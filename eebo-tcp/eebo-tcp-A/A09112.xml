            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And to performe this with more probability of iust occasion he made himself (without commission) a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral VVatch-man ouer all the land, and wrote a most bitter and bloudy pamphlet against thesaid Catholiks,

            <p>But as men are not alwayes constant in the best; so Sir <hi>F.</hi> making a new consultation with his presbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery at <hi>Cadbury,</hi> took another resolution to reply againe vnder the name of <hi>An Apologie,</hi>

dayes, and among other this portrayture of one in a beares skyn, bayted with dogs, and for that I had not heard, nor read of any such matter publikely done in England I beganne to maruaile how it came to be paynted there, yet considering on the other syde (as euery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different man should) that they being graue and learned men that were in Rome at that tyme, and gaue the instructions to the paynter in that matter, and that it was nor likly, they would be so wicked, or foolish, or so litle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect their owne credits, as to inuent, or fayne any such matter of them-selues, &amp; set it soorth so publikely to be seene, and red of all the world, I beganne to ymagin, that eyther them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues knew it to be true, which I knew not, or els might perhaps by letters be informed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of out of England, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some frends who might affirme it of their owne knowledge, to haue byn done in some priuate manner, &amp; for that the said persons in Rome were now dead, I beganne to informe, my selfe of others, and presently I fel vpon a very sufficient ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tleman of Lincolne shyre, who tould me that in the parish of Lowth it is most certayne that in K.

For the Warder meaning to haue the truthe tried indeed substantially and reallie whither igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce were holden by Catholykes to be needful to deuotion, he took a sownd way &amp; went roundly to the matter, setting downe the true definition of deuotion out of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholyke Doctors, &amp; namely out of S. Thomas in name of all the rest: which definition being the true touchstone of the nature of each thing, seing it excludeth ignorance expresly,

and requireth knowlege, doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince Sir F. his fiction of forgery, and deliuereth all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholykes from that fond imputation.</p>
               <p>Moreouer the Warder againe shewed at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> large out of the said Author (S.

<q>Thus yow see (S<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. F.) that we hold not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for the mother nor daughter nor kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, of deuotion but rather to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary we hold that deuotion is fownded and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of knowlege, wherof Catholyks haue byn euer and in all ages more studious and greater enemies to ignorance then Protestants can with any reason presume to haue byn, for the litle tyme they haue byn in the world.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And by this meanes the said Warder taketh an occasion to make a third discourse,<note place="margin">Principal points of the VVarders discourse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched by the knight &amp; Minister.</note> and to shew by many profes and examples that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholyks haue byn euer more greater furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of all kynd of learning, scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege belonging to piety, then Protestants, and namely of that wherof euery Sectarie of our tyme dothe brag, to wit, of holy scriptures, which is euident, by conseruing the same vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt so many ages, wherby Sectaries of our tyme are come to haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they should not, and they are forced to

               <p>The second is that this matter of miracles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is an ordinary common place, wherin the scurrility of incredulous and scoffing heretiks doth enlarge it self very much and often, it being a subiect sit for that purpose; seing that miracles being aboue the common course of natural things must needs haue some dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion or improbability in the sense of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary vnderstanding, that measureth all by that they see with their eyes; and then being set forth also with mocks and moes in the most ridiculous sort that malice can deuise, and the

               </gap> make a certaine breef Catalogue of the most ordinary and knowne shifts, that do euery where occurre, and by them yow may ghesse of the rest, and of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants whole manner of wryting and answering our books.</p>
            <p>The first is to passe ouer and dissemble with silence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the principal and most substantial points of their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saryes wrytings and to answere more largely other points that are of farre lesse difficulty, wherof the reader shal find many complaints made by vs, throughout this whole work.</p>
            <p>The second shift is, when the whole matter cannot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> be dissembled nor put of by silence, then to giue as it were a nod vnto it, answering it only in general by a word or two, and then to passe on as though all were sufficiently answered, wherof yow shal find store of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples noted by vs in this our answere.</p>
            <p>A third shift is, when they are charged with any fault <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> committed, not so much to defend themselues, as to
<pb facs="tcp:14595:279"/>
accuse others of the like fault on out side, as though this did cleer them, as for example when Sir F. in the first Encounter is argued for absurd flattering her Maiestie and the State, he telleth vs againe, for his excuse, that Canonists in Rome, do much more flatter the Pope. And againe in the second Encounter, when he is accused to auouch many lyes, he obiecteth to vs againe, that Friars were braue liars in king Richard the 2. his dayes, and other such like.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> A fourth shift, is running behynd the cloth of State, to wit when out aduersaries hauing the tyme and state fauorable vnto them, do vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery litle occasion, couer themselues with that buckler. As for example when they haue be haued themselues in temperatly against vs in words, and do eyther feare or feel a round reply, they step presently behynd the cloth of state putting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> both her Maiestie &amp; the common welth betwene them and vs; as though we might not answere them, but by impugning the other.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The fifth shift is to repeat their aduersaryes words stil with some vntruthe or aduantage, altering thesame for their purpose and yet setting them downe in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent letter, as though they were their owne words, of which fraud I am forced to complaine often though more of the minister then of the knight in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The sixt shift is, that when they name authors, and alleage their testimonies against vs, and yet would be lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h to haue them examined, their custome is neuer lightly to quote book, work or chapter, but only the author in general, leauing to vs to seek out, where it is to be found, why, how, or in what sense it was spoken, yf it were spoken at all:</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> The seauenth shift is to alleadge authors contrary to their owne meaning, and to their whole discourse and purpose, which could not be vnknowen to them, that alleaged them; And this is very malitious dealing and oftentymes vsed as after yow shal see proued.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14595:279"/>The 8. shift, or deceit, or rather imposture is, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> only to alleage authors against their owne inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but wittingly also to corrupt their very woords, &amp; text, leauing out somthings and adding, and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring others, as by examination yow shal find.</p>
            <p>The nynth shift is a kynd of bold impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> denying things notoriously knowne to all men. As for example to deny (as Sir F. and O. E. do) that there is any substantial point of difference in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, betwene Lutherans, Suinglians &amp; Caluinists: or that the Protestants of our tyme haue byn trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome or rebellious against their lawful Catholike princes, or that there is any diuision at all, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction betweene Puritans and protestants in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. And the like.</p>
            <p>The tenth shift is impertinent and ridiculous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> answering matters wholy from the purpose, as for example the question being whether England be blessed at this day by change of Catholike religion? Sir F. answereth that she was once blessed, though she be not now. And many other such examples yow shal find.</p>
            <p>The eleue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th shift is, to alleage rather matter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> against themselues and their fellowes, when they are sore pressed, then to seeme to say nothing: As when O.E. alleageth the constitution of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop Arundel in England, about reading scriptures in a vulgar tongue quite contrary to himself. And againe thesame man hauing seene and read, that Sir F. in the 6. Encounter affirmeth S. Augustine to haue said, <hi>that it neuer pleased any good man in the Churche, that heretiks should be put to death,</hi> yet he alleageth S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, as praysing the punishing of heretiks by the Imperial lawes; and such other like.</p>
            <p>The tweluth and last shift (for I wil go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> is plaine cosenage, falsifying and lying, and
<pb facs="tcp:14595:280"/>
this vpon euery occasion: wherof there are so many offered, and the kynds and formes are so diuers, as it were ouerlong to alleadge particular examples for euery one, yet by those few that do ensue, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may make a ghesse of the rest, especially yf they should be taken out of all the eight Encounters, as those that follow are out of two only.</p>
