            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O many are the Miſeries of a Land embroiled in Civill Warre, and ſo enterwoven one with another, that like fine ſhaddows in a piece of rich Tapiſtry, they deceive our ſight, and paſſe our imagination, as by wofull experience <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, France,</hi> and other Neighbour Countries hath been tryed and proved. And to begin with <hi>Germany,</hi> who can be ignorant how much that Empire hath ſuffered formerly in Civill Diſſention among themſelves in matter of Religion, and ſince, yea at this preſent in the warres between the <hi>Sweeds</hi> and themſelves, that goodly and moſt fertile Countrey waſted with famine, fire, and ſword, now lying like a Wilderneſſe, in many places deſolate and uninhabited, ſo that not onely men, women, and children have dyed for very hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but alſo wild beaſts in Woods and Forreſts for want of food have periſhed. Let me give you one onely example, which a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of the right Honourable the Earle of <hi>Arundell</hi> related unto mee (preſently after my Lords returne from his Embaſſage in <hi>Germany</hi>) at <hi>Alburie</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> which is this, A poore man bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot and bare-legd followed my Lords Coach to beg bread or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuſtenance of him, while an hunger-ſtarved Fox followed this poore ſoule cloſe, to get a piece of the calf of his leg to ſatisfie his hunger, which my Lord ſeeing he relieved the man, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Fox to be taken up (for ſo weake he was growne with hunger) and to have ſomething given him, but he dyed preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, notwithſtanding his belly was filled.</p>
            <p>Many men and women in woods, fields, and high wayes were found dead, with graſſe in their mouths; ſo that what the ſword
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65729:2"/>
could not devoure, famine did. Now though ambition in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and private ends in particular, as Title and ſuppoſed right in Princes, ſometimes malice and revenge, yet generally all is clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked under the cauſe or reformation of Religion, as we may read in <hi>Sleidan</hi> of thoſe bloudy warres in <hi>Germany</hi> made by the Boores and the frantick Anabaptiſts, and their fellows in <hi>Munſter. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, George, Knipperdoling,</hi> againſt the Princes there, and their Lords; But of all other let us caſt an eye upon our Neighbour <hi>France,</hi> and take a view of that flouriſhing Kingdome, ſee how it hath been rent and torne in pieces (as the Willow-tree complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Fable of her bowes and branches, which were lopt off to make wedges to rend her bodie) by her owne childien, and the fruit may ſay of her bodie, what bloudy Battailes have been fought between the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> the King and the <hi>Guiſians.</hi> But I will relate in briefe ſome particulars, as I finde them recorded in their own Hiſtories, and by their own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, beginning from the yeare 1572, when that great and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Maſſacre was committed upon the poore <hi>Proteſtants</hi> by the King himſelfe, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and the then Queen-Mother, of whom was then made that true and wittie <hi>Anagram;</hi>

            <p>And whom <hi>Th. Beza</hi> in a witty Epigram in Latine in all reſpects compares with <hi>Jezabell,</hi> ſaving that whereas the dogges eate-up and devoured <hi>Jezabell,</hi> he thought verily ſhee was ſo bad that no dog would touch her; <hi>Vel canes ipſi reſpuant Catharinam,</hi> be his words, but to our purpoſe, but take a view of ſome of her ſonnes and the <hi>Guiſe</hi> his prankes, for they were all of a knot.</p>
            <p>A marriage was pretended between the young K: of <hi>Navarre</hi> and the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> the Kings Siſter, which was performed by the Cardinall of <hi>Burbon</hi> 1572. upon the 18. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in our Lady Church in <hi>Paris,</hi> in the preſence of the King, the Queen-Mother, the Dukes of <hi>Anjou</hi> and <hi>Alenſon,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and all the principall <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> at what time was nothing ſeen but banquetting, tilting, feaſting, nothing heard but muſick So friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſalutations, all old rancor and malice between <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and <hi>Papiſt</hi> ſeeming utterly to be forgotten and buried; and to this end the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were ſolemnly invited by Letters and moſt loving Meſſages from all places, by the King and his Mother, a generall peace being before proclaimed. The Admirall was ſent for from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65729:3"/>
               <hi>Rochell,</hi> where he was (diſſemblingly) entertained by the K: in a moſt loving and friendly manner, who called him Father at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word; when the Admirall kneeled, the King tooke him up, proteſting and deeply ſwearing, he was the welcomeſt man in the world, and no day could happen ſo joyfull as that, wherein he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed his company, &amp;c. The Citizens from all places flocked, from all parts to behold him (for his wiſdome, valour, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, he was of all wonderfully beloved and honoured) his Son <hi>Teligni</hi> was much honoured &amp; preſented with great gifts, to the joy of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and the (ſeeming) griefe of the <hi>Catholikes.</hi> But this faire day was quickly over-clouded, with the helliſh and black Clouds of Murder and Miſchiefe, for as the Admirall was going from the Court to his Lodging, he was ſhot &amp; ſore woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with three Bullets, as he went ſoftly in the ſtreet, (from a houſe where <hi>Villemus</hi> ſtood, Maſter to the Duke of <hi>Guiſes</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren lodged) reading of a Supplication.</p>
            <p>The King, being at Tennis, threw downe his Racket, ſeeming to be extreamly grieved, and taking with him his Mother and two Brethren, went to viſit him, looked upon his wounds, (for his forefinger was ſhot off, &amp; with another Bullet he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his left arme) and told him, though he had the hurt and felt the paine, the diſhonour was his, becauſe he upon his faith and promiſe, had ſent for him, vowing to ſecure him from all danger, &amp; whoſoever had done it or conſented thereunto, ſhould be ſeverely puniſhed; The Admirall anſwered, he knew the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors well enough, but left the revenge unto God, and becauſe he knew not how long he had to live, he deſired to ſpeake with the King in private of matters of great importance, the King ſeemed to liſten a while, but the Queen-Mother cunningly brake off their diſcourſe, and upon Saturday which was the 23. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Kings Councell ſat to examine the fact, ſeeming to take great pains to boult out the truth, but all in diſſimulation, for the King ſeeing he had the Admirall and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in a trap, in the dead of the night at the ſound of a Bell from the <hi>Louure,</hi> Harguebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers were ſent out and commanded to kill all that came in their way, <hi>Coſſy</hi> being their Captaine, and breaking into the Admirals chamber, one <hi>Beſme</hi> a ruffian finding him at his prayers upon his knees, asked him, if he were the Admirall, he anſwered ſo I am called, with that he ran him through, another ſhot him into the breſt with a Piſtoll, and the reſt ſtabbed him with their daggers,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65729:3"/>
and after threw his body out at a window into the ſtreet, this was the Religion and fidelitie of the Queen Mother and her ſon to the Proteſtants. An <hi>Italian</hi> cut off the Admirals head, and ſent it for a preſent to the Pope; others cut off his hands and privie members, trailing his bodie up and down the ſtreet, hanging it up after at <hi>Mountfaulcon</hi> their <hi>Tyburne.</hi> This Noble Gentleman was, for his wiſedom, policie, courage and conſtancie in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Gods truth one of the moſt excellent and famous men that ever were bred or brought up in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now with this noble Admirall were murthered in moſt cruel manner of Proteſtant Nobilitie, the Count <hi>Rochfaucout,</hi> a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete wittie and learned Gentleman, dearly beloved for his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and conceited humour of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 2. <hi>Teligny de Montrevill</hi> the Amirals ſon in law, whoſe widow named <hi>Lois,</hi> afterward <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſau</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and father to <hi>Henry</hi> now Prince of Orange married, and by which Lady he had him. Beſides the Baron of <hi>Pardaillon;</hi> of <hi>Pilles; Soubiza;</hi> and <hi>Puviant</hi> all brave men, and all Commanders: But to ſee the butcherie they made in the ſtreets of men, women and young children, would have made an heart of marble to have melted, all the ſtreets being paved with carkaſſes, nothing but weeping and wailing, and a wofull out-crie through the whole Citie: There being ſlain above 10000. perſons, as well Noblemen as Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Preſidents of Courts, Counſellors, Scholers, Praetors, Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Phyſitians, Merchents, Handicrafts men, women, maids, and children, the King and Queen with their brethren went in the evening to behold the dead bodies, amongſt others, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Queen mother would behold the bodie of <hi>Soubiza</hi> ſtark na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, becauſe ſhe had heard (ſhe ſaid) that he was not able to get a child; this moſt cruell and bloodie maffacre, plotted by her the Duke of Guiſe and her ſonne then <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, was act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon <hi>Bartholomew</hi> day being the 24 of Auguſt, <hi>Anno</hi> 1572. and it is worthy of obſervation, that this King ſo led by his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not paſt 29. years of age when he died, and dying, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of blood iſſued from all the open parts of his body, no queſtion but by the juſt judgement of God, for the blood which he formerly had in ſuch abundance ſhed.</p>
            <p>From Paris let us go to <hi>Sancerre,</hi> and after the Sword ſhew the horror and miſerie of Famine.</p>
            <p>Sancerre after it was beſieged by the Marſhall <hi>Danville,</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant

for the King in <hi>Languedoc La Chaſtre,</hi> and the Catholikes was brought in the beginning of the fourth Civill warre to that extreme neceſſitie, that after they had eaten up all their Horſes, Aſſes, Dogs, Cats, and the like, they were conſtrained to make meat of their skins, roſting, ſeething and broyling them upon gridirons like tripes, mice and rats were great dainties, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie was he that could get them; And yet more preſſed with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they made meat of their old ſhooes, horns, horſes, and bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks hoofs which had many yeers lien in the dunghill, and little children would broil and roſt their leather girdles to fill their hungrie bellies; roots, herbs, graſſe and bark of trees were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for dainties. The father and the mother eat their own child which was ſtarved to death, and for ſo horrible a fact were both burned.</p>
            <p>The famine in <hi>Rochel</hi> was alſo very ſore, but God did mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly help them in their extremity, being even ready for want of food to yeeld up their Town to the enemie, for he ſent into their Haven (never ſeen among them before) exceeding multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Muſcles, Cockles and ſmall fiſhes, whereby they plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſtored themſelves in deſpite of the Romiſh Catholiques their enemies, for hereby the women, maids and children took courage and expoſed themſelves to all hazards, animating ſuch as ſought by cheerfull words and hardie examples, and one among the reſt adventuring in the hotteſt of the skirmiſh, and ſeeing one of the Catholiques ſlain, ran and took away his ſword and harguebuz, which ſhe carried in triumph into the Town, ſaying, ſhe had furniſhed her ſelf with the ſpoils of her enemies. But we will leave <hi>France,</hi> and come home to the modern miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Ireland,</hi> occaſioned by their Rebellion.</p>
            <p>The Rebellion began in <hi>Ireland</hi> upon the 23. of October laſt paſt, when the Romiſh prieſts (with whom the countrey aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth) ſwore all the people to baniſh and drive all the Proteſtants out of the Land, if they reſiſted to kill them though they were their next neighbours and friends. In the North of <hi>Ireland</hi> they killed man, woman and child, they aroſe at once in nine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> and at <hi>Longhall</hi> they cut a bridge in two, and then took an hundred Proteſtants Engliſh and Scots, with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children, and bound them two and two back to back, and then threw them into the Rivers. Within two miles of <hi>Dungannon,</hi> which is the ſeat or dwelling of Sir <hi>Philemio</hi> (or <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>)

               <hi>Oneale,</hi> there dwelt a Scottiſh Miniſter whoſe name was <hi>Maders,</hi> into whoſe houſe they brake in the night, and finding him within with his wife and children, they cut off his head and threw it into his wives lap, telling her there was a New-yeers gift for her. A Scot walking upon the high way in the ſame Countie with his wife and ſix children, they murthered the man and all his children, and his wife falling upon her knees, and with tears and prayers entreating they would ſpare her that ſhe might bury them: they ſtabbed her to the heart with their skeines (which are thick and long ſharp pointed daggers, with dudgeon hefts much like unto Cooks knives) and threw her up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of the reſt.</p>
            <p>In the Town of <hi>Machera</hi> in the Countie of <hi>London-Derrie,</hi> they killed a Pariſh Clerk and his five children, after they cut off his wives eares, whereupon ſhe ran mad.</p>
            <p>If they met with any Engliſh, men or women travelling on the wayes, or in the woods, they would make holes under their chinnes, and hang them up on boughs of trees cut off and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>Young children and infants, they will teare quarter from quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as hounds would do a wild-cat, or the like vermine. They cut of Mr. <hi>Rowlcie</hi> a Juſtice of Peace his head in the Countie of <hi>London-Derrie,</hi> then turning up the back of the body, they ſtuck upon a ſtick the head in his fundament, and after ſet it upon a ſtake.</p>
            <p>With their Darts, and before named Skeines half a yard long, they ſtab and rip up the bellies of women with child, and then will not ſuffer them to be buried, but leave them for the woolves and fowls of the aire to devoure.</p>
            <p>Some come from them that have the faireſt quarter and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie ſhewed them, with their hands, ſome with their eares, cut off, cleft down the ſhoulder, or with one of their eyes put out: ſilly women and young children, they will put into ſome old thatcht houſe, and then ſet it on fire, keeping them in till they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to aſhes.</p>
            <p>To relate all the cruell murthers and villanies of theſe baſe villaines, would aſtoniſh and terrifie the hardeſt and moſt inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane heart (I am perſwaded) of the verieſt Turk or Jew in the world, neither can any beaſtly villanie be thought whatſoever, but it is committed among them, and theſe forſooth muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted

the beſt of your Romane Catholikes, but I leave their puniſhment to God, and the valour of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> now ſerving amongſt them; neither hath any Countrey in the world been more plentifull in Treaſons then this, though we our ſelves have had Traitors enough, whom God hath evermore cut off almoſt in the very execution of their Treaſons, I cannot ſtand to particularize the men, nor the manners of their ſeverall plots. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had plotted againſt her 35. ſeverall Treaſons, yet God delivered her out of all. Let me conclude with the juſt reward of a Traitor who betrayed the Iſle of <hi>Rhodes</hi> to <hi>Soliman,</hi> being ſo long and ſo bravely defended by <hi>Liſleadam</hi> &amp; the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; this Traitor being a gentleman and a Commander in that ſervice, ſent privily word to the Turk, if he would advance him, he would help him to the poſſeſſion of the whole Iſland and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. <hi>Soliman</hi> promiſed him he would, nay more, he would give him his daughter in marriage with three millions of Barbarie Duckets for a portion: by his means the whole Iſle, Town and Caſtle were taken. He then being brought before <hi>Soliman,</hi> was graciouſly entertained, <hi>Soliman</hi> ſent for his daughter moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly dreſt with gold and jewels of ineſtimable value; Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, quoth <hi>Soliman,</hi> I have choſen this gentleman for your huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, therefore I charge you to love him, embrace him with all dutifull reſpect. And ſon, quoth <hi>Soliman,</hi> becauſe you ſhall ſee that I am every way as good as my word, in thoſe cheſts (which ſtood by) there is the gold I promiſed you, and ſome foure dayes hence your marriage ſhall be ſolemnized; no Baſhaw was in more honor then was this Traitor throughout the Turks whole Armie. Upon the third day <hi>Soliman</hi> cals for his ſon in law, and tels him that he was a Chriſtian, and his daughter a <hi>Muſulman,</hi> or right beleever, and he feared they would not agree; therefore, ſon quoth he, you muſt be ſtript of your baptized and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed skin, and laid all night upon a bed of ſalt, and if by the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you can find in your heart to turn to her Religion, ſhe ſhall come to bed to you, otherwiſe you muſt lie as quietly as you can by your ſelf. But he being fleied, &amp; laid tumbling without a skin upon the bed of ſalt, which was a moſt cruell torment, died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an houre after: If all Traitors to their Princes and Countreys were ſerved with the like ſawce (eſpecially thoſe in <hi>Ireland</hi>) the world would be at a far better paſſe then it is; which God in his appointed time will accompliſh. And ſo I end this diſcourſe.</p>
