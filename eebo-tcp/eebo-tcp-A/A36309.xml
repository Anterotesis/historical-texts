            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Name of God, Amen.</hi> I <hi>John Donne,</hi> by the Mercy of Christ Jesus, being, at this time, in good and perfect understanding, do hereby make <hi>My last Will and Testament</hi> in manner and form following: First, I give my good and gracious <hi>God</hi> an Intire Sacrifice of <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> with my most humble Thanks, for that his Blessed Spirit imprints in me now an assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Salvation</hi> of one, and the Resurrection of the other; and for that constant and Cheerful Resolution which the same Spirit Established in me, to live and dye in the same <hi>Religion</hi> Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>England</hi> by the known Law. In Expectation of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> I desire that my <hi>Body</hi> may be <hi>buried</hi> in the most private manner that may be in the <hi>Church-yard</hi> of the Parish where I now live, without the <hi>Ceremony</hi> of Calling any Officers. And I desire to be carried to my <hi>Grave</hi> by the ordinary <hi>Bearers</hi> of the Dead, without troubling any of my <hi>Friends,</hi> or letting them know of my Death by any means, but by being put into the <hi>Earth.</hi> And I desire my <hi>Executor</hi> to interpret my meaning in this Request, by my <hi>Word,</hi> and not by his own <hi>Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> who peradventure for fashion sake, and apprehending we shall never meet, may think to <hi>order</hi> things Better for my <hi>Credit.</hi> (God be thanked) I have not lived by <hi>Jugling,</hi> therefore I desire to dye and be buried without any: And not having (as I hope) been burdensome to my Friends in my Life, I would not <hi>load</hi> their shoulders being Dead. I desire and appoint the Right Honourable <hi>Jerome</hi> Earl of <hi>Portland</hi> to be my Executor, hoping that for all his <hi>Cares</hi> of me, and <hi>Kindnesses</hi> to me, he will undertake to see this my Will punctually performed; Especially concerning my <hi>Burial.</hi> To the <hi>Most Excellent, Good, Kind, Vertuous, Honorable Lady Portland,</hi> I give all the Rest that I have in this Will <hi>unbequeathed:</hi> And I do not this foolishly (as may at the first sight appear) because My <hi>Lord</hi> is My <hi>Executor;</hi> but because I know it will please the <hi>Gaiety of her Humour,</hi> which ought to be preserv'd for all their sakes that have the honour and happiness to be known unto her. To the Right Honourable <hi>The Lord Newport,</hi> I bequeath the <hi>Picture of St. Anthony, in a round Frame.</hi> To my very good friend Mr. <hi>John Harvy, the Picture of the Samaritan,</hi> by whose kindness I have been often refreshed. To my good friend Mr. <hi>Chr. Gise,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Moor's Head,</hi> which upon my Conscience I think was not more <hi>Ingenious</hi> then his own. And I write this rather as a <hi>Commemoration</hi> then a <hi>Legacy,</hi> for I have alwaies made a difference between <hi>Kindnesses</hi> and <hi>Courtesies.</hi> To Mr. <hi>George Pitt,</hi> I give the Picture of my <hi>Dutch Fair,</hi> which is full of <hi>Business,</hi> but where there is alwaies room for a <hi>Kindness.</hi> And I brag of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours I received from him, because they came not by <hi>Chance.</hi> To my Cousin <hi>Henry Stafford,</hi> Son to my kind friend Mr. <hi>William Stafford,</hi> I give all my <hi>Printed Books,</hi> which although they are of no great value, yet they may seem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to his youth, and may serve as a <hi>Memorial</hi> to encline him to be as indulgent to poor Scholars as his Father and Grand-father have been before him. And by this means I give not only a <hi>Legacy,</hi> but entayle it upon other men that deserve their kindness. To my honourable Friend Sir <hi>Allen Broderick</hi> I give my <hi>Cedar Table,</hi> to add a <hi>fragour</hi> to his Excellent Writing. To my kind Friend Mr. <hi>Tho. Killigrew,</hi> I give all my <hi>Doves,</hi> that something may descend upon a <hi>Courtier</hi> that is an <hi>Emblem</hi> of Kindness and Truth. To my Servant <hi>Mary Web,</hi> if she be with me at the time of my death, I give all my <hi>Linnen</hi> that belongs to my personal use, and <hi>Forty Shillings</hi> above her Wages, if it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that she hath occasioned my death; which I have often liv'd in fear of, but being alone could never help, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have often complained of my sad Condition to my nearest Relations, 'twas not fit to trouble others. To Mr. <hi>Isaac Walton,</hi> I give all my Writings under my Father's hand, which may be of some use to his Son, if he makes him a Scholar. To the Reverend <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Chicchster,</hi> I return that <hi>Cabinet</hi> that was my Fathers, now in my Dining-Room, and all those Papers which are of <hi>Authors Analysed</hi> by my Father; many of which he hath already received with his <hi>Common-Place-Book,</hi> which I desire may pass to Mr. <hi>Walton</hi>'s Son, as being more likely to have use for such a help, when his age shall require it. These <hi>four</hi> sides of this small <hi>Paper</hi> being written by my own hand, I hope will be a sufficient <hi>Testimony</hi> that this is my last Will. And such <hi>Trivial</hi> things were not fit for a greater <hi>Ceremony</hi> than my own Hand and Seal, for I have lived alwaies without all other <hi>Witnesses</hi> but my own <hi>Conscience,</hi> and I hope I have honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discharged that. I have in a Paper annexed something at this present; and may do some things hereafter, which I presume my most honourable good <hi>Lord of Portland</hi> will see performed.</p>
