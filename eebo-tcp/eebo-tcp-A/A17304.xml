         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost Noble <hi>Senate,</hi> blessed
be God the <hi>Authour,</hi> and
our <hi>Ioshua,</hi> his blessed
<hi>Instrument</hi> of this your
happie assembling. And,
what word <hi>Mordecai</hi> sent
to <hi>Hester</hi> in that deplored
estate of Gods people, let
me be bold to transferre to you, in the like case:
<hi>Who knoweth, whither you are come together for
such a time as this?</hi> The <hi>Mite,</hi> which here I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to offer into the rich <hi>Treasurie</hi> of your
graue wisdomes, is <hi>Israels Fast;</hi> A poore Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
(conceiued formerly, but brought forth in
this Season, I hope, <hi>in a good howre)</hi> which
though it bee out of my penurie, for want of
better meanes of Expression, yet springeth it
from the superabundance of my Zeale, and
heartie well-wishing. And this <hi>Fast</hi> being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and <hi>the Elders of Israel,</hi> vpon
<pb facs="tcp:7346:3"/>
               <hi>Israels</hi> discomfiture: I knew not to whom more
fitly to recommend it, then to You, our Royall
<hi>Ioshua,</hi> and Noble <hi>Elders of Israel,</hi> now assembled
in one intire Body representatiue of this goodly
<hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi> All this <hi>Fast</hi> was about the
trespasse of one <hi>Achan:</hi> But if our <hi>Israel</hi> haue
many <hi>Achans</hi> in it, the more need is there of
<hi>Israels Fast.</hi> Yet not a <hi>Fast</hi> alone. It is but the
<hi>Preparatiue</hi> to the Purgatiue <hi>Potion,</hi> as here; nor
as <hi>Iezebels Fast,</hi> to deuoure <hi>Naboths Vineyard:</hi>
But <hi>Israels Fast,</hi> to preserue <hi>Gods Vineyard,</hi> by
purging out the <hi>Troubler of Israel.</hi> This troubler
was <hi>Achan,</hi> but vnknown to <hi>Ioshua</hi> &amp; the <hi>Elders,</hi>
till found out by Diuine <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t.</hi> And are the <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers</hi>
of our <hi>Israel</hi> so concealed, as wee need
Diuine <hi>Lotts</hi> to discouer them? Yet if so, God
wants not his <hi>Diuines,</hi> those of his <hi>Lott,</hi> such, as
of whom the good King <hi>Iohoshaphat</hi> said to his
people,<note place="margin">2 Cron. 20. 20</note> 
               <hi>Belieue his Prophets, so shall ye prosper.</hi>
I am the least, and vnworthiest of all Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.
And some must speake, least the crying of
the senselesse <hi>Stones</hi> should conuince vs of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull
cowardise. Nor are we to looke after
extraordinarie Commissions, as the <hi>Prophets</hi> of
Old, vnlesse we had extraordinarie Inspirations.
<hi>The Word is neere</hi> vs. Out of this <hi>Word</hi> is my
Message directed to you, O <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and <hi>Elders of
Israel.</hi> And this <hi>Word</hi> it is, which must direct you
at this time in the finding out of the <hi>Troublers of
Israel.</hi> Now <hi>Achan troubled Israel</hi> in two speciall
respects:<note place="margin">Iosh. 7. 12.</note> First, * In diuiding <hi>God</hi> from <hi>Israel:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:7346:3"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">Iosh. 7. 3. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with ch. 8. 1. where the diuision is made vp again in a full March</note> * In diuiding <hi>Israel</hi> from themselues.
Thus all <hi>Diuiders</hi> are <hi>Troublers</hi> of <hi>Israel.</hi> And to
these two Heads may all the <hi>Achans, Troublers of
Israel,</hi> bee reduced. Now forasmuch as they are
many, and a mightie Confederacie: our <hi>Ioshua,</hi>
and the <hi>Elders of Israel</hi> now assembled, and fast
ioyned together, are onely all-together able to
cope with them. Nor shall it be any preiudice to
your graue wisedomes to take a Precedent, for
your easier Processe in this maine Businesse, out
of Gods holy <hi>Word,</hi> and from the King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Israel.</hi> King <hi>Asa,</hi> and his <hi>People</hi> being
about a great Worke of <hi>Reformation,</hi> for their
better God-speed, <hi>They enter into a Couenant to
seeke the Lord God of their Fathers with all their
Heart, and with all their Soule: That whosoeuer
would not seeke the Lord God of Israel, should be
put to death, whither small or great, whither man
or woman: And they sware vnto the Lord with a
loud voyce, and with shouting, and with Trumpets,
and with Cornets: And all Iudah reioyced at the
Oath, for they had sworne with all their heart, and
sought him with their whole desire, and he was
found of them: And the Lord gaue them rest round
about.</hi> This worthy example I onely name to
your apprehensiue wisdomes, praying from the
bottome of my heart, that you would put it in
speedy execution, as the ground-worke of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
good wee may hope or expect by the
meanes of this Noble Meeting. Thus vpon such
A solemne generall <hi>Couenant</hi> sealed by particular
<pb facs="tcp:7346:4"/>
sacred <hi>Oath</hi> of each <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Three Estates</hi>
in <hi>Parliament,</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Nobles,</hi> and the <hi>House
of Commons,</hi> either no diuiding <hi>Achans</hi> will bee
found lurking among you; or if any, they will
the more easily be discouered, and so discarded.
Then in Gods Name goe on, and prosper. Onely
let <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and <hi>Israels Elders</hi> goe inseparably to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
Let not the <hi>Achan</hi>-faction, by their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
whisperings, diuide them, by working dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affections.
For if <hi>Achans</hi> may but come between,
they will put both into extremities. For as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
said to <hi>Ioab</hi> and <hi>Abishai, Ye are too hard for
me, ye Sonnes of Zeruiah:</hi> So the <hi>Achan</hi>-faction
may proue too hard for our <hi>Dauid,</hi> for our <hi>Ioshu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi>
without the ioynt assistance of you the <hi>Elders
of Israel.</hi> Like the <hi>Guisian</hi>-faction in <hi>France,</hi> who
were too hard for King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third. In
such a case then it is necessarie, that the <hi>Elders</hi>
sticke close to <hi>Ioshua,</hi> to free <hi>Israel</hi> out of
<hi>Hucksters</hi> hands. It is <hi>Solomons</hi> aduice, who was
the wisest King,<note place="margin">Pro. 25. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>Take away the euill from the King,
and his Throne shall be established in righteousnesse.</hi>
And the <hi>Wicked</hi> there he compareth to the <hi>Dross,</hi>
which being taken from the <hi>Siluer, there shall
come forth a Vessell for the Finer.</hi> This <hi>Drosse,</hi> these
<hi>Wicked,</hi> are the <hi>Achans,</hi> who so long as they are
before the <hi>King,</hi> it will be hard for his <hi>Throne</hi> to
be <hi>established in righteousnesse.</hi> Now to take them
away (I say) the helpe of you the <hi>Elders</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
required. And doth not the <hi>King</hi> call
you <hi>The great Councell of Vs, and of our Kingdom?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:7346:4"/>
And your <hi>Councell,</hi> was it euer more necessarie,
then now, wherein the <hi>Troublers of Israel</hi> haue
almost gotten the vpper hand?</p>
            <p>Good God, what powerfull Inchanters be
these <hi>Achans,</hi> that presume they can perswade
the World, they are <hi>Ioshuahs</hi> faster friends, when
they would most diuide him from the <hi>Elders of
Israel?</hi> To perswade, they loue the <hi>Head,</hi> when
they seeke to pull it from the <hi>Body?</hi> To perswade
they are for the <hi>King,</hi> when they seeke to strip
him of his <hi>Subiects?</hi> To perswade, they are for
the <hi>Sheepherd,</hi> when against his <hi>Sheepe?</hi> To
perswade, they honour the <hi>Father,</hi> when they
would set him against his louing <hi>Children,</hi> and
loyall <hi>Family?</hi> What a Paradox is <hi>This?</hi>
Wherein did <hi>Hushai</hi> more approue himselfe the
<hi>Kings Friend,</hi> then by his prudent frustraiting of
<hi>Achitophels</hi> traiterous <hi>Counsell,</hi> and so, reconciling
and reuniting the reuolted <hi>Subiects</hi> to their true
<hi>Soueraigne?</hi> What needed posting, and packing
of <hi>Parliament</hi>-Elections, if all they that falsely
pretend as faithfull Seruice to the <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>Hushai</hi>
did laudably to <hi>Absalon,</hi> were as faithfull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
and Friends to the <hi>King,</hi> as <hi>Hushai</hi> was to
<hi>Dauid?</hi> Are any afraid, least the Kings Liege
people should chuse such as are Popishly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
or of factious Spirits? But such will stand
most for the Kings supplyes. They pretend so.
But who doe more hinder or preiudice the <hi>King</hi>
in his necessarie and <hi>Royall Subsidarie Supplyes,</hi>
then such Factours? The Lord Iesus seperate
<pb facs="tcp:7346:5"/>
such factious Factours, and miscreant Merchants
both from the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> that
so this Noble <hi>Assembly</hi> of <hi>Ioshua</hi> and the <hi>Elders,</hi>
may giue and receiue reciprocall and mutuall
<hi>Supplyes</hi> interchangeably: <hi>Ioshua</hi> the <hi>Head,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
from the inferiour <hi>principall Parts</hi> plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
nourishment conueyed by the <hi>Naturall</hi> and
<hi>Vitall Spirits:</hi> And <hi>Israel</hi> the <hi>Body,</hi> receiuing
from <hi>Ioshua</hi> their <hi>Head</hi> a due motion preportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to the capacitie of each Member, conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Animall Spirits,</hi> sweetly gouerning,
preseruing, and protecting, that so the <hi>Whole</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
may <hi>increase with the increase of God.</hi>
There is a Fountaine of an exhausted Golden
<hi>Mine</hi> in the <hi>Bowels</hi> of all True-hearted<hi>English
Israelites,</hi> which, as the Kings fauour, like the
<hi>Sunne-beames,</hi> begets it in them, so vpon all fit
occasions they will be ready in Golden streames
abundantly to supply their Noble <hi>Ioshua.</hi> Hee
needs no <hi>American-Slaues</hi> to digge and force it,
nor the <hi>Romane</hi> mercilesse <hi>Sword</hi> to rip it, as once
out of the Captiue-<hi>Iewes</hi> Bowels: But it will
freely flowe from Loyall <hi>Israel</hi> to their Royall
<hi>Ioshua.</hi> And now, O Noble <hi>Elders of Israel,</hi> I
know the Bees come not more loaden with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to the Hiue, then you at this time with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
affections to minister abundant supply to
your <hi>Ioshuah.</hi> Doe it on Gods Name brauely,
and like your selues. I am a poore Schollar, and
am ready to sell my richest treasure, my Bookes,
rather then <hi>Ioshuah</hi> shall want. And doe it so, as,
<pb facs="tcp:7346:5"/>
by Gods blessing vpon <hi>Ioshua,</hi> &amp; you the <hi>Elders,</hi>
and so vpon vs all by you, many <hi>Parliaments</hi>
may be called, wherein you may testifie (if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
require) the copious and perennious
<hi>Treasure</hi> of your loue and loyaltie in the like

as <hi>Arannah</hi> like a <hi>Prince</hi> gaue to <hi>King Dauid.</hi> For
<hi>Vera liberalitas fundum non habet.</hi> But I meane
(pardon my Zeale, which makes me thus bold
to speake) in the genuine and naturall <hi>Genius</hi> of
your tender loue and care for the safetie and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie
of our Royall <hi>Ioshua,</hi> of the <hi>Crowne,</hi> of
the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and of Vs all. But your
liberall Subsidies are giuen for that end. True.
But alas (pardon still my redenesse; I speake
not as a <hi>States-man,</hi> to aduise such a graue <hi>Senat,</hi>
but as a poore <hi>Minister of Christ,</hi> and <hi>Watchman
of Israel,</hi> to petition rather) What can either <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
or <hi>Men,</hi> or <hi>Munition</hi> doe, so long as <hi>Achans</hi>
trouble <hi>Israel? There is an accursed thing in the

not stand before thine enemies, vntill ye take away
the accursed thing from among you.</hi> Till this hee

                  </gap>ael</hi> must not looke to prosper. We need
no better warrant, then Gods owne Word for it.
It is your <hi>Wisedome</hi> to follow it, least the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi>
preuaile ouer vs. And the vtmost extreami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the state of things calls vpon you to doe it
instantly; It drawes a circle about your <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi>
as that braue <hi>Romane</hi> did with his Staffe about
King <hi>Mithridates,</hi> not to stirre, or steppe ouer it,
<pb facs="tcp:7346:6"/>
till <hi>Ioshuas</hi> and <hi>Israels</hi> danger, <hi>the accursed thing,</hi>
be remoued. It is impatient (I speake no more,
then what you all know farre better then I) to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
the expectation of another <hi>Parliament:</hi> you
see all things are in such a Precipice, and Israel
so dangerously sick, as if you the great Colledge
of Physitians depart without curing of it, all will
haue occasion to deeme the case desperate, and
irrecouerable, already drawing on a pace to a
<hi>Dissolution,</hi> vnlesse the <hi>Great Physitian</hi> doe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully
and miraculously put to his <hi>Omnipotent</hi>
hand. For the Achans, the Troublers of <hi>Israel,</hi>
hasten the ruine of all.</p>
            <p>But who might those <hi>Achans</hi> be? Your wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
cannot be ignorant of them: yet because
they are a mysticall knot of <hi>Iniquity,</hi> and haue
exceedingly insinuated themselues into the good
opinion of many; I humbly craue leaue, that by
the diuine <hi>Lot</hi> of Gods word, I may a little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
them. All <hi>Achans</hi> (as I said) are <hi>Diuiders:</hi>
first, betweene <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Israel:</hi> and secondly (as
a consequence thereof) betweene <hi>Israel</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues;
and that especially, while they mainely
labour to diuide the <hi>Head</hi> from the <hi>Body, Ioshua</hi>
from the <hi>Elders of Israel.</hi> And (saith Christ) <hi>A
Kingdome diuided against it selfe, cannot stand.</hi>
These <hi>Achans,</hi> which trouble our Israel, are of
sundry sorts: as first, <hi>Iasuites</hi> and <hi>Seminary
Priests.</hi> These are the ring leading <hi>Achans:</hi> Of
such the Lord saith in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> that because
they seduce the people from <hi>God,</hi> they shall be
<pb facs="tcp:7346:6"/>
               <hi>put to death.</hi> These, as they diuide <hi>God</hi> from vs
hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>seruants,</hi> so they diuide the <hi>Subiects</hi> from the
<hi>King.</hi> This was wont to be <hi>Treason,</hi> but now a
dayes it would passe for good <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second kinde of <hi>Achans</hi> troubling Israel,
are Idols; <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>f Achans wedge,</hi> and <hi>Babylonish gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
troubled all Israel, as an <hi>accursed thing:</hi>
how much more Popish Idols? shall wee <hi>halt
betweene two opinions?</hi> betweene <hi>God and Baal?
Either goe after the Lord onely, if indeede he be God:
or if Baal be He, goe onely after him,</hi> said <hi>Eliah.</hi>
King <hi>Asa</hi> spared not his owne Mothers <hi>Groue,</hi>
and <hi>Idol;</hi> but brake them downe, yea &amp; for their
cause deposed her from her <hi>Regency.</hi> Oh for the
like zeale for God! But certainly if these <hi>Idols</hi>
and <hi>Masses, Images</hi> and Popish Trumperies be
not speedily abolished, <hi>thou canst not prosper, O
Israel, nor stand before thine Enemies.</hi> Downe
therefore with Popish Idols, O <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and the
<hi>Elders of Israel,</hi> which cease not to cry of our <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
Downe with it, downe with it, euen to the
ground.</hi> Spare not these <hi>Brats</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that
dare perke vp so neere to <hi>Gods Arke,</hi> threatning
to shoulder it out of doores. But you know what
befell the Philistins <hi>Dagon;</hi> and you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
what befell the Romish <hi>Dagon</hi> in the <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friers</hi>
vpon their <hi>fift of Nouember.</hi> So iealous is
our God, Hee cannot brooke a corriuall. But
some, hauing beene <hi>Protestants</hi> formerly, in
which Religion they were baptized, comming
afterwards to be inueigled to Popery, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb facs="tcp:7346:7"/>
making a solemne vow, sealed (as they call
it) with the <hi>Sacrament of the Altar,</hi> neuer to alter
this their new <hi>couenant,</hi> make such a conscience
hereof, as if it stood not with faith and honesty
to breake it. But doe they not know (vnlesse Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
hath altogether blinded their eyes) that
any such couenants or <hi>vowes</hi> ought neither to
be made, nor much lesse to be kept, which haue
any commerce, or relation to <hi>Idolatry?</hi> Doth
not our <hi>Precontract</hi> to <hi>Christ</hi> in our <hi>Baptisme,</hi> to
<hi>forsake the Diuell and all his workes,</hi> frustrate and
make void all second contracts with <hi>Antichrist,</hi>
for the setting vp of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> one maine <hi>worke</hi> of
the <hi>Diuell?</hi> Nothing therefore ought to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
our Christian Resolution and zeale, in the
casheering of these <hi>Troublers of Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A third sort of <hi>Achans</hi> are <hi>Neutralizers;</hi> but
so, as the Bias of their affections, wheeles and
swayes them round to <hi>Popery.</hi> These are so much
the more pernicious plagues to Israel, in that
vnder the seemely vale and masionlike habit of
<hi>the Church of England,</hi> they labour to bring in
that old <hi>Babylonish strumpet</hi> hoodwinkt, that we
should all reacknowledge her for our Mother.
As may appeare in a certaine Booke of <hi>Priuate
Deuotions</hi> (so called) published by <hi>Authority:</hi> the
maine scope thereof all along, being to reduce
vs all to one Church, and that none other, but
(forsooth) the holy Catholike Church of Rome.
But the whole <hi>Mysterie of iniquitie</hi> folded vp
therein, would require a more particular vnfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
<pb facs="tcp:7346:7"/>
These <hi>Neutralizers,</hi> or <hi>Popish Arminians,</hi>
or <hi>Arminian Papists,</hi> or what ye will, vnder the
name of the Church of <hi>England</hi> dare vent any
<hi>Arminian haeresie.</hi> As in a Booke lately printed
by <hi>Authority</hi> too, there is this most blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Arminian heresie, that <hi>there is a goodnesse
obiectiue in the Creature, which in order of Nature
is precedent to the Act or exercise of Gods will;</hi>
thus, by necessary consequence making the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
a <hi>God,</hi> hauing a <hi>selfe-being</hi> independent, but
onely vpon Gods bare <hi>Prescience,</hi> vpon which,
and not vpon that <hi>suprema causa causarum,</hi> Gods
will, he hangeth the being, and well being of all
the Creatures. And this sort and confederacy
of <hi>Achans</hi> haue gotten such a high hand, that no
Booke may be set out, if it be directly against
Popery and Arminianisme; nor against Popery
in speciall, but with some qualification, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient,
such as this: <hi>That the Church of Rome,
though she haue many errours, yet is a true Church.</hi>
And by this deuice they doe, like <hi>Balaam,</hi> migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
preuaile, and that with great ones, Scholars
and others, to draw vs to some friendly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
and correspondence with that <hi>Whoore.</hi>
And they are growne so much the more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
becaue they haue <hi>Authority</hi> in their hand,
either to approue, or prohibit, what Books they
list. Whereas, if the way were open, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
freely to print Bookes by <hi>Authority</hi> against
<hi>Popery</hi> and her confederate <hi>Arminians,</hi> their
<hi>Neutralizing Achans,</hi> as so many Owles, would
<pb facs="tcp:7346:8"/>
fly into their darke <hi>Cels,</hi> as not able to behold
the sunbeames of the <hi>Truth.</hi> But we hope and
pray, that <hi>Ioshua</hi> and <hi>the Elders of Israel</hi> will take
such order, that instead of <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Arminian
Bookes, Orthodox</hi> bookes may be freely publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Authority.</hi> And suffer mee to speake, O
noble Sages of Israel (I am for God, &amp; my King,
for Religion, and my Country) if you O <hi>Ioshua,</hi>
and the <hi>Elders of Israel</hi> purge not out these pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Acans, or close clip their wings, they must
needs bring vtter confusion vpon this state, ere
it be long. They daily creepe into high fauour
in Court; they preuaile mightily by their plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
insinuating, intoxicating flattery. They goe
about (as the Prophet <hi>Osee</hi> speakes) <hi>to make the
King glad with their lyes.</hi> Their Theames and
Theorems are, that Kings are <hi>partakers of Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
owne Omnipotency;</hi> though this be a diuine <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute,</hi>
incommunicable to any Creature: That,
<hi>iustice can be no Rule or Medium, whereby to giue
God, or the King his right.</hi> As if right were not
grounded vpon iustice, as the Rule of it. Take
away <hi>Iustice,</hi> and where is <hi>Right?</hi> Or as if the
seruice, which we performe to God, were not
bounded vpon Gods Lawes, which are holy,
<hi>Iust,</hi> and good. Yea, God neither commands,
nor accepts any other seruice at our hands, but
such as his <hi>Law</hi> prescribes. And thus our seruice
becomes <hi>iust</hi> and <hi>reasonable.</hi> Yet with such like
glosings they thinke, that <hi>Principibus placuisse
viris non vltima taus est.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>Nor doe they blush not onely to preach these
things to the face of the Court, but dare also
publish in Print this their shame to the open

both to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King.</hi>

            <p>Now the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> deliuer our good and

Herein the ioynt courage and zeale

            <p>Many other branches of the Achan-faction

            <p>In the name of God therefore, O ye noble wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies

with the Elders of Israel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Ioshua rent his cloathes, &amp;c.</hi> From this verse, to
the end of the Chapter, are contained these generals: 1 <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuahs</hi>
Act, with the <hi>Elders of Israel,</hi> to the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verse. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
Gods charge and direction to <hi>Ioshua,</hi> from that to
the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verse. Thirdly, <hi>Ioshuahs</hi> execution of it, from thence
to the last verse. Fourthly, the successe thereof, laide downe
first in the Radicall, <hi>So the Lord turned from the fiercenesse of
his anger,</hi> v. 26. Then in a particular braunch and fruit, <hi>Israels
victory,</hi> Chap. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:7346:11"/>
First for <hi>Ioshuahs</hi> Act: It is a very sad humiliation, and
may well stand for a just platforme of a solemne and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fast, in all the parts and appertinencies of it, as wee shall
see anone. But before we enter into this <hi>house of mourning,</hi>
the very first word in our Text, as the Porch, inviteth vs
to pause, pointing vs backe, to looke vpon the occasion of
this great and grievous humiliation. <hi>And Ioshua, &amp;c.</hi> Or as
some translations, <hi>Then Ioshua,</hi> &amp;c. Or as the vulgar Latine,
<hi>But Ioshua,</hi> &amp;c. All comes to one reckoning. It is a word of
coherence, with what went immediatly before, namely <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi>
discomfiture, the occasion of <hi>Ioshuahs</hi> discomfort.</p>
            <p>But what might the discomfiture bee, to moue so great a
mourning? Surely three thousand Israelites had brauely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
to assault and surprise the City <hi>Ai:</hi> but they were
shamefully repulsed with the losse of six and thirty men. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las!
Is this so great a matter to moue the most couragious
Generall <hi>Ioshua</hi> to rent his cloathes? Yea, and those sage El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Israel with him? Farre be it. Such gesture may seeme
fitter for ignoble and imbellious spirits, then for the braue
<hi>Ioshuah,</hi> and the graue Rulers of Israel. It might seeme to
haue beseemed <hi>Ioshua</hi> rather to haue buckled on his Armor,
then to haue rent his cloathes; to march into the field, then
to lye on his face; to fall vpon the enemy, then vpon the
earth; to bee powdering the enemies pate with his steele,
then his owne noble head with dust. What was the losse of
36 men? A flea-biting in comparison. And the losse might be
imputed either to the disproportion of the number, three
thousand to a whole city, or to the disadvantage of ground,
for they of <hi>Ai</hi> smote <hi>Israel</hi> in the going downe of the Sun:
or to the pride of those three thousand, puffed vp for their
parts, with their late conquest of <hi>Iericho,</hi> perhaps presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
that, as of <hi>Iericho,</hi> so the walls of <hi>Ai</hi> would presently
fall downe, and giue them possession; or to the strait and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of the enemy, now put to the last pinch, which
might redouble their courage and strength, to fight it out
desperately, sith in fight rather then in flight was safely; or
if in neither, best to dye brauely in the bed of honour, it is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7346:11"/>
their last fight. Now the likelyest way to cure all this, was
for <hi>Ioshua</hi> to giue a fresh assault, to double his files and his
forces to regaine <hi>Israels</hi> losse. Yea, for <hi>Ioshua</hi> thus to deject
himselfe vpon so slight an occasion, might seeme to argue
him of an abiect and degenerous spirit, not beseeming the
Captaine of Gods people; it might also provoke the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anite</hi>
the more insolently to triumph, if in those dayes there
had beene but a Iesuite lurking among <hi>Israels</hi> tents, to send
secret intelligence to the enemy.</p>
            <p>But the noble <hi>Ioshua</hi> saw more in this small discomfiture
then so. For first, though but 36 of the Israelites were slaine,
yet to <hi>Ioshua,</hi> the life of one <hi>Israelite</hi> was more precious, then
ten thousand of the vncircumcised. Yea, haue not heathen
Captaines showed the like affection to their Citizens? It
was <hi>Pericles</hi> glory on his death-bed, that he neuer caused a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his Citizens to weare mourning attire. And the great
<hi>Scipio,</hi> when he was told by one, that he might winne such a
city, if he would expose but 300 of his men to losse: answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
he had rather preserue one Citizen, then kill a thousand
Enemies. Why not <hi>Ioshua</hi> much more? If a <hi>Grecian</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>
Citizen were so deare to their Emperours, how much
more an Israelite to <hi>Ioshua?</hi> But if <hi>Ioshua</hi> &amp; the Elders were
so affected for the losse of so few Israelites, what would they
haue beene, if many thousands of Gods people, had beene
spoyled by the Enemy? How neerely would it haue tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
them, if the whole inheritance of their brethren, the
two Tribes and a halfe beyond <hi>Iordan,</hi> had beene taken away
by the Heathen? We see here what kinde of sport, pleasure,
pastime, <hi>Ioshua</hi> and <hi>Israels</hi> Elders vsed, in so smal a discomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Gods people. They seeke not now with some madde
mirth, as the hearing of a play, or seeing of a Maske, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure
downe the spirit of a little sad Melancholy: but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
are Actors in a most tragick Scene.</p>
            <p>Secondly, not onely 36 had lost their liues, but vpon this,
all the Tribes and Troopes of <hi>Israel</hi> had lost their hearts. For
thereupon the hearts of the people melted, and became as
water. They who but a little before were as Lyons, are now
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7346:12"/>
become like a sort of sheep. A feareful condition, and a signe
of divine desertion; for as <hi>Moses</hi> said, <hi>How should one chase
a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock
had sould them, and the Lord had shut them vp?</hi> Euen as sheep
in a penne, easie to be taken. What if the Enemy had taken
courage, &amp; vsed this oportunity, in <hi>Israels</hi> consternatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? High
time then for <hi>Ioshuahs</hi> Prostration to interpose it self. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and teares were now (as alwayes) <hi>Israels</hi> best weapons.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this repulse was greatly to <hi>Israels</hi> reproach; no
small touch to <hi>Ioshuahs</hi> good heart. <hi>O Lord</hi> (saith he) <hi>what
shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies?</hi>
Now might the heathen begin to bee of another minde, that
<hi>Israel</hi> was not invincible: and therefore might confederate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Israel,</hi> &amp; resolue, as once the <hi>Philistims,</hi> vpon a former
defeat giuen to <hi>Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Be strong, and quit your selues like men,
O ye Philistims.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, that which aboue all moued <hi>Ioshua</hi> &amp; the Elders
thus to humble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, was the glory of <hi>Israels</hi> God, now
suffering by <hi>Israels</hi> repulse. For now the heathen might say,
<hi>Where is now their God?</hi> Now the <hi>Israelites</hi> themselues might
begin to doubt of the truth of Gods promises, wherein, vpon
this occasion, such an interruption &amp; breach was made. This
was that which troubled <hi>Ioshua,</hi> that he said, <hi>And what wilt
thou doe vnto thy great Name?</hi> v. 9. These were the motiues
of <hi>Ioshuahs</hi> mourning.</p>
            <p>But what might be the cause of this discomfiture, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation
of <hi>Israel?</hi> v. 1. It was <hi>Israels</hi> sin. <hi>The children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
committed a trespasse in the accursed thing: for Achan, &amp;c.
tooke of the accursed thing, and the anger of the Lord was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
against the children of Israel.</hi> This may seeme no lesse
strange to cause <hi>Israels</hi> discomfiture; then it slight, to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<hi>Ioshua</hi> to fall on the earth. But <hi>Israel</hi> had transgressed.
Why <hi>Israel?</hi> Was it not <hi>Achan</hi> alone? Againe, what was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chans</hi>
sin? Any more then the taking of a Babylonish garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
200 shekels of siluer, &amp; a wedge of gold of 50 shekels? And
was it not of the spoyle of <hi>Iericho?</hi> And was not <hi>Achan</hi> a
Prince in <hi>Israel,</hi> of the regal Tribe? Might not his perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
so much of the spoyle, at least for his share? Might not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7346:12"/>
so great a personage desire to reserue such a Babylonish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
for a monument? How so great a sin then? If some part
at least, of those 3000 sent against <hi>Ai</hi> had bin idolaters, <hi>Israel</hi>
might, not without cause, haue suspected some disastrous is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue.
As if a Protestant state, should among Protestant subiects
(when it hath enow) send such as are Popish idolaters for
souldiers &amp; captains against a forraine enemy of the Popish
religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, were it not cause sufficient to defeate &amp; frustrate the
whole expeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to send the scattered &amp; defeated army
home again with no lesse shame, then losse? Much more if i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols
do, not as <hi>Achan,</hi> lurke at home, but dare with open face
perk vp, as <hi>Dagon,</hi> cheek by iowle, by Gods Ark. Yet <hi>Achans</hi>
one lurking sin was provocation sufficient to cause <hi>Israel</hi> to
turne their backs. How so? For the Lord had giuen a speciall
strict charge to the contrary, that no man should reserue
ought of <hi>Ierico</hi> to his proper vse; all must be devowed to the
fire, only the gold &amp; siluer consecrated to Gods Tabernacle.
Therfore no smal sin, which Gods seuere co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand aggravats.
<hi>Saul</hi> had a faire pretence of reseruing <hi>Agag,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.</note> &amp; the fattest of
the cattel, the spoil of <hi>Amalek,</hi> prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for sacrifice; but
it excused not his rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in disobeying Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
for the internecion of <hi>Amalek;</hi> yea it cost him his kingdome.</p>
            <p>Yea, but though <hi>Achans</hi> sin were so great, yet it was his
own. How doth <hi>Israel</hi> then stand charged with it? What rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
is this,<note place="margin">V. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>Israel hath transgressed; for Achan tooke of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed
thing? Shall not the iudge of all the world do right?</hi> Shall
<hi>Israel</hi> be culpable for one mans offence? <hi>Farre be it.</hi> Nay,
more then that, this sin of <hi>Achan</hi> was secret, hid fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Ioshua,</hi> &amp;
the Elders of <hi>Israel.</hi> Indeed if they had knowne of it, &amp; not
punished it, they had made themselues accessaries, &amp; so, cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of it. The whole Tribe of <hi>Beniamin</hi> (a memorable &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
example) came to bee extinct (except a 600, the
poore<note n="*" place="margin">25000.</note> remnant of many thousands) only for conniving and
countenancing a few sons of Belial in <hi>Gibeah,</hi> who had abused
the Levites wife. Let <hi>Israel</hi> read the whole story, and learne
to abhorre such countenancing, such connivency of sin in the
sons of Belial. It was in those dayes, when there was no king
in <hi>Israel.</hi> So it was the lesse maruaile, that open crying sinnes
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7346:13"/>
being countenanced, and walking vnder protection (as then
of a whole Tribe) should plainely argue, there was no King
in Israel. An open sinne then, though but of one <hi>Achan</hi> vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
might with some colour of reason be said to involue
Israel with the same ingagement with the author and actour
of it: but <hi>Achans</hi> sinne was yet concealed from Israel, they
knew not of it, much lesse connived at it, least of all counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
it. Indeed we read, that sacrifice was offered euen
for sinnes of ignorance. And we know by experience, that an
Impostume bred within the body, vnknowne, vnfelt, is no
lesse dangerous to the whole, if not more, then an outward
knowne Gangreene, or Canker. Howsoeuer, wee see heere,
that for <hi>Achans</hi> sin, Israel is counted a transgressour: yea, all
Israel smarts for it.</p>
            <p>Heere is then by the way a point of instruction for Israel,
that one <hi>Achans</hi> sinne is enough to trouble, to endanger all
Israel (secret though it were) till it be remoued. Nor goes
this example alone. <hi>Ionathan,</hi> King <hi>Sauls</hi> Son, for but tasting
a little honey with the tippe of his rod, and that in his great
necessity, ignorant of any the Kings commaund to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
caused Gods Oracle to bee silent,<note place="margin">Jam. 1. 14.</note> a signe of Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
against Israel. <hi>Rachel,</hi> hauing stollen away her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Idols (not for any zeale of depriuing her father of the
meanes of his Idolatry, but rather out of a blinde loue to her
olde Idole-acquaintance) how did shee indanger the whole
Family of <hi>Iacob</hi> her husband,<note place="margin">Gen. 31.</note> while <hi>Laban</hi> in zeale of his
false gods (the most furious and bloody zeale of all other)
pursued him with all his power, but that the Lord interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
himselfe by a monitory dreame? Again, while these idols
lurked still in <hi>Iacobs</hi> house, vnknowne (good man) to him,
was not he and all his in danger of his brother <hi>Esaus</hi> invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
hatred and armed malice, now marching against him,
but that Gods mercy came betweene, crowning <hi>Iacob</hi> with
the name of Israel, which hee had so stoutly and devoutly
<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 32.</note> wrastled for, telling him, that as hee had prevailed with
God,<note place="margin">Hosh. 12. 4.</note> so he should with men, heereby arming him with assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
against his brother? But you will say, this was vpon
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7346:13"/>
an olde quarrell. True. Yet <hi>Rachels</hi> Idoles might helpe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viue
it. For (obserue it) <hi>Iacob</hi> had no security from dangers,
till his house was purged of such stuffe. For no sooner was
this brunt ouer, but a third danger encounters him, to wit,
the quarrell of the <hi>Sychemites</hi> and their Confederates against
Israel and his Family. It was foule on both sides; but the lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
idoles in <hi>Iacobs</hi> house (I dare be bold to say) ministers
either fire, or fewell, to cause it burne the fiercer. Note the
issue well. <hi>Iacob</hi> purposing with his Family to goe &amp; erect an
Altar at <hi>Bethel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 34. &amp; 35.</note> there to worship the Lord in purity without
mixture, first purgeth his family of al their idols. Then, then,
I say,<note place="margin">Gen. 35. 5.</note> &amp; not before <hi>the feare of the Lord fell vpon the cities round
about,</hi> that they pursued not the sons of <hi>Iacob.</hi> Till this time,
we see, <hi>Israel</hi> had no rest, nor security fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his enemies. How
much more is this verified of such sin, when it is once come
to a head and full height? For the purpose. What reigne was
euer more famously peaceable, then that of <hi>Salomon?</hi> yet in
his olde age, doting on his idoles, by reason of his strange
wiues,<note place="margin">1 Kings 11.</note> how did this trouble <hi>Israel?</hi> God beganne to profane
the glory of that peaceable Kingdome,<note place="margin">1 Kings 12.</note> by raising vp sundry
adversaries to vexe him.<note place="margin">1 Kings 14. 21.</note> And <hi>Rehoboam</hi> his sonne insisting
in his Fathers steps of idolatry (his mother being an <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitesse)</hi>
and adding to his Fathers little finger his own loines
and oppressions, to his rods his own scorpions, was the cause
of an incurable rent in <hi>Israel,</hi> of an irrevocable defection of
the ten Tribes, and of the spoyle of the treasure of the Lords
House, and of all those goodly golden vessels and vtensils of
the Temple by the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> though from thence <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
had marryed his wife. So little confidence is there in
marriage, league and alliance, where idolatry is a sticklar. In
a word, in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> if a man committed murther
in shedding innocent blood, the whole Land stood guilty
of it, till it were expiated by the death of him that shed it.
<hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 33.</p>
            <p>But how stands this with reason or equity, that one mans
sin ingages a whole Land? Yes, very well. For euery King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is a body politick. And one member gangreend, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7346:14"/>
the whole body,<note place="margin">—Immedicabile vulnus Ense re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidendum est, ne pars sincera tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatur. Pereat po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius vnus, quàm vaitas.</note> if it be not prevented; and better
the incurable member be cut off. Better, saith <hi>Christ,</hi> that one
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber perish, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole body be cast into hel fire. Again,
sin is of a leprous nature, it quickly spreads ouer the whole.</p>
            <p>This being well waighed, it concernes euery childe of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
to apply it to himself, to smite vpon his thigh, to examin
his conscience, to find out the traytor-sin, <hi>Achans</hi> sin, to wit,
the close or open raigning sinne, the sinne of maintenance, of
course, of custome, of habite, the sinne of rebellion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy,
which els betrayes himselfe, and Israel with him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this should stirre vp the whole state when they
see &amp; feele, that nothing prospereth, but all things goe back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with Israel, to hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in sackcloth &amp; ashes, &amp;
withal to search out the <hi>Achan,</hi> &amp; purge out the sin that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
Israel. For till then, no peace, no prosperity for Israel.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this should teach all true Israelites to condole the
transgressions of others, as wherein themselues are so deeply
interessed: when thy neighbors house is on fire, it concernes
thee neerely to quench it. And wee are indangered not onely
by vicinity &amp; neighbourhood of nature &amp; society,<note place="margin">—Paries cùm proximus ardet, Tunc tuares agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> but much
more, if we become Accessories of others sin, either by not
preventing it when we may, or not laboring for their reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
by praier or perswasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; or much more, by countenancing;
applauding, &amp; approuing it, or also in not cutting it off (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
no other remedy wil remoue it) with <hi>Israels</hi> sword of justice</p>
            <p>In the last place <hi>Israel</hi> may gather by this one example of
<hi>Achan,</hi> in what state it standeth. For if one <hi>Achans</hi> sinne, and
that vnknowne to <hi>Israel,</hi> proued so disastrous, so dangerous:
then how lamentable is the condition of <hi>Israel,</hi> when the
Land is full of <hi>Achans,</hi> and the sins of those <hi>Achans</hi> not so
shamefast, as to seeke to hide themselues in corners, but dare
display themselues vpon the open theater? Such as say, <hi>with
our tongue will we prevaile, our lippes are our owne, who is Lord
ouer vs?</hi> Such as sit in the <hi>Chaire of scorners.</hi> Such as sin with a
high hand, <hi>Cum privilegio.</hi> Then it is high time for <hi>Ioshua,</hi>
and the Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> to rent their cloathes, to faste and
pray, and more then that too, as we shall see anone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:7346:14"/>
Proceed we from <hi>Achans</hi> sin, the Cause, to the effect, <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels</hi>
discomfiture, the occasion of <hi>Ioshua's</hi> discomfort, with
the Elders of <hi>Israel. Achan</hi> now perhaps (if his guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
gaue him leaue) was a sleepe in his Tent, as <hi>Ionas</hi> in
the shippe, or his lust exercised his eyes in beholding of his
new Babylonish garment, his gold and siluer wedges, the
while his innocent brethren smarted for it. But <hi>Ioshua</hi> &amp; the
Elders of <hi>Israel,</hi> guided by another. Spirit, then of supine &amp;
careles sensuality, were now in the deep of humiliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
&amp; that vpon so small an occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison, &amp; to se to.</p>
            <p>Here is then another lesson for <hi>Israel,</hi> to know &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it for the greatest happines, when in their affliction,
or so, they haue such a <hi>Iosua</hi> and Elders, compassionate and
tender-hearted towards their people, &amp; such as are heartily
affected with, as chiefly, the least reproach done to <hi>Israels</hi>
God, so the least dammage or despight done to Gods <hi>Israel</hi>
by the enemy of both. Such was <hi>Israels</hi> happines here. Yea
such was Egypts happines,<note place="margin">Gen, 41. 43.</note> vvhen, next to <hi>Pharaoh, Ioseph</hi>
was set ouer them, before whom the King caused to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed,
<hi>Abrech,</hi> which is <hi>tender Father;</hi> the best Title, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming
the Gouernours of <hi>Israel.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Sam. 1. 17.</note> Such was <hi>Davids</hi>
affection, who mournes for <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> &amp; <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi>
discomfiture by the <hi>Philistims,</hi> vpon the mountaines of
<hi>Gilboa.</hi> Yea how was <hi>David</hi> touched only for a disgrace his
servants suffered from the King of <hi>Ammon,</hi> whom he had
sent in kindnes to congratulate? Nor was it an imbellious
sorrow, but such as became the King of <hi>Israel</hi> to expresse in
a noble revenge. Also this King <hi>David,</hi> vvhen through his
default, his people vvere plagued, vvhat an humble spirit, &amp;
fatherly affection did he expresse tovvards them, vvhen he
said to the Lord:<note place="margin">2. Sam. 24. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Loe, I haue sinned &amp; done wickedly but these
sheep, what haue they done? Let thine hand I pray thee be against
mee, and against my Fathers house.</hi> Vnder such <hi>Iosephs,</hi> vnder
such <hi>Ioshuas,</hi> and Elders, vnder such <hi>Davids, Israel</hi> howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
afflicted, yet cannot perish, <hi>Filij istarum lachrymarum
perire non possunt.</hi> The Sonnes of such compassionate Fathers
can never perish. There is euer hope for <hi>Israel</hi> vnder such
a <hi>Ioshua</hi> and Elders. <hi>Israel</hi> vvas never carried cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7346:15"/>
but vnder wicked and cruell idolatrous Kings. A pious
and well affected Prince, being as a noble head, which ever
keeping aboue water, preserues the body, though vnder wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
from sinking.</p>
            <p>And how well doth it become all <hi>Ioshua's</hi> and Rulers of
Gods people, to bee thus tenderly affected with the good
or evill of <hi>Israel?</hi> For first, as they are next vnto and vnder
God in their power and soveraignety ouer his people: so in
their <hi>Ioshua</hi>-like affection; they doe most neerely imitate
God himselfe, of whom it is sayd, <hi>Esay 63. 9. In all their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>he was afflicted.</hi> Againe, Princes and Rulers, though
they be by calling and office called Gods, yet in nature they
are men,<note place="margin">Psal. 72.</note> and shall die like men, as King <hi>David</hi> saith; they
are of the same mould and mettall of their people, to knit
them in a sympathy of affection with them. Therefore even
Christ the Sonne of God tooke our Nature, with the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of it, that he might be a mercifull High-priest, and
hauing experience of our temptations, hee might succour
them that are tempted.<note place="margin">Dide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> As that noble <hi>Heathen.</hi> Queene said,
<hi>Non ignara mali, miseris succurrere disco:</hi> having experience
of misery my selfe, I learne hereby to succour the miserable.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Princes are also called <hi>Patres Patriae,</hi> Fathers of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
whose subjects are not more their seruants in duty,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> then their sonnes in loue. Also sheapheards of the People.
And the good sheepheard binds vp the broken, seekes out
the lost sheepe, and brings it home on his backe rejoycing.
Yea, Princes are Gods servants and stewards, whose chiefe
office it is to maintaine and vindicate the honour of their
Lord. Lastly, how neerely doth the weale or woe of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
touch the Prince? for it is his owne weale or woe. If
but the foote, the most inferiour member, bee pained, the
head by and by feeleth it as its owne paine, it stoopeth to
helpe it; as euen wisdome would, the head should rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the commodity, then object the distance. If the
feete be in fetters, the head cannot be free.</p>
            <p>It is <hi>Israels</hi> office then alwayes to pray for such <hi>Ioshuas,</hi>
that such gracious and pious Princes may euer raigne ouer
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7346:15"/>
them. Secondly, <hi>Israel</hi> must be carefull to walke worthy of
such <hi>Ioshua's,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 28. 2.</note> both for the obtayning, and the long enjoying
of them. Thirdly, if <hi>Ioshua</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> bee thus
moved euen for the least calamities of their brethren; then
how ought our whole <hi>Israel</hi> to bee affected with the daily
and heauy calamities of Gods people, only divided from vs
in distance of place, not in difference of participation with
Christ our head? Fourthly, hauing such <hi>Ioshua's</hi> and Elders,
who like good Fathers, are tenderly affected with the least
calamity of Gods people, how thankefull ought we to be to
God for them, and to expresse this our thankefulnes in all
pious offices, and liberall beneficence, that nothing bee lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
either for ornament to their princelike port, or much
more for the necessary support of the Crown &amp; kingdome?
In the last place, if <hi>Israel</hi> haue receiued farre greater repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
&amp; reproches, then now <hi>Israel</hi> had done, <hi>Israel</hi> had need
to be so much the more humbled, if possible, then here
<hi>Ioshua</hi> &amp; the Elders were. And so much of the occasion mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Ioshua</hi> with the Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> thus to hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues.</p>
            <p>Come wee now to their act it selfe. Therein consider 2.
things. 1. The Circumstances. 2. The Substance of it. The
circumstances are 3. 1. Of the Persons, the Actors, <hi>Ioshua</hi> &amp;
the Elders of <hi>Israel.</hi> 2. Of the place, Before the Arke of the
Lord: 3. Of the time, vntill the eventide. The substance of
the act consists partly of Action and behauiour, &amp; partly of
speech. Their actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or behauiour was threefold: 1. They rent
their cloathes: 2. they fell to the earth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their faces 3. they
put dust vpon their heads. All this <hi>v.</hi> 6. Their speech is a
prayer or zealous &amp; hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble expostulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with God. <hi>v.</hi> 7. 8. 9.
Al which being jointly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered, they represent vnto vs an
exact pattern &amp; platforme of sole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne &amp; publick Fast. Which
will the better appeare, if we a litle ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> every peece a part.</p>
            <p>First, for the Persons. <hi>Ioshua</hi> for his person was of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
gifts and graces. He was one of the Twelue; that were
sent to view the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> one of the two, that incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
the people to goe take possession, contrary to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
of the other ten. He only was with <hi>Moses</hi> in
the holy Mount those forty daies and forty nights. Hee was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7346:16"/>
a man most zealous of Gods glory, in his pure worship and
seruice. So that in his pious and pithy exhortation to the
people, <hi>Chap.</hi> 24. to feare the Lord, to serue him in sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and in truth, to abandon their strange Gods: he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
in case they would not, saying: <hi>As for me, and my house,
wee will serue the Lord.</hi> Yea hee made a couenant with the
people to put away their idols, and images, those strange
gods; set them a statute and ordinance, <hi>Chap.</hi> 24. 25. He ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
also a stone for a monument, &amp; witnesse for perpetuity
vnto stosterity. A most excellent Precedent for Princes hee
was, sith the only rule of his Regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was the word of God,
the wisest Counsellour of Kinges, if they would haue their
affaires to prosper. As <hi>Iosh. 1. v.</hi> 8. He tooke not his Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from his predecessor <hi>Moses,</hi> though he were a wise &amp;
a good man, but so farre as he was regulated by the only rule
of Gods word. The wisest politicians may foulely erre in
their gouernment, whose precedents may proue the more
perillous to their followers, when out of an admiration and
high opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their wisdome, they withall swallow down
their great errors, digesting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as corrupt blood into all the
veines of the body politick; but they that folow Gods word,
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not erre. This made <hi>David</hi> wiser then his teachers, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
aged, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his enimies. <hi>Ps.</hi> 119. 98. In a word. <hi>Ioshua</hi> is not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of any vice in Scripture, as even <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were.</p>
            <p>Againe, for his office and calling, he was <hi>Moses</hi> successor,
appointed by God to leade his people into the possession of
the promised land. Herein also, according to his name, <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>
or <hi>Iesus,</hi> which signifieth a Sauiour, hee was a type of
Iesus Christ, who conducts his people into the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.
Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were defectiue and faulty, for which
cause they might not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duct the people into <hi>Canaan;</hi> which
is also a mystery, signifying, that the law, those legall and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viticall
observances were defectiue, and so could not bring
<hi>Israel</hi> into <hi>Canaans</hi> possession: onely <hi>Ioshua,</hi> which is <hi>Iesus,</hi>
(in whom no fault is found, noted in Scripture; no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <hi>Melchisedechs</hi> genealogy, to make him a type of Christs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
Priest-hood; though neither <hi>Ioshua,</hi> as a man, was
voyde of all sin, nor <hi>Melchisedech</hi> with out Parents) <hi>Ioshua</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:7346:16"/>
(I say) a liuely type of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> was he, that must put gods
people in the possession of the promised land. This is that
<hi>Iehoshua</hi> here who humbleth himself, and with him the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of <hi>Israel.</hi> whether they were the chief of the tribes or of
the families of <hi>Israel,</hi> or else those 70 Elders, mentioned <hi>Ex.</hi>
24. 1. The chief of <hi>Israel</hi> they were without questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And the
text saith, he (to wit <hi>Ioshua)</hi> &amp; the Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> jointly.</p>
            <p>Hereby the way is a notable Embleme, and patterne of a
well gouerned state, where <hi>Ioshua,</hi> the prime gouernor, goes
not alone in his Counsels and actions, but hath his Elders
with him. Euen <hi>Salomon,</hi> for all his wisdome, had a graue Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
of sage Elders, whose Counsell if his sonne <hi>Rehoboam</hi>
had not forsaken, preferring his braue younkers, before the
graue Elders, his kingdome might long haue florished.</p>
            <p>Well what did <hi>Ioshua</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> here? First,
they rent their cloaths. To signifie the renting of their
hearts. So <hi>Ioel.</hi> 2. 13. Rent your hearts and not your gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And the ceremony of renting the clothes was not
lightly to bee vsed, but in case when Gods glory or name
suffered; as <hi>Num. 14. 6. Ioshua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> rent their cloathes,
when their fellow spies had by their misreport discouraged
the people, causing them to distrust Gods lawes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
The like case is here. Secondly they fell to the earth on
their faces; importing a stupendious abjection full of zeale,
as vtterly regardlesse of their dignity or persons, carelesse
what became of them, so transported were they with zeale
for Gods glory, and people. Thirdly, they put dust vpon
their heads, in signe of greatest humiliation, as dead men, on
whom the earth or mould is cast for buriall. Hereunto adde
the other circumstances, as of the time, how long, vntill the
euentide, the iust terme of a solemne fast: as also of the
place, before the Arke of the Lord, the type of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
in his Sanctuary, before the mercy seate, the place of
publicke worship: together with their feruent inuocation,
and zealous prayer to God: and so in some wee haue a full
fast, in all the intire and maine parts of it.</p>
            <p>Loe, then, what a noble precede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of true piety is here exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7346:17"/>
to Gods people! And doth not our royall <hi>Ioshua</hi> the
like? what saith the proclamation? Note the words well: In
this fast his Maiesty in his royall Person, &amp; with his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and royal household, will giue an example to the rest
of his people. Yea, that the pious and religious considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
[namely of deliuerances past, of disasters present,
and dangers imminent] haue soe wrought in the Princely
heart of the Kings most excellent Maiestie, that he hath not
onely had recourse, to that great and Diuine Maiestie, who
is the King of Kings, in his priuate deuotions, to implore his
mercy, and fauour to himselfe and his people; but according
to the example of all good Kings in former ages, in the
times of common calamities, which equally concerne both
Prince and people, to commaund a solemne, a generall, and a
publicke fast &amp;c: So run the words. Which well obserued,
what hopefull fruites shall not such a fast produce, when
the first seedes thereof, euen prayers, and teares, are begunne
to be sowne by our Royall <hi>Ioshua?</hi> And though in that his
preceeding, and priuate practise he seemeth to go alone: yet
for the more graue and religious forme of solemnizing
thereof, insteed of the Elders of <hi>Israel,</hi> his most excellent
Maiesty hath consulted with his reuerend Bishops. Which
our noble <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and his reuerend Elders, soe farre as they
in this fast imitate <hi>Ioshua</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Israel,</hi> so let our
<hi>Israel</hi> imitate them. Then doubt we not of a hopefull wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
to attend and succeed this fast, wherein <hi>Ioshua</hi> with the
Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> lead vs the way in sincerity of their heart,
&amp; in the precedencie of their pious examples. And note one
fare proofe &amp; fruit of our late generall fast, vpon the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of
<hi>August,</hi> for the Country. That very day the heauens began
to restraine their vnkindly influence of excessiue vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
famine-threatning wette, the Lord clearing vp his
cloudy countinance in the face of the christaline skye, faire
weather continuing from that day, to bring vs in a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
&amp; most plentifull haruest, to the regret of all ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
misers and regrating cornmongers, but joy to all good
hearts. The very like change of weather fell vpon the very
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7346:17"/>
day of the last yeares fast, which began with the Court, and
<hi>London</hi> fast. Thus God is pleased to grace our fasts, showing
how much he is delighted with true humiliation.</p>
            <p>Now, by the example of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Israel</hi>
here, we are taught how to keepe a right and religious fast
to the Lord. First, as they rent their garments, so we should
our hearts with deepe contrition and godly sorrow, for
Gods dishonour, displeasure, and <hi>Israels</hi> discomfitures. And
if euer, now cause there is to rent our hearts, for <hi>Israels</hi>
fearefull rents, both in Church &amp; state. These great schismes
and rents are best cured and closed againe, by this one of the
heart. If our hearts proue rocky, smite we them with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
rodde, by the application of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, that soe being
rent and cleft a sunder, there may issue out floods of liuing
waters of repentance flowing from a liuely faith, which
may supple and close the clefts and chaps of our parched
<hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, as <hi>Ioshua's,</hi> so our fast must be with exceeding
humiliation of soule and spirit, yea euen to the dust, and
that renouncing our selues, as dead men, in whom is noe
helpe or hope, being as it were buried vnder ground, as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>
vnder the dust, which he cast vpon his head. We must
goe out of our selues, as the soule out of the body, flying to
God, who onely canne free vs from our euils, fealt or feared.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, our fast must be constant as <hi>Ioshua's,</hi> vntill the
eventide. The day of our fast is a holy day to the Lord, to be
wholy spent in a religious abstinence as from our ordinary
food, so from any pleasure, or profit of our owne. The Lord
reproues <hi>Israel</hi> for this,<note place="margin">Esay 58. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> saying: Behold in the day of your
fast you finde pleasure, and exact all your labours. We must
forbeare all kind of food, or repast till the euentide. So did
<hi>Nineueh</hi> by the Kings commandement. <hi>Ion.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the speciall place wherein to celebrate our fast,
is the place appointed for publike worship. <hi>Ioshua's</hi> humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
was before the Arke of the Lord. Our priuate houses
haue their vse for priuate deuotions: but in the time of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
seruice in Gods house, whereat we must, if we may be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7346:18"/>
present, our priuate deuotions at home are of no other vse,
but to bring a curse in stead of a blessing, while the publicke
ministery is neglected, or contemned. And euer in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
ordinance God doth more manifest his presence in the
communication of his graces, then in our priuate families:
yet by commending the publike, I exclude not the prinate:
but euer the priuate must giue place to the publicke. The
day of our fast, as also other the Lords Sabboths, allowes
some time to be spent in our priuate families for the duties
of the day, as those vacant howres both before, betweene,
and after the publike seruice: but the publicke worship must
in no case bee incroched vpon by our priuate deuotions,
much lesse by our worldly affaires, or affections: at that wee
must be no lesse instant in comming then constant in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing.
So did <hi>Ioshua</hi> before the Lords Arke. Yea in some
places, specially in the Country, where their Churches are
greater, and their congregations lesser, being also vpon a
working day, and in haruest time, if they be accommodated
for Preachers, agreeing vpon it, the fast may be wholy spent
in the Church, in the publike congregation. Not that there
is more vertue in the Church-wals, or pewes, or pillars,
then in our priuate houses or closets: but the publicke Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
is the most perfect beauty of holinesse, euer to bee
preferred before priuate deuotions.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, a religious fast must euer bee joyned with earnest
and feruent prayer to God, either for remouing present e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils,
or preuenting future: or else in thanksgiuing for bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
receiued and enioyed.</p>
            <p>Lastly, all this must bee done in sincerity of heart, as in
the sight and presence of God, all hypocriticall and Pharisai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
vayles remoued from vs. Thus <hi>Ioshua's</hi> humiliation,
with the Elders of <hi>Israel,</hi> was before the Arke of the Lord,
in the presence of God. Suffice it onely to name these
things as briefe rules and directions for our fast.</p>
            <p>Only insist we vpon two points, as most requisite to our
present purpose. The first is: that in our publicke fast, God
doth especially looke vpon the heart, that it be single and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7346:18"/>
sincere without hypocrisie. Nothing is more abominable
in the sight of God, than an hypocriticall Fast: which the
more solemne, the hypocrisie is the more insolently and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daciously
impious, as daring to play mock-holiday with
God vpon the open stage. Such was <hi>Iezebels</hi> fast, a very
packe of hypocrisie; who to colour and cover her craft, and
cruell covetousnes, to compasse <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard, shee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes
(forsooth) a solemne fast, having her false witnes in
a readines, suborned to accuse innocent <hi>Naboth,</hi> saying, <hi>This
man blasphemed God, and the King.</hi> Who would not imagine
that this fast was rather to expiate <hi>Naboths</hi> imaginary blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
then to satiate <hi>Ahabs</hi> lust for his hereditary vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard?
saving that it was not so easie a matter for <hi>Iezebel</hi> and
<hi>Ahab</hi> by subtile hypocrisie to impose vpon, no not, their
credulous simples. The vaile of hypocrisie is not for every
ones weare. <hi>Iezebel</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> were palpably &amp; notoriously
wicked, which, while they go about to hide vnder hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
they do but dance in a net of too small a thread to hold
such a sish as <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard, without the strong cordes
of a womans lawlesse lust, armed with <hi>Ahabs</hi> signet, with the
awfulnes whereof shee had taught the Elders &amp; Gouernors
of <hi>Naboths</hi> City to bee at a becke,<note place="margin">1. Kings. 21.</note> and to serue at all turnes.
Farre vnlike our <hi>Ioshua,</hi> &amp; Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> here, in their
Fast. But <hi>Ahabs</hi> kingdome was the revolted idolatrous
house of <hi>Israel.</hi> No marvaile if they were no lesse absurdly
hypocriticall, then grossely profane. But let not <hi>Iudah</hi> sinne.
Yes <hi>Iudah</hi> also was become an hypocrite. In the 58. of <hi>Esay</hi>
The Lord bids the Prophet, <hi>Cry aloud, spare not, lift vp thy
voyce like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgressions,
and the house of</hi> Iacob <hi>their sinnes.</hi> What sinnes? Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
stands in the forefront, <hi>v.</hi> : 2. Wherein specially did they
play the hypocrites? In their fasting; so <hi>v. 3. Wherefore haue
we fasted,</hi> say they, <hi>and thou seest not?</hi> &amp;c. The Lord answers,
<hi>v, 5. Is it such a fast, that I haue chosen? A day for a man to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
his soule, is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, &amp; to spred
sackcloath, &amp; ashes vnder him? Wilt thou call this a fast, &amp; an
acceptable day to the Lord? Is not this the fast that I haue
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7346:19"/>
chosen, to loose the bandes of wickednesse, to vndoe the heavy
burthens, and to let the oppressed goe free, and that yee breake
the yoake?</hi> &amp;c. A religious fast then is to loose the bands
of vvickednesse: but hypocrisie fastneth them the more by
fasting.</p>
            <p>How so? For first, of an hypocriticall fast comes no
good, God regards it not, as the people complayned. Yea,
sayth <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay. 58. 3.</note> 
               <hi>if I regard wickednesse in my heart, the Lord
will not heare me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 66. 18.</note> And <hi>Psal. 17. 1. Heare the right O Lord,
attend vnto my cry; giue eare vnto my prayer, that goeth not
out of fayned lips.</hi> Implying that dissimulation with God
hath no plea for acceptance. Yea, on the contrary, as it har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
a man in evill, so it hastens greater judgements; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in a solemne fast, it turnes even our prayers into sinne,
and bringeth a curse in stead of a blessing; as <hi>Iacob</hi> feared,
by having on his brothers garment, and pretending to bee
<hi>Esau.</hi> Though neuer any dissimulation sped so well as that
of <hi>Iacobs.</hi> And not without cause. For the blessing belonged
to him, by a double right: By Gods donation and designe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and by purchase from <hi>Esau;</hi> so that in truth and effect,
<hi>Iacob,</hi> was <hi>Esau,</hi> to wit, the elder brother, to whom the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of birth-right belonged. This by the way. But false
hearted hypocrisie is euer disastrous and vnhappy. And as
no reformation can be expected of a solemne hypocrite, but
still greater obfirmation in evill: So hee cannot hope of any
good from God; or if hee doe, his hope shall perish, as <hi>Iob</hi>
faith.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Ahabs</hi> humiliation and fasting,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>biece.</note> though hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
yet obtayned favour of God.</p>
            <p>True,<note place="margin">Answere.</note> But what favour? He obtayned the reprivall of his
punishment for the time, but not the pardon of his sinne,
nor consequently exemption from judgment. Gods tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
or temporary favour to an hypocrite, sheweth how
much he delighteth in a sincere heart. But <hi>Ahab</hi> was paid
home at last for all his hypocrisie and impiety. For as hee
had swallowed downe at a morsell <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard,
whereof, for all his humiliation, and crowching, hee never
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7346:19"/>
made, nor euer meant restitution, while he disfigured his
face in a counterfeit fast: So at <hi>Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oth Gilead,</hi> the Lords ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
hit him home,<note place="margin">1 Kings. 22.</note> &amp; that in the same place, where <hi>Naboth</hi>
was slaine, and that also in <hi>Ahabs</hi> disguised attire, whereby
he thought to haue frustated the trueth of <hi>Micaiah's</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.
Well might <hi>Ahab</hi> by hypocrisie commit the evill
of sin vnseene of men, but he could not thereby avoid the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
of punishment, seene of God, for all his disguising.</p>
            <p>This may teach vs in our humiliation to looke well to
our hearts, how they stand affected. The ancient Heathen v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to looke into the Entrals of their Sacrifice, whether they
were sound or no. <hi>Caesar</hi> observing his sacrifice to vvant a
heart, tooke it for an ill presage, as it proved. That which
they did in superstition, let Christians haue in religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
namely to looke well to their heart, if sound and
sincere: else such a sacrifice bodes no good. <hi>Wherefore is
there a price in the fooles hand, to buy wisdome, and he wants a
heart.</hi> Prov. 17. 16.</p>
            <p>Now an ill affected heart in our Fast-sacrifice, is either a
wilfull ignorance of our sinne, or if we know it, stubborne
impenitency, hauing no thought or purpose, much lesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and endeavous to reforme it. This is a fast not for sinne,
nor from sinne, but in sinne, and vnto sin. <hi>Ioshua's</hi> heart, and
the Elders of <hi>Israel,</hi> was not so. They were ignorant indeed
of <hi>Achans</hi> sinne, but not wilfully or willingly. Besides, if
they had knowne it, how ready would they haue beene to
purge or to punish it? as vve shall see afterwards? Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
their sacrifice had vvanted a heart, and so vvould haue
proued or procured a greater plague vnto <hi>Israel.</hi> But in
their humiliation they vvere no vvay guilty of <hi>Achans</hi>
sinne, nor as authours, nor as accessories, either by appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
conniuing or patronizing of it. They dealt sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>The second and last speciall poynt considerable in <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua's</hi>
act, is, that as <hi>Ioshua's,</hi> so our fast, should be holy to the
Lord, and for the Lord. <hi>When ye fasted, ye fasted not to mee,
but to your selues: Zach:</hi> 7. 5. They sought themselues, their
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7346:20"/>
owne wealth &amp; welfare. No godamercy. <hi>Should ye not
heare</hi> &amp;c? <hi>Esay.</hi> 58. 3. That which <hi>Ioshua</hi> and the Elders of
<hi>Israel</hi> sought, was principally Gods glory which suffered in
<hi>Israels</hi> discomfiture. As <hi>v. 9. And what wilt thou doe vnto thy
great name?</hi> It was not their owne profit, or priuate ends, nor
policy, but piety, that moued them to this humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

            <l>Hee that seekes Gods glory onely, procureth also his
owne:</l>
            <l>Hee that seeketh his owne glory alone, looseth also
Gods.</l>
            <p>Now the right seeking of Gods glory in our Fast, is to
put the meanes in practise. As, to remoue the impediments,
generally all mens personall sinnes, particularly state-sins,
as idolatry and heresie, which directly strike at Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and ruinate <hi>Israel;</hi> as also oppression and bribery, which
ruinate kingdomes. Withall, to establish the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
with justice distributiue and correctiue: so is Gods
<hi>Israel,</hi> so the Kings throne established.</p>
            <p>Many may the causes be of <hi>Israels</hi> fast, whereof <hi>Ioshua</hi> &amp;
the Elders cannot be ignorant. Yet if there were no more,
<hi>Achans</hi> sinne alone, though concealed, is cause enough.
But how shall <hi>Achan</hi> with his privy palliated sinne, bee
found out? This is Gods part in the next words, <hi>v.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>From this verse to the 16 is contayned the Lords charge
to <hi>Ioshua, Get thee vp; wherefore lyest thou thus vpon thy face?
Israel hath sinned,</hi> &amp;c. It may seeme strange that God should
bid <hi>Ioshua</hi> surcease his sorrowing, alledging withall the
cause, <hi>Israels sinne.</hi> If <hi>Israel</hi> hath sinned, the rather haue
<hi>Ioshua</hi> and the Elders cause to continue their fasting and
prayer. But wee are not to take this charge as a checke.
For the Lord did not interrupt <hi>Ioshua's</hi> devotion, till the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventide,
the time of comfort after sorrow. So that being
at a full period, <hi>(And what wilt thou doe to thy great name?)</hi>
the Lord takes the hinte and answeres <hi>Ioshua</hi> so, as <hi>Ioshua</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:7346:20"/>
might be partaker of that hee prayed for. Otherwise, <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>
and the Elders might haue fasted and prayed long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
with small fruit, if the Lords speech had not stept in.
Something else must be done besides a fast, before it will go
well with <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But was not <hi>Ioshua's</hi> prayer and fasting aualeable? Was
hee not a holy and a vertuous Prince? And doth not the
effectuall feruent prayer of a righteous man auaile much?<note place="margin">Iam. 5. 16.</note>
Againe was not <hi>Ioshua</hi> a type of <hi>Iesus Christ?</hi> And are not
the prayers of Iesus effectuall? Can God be angry with his
people, for whom Iesus prayeth? This is Israels confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
euen ours, that wee haue Iesus entred into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Canaan, there taking possession, there making inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
for vs. Can any thing then betide vs, but good? If
our Iesus pray, can wee his Israel perish? God forbid. Yet
something is required on <hi>Israels</hi> part, to be made partakers
of Christs prayers, to bring the blessing thereof downe vnto
vs. <hi>Israel</hi> had the Oracles of God, his Arke, his speciall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
a noble <hi>Ioshua</hi> and Elders praying for them: yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was lacking on Israels part. <hi>Ioshua,</hi> Iesus may pray for
Israel, yet Israel be in perill of perishing, if Israel haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
But Israel hath sinned sayth the Lord to <hi>Ioshua; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
lyest thou thus vpon thy face? get thee vp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Israel hath sinned, Israel hath an aduocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>
Iesus Christ the righteous and hee is the Propitiation
for all our sins. What more is required? yes, something. For,
<hi>if wee confesse our sinnes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1. 9.</note> 
               <hi>hee is faithfull and iust to forgiue us
our sinnes, and to cleanse vs from all vnrighteousnesse.</hi> If Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
confesse his sinne. Without this, not <hi>Ioshua's</hi> fasting and
prayer will availe. Indeed our <hi>Ioshua's</hi> prayer, Christs
prayer for Israel, is an effectuall meanes to worke true faith,
and to produce repentance in a sincere confession of sinnes
vnto saluation. And therefore <hi>Ioshua's</hi> prayer is not spent
in vaine, but is a fore runner inducing and conducing to
the confession, and so to the purgation of Israels sin.</p>
            <p>The point hence is: that all Israels fasting, prayer, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
deuotion, is to noe purpose to preuent plagues,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7346:21"/>
but rather to provoke and procure them, if it be not atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with true repentance, &amp; thorow reformation of <hi>Israels</hi>
sin. When you spread forth your hands (saith the Lord) I
will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when yee make many
praiers, I will not heare. Will not many prayers serue the
turne? No, not a beadroule of Prayers, Why? your hands are
full of blood. In praier, pure, not bloody hands, must be lift
vp. God waighs not praiers by their plurality, but by their
purity. And this purity, is not in a neate concatenation of
Scripture phrases, or formes of speech, but in faith and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of a pure heart.<note place="margin">Ezech. 14. 3.</note> In <hi>Ezechiels</hi> time <hi>Israel</hi> had set vp an
idoll in their hearts. Some Idol sinne or other. Any beloued
darling habituall sinne, is an idoll set vp in the heart. How
much more the loue of idols, and images themselues? Well,
what of this?<note place="margin">Vers. 16.</note> The Lord there saith: Though <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi>
and <hi>Iob</hi> were in the land, as I liue saith the Lord, they shall
deliuer neither sonnes nor daughters. Why? The idoll was
set vp in the heart.</p>
            <p>What then doth the Lord require in <hi>Israels</hi> fast? Surely
<hi>Israels</hi> publicke and solemne fast requireth a publicke and
solemne reformation of <hi>Israels</hi> sin. <hi>Ioel.</hi> 2. 12. Turne ye vnto
me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping,
and with mourning &amp;c. Such was done in heathen <hi>Nineuchs</hi>
fast.<note place="margin">Ion. 3. 7.</note> The King caused to be proclaimed through <hi>Nineueh,</hi> (by
the decree of the King and his nobles) Let neither man nor
beast, heard nor flocke, great nor small, old nor young tast
any thing, but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth,
and cry mightily vnto God: Yea, let them turne euery
one from his euill way, and from the violence that is in their
hands.</p>
            <p>Is this the condition required in <hi>Israels</hi> fast? O then what
a terror and horror is it for <hi>Israel,</hi> when in the solemne fast,
not onely some <hi>Achans</hi> priuie sinne is not lookt into, to
be purged and punished,<note place="margin">Esa 1.</note> but open * crimson, scarlet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
sinnes goe disfigured for a day, to no other end, but
that (as <hi>Romes</hi> images at Easter, after their mourning in
blacke all the Lent) they may spring out in a fuller vigour
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7346:21"/>
and luster; vsing a fast, as the rose doth the sable night, to
cause the fayrer glosse?</p>
            <p>Yet here is comfort to the true <hi>Israel</hi> of God. What if
<hi>Achans</hi> sins be not expiated? shall all <hi>Israel</hi> perish? God
forbid. Shall not the judge of all the world do right? But if
<hi>Israel</hi> be pertaker of <hi>Acans</hi> sinne, <hi>Israel</hi> must perish with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan.</hi>
True, but <hi>Israel</hi> fasteth, <hi>Israel</hi> prayeth, so <hi>Ioshua,</hi> so the
Elders. What if many in <hi>Israel</hi> play the hypocrites in their
fast? yet euery <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> fasting and praying
with and for <hi>Israel,</hi> shall be preserued. <hi>Ioshua</hi> and the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of <hi>Israel,</hi> fasting, praying, should haue beene preserued
(who euer else had perished) though <hi>Achans</hi> sin had not
beene purged, so it had not beene through their default. In
<hi>Israels</hi> fast then, let all true <hi>Israelites</hi> comfort themselues, if
first they be purged themselues, by renewing their couenant
with God, and if they cry mightily to God for the purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Achans</hi> sinne, whatsoeur, whosoeuer it is, that
troubleth <hi>Israel:</hi> howsoeuer <hi>Achans</hi> sinne remaine vnpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
to the perill of Israel; yet the labour of such shall not
be in vaine,<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 17.</note> in the Lord. In the day when the Lord makes
vp his Iewels, he will spare them as a man spareth his owne
sonne, that serueth him. Then shall ye returne (sayth the
Lord) and discerne betweene the righteous and the wicked:
betweene him that serueth God, and him that serueth him
not.</p>
            <p>But what was <hi>Achans</hi> sin? It is laid downe verse the 11.
and layd to <hi>Israels</hi> charge, as before. <hi>Israel</hi> hath sinned, and
they haue transgressed my couenant, which I commaunded
them: for they haue euen taken of the accursed thing, and
haue also stollen, and dissembled also, and they haue put it
euen amongst their owne stuffe. Soe, <hi>Achans</hi> sinne was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge,
theft, dissimulation, mingling the accursed thing
with <hi>Israels</hi> stuffe. This accursed thing was a Babylonish
garment, a wedge of gold, of 50 shekels, and 200 shekels of
siluer. It is called accursed in a threefold respect: first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was Babylonish and Chanaanitish stuffe, abominable
to <hi>Israel.</hi> Secondly, because the Lord had expressely forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7346:22"/>
               <hi>Israel</hi> to make or meddle with it, for their owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
vse. Thirdly, because medled withall against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement,
and intermedled with <hi>Israels</hi> stuffe, it caused
<hi>Israel</hi> to be accursed, and all they tooke in hand <hi>v. 12. For
therefore (sayth</hi> God) <hi>the children of</hi> Israel <hi>could not stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their enimies, because they were accursed: neither will I be
with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then we might take occasion to speake of the sins of
sacriledg, &amp; such kind of sacred-profane theft, of hypocrisie,
and dissimulation, of mingling execrable things with <hi>Israels</hi>
stuffe: but it might proue tedious. Onely for a touch by
the way, <hi>Israel</hi> may learne thus much: that if the stealing of
a Babylonish garment were soe hainous: What had beene
then the bringing in of idolatrous reliques with all Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonish
equipage and furniture, to set vppe the Babilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
Religion in <hi>Israel:</hi> in case also it had beene done not
secretly, as <hi>Achans</hi> Babylonish garment, (which might
therefore haue seemed to excuse <hi>Israel,)</hi> but openly and in
the sight of the Sunne, like <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi</hi> in the open
tent? If it were so hainous to steale priuily a wedge of gold,
and siluer, of soe small value in comparison, which though
it were sacriledge, yet the Tabernacle of the Lord was not
as yet possessed of them: what then had it beene, euen with
a high hand of sacriledge &amp; simony, in euery corner &amp; high
mountaine of <hi>Israel,</hi> to robbe and cheate God of his porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Patrimony, the onely Leuiticall inheritance for his
ministery, to the great desolation of many thousand soules
in <hi>Israel?</hi> What if <hi>Israel</hi> herein had beene guilty? How
would they haue weighed such stollen sacred wedges in the
ballance of the sanctuary? What a snare would they haue
found it, to haue deuoured so much sanctified, and after the
vow so to haue inquired?</p>
            <p>Againe, if one <hi>Achans</hi> dissimulation were soe hainous,
how then had the condition of <hi>Israel</hi> beene, if her fairest
face, and most beautifull body had beene couered ouer with
hypocrisie, as with a leprosie, soe that from the crowne of
the head to the sole of the foote, there had beene no sound
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7346:22"/>
part? In a word, if it were imputed to <hi>Israel</hi> for such a
haynous sin, that <hi>Achan</hi> mingled the Babylonish garment
with <hi>Israels</hi> stuffe, then how had <hi>Israels</hi> case stood, if Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish
lees had beene by prodigious <hi>Achans</hi> mingled among
<hi>Israels</hi> pure wine, if <hi>Canaanitish</hi> heresies had beene not only
put with, but for, and in stead of <hi>Israels</hi> most precious stuffe,
her purest doctrines? If these had beene <hi>Israels</hi> sinnes, no
marvaile if they had caused <hi>Israels</hi> affaires to fare so ill; no
marvaile if they had caused <hi>Israels</hi> GOD to estrange him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
from <hi>Israel,</hi> and to take the <hi>Canaanites</hi> part against her;
no marvaile if they had caused <hi>Israel</hi> to be contemned of the
<hi>Canaanite,</hi> to whom she was wont to bee terrible, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
invincible; no marvaile if they had caused GOD
not to goe out with <hi>Israels</hi> Armies, to suffer his Truth to bee
trampled on, yea to threaten vtter desolation and derelicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as v. 12.</p>
            <p>Is <hi>Israels</hi> case no better? Poore <hi>Israel,</hi> what wilt thou
doe? Fast and pray? It is high time indeed. For <hi>Israel</hi> hath
sinned. But yet the Lord bids <hi>Ioshua<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and the Elders of <hi>Israel</hi>
to rise vp from their prostrations, because <hi>Israel</hi> had sinned.
Why so? For, as we haue shewed, something else is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
besides a Faste, to purge <hi>Israels</hi> fault. What is that?
The Lord sheweth v. 13. &amp;c. <hi>Vp, sanctifie the people, and
say, sanctifie your selues against to morrow: for thus saith the
Lord God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the middest
of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies,
vntill yee take away the accursed thing from among you. In
the morning therefore yee shall bee brought, &amp;c. And it shall
bee, that hee that is taken with the accursed thing, shall bee
burnt with fire, hee, and all that hee hath, because &amp;c.</hi> In
these wordes of GOD to <hi>Ioshua,</hi> is first set downe the
cause of <hi>Israels</hi> discomfiture, the accursed thing: Secondly,
The ill condition of <hi>Israel,</hi> vntill this cause bee remooued;
no standing for them before their Enemies. These
wee haue already handled. Thirdly, a direction
to <hi>Ioshua,</hi> for the finding out of the Delinquent,
and for his punishment: Hee and his, must all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7346:23"/>
perish. 4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> 
               <hi>Israel</hi> must be sanctified, to fit them for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
This sanctification was partly externall &amp; ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
in the body,<note place="margin">Exod. 19. 14. 15</note> by washing their cloathes, or abstinence
from pleasures; partly internall by faith and repentance, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
by the externall.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> The word also in the originall, for to
sanctifie, signifying also to prepare. So that the Israelites
were now to prepare themselues in holinesse, for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a notable peece of Iustice, wherein al the people was
to haue a hand. Before they were to inquire into, and punish
anothers sinnes, they must first purge themselues of their
owne sinnes. As <hi>Christ</hi> saith in the Gospell, concerning the
adulterous woman, to those that accused her, <hi>He among you
that is without sin, cast the first stone at her:</hi> So that they that
are to cast a stone at <hi>Achan,</hi> must first be sanctified &amp; clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from their sinnes, by faith and repentance. Also in this
their sanctification they might be vnderstood to haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
themselues and the cause to God, with prayer, that
God would finde out for them the Troubler of Israel, that
he would blesse and direct the lot for that end.</p>
            <p>And here is a good lesson for all Iudges and Iurers, and
Executioners of Iustice, in matters of life and death, that
they be sanctified first themselues by faith, and repentance,
before they passe their verdict vpon others.</p>
            <p>Otherwise without this sanctification and due preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for men to rush vpon the censuring and punishing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sins, is the way to bring Gods displeasure vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Wee haue a famous example heereof in the Israelites
themselues, when they were to take revenge vpon the Tribe
of <hi>Beniamin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iudg. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20.</note> for that foule fact committed by a few sonnes
of Belial vpon the Levites wife, but much more, (which ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated
the fact beyond measure) for the <hi>Beniamites</hi> not
onely not punishing of it, but countenancing and defending
it. That the rest of the Tribes all combined as one man to
punish such an vnheard of impiety, and insolency, euen in
their brethren the <hi>Beniamites,</hi> no doubt, was both laudable
with men, and acceptable with God. Insomuch as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
with God,<note place="margin">Iud. 20.</note> had his directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; approbation. Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7346:23"/>
with God was good and requisite, and the only way
to speed well in their enterprize. Yet (which is to bee well
noted) they prospered not against <hi>Beniamin,</hi> till they had
throughly sanctified themselues. For, First their consulting
with God, was not whether they should goe vp against <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iamin,</hi>
or no; but hauing resolued on it among themselues,
they aske of GOD, which of the Tribes shall goe vp first?
Heere was yet no due sanctification of Israel to prepare
them to the battaile, and so they sped accordingly; for the
first day, the joynt Tribes lost twenty and two thousand
chosen men. A fearefull discomfiture. Well, they re-inforce
the battaile the second day, but withal goe a little more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to worke, then before. They weepe before the Lord vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
euen, which was a good peece of a publicke Fast. And
good reason they had to weepe, that had lost so many of the
thousands and worthies of Israel. But this as yet was but
a carnall weeping. Yet they aske counsel of the Lord, saying,
Shall I goe vp againe to battaile against the children of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iamin</hi>
my Brother? And the Lord said, Goe vp against him.
Yet for all this, Israel was foyled the second day, and lost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
18 thousand men. Why? Did not the Lord bid them
goe? Yes: For the Lord would be avenged on the obstinate
<hi>Beniamites.</hi> How then came the Tribes to be beaten againe?
Surely as yet they had not duely sanctified themselues. So
that, though the Lord bade them goe, yet, because they had
not sanctified themselues, the Lord as yet makes them no
promise of good successe. But vpon this second disaster,
then all the children of Israel, and all the people went vp, &amp;
came into the House of God, and wept, and sate there before
the Lord; and fasted that day vntill euen, and offered burnt
offerings, and peace offerings before the Lord. This is to the
purpose indeed. Heere is a second Faste, not onely publicke,
but generall, of all the children of Israel, and all the people, of
all ages, and sexes, and not onely the sword-men, and men of
warre. They come to the House of God, they weep, they
faste till euen, yea they offer burnt offerings, and peace offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.
All which together was a due and orderly sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7346:24"/>
of <hi>Israel,</hi> when to their weeping and fasting they added
burnt offerings, and peace offerings, whereby they made
their attonement and peace with God, for all their own sins.
Well, hauing thus sanctified themselues, what followeth?
They withall aske counsell of the Lord, whether they should
goe vp againe, against <hi>Beniamin,</hi> or surcease. Still it was
<hi>Israels</hi> constant course to aske counsell of the Lord in all
their enterprizes, to take their God-speed with them. And
now the Lord not onely bids them goe, but giueth them his
expresse promise to deliuer <hi>Beniamin</hi> into their handes,
which hee did not before. It is not enough to aske coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of God, but to obtaine his fauour and promise for good
speed in our vndertakings. And we are sure of his blessing
vpon vs, if first our enterprize be just &amp; warrantable, as this
of <hi>Israels</hi> was: and if withall it bee vndertaken with a good
conscience, seeking therein the glory of God principally, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
first humbled our selues before him, consulted the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
of his Word, offered him burnt offerings and peace
offerings, by renewing our faith and repentance, to bee at
peace with God. All this done, we haue God on our side,
his blessing and Promise attends our Enterprizes. Now
<hi>Israel</hi> being first throughly sanctified, goe on, and prosper in
the execution of Iustice vpon their refractary and too too
audaciously insolently impious Brethren, as wee see in the
rest of the Chapter.</p>
            <p>Would <hi>Israel</hi> then proceed well, and prosper in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of Iustice vpon those that trouble <hi>Israel? Israel</hi>
must bee sanctified first from her owne sinnes by fasting and
prayer, by faith, and repentance, by consulting with GOD,
by seeking his glory in all. Then <hi>Israel,</hi> goe on, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper;
the day is thine. Otherwise, <hi>Israel</hi> doth but puzzle
and perplexe her selfe with sollicitous, industrious, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>successefull
vndertakings. Euen obstinate <hi>Beniamin</hi> gets
the better of his better Brethren, seeking his reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
before they were duely sanctified to take a iust revenge.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Israel,</hi> thou fastest, thou prayest, thou weepest, thou
lamentest thy vnhappy successes at home and abroad; thou
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7346:24"/>
wouldest faine haue cured the maine cause (as thou imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest)
and haue procured thine owne peace and contentment.
But thou hast laboured in vaine; thy best purposes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendments
for <hi>Israels</hi> good haue beene frustrate. But ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the cause of all this. Hast thou beene sufficiently
sanctified, when thine Elders were assembled? Yes, you pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
you mourned, you desired at least a solemne fast for your
good speed. But did you therein seeke Gods glory first? Yes.
But did you offer your peace offerings, seeking your peace
with God in the purgation of your own sinnes, euen the sins
which not a little trouble <hi>Israel?</hi> What bee those? In speciall
Sacriledge and Simony, the great corrupters of Church and
Religion. The one hath swept away the maintenance from
Ministers: the other hath turned Ministers into Marchants:
and both together cause prophecyings to faile, the people to
perish, and Idolatry to spread it selfe. The authors and actors
of these, are <hi>Israels Achans,</hi> enough to alienate God from his
people. But you were about good Lawes to cure their mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
so far as the iniquity of the times would suffer; by resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
at least some part of the long detained portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Tithes,
Gods own inheritance, which might be some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petent pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to maintaine a painefull Minister: &amp; by restraining (if

either honest men to purchase the Church with mony,
or to permit theeues &amp; robbers to possesse all, entering into
the sheepfold another way. This you aymed at. And why did
it not succeed well? It was among other things thought of.
What if it had bin not only thought of, but concluded &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted,
not among, but before all other things? <hi>Dimidium fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti

And, <hi>Dii caeptis aspirate meis,</hi> &amp;c. should not Israel much

               </gap>ruse, notwithstanding her present extremity?
Yea, hath it not beene the ancient customes of Parliaments
in <hi>England,</hi> euer to begin not onely to treate, but to conclude
of, and settle the state of Religion, before matters of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicke
came to be handled? If wee revolue the Annales of

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of the present resplendent light of Israel, we shal find
therein such noble steps of piety towards God in this kinde,
as may make our Israel to blush, if it doe not kindle an emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
zeale of imitation in a parallel at the least. Let me for
the purpose heere insert the words of that precious Bishop
<hi>Iewell.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Defence of the Apology, Part. 6. chap. 2. Divis. 1. pag. 5 22. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced 1611.</note> Neither is it (saith hee) so strange a matter to see Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
matters debated in Parliament. Reade the Lawes
of King <hi>Inas,</hi> King <hi>Alfred,</hi> King <hi>Edward,</hi> King <hi>Athelstane,</hi>
King <hi>Edmund,</hi> King <hi>Edgar,</hi> King <hi>Canute;</hi> and yee shall find
that our godly forefathers the Princes &amp; Peeres of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme,
neuer vouchsafed to entreate of matters of Peace, or
warre, or otherwise, touching the common state, before all
controversies of Religion, and causes Ecclesiasticall had bin
concluded. King <hi>Canute</hi> in his Parliament holden at <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
vpon <hi>Christmas</hi> day, after sundry lawes &amp; orders made,
touching the Faith, the keeping of holy-dayes, publick pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
learning of the Lords Prayer, Receiuing the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thrice in the yeare, the manner and forme of Baptisme,
Fasting, and other matters of Religion; in the end thereof
saith thus: <hi>Iam sequitur Institutio legum saecularium.</hi> Now
followeth an order for Temporall Lawes.</p>
            <p>Thus wee see (saith the good Bishop) that the godly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
Princes in olde times thought it their duety before
all other affaires of the Common-weale, first to determine
matters of Religion, and that euen by the Parliaments of this
Realme.</p>
            <p>Such were the auncient Princes and Elders of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in times past. Their care of Religion in the first place
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7346:25"/>
in their Parliaments, was the onely way to bring on the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
successe for their Civill affaires. Wherein also the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Prelates furthered all good Acts by their counsel, when
required, although they had not negatiue voyces in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;<note place="margin">Part. 3. within two leaues of the end.</note>
as D <hi>Iewell</hi> in the foresaid place, and also Bishop <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
in his booke of Christian subjection, and Antichristian
Rebellion, doe plainely show; the Parliaments of this Land
hauing euer had this power as well in matters of Religion, as
of ciuill Policy, to establish good and wholesome Lawes for
both. Not that our Parliaments haue power to make new
Articles of the Faith, to establish what Religion they please;
but it is in their power, yea and their duty too, taking the
Word of God for their guide and rule, to establish the true
Religion taught therein, and to abolish all false Religions co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
thereunto. Where then should a Parliament begin but
with God, but with Religion, if euer they looke that GOD
should giue a happy successe to their ciuill affaires therein?
Especially the Parliaments of these our times, wherein the
cloudes of <hi>Pelagian</hi> heresie, mounting to the toppe of mans
aery imagination, by casting a false shaddow vpon the pure
doctrines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> deriued vnto vs from
the Fountaines of Scripture, by the Conduits of the prime
Reformers of Religion, and continued vnto vs euer since by
the vninterrupted pipes of the most learned and illustrious
Martyrs, Prelates, and Doctours of our Church, would bring
our Meridian light of the Gospell, to a twylight, by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingling
with it the <hi>Egyptian</hi> fogs of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
So that if our Parliaments would repaire the ruinated Edifice
of the Republicke, let them begin to make good, and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
the maine pillars and Foundation whereon it standeth,
and that is, Gods Temple, Religion, which through vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
Pioners is shrewdly shaken, who goe about to erect
the towre of <hi>Babel</hi> instead thereof. In the Name of GOD
therefore (pardon by boldnesse: some must speake out, else
the stones would cry; yet I take not vpon mee to teach the
Elders of Israel; They can best judge of what I say; and the
Lord giue them vnderstanding in al things) whensoeuer the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7346:26"/>
Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> shall meet againe in Parliament, (and I trust
God will put it into the heart of our <hi>Ioshua</hi> in due time to
summon a Parliament for the glory of God, and the good of
Israel) I trust to see both <hi>Ioshua</hi> and the Elders of Israel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in one in the first place to establish the Religion of
<hi>Christ,</hi> so long and happily hitherto avowed and maintained
in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The establishment whereof
necessarily dependeth vpon the abolishment of two maine
troublers of Israel, to wit, Antichristian Idolatry, and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian</hi>
heresie. While these two stand, neuer let Israel
looke for any good. To omit many godly Kings of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
as <hi>Iehosnaphat, Ezechiah, Iosiah,</hi> who destroying Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
prospered: remarkeable is the example of <hi>Asa,</hi> who in
rooting out of Idolatry,<note place="margin">2. Chron. 15. &amp; 16.</note> spared not his owne Mother <hi>Maa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chah,</hi>
remouing her from being Queene, because shee had
made an Idole in a groue, and <hi>Asa</hi> cut downe her Idole, and
stamped it, and burnt it. Insomuch as King <hi>Asa</hi> prospered in
warre, and his Land had peace to the 35 yeare of his raigne,
vntill he made a league with the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> not relying
on the Lord, and being depraued by <hi>Hanani</hi> the <hi>Seer,</hi> hee put
him in prison, and oppressed some of the people. Againe, so
long as <hi>Arminian</hi> bookes are vnpurged, and the Trueth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priviledged
to passe abroad, your Parliaments O Israel, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
prosper, To the repurgation of these, if you adde out
of euery Impropriation a sufficient maintenance to the
Ministery, if you castigate Simony (if possible) by some wise
&amp; godly restrictions better executed; if with these reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
you conclude your first Session of Parliament, without
any mixture of your owne ciuill matters, all other grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
shall fall <hi>mole sua,</hi> as the wals of <hi>Iericho</hi> at the voyce of
the rammes hornes: Our <hi>Ioshua</hi> shall be honoured with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidiary
streames of loue &amp; duty, flowing from the hearts of
the best subiects in the World, out of whose oary bowels
the King of <hi>England</hi> may dig richer Mettalls, then the King
of <hi>Spaine</hi> can out of all his <hi>Indies.</hi> The King of <hi>Englands</hi>
Subiects will for loue sweat his Maiesty more golde, then
all the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> poore slaues can for feare digge
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7346:26"/>
out of the bowels of their senseles mother-earth: this done,
I say, what can be reciprocally desired either of the Subjects
by the King, or of the King by his Subjects, that shall not
haue a full confluence, each striving to satisfie other with
all wished contentments? Gods cause being first acquitted,
and our Mother-Church of <hi>England</hi> asserted to her owne
auncient Catholicke Tenants, then <hi>Ioshua</hi> and the Elders, and
all <hi>Israel</hi> with them shall from their celestiall Father, and
their spirituall Mother receiue such a blessing, as shall
bee admired of all their friendes, envied of all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>And you Lady <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> the beloued City, the
darling <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> when you send your Agent-Burgesses
to joyne with <hi>Israels</hi> great assembly, as you looke to haue a
part in the blessing thereof. Be perswaded to sanctifie your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and reforme your <hi>City-Achans.</hi> Search them out;
you need not lanthornes for it. Your loue and liberality to
the Gospell, and to the Ministery thereof, both at home and
abroad, cannot be paraleld by any Church in any age. Onely
your <hi>Achans,</hi> as so many cloudes, eclipse the glory, and
(otherwise) the vnstained beauty thereof. A little leauen
(yee know) leaveneth the whole lumpe. Purge it out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that yee may be altogether a new lumpe. This we hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
desire, even your perfection.</p>
            <p>Now then O <hi>Israel,</hi> you haue had your fast, yee are wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yee are sanctified, yee are justified from your owne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
sinnes by your faith testified by your repentance, and
the trueth of your repentance testified by your reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
now you are cleare and cleane, but not all. In the next
place, yee are to finde out the <hi>Achans,</hi> that trouble <hi>Israel,</hi>
least yee bee all wrapped in <hi>Achans</hi> sinne. So did <hi>Ioshua</hi>
and the Elders of <hi>Israel;</hi> after their owne humiliation, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their sanctification of the people, the very next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
early they goe about to finde out the Troubler of
<hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First note <hi>Ioshua's</hi> diligence and vigilancie with the
Elders and people of <hi>Israel</hi> to execute justice. They rose
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7346:27"/>
early in the morning. And good reason. Delay is dangerous
in such cases; it might haue hastened many bad consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
for now the newly fleshed <hi>Canaanites</hi> might haue
wonne time to confederate, and bande against <hi>Israel,</hi> while
Gods displeasure was not remoued. Besides, delay and
neglect in doing justice brings the Iudges within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of Accessaries.</p>
            <p>For as hee that prevents not a sinne in another when hee
may, commits it: so hee that punisheth it not, when hee
may and ought, defends it, and makes it more his own. But
prudent and provident <hi>Ioshua,</hi> with the Elders of <hi>Israel,</hi>
and the people, prevent the daunger of delay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they rise early
in the morning.</p>
            <p>But how doe they goe about the scruting to finde out
the troubler of <hi>Israel? Achan</hi> with his Babylonish gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and wedges, were lurking in the Tent, among the
thousands of <hi>Israel.</hi> Hee had conveyed his Sacriledge and
theft so cleanly, by his dissimulation, as no man was privy
to it, to accuse him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who then shall finde him out? yes,
the Lord takes this taske vpon him. And where the Lord
makes the search,<note place="margin">Psal. 44. 20. 1.</note> what place for lurking? <hi>If wee haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forgotten
the name of our God, and holden vp our hands to any
strange God. Shall not God search this out? for hee knoweth
the secrets of the heart,</hi> saith <hi>David.</hi> But by what meanes
doth God search out <hi>Achan?</hi> By a strange and admirable
meanes, even by lot, a thing of it selfe of a casuall and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent
nature, yet which the all disposing God canne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
to produce the most certaine effects of his owne
will.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 10.</note> Thus by lot hee elected <hi>Saul</hi> for King, among all the
Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> from among all the families of <hi>Beniamin,</hi>
after that <hi>Samuel</hi> had already by Gods assignement an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
him.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 14.</note> Thus by lot was <hi>Ionathan, Sauls</hi> son, found
out, for but tasting a little honey. Yea God canne make
the fowles of the ayre to reveale the most hidden
sinne.</p>
            <p>Well, <hi>Ioshua</hi> following the Lords direction, findes
out <hi>Achan</hi> by lot. This done, note <hi>Ioshuah's</hi> behauiour to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7346:27"/>
               <hi>Achan</hi> vers. 19. <hi>My Sonne, giue I pray thee, glory to the Lord
God of Israel, and make confession vnto him, and tell me now,
what thou hast done, hide it not from mee. Ioshua</hi> heere like a
tender-hearted Father vseth a Fatherly compellation to
<hi>Achan, My Sonne.</hi> Hee breakes not out into suddaine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and passion, now to adde more terrour to <hi>Achans</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
or to shew the greatnes of his owne authority. For
what neede authority and power bee armed with impotent
hasty passion? And it is the gentle Sun-beame, not the rough
winde, that causeth the offender to lay aside the cloake of
dissimulation. It is the goates milke of mild mercy, not the
hard stroake of the hammer, that dissolues the adamantine
heart. It is the warme fire of louing intreaty, not the frost of
a frowning brow, that causeth the ycie obdurate conscience
to melt, &amp; drop into teares. It was the soft still voyce, not
the whirlewind, &amp; earth-quake, that caused <hi>Elias</hi> to couer
his face and his mouth. <hi>My son,</hi> was the seemeliest rack for
<hi>Ioshua</hi> to vse, whereby gently to draw confession from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan.</hi>
For <hi>Ioshua</hi> was <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> the Father of <hi>Israel</hi> Gods
people, the affection whereof he puts not off, while now he
puts on the office of Iudge. <hi>Mercy and truth preserue the
King</hi> (saith <hi>Salomon) and his throne is vpholden by mercy:</hi>
mercy &amp; truth are the two supporters of the Kings Armes.
The herb <hi>Basil</hi> (a proper embleme for a Prince) ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly stroakt
on the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, yeelds a pleasa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t smel: but crusht vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, vnsavory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Son,</hi> saith <hi>Ioshua.</hi> What then? <hi>Giue, I pray thee, glory to
the Lord God of Israel, and make confession vnto him,</hi> &amp;c. The
first thing that <hi>Ioshua</hi> seekes, is the <hi>glory of the Lord God of
Israel.</hi> How? By <hi>Achans</hi> confession. How should that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
to Gods glory? Yes: three wayes in <hi>Achan:</hi> first, by
shewing the Lord to bee just and true in finding him out
thus miraculously by lot; while <hi>Achan</hi> confessed himselfe
to bee the man thus divinely pointed out. Secondly, by a
faithfull, humble, and penitent confession of his sinne against
God and his people, to the end, God might glorify his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in pardoning his soule, though his justice in punishing
his body. Thirdly, that Gods act in <hi>Israels</hi> discomfiture
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7346:28"/>
might appeare to all the world to be vpon iust cause.</p>
            <p>Nor doth <hi>Ioshua</hi> heere remit <hi>Achan</hi> to make his private
auricular confession to the Priest. For so <hi>Achans</hi> sinne had
never come to light; but had gone close mantled vnder the
stole and seale of confession. So had God lost his glory two
wayes: First by <hi>Achans</hi> private confession, in stead of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick:
Secondly, by taking his absolution from a Priest, which
none can giue, but God only. Therefore, saith <hi>Ioshua, Giue
glory to the Lord God of Israel, &amp; make confession vnto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heere note, that a publicke sinne must haue a publicke
confession to Gods glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiection.</hi> But <hi>Achans</hi> sin was private.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Though it were privately committed, yet by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
publikely punished by the diuine hand, God had now
branded it for a publick sin. Thus did God make <hi>Davids</hi> sin
publick by an exemplary punishment, which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
privately.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 12.</note> And therefore to glorifie God in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
confession of it, how many penitentiall Psalmes did
<hi>David</hi> pen and leaue recorded, as monuments of his owne
frailty, and Gods mercy.</p>
            <p>Well: vpon <hi>Ioshua's</hi> fatherly exhortation, <hi>Achan</hi> maketh
confession of all, <hi>v.</hi> 20. 21. This was the way for <hi>Achan</hi> to
finde mercy with the Lord, even in the midst of Iustice.</p>
            <p>Vpon <hi>Achans</hi> confession,<note place="margin">V. 22. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Ioshua</hi> presently sends, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all to be true, he and all <hi>Israel</hi> speed them to the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for the making vp of <hi>Israels</hi> breach againe. Note here,
though <hi>Ioshua</hi> tendred him as a father the sonne, yet this
his affection to <hi>Achan</hi> did not make <hi>Ioshua</hi> to forget he was
a Iudge, to doe justice, in so weighty a cause, that so highly
concerned Gods glory, and <hi>Israels</hi> good; yea although <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi>
were one of the Tribe-royall, namely of <hi>Iuda,</hi> a great
Prince in <hi>Israel,</hi> yet impartiall justice must proceed against
him, for the expiation of that sin, which troubled <hi>Israel:</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as <hi>Ioshua</hi> saith vnto him: <hi>Why hast thou troubled vs.
The Lord shall trouble thee this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, note the severity of Iustice in the punishment
of <hi>Achans</hi> sin; not onely himselfe, but his sonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7346:28"/>
his oxen and Asses, his sheepe and tent and all that hee
had,<note place="margin">Vers. 15.</note> were by the Commaundement of the Lord stoned with
stones by all Israel, &amp; burned with fire in the valey of <hi>Achor;</hi>
so called vpon that occasion <hi>in perpetuam rei memoriam.</hi> The
valley of trouble; because he had troubled Israel. Nor may
this peece of justice seme vnjust.<note place="margin">Vers. 16.</note> First, because god co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it. And shall not the judge of all the world do right? His
iudgments are often secret, but neuer vniust. Yea reason
makes for the approuing of it. For he that by his sin trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
all Israel, and brought them in danger of destruction,
did hee not justly pull distruction vpon himselfe, and his
whole house, to be executed by all Israel? Nor goeth this
example alone. The like we see executed vpon <hi>Chorah</hi> and
his company <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. Here an end then of <hi>Achan</hi> and his
sinne.</p>
            <p>What followes? A happy successe for Israel. For, vers. 26.
No sooner was the heape of stones raised ouer <hi>Achan,</hi> but
Gods fauour like the Sun from vnder a thick cloud breaks
forth afresh to Israels comfort. <hi>So</hi> (sayth the Text) <hi>the Lord
turne à fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the feircenesse of his anger.</hi> And for proofe hereof,
ye haue Israels victory ouer <hi>Ai.</hi> Chap. 8. And that by a strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme
of the Lords owne deuising, to take away from the
<hi>Chanaanites</hi> all conceipt, that Israel fled away at the first for
feare, but rather in pollicy to intice them out afterwards, and
soe vtterly with more rage to destroy them: as the reader
may obserue by Israels second flying of purpose to inclose
the <hi>Aians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence note first, that stratagemmes in warre are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
as to fly for aduantage, to lye in ambush and the like;
yet not to lye for aduantage. Faith once made must be kept
with the <hi>Chanaanites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iosh. 9.</note> as <hi>Ioshua</hi> did with the <hi>Gibeonites;</hi>
though they were iustly made <hi>Israels</hi> slaues and drudges, for
their false dealing, pretending to come from a far countrey
shewing their mouldy breade and old shoes, as Papists make
oste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tation of their mouldy pretended antiquity. So that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the league with the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> stood firme (though with
qualification as is noted) because both it was done of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7346:29"/>
(the Lord not being foreconsulted) a dangerous and
disgracefull thing for Israel, to enter into leagues, and not
aske counsell of the Lord) and also it was done not by <hi>Ioshua</hi>
alone but all the Princes and Elders of Israel with him rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
it,<note place="margin">Iosh. 9. 15.</note> with common consent and oath. And it was the
more firme, because they becomming Israels seruants, were
thereby brought of necessity to be of Israels Religion.</p>
            <p>Againe, note from the Lords stratageme for Israels vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
that when Israel pleaseth the Lord, hee not onely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
them power, but prudence also and godly pollicy to
deale with, and ouercome their enimies. It is a bad signe, and
bodes little good to Israel, when Israel manageth not their
affaires by good counsell. It was one of the curses of <hi>Elies</hi>
house, that there should not be an old man in it. But Israel is
euer in good state, while guided by graue counsell. It is a
token of Gods blessing vpon Israel: otherwise of a curse:
For, <hi>Quos perdere vult Deus, hos prius dementat.</hi> And a woe
is to that land, whose Rulers are children as the wise man

            <p>In a word, Israel now prospereth, whithersoeuer their
armies march; now, that <hi>Achans</hi> sin, which troubled Israel,
is purged out: Now that the Babylonish garment, with the
reliques of <hi>Canaanitish</hi> idolatry is purged with fire, as <hi>Rome</hi>
was wont to purge Israels Saints &amp; Martyrs: Now, that the
golden wedge of sacriledge is expiated by a kind of restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Now, doth God goe forth with Israels armies: Now
may Israel say boldly, <hi>Exurgat Deus, dissipentur inimici,</hi>
stamping it not in their coyne, but in their colours: Now,
lesse Nauies by Sea, lesse Armies by land shall be terrible to
the enimie, which before returned home in their derision.
Now shall one of Israel chase a thousand, and two put ten
thousand to flight: For their Rocke is not as our Rocke, euen
our enimies themselues being iudges.<note place="margin">Deut. 32.</note>

            <p>Thus haue we seene Israels fast, and Israels fact. Israels
discomfiture moued <hi>Ioshua</hi> and the Elders of Israel to a
fast: their fast so piously performed, moued the Lord to stir
them vp to remoue the cause of Israels trouble: the cause

being remoued, made Israel prosperous in all their enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes.
Thus Israel doe, thus Israel haue; which the God of
Israel grant to his Israel, for the intercession of Israels Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
at Gods right hand, euen Iesus Christ, to whom
with the Father, and their Spirit, three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and one euerliuing God be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of Israel, as most due, al ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
