            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Brief Answer to F. Bugg's Brief Reply to the
Considerations Humbly Offered by the People call'd
Quakers, Relating to the Bill for Restraining the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness
of the Press.</head>
            <p>IT has been the known Practice of the said <hi>F. B.</hi> of late Years, not
only to Buisy himself to Interrupt our Applications to the Parliament,
by his Abusive Pamphlets, but now strives to have us debarred of the
Liberty of the Press, that he may more easily Misrepresent our Christian
Profession, and Calumniate us without Detection, as appears in his said
pretended <hi>Reply;</hi> and therefore the more Necessity that we (the said Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
should not be debarred of the Press for our Just Defence, according
to Holy Scripture, that we may not be Defamed (in our Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation)
as <hi>Seditious</hi> or <hi>Blasphemous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to his usual Method, he begins with a perverted Quotation
upon our Considerations, thus, <hi>viz. [Yet,</hi> say they, <hi>to Limit the Press, we
conceive Vnsafe.]</hi> Instead of <hi>[to Limit Religious Books to a License, &amp;c.]</hi> Thus
he stumbles at the Threshold, and Imposes on the Reader. And as false
it is, <hi>That the Quakers are Guilty of Printing and Publishing Seditious and
Scandalous Pamphlets;</hi> and as unjustly Inferred, that <hi>therefore <hi>a Restraint
on them they think Vnsafe.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Of Kingly Government, about Earthly Kings, &amp;c.</hi> he gives Curtailed
and Broken Quotations, but not the Dates of <hi>the several Papers,</hi> he mentions,
which (however Perverted) we take the General Import thereof to mean,
<hi>That our Lord Jesus Christ is King</hi> over true Christians Consciences, and
his own Spiritual Kingdom (which is not of this World) and not Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or Persecuting Kings, as are mention'd.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Of Parliaments;</hi> We find not <hi>F. Howgill</hi> fairly Quoted, but grossly
Abused, by leaving out what he saith for the <hi>good Intention of Parliaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is it reasonable we should Answer for the Opinion of the <hi>Council of
Officers</hi> (against the House of Lords) in the Common-wealths days, or what
any one told them thereof?<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Truth and Innocency, <hi>pag.</hi> 64.</note> Or is it a good Argument, that because
the Corruption and Bad Lives of Earthly Kings and Governments, as also
their Ends, are upon Record both in History and Sacred Writ, that therefore all
such History and Writings (or Citations out of them) are Seditious? Or because
some have Writ against the <hi>Oppression of former Persecuting Kings and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi>
were it a good Inference that therefore the <hi>Quakers</hi> ought not
to have Liberty of the Press to Defend their Religious Perswasion, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Profession or Innocency? when they have not the least Design of
<hi>Sedition</hi> or <hi>Scandal</hi> against the Civil Government, or Constitution of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments;
tho' to tell of <hi>Respect of Persons, and not Equality in Chosing
Members,</hi> be Quoted as <hi>Seditious,</hi> yet it is no new thing; Undue and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Elections not unknown to Parliaments, who have Endeavoured to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the same.</p>

3. <hi>Of the Holy Trinity;</hi> Thereby being meant, that, <hi>in the Deity,</hi> there
are <hi>Three Bearing Witness in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit,</hi>
i. e. <hi>the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,</hi> which are One God Blessed
for ever, the Scripture Terms thereof <hi>are not Questioned,</hi> but owned by
the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Pilgrim, <hi>p.</hi> 45, 46.</note> what Disputes or Reflections soever have
been (about <hi>Vnscriptural Terms and Distinctions</hi>) they were never by
any of us applied or intended against the <hi>Blessed Deity</hi> or <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son,</hi> or <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Of Christ our Blessed Lord,</hi> the <hi>Eternal Son, or Word of God,</hi> his Body
that Dyed, is called in Scripture <hi>the Body of Jesus;</hi> and 'tis said he Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
and <hi>was put to Death in the Flesh,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 18. Not in his Divine
Nature, for that never Dyed. This was <hi>W. P</hi>'s. Sense,<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Truth and Innocency,</hi> p. 71, 72. And D. P<hi>'s. Vindic. Verit.</hi> p. 89, to 110.</note> That the True
Ministers do not Preach Christ without <hi>Only,</hi> as he is in Heaven (and
Glory) above, but also as he is in <hi>Men's Hearts,</hi> is an Undeniable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Doctrine. The Word <hi>Only</hi> being omitted (in one Edition of <hi>William
Smith</hi>'s Primmar) is made an Accusation against us (as if <hi>we denied Jesus
to be Christ)</hi> tho' the same Word <hi>Only</hi> be inserted in his Works in the
same place. Thus unfair is this Adversary.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Concerning the Holy Scriptures. We Hope</hi> our preferring Christ the
<hi>Word,</hi> and his <hi>Spirit</hi> to the <hi>Letter of the Scripture,</hi> and yet owning <hi>the
Holy Scriptures to be given by Divine Inspiration,</hi> and preferring them before
all other Books, may not be Offensive, or render us Uncapable of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Press, or of our Consciences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If one should Argue thus against us,</hi> Some of your Antient Friends Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
are Perverted and Misconstrued, <hi>(and thereby made Offensive)</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you must Write no more: <hi>Or,</hi> some of you have spoken something amiss, or
that Offends Vs, therefore you must never speak more. <hi>Would this be fairly
Argued? Yet we don't see our Adversary make better Work on't against
Us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under the Title of <hi>the Holy Scriptures, F. B.</hi> sets, <hi>the Letter is Death-<hi>Beastly
Wares,</hi>
               </hi> &amp;c. as if the <hi>Quakers</hi> so Term the Holy Scriptures <hi>Beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Wares</hi> (Oh! Horrible); this has been often Charged upon him, and
Refuted as a gross Slander and Forgery, and not found applied to the
Scriptures in his own Quotation; tho' he persists repeating the same, and
in such foul Aspersions, as, <hi>that the Quakers Vilify the Scripture, Blaspheme
the Blessed Trinity, Reproach Christ's Ministers.</hi> (But, <hi>F. B.</hi> didst thou so,
when a <hi>Quaker</hi> 25 years?) <hi>Boldly in Print tell the World, that such as turn
from them, and Imbrace the Christian Faith, are the worst of Apostates, worse
than</hi> Francis Spira <hi>and</hi> Julian <hi>the Apostate.</hi> Quoting <hi>John Whiting's</hi> Book,
<hi>[Judas and the Chief Priests,] Preface and p.</hi> 5, 6. wherein <hi>F. B.</hi> Notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
Wrongs both the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and <hi>J. W.</hi> also, who never
told the World so. And to his Charging the said <hi>J. W.</hi> with <hi>false Stories
of G. Keith; J. W.</hi> saith, he has several Certificates to prove the Truth of
what he related concerning <hi>G. K.</hi> in his Preface, under the Hands of such
as were Witnesses of the same, ready to Produce as Occasion may offer.</p>
            <p>His Story <hi>by the Fire side</hi> against <hi>Edward Dikes,</hi> Junior, of <hi>Bury St. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,</hi>
and his Constructions on the Words <hi>We</hi> and <hi>You,</hi> are so Ridiculous
that it is not worth insisting on. He again Clamours out <hi>their Blasphemies</hi>
(against the <hi>Quakers</hi>) upon a Passage Aledged against our Deceased Friend
<hi>Edward Burroughs,</hi> terming him as <hi>Horrible an Impostor</hi> as <hi>Mahomet,</hi> about
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38991:3"/>
               <hi>the Sufferings of the People of God; which yet</hi> (he saith) <hi>he could never find
any of them so Defend;</hi> tho' the same be fully Answered and Explain'd in
<hi>Vind. Verit.</hi> p. 206. <hi>F. B</hi>'s. Story of <hi>G. F. hiring Two Jews for 80 l.</hi> we
reject as his own Forgery.</p>
            <p>But no better Treatment, or Manner of Answering, do we expect
from a Mercinary Scribbler, than Reiterated <hi>Perversion, Forgery,</hi> Curtalizing
and Confounding Quotations, whereby the Best of People and Books have
been grosly Misrepresented. Therefore the more Need of the Liberty of
the Press for Just Vindication. Passing by several other Abuses and Falshoods,
