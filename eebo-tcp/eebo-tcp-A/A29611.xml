            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Sir <hi>St. JOHN BRODRICK</hi>'s VINDICATION OF HIMSELF, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I AM very ſorry for the Occaſion that is given me of appearing in Print at this time: I know Myſelf ſo unqualified for the Writing what muſt undergo every Man's Cenſure, that I ſhould rather have ventured to rely on the Reputation I have with thoſe to whom I am known, and the Charity of Strangers, againſt <hi>All</hi> the Aſperſions that <hi>are</hi> or <hi>can</hi> be caſt on me by Sir <hi>R. B.</hi> then have undertaken the Task of a Publick Vindication, did not the Title-page of his Book carry the Sacred Name of <hi>Authority</hi> in it, under which he would ſhelter himſelf, in the publiſhing as ſevere a Charge againſt me, as was ever laid on Man.</p>
            <p>The unuſualneſs of <hi>Licenſing</hi> Perſonal Reflections of one private Man upon another, may, 'tis to be feared, poſſeſs indifferent Men with a belief, that there is ſomething more in the Accuſation than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100382:3"/>
Railing; and therefore to be ſilent upon ſuch an Occaſion, could not be interpreted leſs than an owning myſelf guilty of what I am charged with: This has put me under a neceſſity of making the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſhort Defence.</p>
            <p>To the doing my ſelf Juſtice in this Affair, it will be neceſſary in the firſt place, to give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome Account of my Propoſal, the occaſion of it, and what ſteps I made in it; and then ſhortly anſwer what is perſonal, and reflects upon myſelf onely.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, that in the former of theſe I ſhall have ſome difficulty to ſtruggle with; for if as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt a Proceeding as ever Man made, ſhall, by Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, be called <hi>Inſolence beyond imagination,</hi> I know not what a Defence of myſelf in that Proceeding, tho' never ſo modeſt, may be interpreted into. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſince my Reputation (as Sir <hi>R.</hi> ſays very truly of his, at leaſt ſince the Publiſhing of this Pamphlet, whatever it did before) lies at ſtake; and ſince my Propoſal, which was at firſt put into better hands, is now fallen ſo low as Sir <hi>R. B</hi>'s. and is by him ſent abroad, mangled, and with the harſheſt Reflections his Malice could ſuggeſt to him; I hope it cannot be looked upon as a breach of the Rules of Decency in me, to ſet it in its true light, and wipe off thoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſions he has endeavoured to caſt on it, and <hi>Me</hi> upon the Account of it.</p>
            <p>But I muſt acquaint the Reader, that, not having yet received any Anſwer to it, I ſhall avoid the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing about it, further then what Sir <hi>R</hi>'s. Reflections have made abſolutely neceſſary; in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100382:3"/>
hopes that I may yet be called upon, in a proper place, to juſtifie my ſelf and it; which I muſt uſe my utmoſt Endeavours to have an Opportunity of doing.</p>
            <p>About the middle of laſt <hi>June,</hi> being in the Court of Requeſts, ſeveral Gentlemen of <hi>Ireland</hi> came to me, and enquired, whether I deſigned to return to that Country? Upon my asking the reaſon of the Queſtion, I was anſwered, That a Gentleman<note place="margin">H. S. <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
               </note> had juſt then given an Intimation, that all the Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland</hi> were to be formed into Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And that the Lords Commit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es for the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> had deſired, that thoſe who were willing to enter into that Service, would repreſent to them ſuch Perſons as they looked upon to be fitteſt for Commands; And ſaid, They (being of <hi>Munſter</hi>) with my leave, would name me for one. I told them, I ſhould be very ready to undertake it, if His Majeſty thought fit to Employ me. This was the firſt Notice I had of any thing of this kind, and not one word farther paſſed between us. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in four or five days after, they delivered unto me the following Petition, Signed by above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Perſons, many of them Gentlemen of very good Eſtates in that Kingdom, deſiring me to purſue it in ſuch Methods as I thought moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>

After ſome little time his Grace told me, that he had acquainted His Majeſty with the Effect of the Petition, upon which His Majeſty was pleaſed to ſay, <hi>That he did not intend to raiſe any new Forces yet, but that whenever he did, this ſhould be taken into Conſideration.</hi> His Grace was pleaſed further to promiſe me, That, whenever he heard His Majeſty deſigned to add to his Forces, he would put him in mind of this Petition: And to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it was left with his Grace, and reſted in his hands for about four Months, till the time that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-General <hi>Trelawney</hi> went for <hi>Plymouth.</hi>

            <p>I think I need not put the Reader in mind that theſe were Propoſals <hi>onely;</hi> and therefore if any thing, againſt which there was a reaſonable Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, were mentioned in them, that might eaſily
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100382:8"/>
be Corrected or Altered, as His Majeſty ſhould think fit. But theſe being the onely Ones of the kind that ever I heard of, and ſeeming to obviate the great Objection (<hi>viz.</hi> want of preſent Money) by maintaining double the number of Forces at ſingle Pay; (not to mention the Pledge which the Reward of the Souldiers depending on the Succeſs of their Arms, gave, of their hearty Service) I hoped, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, they might have met with a better Uſage than Sir <hi>R.</hi> has given them. But whatever the Fate of the Propoſals may be, I ſuppoſe the fore-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Account will fully clear me of the Inſolence I am charged with, <hi>Of providing myſelf Souldiers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King's Pleaſure was known; and ſetting the Heels above the Head.</hi> (An Inſolence indeed, and ſuch an one, as I muſt have owned Sir <hi>R.</hi> a very modeſt Man, for giving it no worſe a Name, if it had been true). And I cannot believe that it will be looked upon to be unreaſonable, that the Deben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of thoſe who run the Riſque of taking half their Pay in <hi>conquered</hi> Lands, ſhould have preference to Acts of meer Bounty, and voluntary Grants: And nothing elſe was, or could be intended by me (for more the King could not grant); and ſo I have often explained myſelf. I will add in the laſt place, That, whatever this <hi>conſidering Man</hi> thinks to the contrary, I do not doubt, in a very ſhort time, if His Majeſty ſhall ſo think fit, <hi>yet</hi> to raiſe a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who will carry Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skets: (Tho 'tis moſt plain my Propoſals for them, aim at Horſe or Dragoons, and I have not confined myſelf <hi>to ſuch onely,</hi> in the Foot-Service): But I muſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100382:8"/>
not be tyed up <hi>now</hi> to thoſe in and about <hi>London,</hi> (for that moſt of thoſe of the middle Rank, finding it too chargeable to remain hereabouts, have remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into cheaper Countries). And tho' it will be a matter of much more difficulty to do now, than when I undertook for it; if Sir <hi>R. B.</hi> doubts it, he, who has ſhewn the vehement bent of his Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to expoſe me, can't take a more effectual way of doing it, than by uſing that great Intereſt, which his Paper would poſſeſs the World with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief he has, to put me upon making the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That he may be the more hearty in it, I will undertake to remove, to the ſatisfaction of all reaſonable Men, the Objections, (which in a way <hi>ſo becoming a Gentleman, ſo peculiarly his own</hi>) he has made againſt my Perſon and Behaviour.</p>
            <p>He has charged me with <hi>tacitely providing myſelf with Souldiers, before the King's Pleaſure known,</hi> p. 20. And <hi>keeping thoſe Souldiers in Pay for Five Months, p.</hi> 19. This is an Accuſation indeed; and put me immediately upon turning to the 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. where I found myſelf directly within the words of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; but I took comfort when I conſidered that the Charge muſt be proved by Two Witneſſes, and thoſe <hi>Fide digni &amp; exceptione majores.</hi> I was ſure Sir <hi>R. B</hi>'s. Pamphlet could not be one of them. But tho' 'twould not amount to Treaſon, I had heard of a way, of turning that Offence into a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour: And that was laid very thick upon me; for I had not onely levied War, but did it with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mens Money, <hi>to the cheating of poor Widows</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100382:9"/>
               <hi>and Children: And by this Knavery of mine, luſty young Men that might, and probably would have gone over with the Army, were kept here.</hi> I ſhould be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſorry to hear any Man in <hi>England,</hi> but Sir <hi>R. B.</hi> reflect upon the part which I have acted, in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of the Brief-Money. I am ſure, that if thoſe excellent Perſons, who gave ſo bountifully to that Collection, intended, that the Money ſhould be diſtributed to thoſe whoſe Wants called for it moſt, without diſtinction of Age or Sex; I ſhall never receive a Reproof from them, for breach of Truſt in that Affair. I Appeal to all the poor Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Children, whoſe Diſtreſſes have driven them to ſeek Relief out of that Fund, whether I have not eſpouſed their Cauſe, more heartily than ever I did my own, in any inſtance whatſoever: I appeal to all the Commiſſioners who acted with me, whether I have not conſtantly attended there, to my Charge, and loſs of time; whether ever any Perſon came thither for Relief, with my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation, who has, upon the ſtricteſt ſcruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, from that time to this, proved an unfit Object of Charity. That ſome luſty young Men, <hi>of all Provinces indifferently,</hi> have partaken of that Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is undoubtedly true; and that they ought to do ſo, will be always my Opinion, till Sir <hi>R. B.</hi> makes it out, that 'tis fitting, that Gentlemen ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well deſcended, and whoſe Education has been too honeſt to ſuffer them to entertain a thought of living by Villany or Violence, muſt ſtarve here, or in a Camp, for want of means of ſupporting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But that ever any regard was had by me
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100382:9"/>
in the Diſtribution of that Money, to my Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals (made no longer ago than two Months ſince) or that I ever prevented any man's going over with the Army, upon that or any other Account, is a Calumny ſo black, that were it not ſenſeleſs enough to expoſe its Author to all mankind, I ſhould ſcarce be able to contain my ſelf in the Temper which I reſolve to carry through this Paper. I am, I confeſs, verily perſwaded, that ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons did wait in and about <hi>London,</hi> in hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing employed, upon the general belief that it would be ſo in time (it being looked upon to be ſo very much His Majeſty's Intereſt to do it) tho' the Charge of raiſing them could not be well born then, which, it is probable, they expected, the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſeveral of the Committee of the Honourable Houſe of Commons did frequently to thoſe of the Country expreſs their wonder that they were not employed. And 'twas commonly diſcourſed, that that Honourable Houſe would Addreſs to His Majeſty, that they might be formed into a Body. And I believe that many of thoſe Perſons, if there had been a publick Intimation given, that they muſt expect no Employments, would have betaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſome other way of living, and thereby the Brief have been eaſed: But how come I to have any ſhare in the blame of this? Eſpecially when I have it to ſay for my ſelf, and can prove it by the Teſtimony of Thouſands, that before the Army went, I ſpent my whole time in <hi>London,</hi> uſing my Intereſt with thoſe of my Acquaintance, and taking a Confidence (which I could have ſtarved ſooner,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100382:10"/>
than have done for my ſelf, or any one of my own Children) to ſollicit Perſons of Quality, to whom I had not the Honour of being known, in behalf of Gentlemen of that Country, to get them into the Army. I Appeal to my Lord <hi>Lumley</hi> (and heartily beg his Pardon for my Preſumption in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, as well as the doing what gives me the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this Appeal) how many Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he had under my Hand of Perſons, ſeveral of whom returned to me with Thanks for it, full of Acknowledgments to my Lord, not only for his Employing them, but for his Obliging way of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and the Generous Concern and Compaſſion he expreſſed for their Condition, which ſtopt not at bare words, but ſhewed it ſelf in large and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Contributions towards the mounting of them. I made it my buſineſs to place others under ſome of the <hi>French</hi> Officers, whom (and many others of that Nation ſetled in the Town where I live) I had formerly Opportunities of obliging, tho' ſome of theſe men were afterwards turned out again, for Reaſons not neceſſary to be here expreſſed. But theſe Inſtances, and many others that I could give, being ſome time ſince, I will add further, that, as lately as laſt <hi>September,</hi> I ſent away ſeveral Young Men, Sons of Tenants of mine, from my own Houſe, fitted out with all things, as far as my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or any Intereſt I could make, would ſupply them; to be ready at the Water-ſide to go off with the firſt Forces: And took care when Major-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Trelawney</hi> was at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> to give them, and others of my Relations in the Weſt Country, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100382:10"/>
of it, that they might take that Opportunity of joyning them, which they did; and one of them was, at the return of the Major-General, ſick of the Small-Pox (but carefully ſupplied and looked after by the Charity of Captain <hi>Luttrel</hi>) at <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi> This ſurely may be allowed an inſtance, that I do not keep Men to ſerve my own turn, to the hindrance of His Majeſty's Service: Theſe I might have pretended to have a Power over; and the Reader will, I ſuppoſe, obſerve the <hi>uſe</hi> I made of that Power.</p>
            <p>And here, having this occaſion, I cannot but take notice, that it is very hard, that the ſmall Fortune which I have in <hi>England,</hi> ſhould be looked upon with an Evil Eye; and Endeavours be uſed to prevent, my ſharing with my Fellow-ſufferers of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in His Majeſty's Bounty upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that; when I have, not onely a very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Family of my own, and the Additional load of Children and their Families that were Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and good Eſtates ſetled on them by me in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to maintain out of it, (beſides my being incumbred with Debts, which muſt encreaſe daily) but have always ſome of thoſe, who lie under the ſame Calamity, upon me; Whoſe wants being more preſſing than my own, I will not, I cannot deny their <hi>ſharing</hi> my Bread with me, while I have any to put into my own head.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:100382:11"/>I am charged with the <hi>Cheating the young Men,</hi> (as Sir <hi>R</hi> is pleaſed familiarly to call them) and the hindring the payment of the 15000 <hi>l.</hi> I will account to the <hi>young</hi> Men for the firſt, and the Gentry of <hi>Ireland</hi> for the ſecond; And not trouble the Reader with a Juſtification as to them, who are ſo far from accuſing me, that they know I want no Defence. But however, for fear of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my leſſer Propoſal, by graſping at the Power of a <hi>General,</hi> I will tell the Reader all that ever I heard or know concerning the matter of <hi>Cadets.</hi> And 'tis this; At the time that I delivered my Propoſals to my Lord Preſident, in which I offered in the name of ſeveral Gentlemen of <hi>Munſter,</hi> to accept of the Foot-ſervice, rather than be unemploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I mentioned to his Lordſhip, That if His Majeſty ſeemed enclined to entertain the Propoſal, but ſhould make it his choice, that the Regiment ſhould be Foot; He would give me leave to deſire, in order to the carrying over moſt of the <hi>Munſter</hi> Men together, where there were ſo many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of very good Quality, all of whom could not be Officers, and ſome would be unwilling to carry Muskets; That there might be a few added to each Company with double Pay, (which for One hundred would have amounted but to Twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five Shillings a day at the Pay we were to ſerve for) who, as the <hi>Cadets</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> might be ready to fill up any Vacancies by the loſs of Officers, in the ſame Regiment: That I would endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100382:11"/>
this; and I hoped it would be granted, if the Propoſal were accepted, was the utmoſt that I ever promiſed on this occaſion. And for the truth of this, I refer my ſelf to thoſe Gentlemen; not to mention the ſenceleſneſs of my promiſing there ſhould be <hi>Cadets,</hi> when I could pretend to no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of having a Regiment.</p>
            <p>I never ſaid that I had a better Pretence to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment<note place="margin">F. 20.</note> than others of <hi>Ireland</hi> here; But if I had not thought, that I might <hi>probably</hi> have been ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of doing Their Majeſties Service with it, I ſhould not in the Sixty-fourth Year of my Age, when the Reports of the Poſture of Affairs in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were very unpromiſing, have offered my ſelf to a Winter-Campaign, and upon Terms ſo much more eaſie than others ſerve for.</p>
            <p>'Twould be an Objection indeed to be beaten by<note place="margin">F. 21.</note> a Clergy-man, if true; not altogether upon the Account of the Cowardice of it (for I think I need not mind the Reader, that a worthy Gentleman of that Character, has very lately given ſuch proofs, that Courage is not peculiar to the Laity, as may make it neither a Reproach, or matter of wonder, to be out-done in <hi>Soldiery</hi> by one of that Coat) but that I ſhould have done any thing to deſerve it. Sir <hi>R. B.</hi> is no Clergy-man, ſo, I am ſure, 'twas none of he that did or <hi>will</hi>

               </gap> undertake it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the matter of fact being abſolutely falſe, I muſt deſire Sir <hi>R.</hi> to take the <hi>Scurrilous</hi> that goes before it, to himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:100382:12"/>But now I come to a very conſiderable Objection,<note place="margin">F. 20.</note> My being a Juſtice of the Peace and Deputy-Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant in the time of King <hi>James</hi> the Second, nay at the time of His preſent Majeſty's Arrival at <hi>Windſor.</hi> Of which I will give the following ſhort Account, referring the Reader to the Letter from his Grace <hi>the Duke of Norfolk,</hi> printed at the end of this Paper, for further ſatisfaction. During the life of my Brother Sir <hi>Alan Brodrick,</hi> my Name was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the Commiſſion of the Peace, but I never would act, we both living in the ſame Town, ſo that there was no need of it, and thereupon my Name was for ſome time omitted. He dying ſome years before the Death of the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, upon the Application of all the Gentlemen then upon the Bench, <hi>without my Privity;</hi> I was not onely put again into Commiſſion, but the Oath of a Juſtice was tendred me, before I knew of my being ſo. So I continued, with Company that I am very proud of, till the time that the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions went about; Immediately after which, I, with that Company, was left out. My Anſwers to thoſe Queſtions will juſtifie me, That I neither was a Tool to ſerve a Turn in thoſe times, nor courted my Intereſt to the Proſtitution of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. To have made a general Anſwer of No Toleration, had been eaſily paſſed over, and ſuch an one as would have humoured the Intereſt then carrying on, by making the Repeal of <hi>All</hi> Penal Laws the common concern of <hi>All</hi> Diſſenters.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100382:12"/>
But at that time to diſtinguiſh between the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and Popiſh ones, as I did; to ſay, That I ſhould endeavour the Allowance of Eaſe to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which I thought the doing to the other, would be inconſiſtent with the Safety of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will, I believe, with unprejudiced Men, clear me ſo much from the imputation of a <hi>Knaviſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance,</hi> that I rather fear it will be cenſured as a Fool-hardineſs, and a needleſs provoking a Prince whoſe Reſentments were known to run very high; Eſpecially in me, whoſe Concerns in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted me to more ſenſible effects of his Diſpleaſure, than others, who had the good Fortune to have their Lots fall in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From that time till the <hi>dreadful</hi> News of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Expedition, I was out of Commiſſion; then, when Miſ-managements were publickly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and all things promiſed to be reſtored to their former ſtate, Orders were given for renewing all Commiſſions, and reſtoring the Gentlemen lately put out; which was done accordingly, and I amongſt them. Yet even then, at a Meeting of thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, long before His Majeſty landed, we una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly agreed, not to act, while one Man, whoſe compliance with the Queſtions had qualified him for the New Commiſſion; or who had aſſerted or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted under the Diſpenſing Power, was left in the Commiſſion. Affairs of greater importance, it ſeems, took up their time, ſo that the Commiſſion was not altered; nor did one of us act. This is the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100382:13"/>
true ſtate of this matter, and I defie the Malice of the worſt of Mankind, to charge me in the whole time of my being employed, with one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt Action, or the doing any thing unbefitting a Gentleman. And now I will leave the Reader to judge, between Sir <hi>R. B.</hi> and me, as to this part.</p>
            <p>There is nothing elſe poſitively affirmed of me, but that I had no Plantations in <hi>Ireland</hi> to loſe; which I would not have taken Notice of, but to let the Reader ſee, that one word of truth is not to be expected from him, with relation to me. How poſitive ſoever he is in it, 'tis a thing which he could no ways know, for I dare ſay, he will never pretend to have been upon the place: But I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as many Witneſſes as ever have ſeen that part of the Kingdom, that there is not in the whole Province of <hi>Munſter,</hi> a better planted and improv'd Eſtate than mine. Beſides the viſible ones, I will tell Sir <hi>R. B.</hi> that I made other Improvements of it, that were really valuable: 'Twas let out to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tenants, near thirty Years ſince, upon ſuch Terms, that they all thrived, and moſt of them lived much better than I can at preſent. 'Twas a Condition of their Leaſes, of which I have the Counterparts to produce, not to let in a Papiſt amongſt them, as Aſſignee of any part of their Lands (which was lately made an Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt me, and reſented as a great Fault): And they were bound at all times, when the Crown
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100382:13"/>
of <hi>England</hi> required it, to attend me, or my Heirs, in perſon, with ſerviceable Horſe, Arms, and Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture; and I hope there are many of them yet in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that may be ſoon put into a Condition to perform this laſt part of their Covenant, when they have an opportunity of doing it: Which may be eaſily believ'd, it being notoriouſly known, that my Son in the Year 1680, (when the Militia of the County of <hi>Cork</hi> was raiſed) did Petition the Government to have leave to raiſe an entire Troop of Horſe, to be made up out of his and my Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants onely; which he undertook ſhould be the beſt Militia Troop in the whole County.</p>
            <p>I come now to the compariſon he makes between us; I know no-body elſe in the World that would do it, and therefore will leave him to make the moſt of it. Only where he talks of his Eſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſetled for Four Generations laſt paſt in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and that I had no Plantations to loſe; leaſt he ſhould inſinuate ſomething further, then that my Eſtate there is new purchaſed, (which I agree) I beg the Reader's Excuſe for my Vanity, (I confeſs 'tis a Folly, yet I cann't forbear it) when I tell him, that my Father left an Eſtate of double the Value that ever Sir <hi>R. B</hi>'s. was at the higheſt purchaſe: And that he derived his Title to a good Real E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, enjoyed by his Anceſtors for twenty Lineal Diſcents, from the time of King <hi>William</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; at which time his Anceſtors came out of <hi>France,</hi> of the ſame Quality that Sir <hi>R. B.</hi> now is,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100382:14"/>
unleſs his Title be Barronet; which I think not worth my while, to inform my ſelf certainly in.</p>
            <p>But what does Sir <hi>R. B.</hi> mean by theſe words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">F. 21.</note> 
               <hi>I got none of my Eſtate by Perjuring myſelf, or other Men, nor by any other indirect courſe, I thank God:</hi> No Reader can judge that they carry leſs in them, than an hint that I did. What can I, or any Man in the World, ſay to ſo <hi>villanous,</hi> yet ſo general an Accuſation? 'Twill be of no uſe that all the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Clergy and Laity, will declare, that they never heard ſo much as a ſurmiſe of a thing of that nature: That they know me too well, not to be ſure that it is impoſſible to be true. 'Twill do me no Service to vouch Sir <hi>Richard Reynel,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Temple,</hi> now in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> or near it, who were my Councel in every Cauſe, that ever I had relating to my Eſtate, and by whoſe Advice I was governed in all that I did in it; who will bear me witneſs that my conſtant Inſtructions to them were, to quit all pretences to every thing, which good Conſcience would not give me as well as Law. What can be done then in ſuch a Caſe? I will onely ſay, that whenever Sir <hi>R. B.</hi> or any body elſe, makes the leaſt ground for ſuch an Imputation upon me, to appear, I do hereby undertake to prove, That he murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Father, is a Rebel and Traytor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:100382:14"/>I do expect a Vindication and Satisfaction from him, (in this particular eſpecially) as publick as the Affront is; and till he has done me right, either juſtified the Words, or given me an opportunity of taking ſatisfaction for them, by quitting his place of Refuge; I may, I think, reaſonably expect, that no Gentleman will ſee him, without ſpitting in his Face. This is a Reflection beyond all bearing; a private Stab to the Heart had been <hi>Mercy</hi> to it: And to ſee a <hi>Publiſhed by Authority</hi> to this, will hardly let a Man ſtop at a common degree of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: But I <hi>will</hi> be temperate, expecting, that if he has abuſed the World by thoſe words, right will be done <hi>Me,</hi> and care taken to call him to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for his doing ſo; if not, at leaſt, that he may be required to juſtifie his Charge; and upon his failing to do it, that the ſame Authority will encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his being proſecuted as the worſt of <hi>Libellers.</hi> This is the hardeſt word I have given him, (the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are conditional onely). And if I have made every part of his Pamphlet, which affirms or inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates any thing really to my diſadvantage, appear to be falſe, as I think I have ſufficiently; I believe all Mankind, who have read that Paper, will allow me to be very much Maſter of my Paſſions, when I give him no worſe a Name.</p>

That I called his Propoſal <hi>Diſhoneſt and Knaviſh.</hi> He tells not when, where, in what Company, or upon what Occaſion I ſaid ſo: I will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affirm, nor deny the words, till I know certainly whether he charge me truly with them or not; but onely declare, that if I did ſay any ſuch words, and had been taxed with them in a manner becoming a Gentleman, I would either have made him a Submiſſion as Publick as my Fault was, or have juſtified what I had ſaid, and given him an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of taking what Satisfaction he expected: But as he has now uſed me, I think myſelf in no ſort obliged to take further Notice of them.</p>
            <p>This I ſhall farther obſerve, that tho' Sir <hi>R. B.</hi> hath thought fit to ſingle me out, to vilifie by Name, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice hath not ſtopt there, but in the ſame Pamphlet he reviles and traduces as worthy Perſons as belong to the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with Terms unbefitting a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to give or receive.</p>

            <p>I Humbly beg your Grace's Pardon for the Confidence of this Addreſs, which the Vindication of myſelf has made neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; and I am too well acquainted with your Grace's Honour and Temper to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that you will let any Man's Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuffer unjuſtly, when 'tis in your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do him right. If your Grace will pleaſe to turn over a late Pamphlet, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Sir <hi>Richard Buckley,</hi> called, <hi>The Propoſals for ſending back the Nobility and</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:100382:16"/>
               <hi>Gentry of</hi> Ireland, <hi>Vindicated.</hi> (Which I herewith ſend to your Grace); in the Twentieth Page of it, you will find, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſt other things, this Objection againſt my being employed by Their Majeſties: <hi>I will not ſay, that he will carry in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment to his Old Maſter; but this I will ſay, that when His Majeſty came up from the</hi> Weſt <hi>to</hi> London, <hi>in our March, I found this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman at</hi> Windſor, <hi>then a Juſtice of the Peace, (and I have heard ſeveral ſay, he was a Deputy-Lieutenant) under the late King, at a time when few honest Men in the Kingdom would accept of it.</hi> The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection which the latter words carry, ſeems ſo large, that I cannot but believe, they were inſerted without the Allowance of the <hi>Authority,</hi> by which the Title-page ſays his Book is <hi>Publiſhed:</hi> But for me to inſiſt only on the generality of the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, when I am particularly charged, might reaſonably be interpreted a ſhifting off what I could not defend myſelf againſt. Your Grace (being then Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Surrey</hi>) is beſt able to ſay, what ground
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100382:16"/>
the Gentleman has to charge me with any thing, that may be an Imputation upon me upon that Account: And to your Grace I appeal in it. I intreat your Grace to give me leave to make Publick Uſe of your Anſwer to this Letter, which ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be owned by me, as the greateſt Favour, tho' nothing can oblige me more than I am already obliged to be,</p>

            <p>IN Anſwer to what you write me word, That you are aſperſed as one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to act as a Juſtice of Peace, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty-Lieutenant in <hi>Surrey,</hi> at a time when every one was turned out of Commiſſion, that did not promiſe to Repeal the Penal Laws and Teſts, I will always do you that Juſtice as to bear you witneſs, that I firſt made you a Deputy-Lieutenant in the time of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and ſo you continued (as well as in the Commiſſion of the Peace) until King <hi>James</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſed the Queſtions concerning the Teſts, to be put to every one that was in Commiſſion; and that upon your refuſing to comply with them, you were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately put out of the Commiſſion of the Peace; and I had Orders to remove you, and all the reſt that would not comply,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100382:17"/>
from being Deputy-Lieutenants; but I (chuſing rather to run the hazard of being turned out with ſo many honeſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, then to remain in, with ſuch as they would put in their rooms) refuſed to Obey that Order; ſo that it was not onely you in particular that continued; for I did not turn out one Deputy-Lieutenant in either of the Counties of <hi>Norfolk, Surrey,</hi> or <hi>Berks,</hi> where I was Lord-Lieutenant. I am</p>
