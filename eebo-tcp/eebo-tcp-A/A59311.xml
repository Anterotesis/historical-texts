            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To his Honoured Friend, Sir Robert Owen.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ertainly, of all Mankind, nothing is so vain as the Scriblers of this Age; for no sooner are they blest with any extraordinary Favour, but they must tell the whole World of it. The Honour of that Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship You have been Generously pleased to give me, and the Delight of a Conversation so Compleatly Ingenious, affords me no little Occasion for the same Natural Vanity. This is that makes us Publish our <hi>Plays,</hi> as formerly the <hi>Romans</hi> Built the Porticoes to their Houses; they always fixt their <hi>Lares</hi> o're their Threshold.—But at the same time that I boast of the Honour I have received, I ought to blush at the Present I make You, when I treat you with a Play so worthless, and so Unfortunate. Nay, to sum up all its Misfortunes, it does not only owe so little to the Composers Hand; but breath'd too in a Season, when Poetry even with its softest and most Curious Aires, to the Ears of this untunable Age, sounds but harsh and unpleasant: nay, and what's yet worst of all, perform'd by the feeble Fragment of a Company.—'Tis true, the <hi>Theatre Royal</hi> was once all Harmony; where the Heroick Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses sung so sweetly, and with Voices so perfectly Musical, as few or no Ears could escape Enchantment. But when this hapless Play came forth, its sweetest Pipes were stopt; and like a shatter'd Organ, it had only left what could do little more than squeak and jar. But, Oh, that their <hi>Oracle</hi> should be quite silent! Ah, that their <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Head</hi> would speak agen, and bring once more the scatter'd Quire around him! Then <hi>Tragedy</hi> might re-assume its Majesty, and Passion plead with such aa Emphasis, till the charm'd Spectatour should almost wish to be that Real suffering <hi>Hero</hi> he admires, and share his very Fate, to move but half his Pity.

I a Poet, nay, a <hi>Fletcher,</hi> or a <hi>Shakespear,</hi> I would quit my whole Title to Immortality, so that one <hi>Actor</hi> might never Die. This I may modestly say of him, (nor is it my own particular Opinion, but the Sense of all Mankind) that the best Tragedies on the <hi>English</hi> Stage have receiv'd that Lustre from Mr. <hi>Hart's</hi> Performance, that he has lfft such an Impression behind him, that no less than the Interval of an Age can make them appear agen with half their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, from any second Hand. And when he leaves the Stage, the Reign of <hi>Tragedy</hi> Expires; for then it must dwindle from a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> to a <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> And were it in my Nature to be Envious or Malicious against any Man that writes, it should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Good Fortune, who writ in the <hi>Indian</hi> Emperors first Days: And having named that admirable Play, methinks it has made its Appearance since, so far short of its Primitive Excellence, that I fancy it has been sometimes almost as unmercifully used, as their tortured <hi>Montezuma</hi> by the Barbarous <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But, Alas, the very best of Plays now find but a cold Reception, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the kinder Entertainment they met, at the <hi>King's</hi> first Returne. For Players and Plays came then upon the Stage like <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus</hi> into <hi>America,</hi> they brought New Faces, and almost a New Language into our World; and what betwixt Novelty and Surprize they won Spectators Hearts so easily (whilst a little Wit in Plays went so far) that like Him they could Traffick even with Beads and Baubles: But Time &amp; Conversation has made the Critical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences like the Wiser <hi>Indians;</hi> and he that would please 'em now, must purchase their Applause with Solid and Elaborate Sense, and bring more than Glass to barter for their Gold.—But this Discourse looks so like extenuating my Faults, that 'tis high time to give it or'e: Yet if by any Arguments I can purchase your charitable Opinion I have gaind a Judge to my side; and indeed I have no mean Creder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials to confirm me in that Assurance: For, besides the Charm of our ordinary Conversation, you have more particularly favour'd
<pb facs="tcp:50754:3"/>
me with the Perusal of a Poem of your own; without Flattery, not outdone by a <hi>Coopers Hill:</hi> And what adds to the Merit of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you writ it so Young, that a Judgment so Ripe, at an Age so early<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not a little Miraculous. But, Sir, you have all the Reason in the World to be both Poetical and Ingenious, having both Nature and Fortune your Friends; and certainly, there's nothing goes so far to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the compleating a Man of Wit, as Prosperity and Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. For to say truth, Wit is never truly well scituate, but where a good Estate lies round it. This made the Antient Poets fancy that their very Muses could never be Happy, nor cheerfully Harmonious, till they gave 'em a <hi>Pernassus</hi> for their Inheritance, whilst their Mounts &amp; Fountains, Groves &amp; Grottoes were all their own. With these Advantages your Fancy soars; nay, it has one Happiness above all this, it needs not look abroad for a Subject: For whilst you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive your Descent in a long unbroken Line, from the Old Active <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Princes, within the Circuit of your Ancestries Fame, like him that hunts and hawks in his own Ground, you have an ample Field for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry even within your Self; and borrow-from your Birth a Theme, of which your own Native untaught <hi>Bards,</hi> could but rudely sing.</p>
            <p>But your Hereditary Glory has no occasion to look so far back into the Records of Time: Even the last Age is so full of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and your whole Families Active, and no less suffering Loyalty; Loyalty that e'n embalms their Dust, and makes their Memories fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant: That if ever an <hi>English Monarch</hi> should have a Cause to dispute, a Prerogative to maintain, or an Injury to revenge, (but Heaven forbid, that the Glorious Son of the Unhappy <hi>Charles,</hi> should ever have his Father's Necessity to use 'em) I could wish him no bolder, nor no Faithfuller Champions, than the Heir of your Families Honour, Courage, and Allegiance. But, Sir, my Business is not to be your Herald nor Historian; but to tell you how much I am<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <l>Who best knew how to Value what they Taught,</l>
               <l>With that true Zeal their <hi>Poets</hi> did Adore,</l>
               <l>That scarce their Conquerours themselves had more.</l>
               <l>And the same Wreath, that did in Peace adorn</l>
               <l>The <hi>Poets</hi> Brow,</l>
               <l>Was by the Victour in his Triumphs worn.</l>
               <l>Wit then was Sacred, and less Awe was paid</l>
               <l>To <hi>Caesar</hi> Living, than to <hi>Virgil</hi> Dead.</l>
               <l>But the Degenerate World has chang'd the Scene:</l>
               <l>Wit ne'r must see those Golden Dayes agen.</l>
               <l>The Reverend Stage has lost its Native Use,</l>
               <l>And is become a <hi>Bridewel</hi> to a Muse:</l>
               <l>For here She must from testy Critick bear</l>
               <l>More Lashes, than poor Punck from Beadle there.</l>
               <l>Censure's your Game, and when you've rowz'd a Play,</l>
               <l>How loud the numerous Pack of Coxcombs Bay.</l>
               <l>The grateful Musick ecchoes through the Town;</l>
               <l>And, open-mouth'd, you run the <hi>Poet</hi> down.</l>

               <l>That you see Plays e'n just as Cats make Love.</l>
               <l>Here Three dull Hours i' th' Afternoon you pass,</l>
               <l>With those crampt Looks, and with that Damn'd Grimace,</l>
               <l>In so much Pain, so much against your Will,</l>
               <l>As if your Morning-<hi>Bolus</hi> grumbled still.</l>
               <l>The Ladies too, who should Relieve the Stage,</l>

               <l>Severe to Man in all Respects they prove:</l>
               <l>Are neither satisfied with Wit, nor Love.</l>
               <l>But think their Drudges in both Labours dull,</l>
