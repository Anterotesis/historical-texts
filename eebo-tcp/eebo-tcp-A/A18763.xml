            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The liues of good men are gladsome to heare of, but the death of euery one in generall, is heauy to behold: first for the losse of friends, (for the affection we beare them,) &amp; for the want of those we can not call againe (whatsoeuer neede requireth their presence) nor beare eeuenly the losse of such as we are bounde to fauor when death takes them hence, and life denies them any longer continuance on earth: my good Lord your noble father who fauored me much, and my Lord Chamberlaine that loued me not a little, (whose troth and woorthines I am too meane to write of) sturs vp my spirits (that in a maner drowpeth to honor the names of those that were woorthies in our age, and shew in verse that men

of value and laudation should be alwaies honored in the best sort we can deuise. Thus waying the sudden departures of diuers woorthie men (in their calling and vocation) some famous and learned Bishops, some renowmed Captaines and couragious Leaders, and some most honorable Personages, Gouernours of our state, taken all away together in one yeere. I not onely la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment soe great a losse, but in the number rehersed haue founde out one among the cheife an honorable Knight, I knew for many parts well abled in goodnes to be written of to the vttermost of my inuentions and skill, thinking my selfe fortunate to set foorth the vnstained life of so happie a Councellor: but my great loue to him, presumsion and forwardnes to enrowle his name among a multitude, makes me passe the bonds of ordinary duty, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vtter the opinion conceiued of his vertues, which neither pen can amplely pronounce, nor writer may easily set out: God grant the curious wits of the world stand as well pleased with my pains, as your L. I dout not is glad to heare your worthy father in law praised, then I account my labor well bestowed, and so take leaue, wishing your Lordship long life and blessednes, with double increase of vertue and honor.</p>
