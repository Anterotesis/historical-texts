         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And further, the greateſt thing that troubles you, is Printing and publiſhing books many thouſands, you ſay, concerning blaſphemous and heretical, and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magiſtratical opinions tending to unchriſtian people, and diſorder the people of the Nations, and to bring in paganiſme, and libertiniſme, and this you ſay you preſent unto them to provoke their zeale againſt them.</p>
               <p>Oh you blood thirſty minded men, all the care that you would have the Magiſtrates to take of the people is to deſtroy them, and to have them ſhut up in holes and caves, and dens, and priſons, and the truth ever ſuffered by your generation, and your generation hath ever preſſed the Magiſtrates that they might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe their power, and if they will but hearken to you, inſtead of healing the people, they will be deſtroyers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and in ſtead of making up breaches, they will make deſolate, and ſo you would drive them on haſtily to ſatisfie your corrupt wil, and to uphold your Diana, and your craft, that you may make merchandize of that which hath been long enough ſold and printed by you; and what hath it done? who is turned from darkneſſe to light? and you that makes a trade of others writings and words, to maintain you in your luſts, and deceive, this you would have them to uphold; but as for the care of peoples ſoules, its far enough from you, and all along your filthy lying ſlanderous booke, you are made manifeſt to bee of thoſe that would have fire to come down from heaven in your wils to deſtroy all thoſe that withſtand you and your imaginations. And therfore let all magiſtrates in whom the fear of the Lord is, take heed how they take things from the hands and mouthes of them who hath alwaies perſecuted the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of truth, and called truth errour, and light dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and darkneſſe light; and in a blind zeale for God, deſtroy them whom the power of the Lord is manifeſt in; for ſo <hi>Paul</hi> perſecuted Chriſt, and the Saints, and ſo the Jewes crucified Chriſt, and all the Saints have ſuffered. And you are offended at our meeting in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> while wee have beene here in the City wee have not been in a corner, and wee challenge you and all the City in the name of the Lord, who is dreadfull to all liers, and ſlanderers, to ſhow what are thoſe blaſphemies that you ſpeake of, you backbiters ſhall have your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the reſt of hypocrites: opinions we deny, for the light of Jeſus Chriſt which is ſpirituall which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears and declares againſt all ſects, and opinions, and blaſphemies, and all you who hates it, are in contention, and in opinions, and blaſpheme the truth; and here I charge it upon you in the preſence of the living God, that you are blaſphemers who calls the light naturall and paganiſme; and the Lord wil plead with you, you filthy corrupt minds, who calls the light of Chriſt.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:167992:3"/>
Antichriſtian, for here in the preſence of the Lord of hoſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſpeake it, no other light doe wee owne to walk by, but that which is ſpiritual and eternal, the light of Chriſt, which he hath enlightned every one that comes into the world withal; and this is not Anti-ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural as thou cals it; for the Scriptures witneſs the ſame, and Chriſt bears witneſs of it, and no other light do we own but the ſame that ever was, which was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and which convinceth the world of ſin, and the ſame that led up the Saints to know the Father and the Son: and you that cal this paganiſme and heretical, and blaſphemous, and Antichriſtian, let all who have any light in them judg, and let ſhame cover your faces, and fear take hold upon you, for your words ſtinke, and come out of the mouth of the dragon; ye filthy unclean frogs, which hath poiſon under your tongues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as for the bookes which wee have Printed, wee owne them, and are ready to lay downe our lives for the teſtimonie of Jeſus, and the truth of them, and ſeale them with our blood, and what are written in them, through the eternal power of God, which is made manifeſt, and that wee have publiſhed any thing againſt any juſt Magiſtracie, let all our writings, and all who reade them judge; and if bearing witneſſe to Jeſus Chriſt unchriſtians people, let all judge; for no other do wee owne, but the ſame Chriſt to day and ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, and for ever; and here all your petitioning is made manifeſt, from whence it did ariſe and proceed, and your ſhame and nakedneſſe, and envie appears.</p>
               <p>And the Sacraments which you ſay you uſe, which is appointed in the Scripture, and <hi>Farnworth</hi> in Anſwer to a petition did deny them.</p>
               <p>Anſwer, His anſwer we owne; and I challenge you to bee perverters of the Scripture; where read you of Sacraments in the Scripture? here I charge you to be liers and ſlanderers, and deniers of the Scripture, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to it, and the plagues ſhall be added to you; and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:167992:4"/>
as for that which you uſe among you is traditional and imitatory. Yet the bread which wee break is the Communion of the body of Chriſt, and the cup wee drink is the Communion of the blood of Chriſt, and this is that which <hi>Paul</hi> received from him: and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme by one ſpirit into one body we owne; the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is but one, and this wee owne, and here you liers and ſlanderers are ſeen and denied.</p>
               <p>Another thing you call hereſie and blaſphemy, is, that wee ſay that Chriſt hath enlightned all men; but I ſhal lay downe your own words, and prove you liers out of that booke called the General good to all people: and you ſay the light of God that is in all men, that is to wit, natural conſcience, that it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, if wee give heed unto it, to diſcover ſinne, and and turne our minds towards God, and that this light within, is the grace of God, and that it is Chriſt in us.</p>
               <p>Anſwer, Let all that reades that booke, ſee if you bee not liers and ſlanderers, and perverters, and are in the generation of thoſe falſe witneſſes which bore wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt Chriſt; and here I charge you to be liers. Where in all the bookdoth he ſay that the light of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſcience is ſufficient to guide to God, if it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heed to? or where doth it ſay it diſcovers ſin? there is another lie: and where doth hee ſay that natural conſcience is the grace of God? there is a third lie; and where doth hee ſay that natural conſcience is Chriſt in us? there is a fourth lie; bee aſhamed that ever you ſhould goe and preſent ſo many filthy lies to authority that there is no truth in at all. Oh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yee darke mindes, would you be judging and preſcribing what is hereſie and blaſphemie, and cals the light of Chriſt paganiſme and hereſie? but I am bold in the Name of the Lord, to declare unto you, and unto all the world, that Chriſt is the true light that hath enlightned every one that comes into the world, and that this light is ſpiritual, and not natural, and it convinceth of all ſinne; hee ſhal
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:167992:4"/>
convince the world of ſinne, and whoſo obey this light which ſhines into the conſcience, it leads up to Chriſt, and out of ſinne, and it turns the mind towards God, and it ſhines in darkneſſe; but you dark ſottiſh children know it not; yea, you that hate it, have it, and it ſhal condemne you, and when the book of conſcience ſhall be opened, you ſhall be judged for all your hard ſpeeches againſt the truth.</p>
               <p>Another thing you preſent to be blaſphemie and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, is that the worſhip that is performed in <hi>England</hi> with thoſe Miniſters that ſing <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms, baptize infants, weare double cuffes, boot hoſe tops, take tithes, ſay men ſhal never be perfect in this world, and that ſay the letter is the light, and the letter is the word; and that ſalvation is in the Scripture, and that cals <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> &amp; <hi>John,</hi> the Goſpel, are ſeducers, and no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the word, but ſhew forth the Spirit of error.</p>

And truly I ſay unto you, you have, and wil miſs of your end in putting forth this book of yours; and whereas you ſay you ſhall be willing at any time to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate every concluſion therein contained againſt any that ſhall oppoſe. I anſwer, I challenge you all in this particular to prove thoſe accuſations which you have laid to our charge whom you call Quakers, in many particulars which before I have demanded; what they are is before ſpoken of; and whereas you ſay, you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that light within (not witneſſed by the ſcripture without) which ſome ſo much talke of, to be deep dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I anſwer, if you know any who ſpeake of any light which the Scripture doth not witneſſe of, we with you freely declares againſt ſuch, and ſuch a light is darkneſs, but the light of Chriſt which we ſpeak of, which hath lightned every one that cometh into the world, I hope you are not ſo impudent, but you wil acknowledge that the ſcriptures ſpeaks of this light; and dare not deny, but that the ſcripture witneſſes that Chriſt is the light of the world; for as I ſaid, we freely give way, and deſires that all might ſearch the ſcripture, whether theſe things be not ſo as we declare.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:167992:18"/>And whereas you ſay, and exhort to let the Scripture be the rule of faith and practice.</p>
               <p>I Anſw. Here you would alwaies keep people in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneſs, under your teaching, and would make void the new Covenant which is the Law written in the heart, and the ſpirit of the Lord put in the inward parts, to be the rule and guide of the Saints, for who walkes by the rule without them, and teaches men ſo to do, would make void the Covenant of life and peace, where the teacher is not removed into a corner, which teacher all that have faith and an holy converſation do witneſſe, which teaches not contrary to what the Scripture ſpeaks, but is a teaching fulfilling of the Scripture, and an eſtabliſhing of it, though thou and many may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the teaching of the Scripture and may in your own wills, conform unto it in the outward appearance, as the Phariſees did, and yet be but Hypocrites and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as they were; and I ſay againe, that faith was before the Scripture was written, which faith is declared of in the Scripture, which faith comes as is manifeſted by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word Preached, which word is even in the mouth and in the heart; if you have an ear you may hear; &amp; now I adviſe you all in the name of the Lord to ceaſe ſtriving and contending againſt the truth, for veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſtone which is cut out of the mountain without hands, will daſh your image of many mixtures to peices, and it falling upon you, wil grinde you to powder, and your conforming the outward man, to an outward thing and teaching men ſo to doe, and limiting and tying the Holy one to a viſible thing, wil not cover you in the day of the Lord: nay verily, though concerning the Scripture without, you may walk blameleſſe, yet one thing will be found lacking even the croſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, by which all ſin is crucified in them who walks in it; and I ſay unto you, that your covering is too narrow, and it will not hide your ſecret parts: for in the eternall light of Chriſt you are ſeen and comprehended,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:167992:18"/>
your beginning, your time, and your end, for though you have the Scriptures, and Jewiſh like, walkes up in the outward appearance of them, crying the ordinances and Churches are ye, yet your praiſe is of men, and not of God, for you are enemies to the life of the Scriptures as is made appear by your many lies and ſlanders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, which you have uttered; and I ſay returen your minds every one within to that in your own conſciences which reproves you in ſecret for your ſecret iniquities, it wil let you ſee where your hearts are, and how far they are mortified to the world, and the love of it, and this light wherewith every one of you is lightned is the light of Chriſt, and it is the Lords true witneſſe and ſhall witneſſe for him eternally againſt all whoſe deeds are evil, who walk in diſobedience of it, and all who love it and walk in it, it leads unto Chriſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all purity and holineſſe and uprightneſs of heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and man; and this light leads unto juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, all them who are taught by it; and here is your teacher, loving it; and your condemnation eternally, continuing to hate it. And thus I have anſwered your booke, and the truth is witneſſed, and many falſe lies and falſe accuſations denied and teſtified againſt, and thus I reſt, waiting for an anſwer to clear your ſelf (if you be able) of thoſe things which I have denied from you, which you have charged upon us, for God is my witneſſe, this I do deſire, that truth may be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and imbraced, and deceit and errour diſcovered and denied.</p>
