         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THIS ſhort Diſcourſe cometh not from the expectation of pleaſing any of the Extremes, the Tyrannical or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founders. And therefore in a Time and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where thoſe that eſcape Extremes are few, it muſt expect but the private approbation of thoſe few. But thoſe few and their Cauſe, are ſo conſiderable, as that if God mean not to forſake the Land, they may yet become the Agents and <hi>ſtamina</hi> of a happy concordant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Of which in the appearance of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſes, there is yet no great proſpect, nor like to be, unleſs God cauſe the Supreme Power, by Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs, or by
<pb facs="tcp:60966:3"/>
their own conſtraining Intereſt and Neceſſity, to drive the Worldly Unpeaceable Sort, to obey Healing Precepts for their own Advantage, contrary to their Temptations and Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. If ſuch a day come when I am dead, theſe Principles will be of uſe. They are not lately taken up by me, as you may ſee in my Five Diſputations of Church Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in my Treatiſe of Epiſcopacy, Nonconformity ſtated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in our fruſtrated Treaty for Concord 1660, 1661.</p>
            <p>In the ſtate that we are in while we have none to whom we have any Call or Hope to addreſs our ſelves for publick Concord, let us keep our ſelves from the guilt of unpeaceableneſs, and bear the Slanders and Wrongs of falſe Accuſers, and thank God for checking the Power of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, and let us make peace among thoſe that we may ſpeak to with any hope, and wait on God till he ſhew us whether he be ſaving or forſaking the Land, and the reſt of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (Unreformed) Churches.</p>
            <p>And to them that will be offended with me for ſaying ſo much for Biſhops and Archbiſhops, let them know that this Book is but an Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on a bigger, written againſt a Foreign Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction or Popery, which ſheweth that I am
<pb facs="tcp:60966:3"/>
no more for the Extremes of others' than of theirs. As alſo my Treatiſe of Epiſcopacy hath ſhewn: And here I have proved that Popery is but a Fabrick built on the Ruins of National Churches or Chriſtian Kingdoms: And if it ever fall it muſt be by their Reſtoration. The Lord pity the Blind, Malignant, Self-deſtroying World, and prepare us better for a better Society.</p>

            <head>Chap. I. <hi>What a National Church is.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>§ 1. A National Church and a Chriſtian Kingdom conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of a Chriſtian Soveraign Magiſtrate, and of Chriſtian Subjects worſhiping God (ordinarily) in true Particular Paſtoral Churches,) is the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>§ 2. The ignorance of this hath confounded the Chriſtian World, by two extreams.</p>
            <p>On one ſide a double miſchief hath been by this ignorance introduced. Firſt, That of Popery, which firſt prophaneth the Sacred Office of Kings and Magiſtrates, feigning them to be but a ſort of ſecular Animals, that have the care only of mens Bodies and trading and worldly Affairs, and not of Souls, or of mens everlaſting Safety; as if this belonged only to Prieſts; whereby they make Kings to be as much baſer than Prieſts, as the Body is viler than the Soul, and teach the Subjects accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to diſhonour and contemn them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And while they confine Princes to the bounds of their own Dominions, they pretend that the whole World muſt have one Church Soveraign, either Monarchical, Ariſtocratical, or mixt; which yet Humane Nature is utterly uncapable of; ſo that truly Popery is founded on the degrading of Princes and States, and overthrowing true National Church-bounds, to ſet up an abſurdly pretended Univerſal Soveraignty inſtead of it, under Sacerdotal Heads.</p>
            <p>§ 3. And this miſtake hath corrupted the late Innovating Prelatiſts, that would be called the <hi>Church of England;</hi> who have learnt of the Papiſts to appropriate the name of the Church, or at leaſt Church-Government, to the Clergy; and ſo think that a National Church muſt be unified and conſtituted by a National Sacerdotal Head, either ſingle or collective: And that a Prince is not ſacred enough to be a National Church Head. That this novel Opinion is contrary to the Laws, and the ſenſe of Lawyers, and the Doctrine of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the very Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, is ſo
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60966:6"/>
well known, as forbids me to loſe any time in proving it.</p>
            <p>It's true, that Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and our Kings and Doctors have juſtly appropriated the Power of the <hi>Word, Sacraments,</hi> and the Keys of Admiſſion to Chriſtian Communion, and of Excommunication and Abſolution, to the Paſtoral Office, and have proved that Chriſt did himſelf inſtitute that Office, and not leave it to the will or power of Princes to inſtitute, abrogate or alter it: But it is as true, that Princes are the Governours of thoſe Paſtors, and may puniſh them for Male-adminiſtration, and diſpoſe of the things <hi>circaſacra</hi> undetermined by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>§ 4. By this miſchievous Errour alſo the Clergy have been drawn to tempt Kings and Magiſtrates to think that they are but Civil Officers, and have not much need to be very ſtudious to underſtand the Scriptures, but muſt leave that to Biſhops and Prieſts, and take it on their words: By which they have been perverted and let looſe to ungodlineſs and debauchery, waſting that time in Luxury, and Sports, and Idleneſs, which ſhould have been ſpent in ſtudying of the Word of God; and govern by erroneous ungodly Laws, becauſe they know not the Law of the Lord: Whereas God hath commanded Kings and Rulers to ſtudy his Law diligently, and keep it alwaies before their eyes and on their hearts, and to govern according to it, and make it the chief work of their Office to promote the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of it.</p>
            <p>§ 5. <hi>Moſes</hi> was more the Mediator between God, as Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and the People than <hi>Aaron</hi> was, and was better acquainted with the Law, and the meaning of it, than <hi>Aaron</hi> was: It was he that is called King in <hi>Jeſurun:</hi> And God inſtituted a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Succeſſion of ſuch, which the Iſraelites ſinned in chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Kings: <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up to you like to me, him ſhall you hear]</hi> tho' it meant Chriſt remotely and eminently, it meant his Succeſſors proximately. <hi>Joſhua</hi> was commanded the ſtudy of God's Law: And <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> are undeniable Inſtances to prove that Kings were by God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be more wiſe and holy perſons than the Prieſts. And indeed if Kings be not better skill'd in God's Word than moſt of the Popiſh Prieſts are, no wonder if they be the Subjects of Prieſts, and be lightly eſteemed as unmeet to Govern; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s Doctrine were true, that [<q>the Eſſential work of the Miniſtry, according to my Principles is to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60966:6"/>
between God and Man; to ſeal Covenants on behalf of God, and to accept of thoſe which are made by Men; and to oblige them to perform their part of the Covenant by other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe authoritatively excluding them from God's part. Hence reſults the whole Power of Eccleſiaſtical Government: And for this no great gifts and abilities are eſſential. All the skill that is requiſite eſſentially, is only in general to know the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits to be performed on God's part, and the duties to be performed on Man's, and the Nature and Obligation of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants in general, and the particular Solemnities of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Covenants. And of this how any man can be unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, who is but capable of underſtanding the common dealings of the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>]</p>
            <p>If it be much more knowledge than this that is commanded to Kings and Rulers, then are they the more ſacred perſons, and fitter to be Heads of a National Church, than ſuch Prieſts are.</p>
            <p>§ 6. Biſhops or Paſtors may be the conſtitutive Heads of Particular Churches, and yet not of National, nor therefore ceaſe as ſuch to be under the Government of Chriſtian Princes; nor Princes thereby be made Prieſts. A School-Maſter, a Colledge-Maſter, an Hoſpital-Governour, a Philoſopher, may be the Head of his particular Society, and yet under a Prince that is not of his Art. The King is no Phyſicion, and yet Ruleth Phyſicions, not as a chief Phyſicion, but by the General Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a King.</p>
            <p>The Maſters of Sciences and Arts (as ſuch) govern none but Volunteers, and therefore not by the Sword: It's Princes that do that.</p>
            <p>§ 7. Though <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, as ſuch, bind not us, nor any, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Chriſt hath put it into his Law, and many things in their Policy, are unſuitable to our times and places, and more in their way of Worſhip; yet the true nature of ſuch a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church as Chriſt did inſtitute, muſt be known by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the Jews Church was as National, and how far Chriſt would have continued that form of Government, and what change it was that he was for.</p>
            <p>§ 8. 1. Chriſt would not have the Jewiſh Nation to retain their peculiarity as diſtinct from the Catholick Church, for he came to call the Gentile World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He intended not to make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the Seat of a Regent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60966:7"/>
Church over the reſt of the World, as it then was over the Jews; for he knew that it was to be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He intended not to ſettle one High Prieſt over the whole Catholick Church, nor over the National Church: For <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facto</hi> he did it not; and he knew that the High Prieſt did typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelf only.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He intended not to continue the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> as ſuch; nor its Ceremonious Worſhip; but only ſo much of it as was of the Law of Nature common to others; and ſo much of the Policy as by parity of caſes and reaſon, is ſuited to others as well as to the Jews.</p>
            <p>§ 9. But 1. He offered to be King over them as a holy National Kingdom-Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He accordingly appointed the number of Twelve and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty under him, as related to the Twelve Tribes, and to their great Council.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He ſent theſe firſt to work upon them by Doctrine and Perſwaſion, his Kingdom being a Government of Love, Mercy and Free Grace, that would have none but Volunteers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He gave them Laws by which he would govern them, with promiſes of Reward, and threats of Penalty.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He extended this offered State and Priviledge to them and their Children.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He intended to ſet up his Government in Power by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes, as ſoon as his Word and Providence had ripened the Church for it.</p>
            <p>§ 10. I ſhall prove all this in the next Chapter, when I have told you firſt, that as the Papal Party hath been ſet up in their Uſurpation (Univerſal and National) for want of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt's Inſtitution of Kingdom-Churches; ſo the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and dividing part of the Nonconformiſts have by this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, run into many hurtful Errours, and unpeaceable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How much the very name of a National Church is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſted by very many zealous perſons through meer ignorance, is too commonly known.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And in Independents, and too many Presbyterians, the cuſtom prevaileth, of calling the exerciſe of Paſtoral Diſcipline, by the name of the Kingly Government of Chriſt, as diſtinct not only from his Prophetical and Prieſtly Office, but alſo from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60966:7"/>
his Government by Magiſtrates: As if Chriſt governed not as King, as much and more eminently by Princes as by Prieſts, or Paſtors.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And if a man ſpeaketh but what Scripture ſpeaketh for Chriſt's Government of the Churches by Magiſtrates, they call him an Eraſtian: Whereas the Errour of <hi>Eraſtus</hi> (an excellent Proteſtant Phyſicion) was not his being for the Government of Princes, but his taking down the Power of the Keys too much, which was the Office of Paſtors, and making Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over-common, and too much denying Excommunication: (Of which I have written a peculiar Treatiſe to Dr. <hi>Ludov. Molinaeus,</hi> ſhewing the true difference between the Power of Magiſtrates and Paſtors.)</p>
            <p n="4">4. And hence great diſorder hath ariſen from the underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing of the Confederacy of all particular Churches in the ſame Kingdom; and from a diſobedience to the lawful determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Princes in Church Affairs, and even from the cauſleſs ſingularity of every humorous Sect, as ſlighting the Concord of the Confederate Churches; what abundance of Schiſms had it prevented (with their diſmal Effects) if men had but retained. a due Reverence to Church Confederacies and Concord, and to the Chriſtian Magiſtrates Power? which cauſed the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſo marvelouſly to keep up Concord, and keep out Sects, though they were againſt Dioceſans, becauſe they maintained National Church Confederacy.</p>
            <p>§ 11. It may perhaps be uſeful to others that I here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my own Ignorance and Errour, that I once thought that the Scots way of a National Church Confederacy and General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, was but a ſadling the Horſe for Papal Uſurpation to ride upon: For I conſidered not that National Churches truly ſtated were Chriſt's Inſtitution, and the principal way to keep out Popery.</p>
            <p>§ 12. And whereas in my Defences againſt Dr. <hi>Stillingſleet</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> I called the Chriſtian Magiſtrate an Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Head, and urged them hard to name the Eſſential National Church-Head; I ſpake on ſuppoſition of their Opinion which I oppoſed, that Biſhops only were ſuch <hi>Eſſential Heads,</hi> from whom <hi>A National Church</hi> muſt be unified and ſpecified: But I ſtill profeſſed to own a National Church as a Chriſtian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, containing Confederate Paſtoral Churches: And of this the Soveraign Power is the Eſſentiating Head.</p>

§ 13. The names of diſtinction of <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> as differencing the Office of the Chriſtian Magiſtrates and Paſtors, may be uſed as well underſtood; but is too Popiſh, and uſed by Papiſts and ſome others, to obſcure and debaſe Chriſt's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Magiſtrates, as if they were only for ſecular uſes: Whereas indeed in a Church as National the Prince is the chief Eccleſiaſtical Officer of Chriſt. And the true differencing terms are fetcht, not from the <hi>ſubject matter,</hi> ſo much as from the <hi>Mode</hi> of Government, one being <hi>forcible</hi> by the <hi>Sword,</hi> and the other only on <hi>Conſcience</hi> by the <hi>Word,</hi> doctrinally opened, and perſonally applied by the Keys. And Ruling is called <hi>Civil,</hi> becauſe it is the Regiment over <hi>Cives quâ tales,</hi> ſo it is Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical as it is over <hi>Cives quâ Chriſtianos,</hi> and over particular Churches and Paſtors; and for Souls more than for Bodies, and worldly Eſtates.</p>
            <p>§ 14. A National Church containeth not all that dwell in the Land, but all that are Burgeſſes or Free-men in Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. All be not Citizens that dwell in the City; but they that are Deniſons, and have City-Rights and Priviledges. As Chriſt is Head <hi>over all things, To his Church, Eph.</hi> 1. 23. ſo a Chriſtian King is Head over his inhabiting Enemies and Aliens, and Head to all Civil Deniſons as he is a King; and <hi>Head to all Chriſtian</hi> Church Deniſons as he is a Chriſtian King.</p>
            <p>§ 15. In what caſes Subjects may be Civil Deniſons that are not Chriſtian Deniſons, or Church Members, requireth ſo many words and cautions to open, that I omit the deciſion of it: But were a Chriſtian Kingdom ſuch as it ought to be, none ſhould be a Civil Burgeſs with any Truſt belonging to Government, but ſuch as are Baptized or profeſſed Chriſtians, and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating Members in ſome Churches or Aſſemblies allowed or tolerated, or that ought to be tolerated. For a Kingdom and Church <hi>as formally Chriſtian,</hi> ſhould be Ruled by none but Viſible Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>This is true both of Magiſtrates, Paſtors, and the chuſers of of them. But none ſhould for this be forced or drawn to profeſs Chriſtianity, or communicate againſt their wills, it being a priviledge that none have right to but thoſe that earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired it: Nor did the Antient Churches grant it to any other: Nor would ſo much as receive Oblations for maintenance of Miniſters from others.</p>

            <head>Chap. II. <hi>That Chriſt inſtituted ſuch a Church-Form.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>§ 1. THat Chriſt inſtituted ſuch a Kingdom or National Church, I prove as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He was by the Prophets ſtill deſcribed as ſuch before his coming, as was to be the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> under him a National Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> was King in <hi>Jeſurun, Deut,</hi> 33. 5. and ſaid, <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up to you like to me, viz.</hi> that was a Prophet and King. <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> was the Type of Chriſt that was King of <hi>Salem,</hi> and Prieſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>David</hi> was herein a Type of Chriſt, and Chriſt was promiſed to ſit on his Throne, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Yet have I ſet my King on my holy Hill of Sion,</hi> Ezek. 37. 24. David <hi>my Servant ſhall be King over them, and they ſhall all have one Shepherd,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>My Servant</hi> David <hi>ſhall be their Prince for ever.</hi> So <hi>v.</hi> 27, 28. ſo <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 6. <hi>Ye ſhall be to me a Kingdom of Prieſts,</hi> Dan. 2. 44. Mark 11. 10. Pſal. 33. 12. <hi>Bleſſed is the Nation whoſe God is the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt is proclaimed the King of the Jews, and claimed that title and their ſubjection to him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 2. &amp; 27. 11. <hi>Mark</hi> 15. 2. He was of the Line of <hi>David,</hi> and had right to his Kingdom. He was ſcorned and crucified for that claim, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 29, 37. <hi>Mark</hi> 15. 9, 12, 18, 26. <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 37. <hi>John</hi> 19. 21. The People acknowledged him King by their <hi>Hoſanna.</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth them as Enemies that would not he ſhould Reign over them, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 14, 27.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He laid the Foundation of his offered National Kingdom among them: He owned the Title, and choſe twelve Apoſtles in relation to the twelve Tribes; and the ſeventy Diſciples related to their great Council: He would Preach to none but <hi>Iſrael,</hi> till they rejected him: He would have gathered all <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and her Children as the Hen gathereth her Chickens; but they would not, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 37. He deſtroyed them for refuſing him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He commiſſioned his Apoſtles to ſtay at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> till they rejected them. They made up the broken number of twelve as related to the twelve Tribes by <hi>Matthias,</hi> though <hi>Joſes</hi> and others had alſo followed Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He appointed them to Preach the Goſpel to Nations, and to diſciple Nations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:60966:9"/>
6. He planted the Gentiles into the ſame Olive-tree that the Jews were broken off from, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Jews had not been broken off from their National Church-ſtate, but for unbelief, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He tranſlated the Kingdom from them, to a Nation that would bring forth the fruits of it.</p>
            <p n="9">9. In due time the Kingdoms of the World were made the Ringdoms of the Lord and of his Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. &amp; 19.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Kings are to be the Churches Nurſing Fathers.</p>
            <p n="11">11. All Power in Heaven and Earth is given to Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. and by him Kings Reign. He is King of Kings, and not of ſingle perſons only.</p>
            <p n="12">12. But what need there any other proof, while all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians confeſs that All Kings are bound to be Chriſtian Kings, and to promote Chriſtianity to their Power; and all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Subjects to be Chriſtians: And are not they then bound to be Chriſtian Kingdoms; and that is National Churches?</p>
            <p>§ 2. When he had prepared them to be voluntary Subjects, by the Preaching of the Goſpel, and the Church came to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Chriſt actually ſet up National Kingdom-Churches; and Ruled by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> &amp; ſucceſſive Chriſtian Princes: And Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth rejoyced that he had taken to him his great Power and Reigned, and that the Kingdoms of the World were become his Kingdoms, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. &amp; 18. &amp; 19. Infancy is fitter for Inſtruction than to Govern. Man is made to uſe Reaſon; but he uſeth little in Infancy, or till maturity. That which was firſt in intention, is laſt in execution. Mature Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Man, and Princely Government in Kingdom-Churches, was firſt in intention, tho' not in execution. Who would wiſh that Pagans had ſtill Reigned? What Chriſtian wiſheth not that the <hi>Perſians, Indians, Turks, Tartars,</hi> &amp;c. were all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kingdoms? Why elſe do the Millennies hope for ſuch a ſtate of holy Government?</p>
            <p>§ 3. <hi>Obj.</hi> But tho' there be no doubt of the command, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and duty, what hope have we of the conſtitution, and event that Kingdoms ſhould become Chriſtian?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Our Queſtion is of the Inſtitution and Duty: confeſs that, and let us do our endeavour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is not this a Chriſtian Kingdom, while King and Subjects
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60966:9"/>
are baptized profeſſed Chriſtians? Are we a Proteſtant King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and not a Chriſtian Kingdom? And are not others ſuch?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But theſe be moſtly but nominal Hypocrite Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> They are viſible profeſſed Chriſtians. The Corn is not without Straw and Chaff. Do you look for Kingdoms that conſiſt only of the ſincere?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But Churches muſt conſiſt only of thoſe that ſeem ſincere.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> All ſeem ſincere that profeſs ſincerity, till it be by tryal and witneſs publickly diſproved. There are ſeveral degrees of ſeeming; ſome by fuller evidences than others; but all that Vow it, and ſtand to that Vow, do ſeem and profeſs it till diſproved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But how prove you that a Chriſtian Kingdom is a Church?</p>
            <p>

            <p>If it be the <hi>Name,</hi> 1. The word <hi>Eccleſia</hi> is uſed for even common Aſſemblies, and therefore much more for Chriſtian Societies.</p>

            <p>But make it not your pretence that only Prieſts are perſons Holy enough to be Heads of Churches, and not Kings; and therefore that it is no National Church that hath not a Clergy Head, Monarchical or Ariſtocratical; for that's the Popiſh Doctrine which I have confuted.</p>

            </head>
            <p>§ 1. IN the Execution of his Inſtitution, Chriſt in the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and after, made <hi>Judea</hi> it ſelf a National Church as far as a Province of the Empire may be called a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Empire, as Chriſtian, headed by one Chriſtian
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60966:10"/>
Soveraign, and materiated by Chriſtian Subjects obeying Chriſt both ſingly and in ſacred Aſſemblies under their Biſhops or El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, was all one National Church, that is, One Chriſtian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, long before promiſed by Chriſt, and prepared for: But as the Emperors allowed ſome Provinces to have ſubject tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary Kings, and others to enjoy moſt of their Antient Laws and Liberties, ſo they might <hi>ſecundum quid</hi> be called Kingdoms and National Churches, though they were but Provinces and parts of the Imperial Church. And thus <hi>Judea</hi> became a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church.</p>
            <p>§ 2. It is paſt queſtion that many Kings who had given up their Kingdom to the Pagan Beaſt, followed the ſucceſs of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and afterward did give up their Power to Chriſt, yet no Kingdom was wholly converted at once, nor of many years: But yet while the Soveraign Power and Confederate Chriſtian Paſtors and Subjects had the chief Power, it was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Chriſtian Kingdom: For the Form in capable matter doth denominate.</p>
            <p>And tho' many Heathens were long permitted in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that doth but prove that the Kingdom had two ſorts of free Subjects; one ſort that were Chriſtians, and ſo were the chief Members, who in all matters of Religion were exempted from Pagan Judicatures; and the other Heathens who had a freedom in things ſecular.</p>
            <p>§ 3. <hi>Judea</hi> then was more eminently Chriſtian than any other Nation of no greater extent: There were Arch Biſhops, and Biſhops, and Presbyters, and after a Patriarch: And there were more Monaſteries and Religious Societies, and more Temples built there, than in any Countrey that was no greater: And more Chriſtians flockt thither from other Nations out of a veneration for the place: And indeed it was the Mother-Church out of which all other Churches ſprang: Therefore if any Province might be called a National Church, it was <hi>Judea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 4. This was when the Fulneſs of the Gentiles came in; that is, when the Gentile Empire turned Chriſtian: And ſo the Gentile Powers turned Chriſtian, provoked the Jews to emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and requited them by becoming Nurſing Fathers to them, and bringing their Glory to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> And ſo all <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſaved; that is, the body of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60966:10"/>
alſo the faithful Gentiles that were the ſpiritual Seed, were unitedly gathered to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>§ 5. <hi>Obj.</hi> But they were moſtly Gentiles that then dwelt there: And that proveth no Converſion of the Jews.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The ſcattered Jews were in many Countreys of the Roman Empire: And moſt of them had neither mind nor means to return to a ſmall and barren Land: But as many as were willing and were zealous for their Countrey did live there, and none were forbidden: And it is far moſt probable that the moſt that were there left, were ſuch as kept their old Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And the moſt that were kill'd were the military part: In the days of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and after their Churches flouriſhed: And what greater encouragement could they have now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, were they converted, than they had? None would make them go againſt their wills: If Gentile, Chriſtians and Jews were there mixt, they did the more fitly ſuit a Catholick Church-ſtate; when <hi>Moſes</hi> Policy and their Peculiarity ceaſed.</p>
            <p>Should they in the feigned Fifth Monarchy-ſtate, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to that Countrey, which is like our <hi>Wales,</hi> how contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible a Nation would they be, in compariſon of what <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> allowed them, both in <hi>Judea,</hi> and throughout all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire?

                  </expan> Tabulae,</hi> and Head of the Church as a Chriſtian Kingdom. And for want of knowing this, and the true nature and bounds of his Office, how foully many have miſcarried, I have ſhewed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe called <hi>Eraſtians,</hi> carry it too far, and give the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate part of the Office of the Paſtors, even the Keys of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the Church as a Church, and of Excommunication; which God hath put into the hand of the Paſtors, by as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate a Commiſſion, as he hath put the Sword into the hand of the Magiſtrate. And by this over-doing they undo: They would ruine the Prince on pretence of defending his Power: For all <hi>Authority</hi> hath alſo <hi>Obligation</hi> to duty: And muſt Princes and Magiſtrates be put on the task of trying the Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of all that are to be Baptized, Confirmed, Abſolved or Excommunicated? Then they muſt leave their own Calling, for they will here find work enough. This is like the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts making the People Judges, by which they would undo them, calling them from their Callings, to take on them a work of which they are uncapable, and about which they will never long agree, and making them reſponſible to God for all their Male-adminiſtration: As if the King muſt not only be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of Phyſicions, but muſt be a Phyſicion himſelf, and give Medicines, and be anſwerable for the Patients lives: Or muſt be a Schoolmaſter becauſe he governeth Schoolmaſters: And this puts them on a neceſſity of caſting out true Diſcipline, and holding the Opinion that Sacramental Communication ſhould be common to the Godly, and the openly Wicked, as being a Converting Ordinance; and that Excommunication is but Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. Juſt as thoſe Dioceſans that will have no Biſhops but one over a thouſand or many ſcore or hundred Pariſhes, by pleading for their ſole Epiſcopal Power, take on them the ſole Obligation to Epiſcopal duty, and ſo make themſelves reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for that work which requireth many hundred men, and under themſelves while they undo the Churches, and leave all true Diſcipline undone, and mock (not God, but) men and themſelves with names and ceremonious ſhadows.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And the Papal and French Prelatiſts, have by this Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, got a fixed falſe Opinion, that, as Paſtors are the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60966:11"/>
Heads of Particular Churches, ſo they muſt be of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches, and that every National Church muſt be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſpecified by one Clergy Soveraignty, in one perſon, or in a Colledge or Ariſtocracy: Or elſe that a Chriſtian Kingdom is not properly a <hi>Church;</hi> becauſe it hath not a Prieſtly Head. It's true, that it is not univocally a <hi>Church</hi> of the ſame ſpecies or rank as a Paſtoral Church is, but is more eminently, and as fitly called a Church, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And the Independent Separatiſts and Anabaptiſts, for want of underſtanding this, as I ſaid before, cry down Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Churches with ſcorn, and run away from National Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, into endleſs Diviſions and Sects, while at the ſame time they pray and wait for National Churches in the <hi>Millennium</hi> as the Fifth Monarchy. And none of them will deny it to be the Duty of all Kings and Kingdoms to be Chriſtians; and ſo that Chriſtian Kingdoms are Chriſt's Inſtitution and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>§ 3. But the Soveraign is the Judge, what Paſtors and Churches he ſhall allow and maintain as parts of the National Church or Kingdom. As the Colledge is to judge who is fit to be a Phyſicion, and the Patient who ſhall be his Phyſicion, and the truſted Phyſicion, what Medicine he ſhall give: But the King to judge whom he will allow in his Kingdom, and to make Laws forbidding poiſonous Drugs and abuſes of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicions.</p>
            <p>Even ſo the Ordainers are Judges who are fit to be Paſtors, and the People whom they will truſt their Souls with as <hi>their</hi> Paſtors, and the truſted Paſtors to judge what Doctrine to Preach, and whom to receive to Communion, or to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate; but the King to judge whom he will allow, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or tolerate as Members of the Chriſtian Kingdom or National Church.</p>
            <p>§ 4. That all eſſential parts of a National Church, are not the Form that denominateth (as aforeſaid) needs no more proof, than that <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Privation</hi> (by which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> meant <hi>Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitio Materiae receptiva)</hi> are not the Form of a Natural Body: So that <hi>Confederate Paſtoral Churches</hi> are <hi>neceſſary,</hi> yea <hi>eſſential matter</hi> of a National Church or Chriſtian Kingdom, when it is paſt being a meer <hi>Embrio,</hi> or unſhapen Maſs, and is come to be a well ſhapen Politick Body: Till then it is but as the body in the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60966:12"/>
womb, while the <hi>punctum ſaiiens</hi> firſt maketh the Heart, Eyes, Brain and Arteries, before it hath made the Stomach, Liver, Lungs and Inteſtines. It is not yet come to ſhew what Chriſt's Inſtitution of a Church was.</p>
            <p>§ 5. But our great Controverſies are,</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. Who be the Organical Paſtors that muſt make up a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church.</item>
               <item>II. Who muſt be the Lay-members of thoſe Churches.</item>
               <item>III. What that Confederacy muſt be that muſt unite them.</item>
               <item>IV. How far the Members are bound by that Confederacy.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And becauſe Ignorance hath made theſe Points of ſo much Controverſie and Conſequence, I will open them diſtinctly. By which I conjecture it will appear, that Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but about the right wording of the definition of a National Church.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="5" type="chapter">
            <head>Chap. V. <hi>Of Paſtors or the Biſhops of National Churches, that they are to be of Three ranks.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>§ 1. THat Paſtors are the prime neceſſary part of the <hi>Matter</hi> of a Kingdom-Church (tho' not the Unifying Form) is plain in Scripture, and in the nature of their Office, and of a Church.</p>
            <p>§ 2. The Independent Separatiſts therefore ſhew groſs Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when they make a meer Community unorganized to be a Church <hi>in ſenſu Politico,</hi> and then muſt have a Lay-man that was of the Univerſal Church before, to be by the Peoples Votes choſen a Member of that Church while it hath no Paſtor, and then choſen their Paſtor after. Whereas a meer Community is no more a Political Church without a Paſtor, than a Community is a Kingdom that hath no King (individual or collective, exiſtent or virtual.) Or than this can be a School without a Schoolmaſter, or a Family without a Head of it.</p>
            <p>§ 3. As Nature firſt formeth by the Soul and Spirits <hi>ex ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria ſeminis,</hi> the heart and prime organical parts, and by them formeth all the reſt, and laſt of all formeth the Stomach and Inteſtines to be the Organs of future nutrition, and then putteth in the nutriment, (which in the Chicken is the Yelk of the Egg, the bodily <hi>ſtamina</hi> being firſt made of the white) and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60966:12"/>
then cloſeth up the before encloſed ſtomach upon that food; ſo Chriſt did firſt by his Calband Spirit make ſome prime organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal General or Indefinite Miniſters, and by them make others, fixed in particular Churches and Offices, and by them edifie and feed, and perfect the Body by their Official Miniſtration, and fit the people to digeſt the received food for their continued nutrition.</p>
            <p>And as the King firſt maketh General Officers for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Army, and then by them, or immediately commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Generals and Captains to raiſe their ſeveral Regiments and Companies, and doth not make the common Souldiers before the Officers, that are to Rule them; ſo was it done by Chriſt at the gathering of his Church. But when a Church is gathered (or an Army raiſed) they are not to be diſſolved (or disbanded) when the Paſtor (the Captains or Generals) die, but continue in the exiſtent ſtate of a Community, and the ſtate of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Policy till a Paſtor (or Ruler) be choſen, becauſe the Legal Inſtitution <hi>de ſpecie,</hi> keeps up a virtual or intentional Policy ſtill.</p>
            <p>§ 4. Chriſt's firſt Inſtituted Officers were Apoſtles, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Inferior Official Diſciples, immediately from himſelf, to convert Souls, and make them fit matter for his Kingdom-Church; and theſe were afterward to gather into diſtinct re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Congregate Churches, ſuch as were ſo converted by their Miniſtry, and to place fixed Elders over them.</p>
            <p>§ 5. Theſe Twelve Apoſtles and Seventy Diſciples were firſt inſtituted in and for a National Church ſtate. Chriſt found the Jews under a National Form, and therefore did not at firſt change that Form, but only changed the Laws and Ordinances made for their Infant ſtate of peculiarity, which he had fulfilled for them, they being but a Paedagogy to lead to and till Chriſt.</p>
            <p>§ 6. It's plain that the number of Twelve and Seventy were choſen as related to the Twelve Tribes (all then in being and known) and of the Sanedrim or great Council: And therefore a National Form of Church-Officers, and not yet Univerſal nor Congregational.</p>
            <p>§ 7. Therefore Chriſt himſelf would not Preach beyond the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor give the Childrens bread to Dogs till he was finally rejected by the Children of the Kingdom, and' ſo the Kingdom taken from them, and given to a Nation that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60966:13"/>
would bring forth the fruits of it. And he forbad his Apoſtles to go among the Gentiles, and confined them to the loſt Sheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 8. It is plain that Chriſt would have this juſt number of twelve kept up in relation to the twelve Tribes, till the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was taken from them, becauſe one, and but one was to be choſen in <hi>Judas</hi> room, and ſo the due number of the Twelve to be kept up.</p>
            <p>This proveth the Inſtitution of a diſparity of Miniſters.</p>
            <p>§ 8. The Keys of the Kingdom were given firſt to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, before the empowering of the ſeventy, and that as to diſtinct ſuperior Officers. And the word <hi>Keys</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> when Chriſt is ſaid to have the Keys, it is expounded by his <hi>opening and no man ſhutteth, and ſhutteth and no man openeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Government was laid on his ſhoulders as King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>And as his Father gave the Keys and ſent him, ſo he ſent his Apoſtles and gave power to them.</p>
            <p>§. 9. But there is no doubt but this Power called the Keys or Governing Power, extended both to the ordinary and the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary part of the Apoſtles Office, and included even ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous power as <hi>Peter</hi> executed on <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> on <hi>Elymas,</hi> and which is called giving up to Satan, that the <hi>Fleſh may be deſtroyed,</hi> and they may <hi>learn not to blaſpheme.</hi> When there were no Chriſtian Magiſtrates, Chriſt made his Apoſtles the executioners of his juſtice, (as to ſentence, as Satan was in executing their ſentence) not when and how they pleaſed, but as the Spirit determined them.</p>
            <p>§. 10. That the office of the Apoſtles was partly for an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſort of work, to be continued to the end of the World, and partly for the extraordinary work, which ended with them, or is now ceaſed, is paſt diſpute.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The extraordinary work was, 1. To be immediately ſent by Chriſts own mouth, and to go upon that Miſſion, and act by that Commiſſion, (in which alſo the ſeventy did concur.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. To be the Witneſſes of what they had ſeen Chriſt do, and of what they had heard him ſay.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To deliver this to the World by Preaching and Writing as ſuch firſt Witneſſes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To do this under a Promiſe of Chriſt, that he would give
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60966:13"/>
them his Spirit to bring all things to remembrance, and to lead them Infallibly into all Truth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To ſpeak the Languages which they had never learnt by art or uſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To work Miracles to confirm their Teſtimony and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; and to have the Gifts of Prophecy, Healing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which tho others did partake with them, yet it was but for a time, and not as a ſtanding Office and Power.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To Sentence ſome men (as aforeſaid) to Satans Execution.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To be the firſt planters of Congregate Churches, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers of their Paſtors or Elders, and authorized to inſtitute ſuch Orders and Subordinate Officers, (Deacons, Deaconneſſes,) by the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, as ſhould continue.</p>
            <p n="9">9. To be Inſpired Infallible Expounders of the Prophecies and Types of the Old Teſtament. And the Infallible deciders of Controverſies.</p>
            <p n="10">10. To be Inſtrumental by Impoſition of Hands in giving the extraordinary miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt to others.</p>
            <p>All theſe are works that God hath made no Promiſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to the end, and therefore this part of their office ceaſeth.</p>
            <p>§. 11. II. Theſe following Works of the Apoſtles ceaſe not, and therefore in theſe they have Succeſſours to the end.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To Preach Gods Word, and Publiſh the Goſpel by voice or writing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Indefinitely to Teach and make Diſciples of all Nations, (tho' they could not Univerſally go to all, yet to go as far as they could, and as they were called.)</p>
            <p n="3">3. To gather Churches of the Converted, and ſettle Elders over them, and to be chief (tho' not ſole) Agents and Guides in ordaining them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To take care and overſight as General Paſtors of the Churches Gathered and Ordered; as being not confined to be Officers only of this or that ſingle Congregation, (tho' they might alſo divide their Provinces for order ſake, and have their moſt uſual habitation fixed.)</p>
            <p n="5">5. To adminiſter the Sacraments of Baptiſm and the Lords Supper where ever they came, as General Miniſters.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To cenſure or uſe diſcipline authoritatively in various Churches.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To try Cauſes upon Appeals from ſeveral Congregations.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:60966:14"/>
8. To do all this as inſtituted Officers Superior to the Interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or particular fixed Elders and Churches. All theſe continue.</p>
            <p>§. 12. That all theſe are works to be continued is plain in Scripture. 1. The firſt is common to them with all Chriſts Miniſters in the Office of Elders. And ſo is the fifth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond muſt be done by all occaſionally and as far as the work of their particular Churches will allow; But that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth much from doing it as the Work of a General Officer ſpecially Commiſſioned for ſuch general Indefinite work, and tied to no one ſetled Church, ſave for Temporary ſervice. As we uſe to ſay, [that which is every mans work is well done by none, in compariſon of that which ſome are ſpecially appointed to.] Others may do it: Theſe muſt do it. Others will make it their ſecond work, but theſe their firſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſame I ſay of gathering and ſetling particular Churches: Others may do it: Theſe muſt do it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth is proper to general Officers, to take a ſtated official care and overſight of many Churches as confined to no one. <hi>Others</hi> muſt <hi>Secondarily</hi> take a <hi>Brotherly</hi> care; But <hi>General Officers</hi> take a <hi>Fatherly Stated</hi> care of them as their <hi>province</hi> or <hi>charge.</hi> It would be tedious to cite all the texts that mention <hi>Pauls</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and ſuch others care to preſerve and edifie the ſeveral Churches which they had planted. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtaid at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> ſome years to carry on this edifying ſetling work: ſo did <hi>John</hi> and other Apoſtles in their Provinces. This was not to play the Biſhop in other mens Dioceſs, as it would be in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Paſtor if he ſhould intrude without the particular Paſtors conſent; which yet a General Officer may do.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſame I ſay of Cenſuring.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And of trying Cauſes officially in various Congregations. There is the ſame reaſon for theſe in all Ages as there was in the firſt.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And that all this be done as by General Officers ſuperior to the particular fixed Elders, hath the ſame reaſon for it now as it had at the firſt. All theſe are works that may ſtill be done; and therefore muſt have Officers to do them.</p>
            <p>§ 13. That Chriſt intended a ſetled Inſtitution of ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity of Miniſters as to the <hi>Ordinary</hi> part of the Apoſtolick Office, I prove as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe having found a diſparity before in the Jewiſh
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60966:14"/>
Church, he offered not to repeal it, when he offered to gather all that Church to himſelf, as a Hen gathereth her Chickens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her Wings. Yea he ſent the Lepers to the Prieſts and bid men hear them in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair; and owned the diſparity.</p>
            <p>§ 14. Becauſe he formed a diſparity himſelf, as is aforeſaid between the Twelve Apoſtles and the Seventy, and that in ſome Conformity to the Jewiſh Church Policy. And tells his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles that they ſhall Judge the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 15. Becauſe he ſuiteth his Governing Laws and Diſcipline much to what he found among the <hi>Jews.</hi> This is evident in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. where he doth but vindicate the Law from the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees abuſe: And <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15. where he formeth his Diſcipline much to their Method. And many Learned men have proved that the Jews Baptized Proſelites before <hi>John</hi> and Chriſt Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. And they had the Ten Commandments before: And <hi>Selden</hi> and others ſhew that they had a Prayer before very like the Lords Prayer. And <hi>Grotius</hi> ſheweth that they had Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues in every City, even to ſmall numbers, like our Pariſh Churches or Chappels. And Chriſt ſubmitted to the Rulers of the Synagogues for his own leave to Preach.</p>
            <p>§ 16. I once doubted (in my Diſpute of Church Government) whether the Apoſtles Superiority was not only for their peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar advantages of Knowledge and Gifts, rather than a ſetled Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of Office, and whether <hi>any Paſtors</hi> might not do <hi>all their</hi> Ordinary continued work. But (beſides the ſingularity of that doubt) I was ſoon convinced of an Official Superiority and Diſparity, not only becauſe a <hi>Judas</hi> had been one, but becauſe the number of Twelve in Superiority was to be kept up, by the choice of his Succeſſor; even one from among thoſe that had been Witneſſes of Chriſts Words and Works as well as he. And by <hi>Pauls</hi> being made a thirteenth Apoſtle when the Goſpel was to be carried further than to the Jews: And his claim of Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Power and Priviledges.</p>
            <p>§ 17. Eſpecially becauſe I find Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the General Office as well as the Particular, even go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into all the World to Diſciple whole Nations, as well as to teach them to obſerve Chriſts Commands, promiſing to be with them to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>§ 18. And alſo becauſe it is apparent that Preaching the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to Heathen and Infidel Nations is a Work ſtill to be done,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60966:15"/>
and for want of men purpoſely appointed to do it, the progreſs of the Goſpel hath been wofully ſtopt; Few doing any thing in it but Mr. <hi>Eliots</hi> and a few honeſt men in <hi>New England,</hi> and they ſay ſome of the Dutch, and the Jeſuits and Fryers that do it corruptly. Particular Church Work is below this.</p>
            <p>§ 19. And I am fully confirmed when I find that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves ſetled a General ſort of Miniſters in Superiority and General Work to ſucceed them. As Chriſt himſelf by his Spirit made <hi>Barnabas</hi> an Apoſtle, ſo he gave to his Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Evangeliſts who were General helpers of the Apoſtles, and were put in a ſtate of Diſparity and Superiority. <hi>Sil as</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> and <hi>Apollos,</hi> and many more are named. The texts that mention the General Office and Superior power of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> are ſo well known and oft cited, that it's needleſs to repeat them. The charge of ſetling and overſeeing many Churches (as in <hi>Crete)</hi> and of caution in Impoſition of Hands, receiving accuſations, rebuking ſharply, ruling them well, ordaining Biſhops and Deacons: and much more the like.</p>
            <p>I never thought <hi>Saravia</hi> and the Kings Arguments in the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> well anſwered. Mr. <hi>Prins</hi> and the common anſwer is, that theſe were not Biſhops, but Evangeliſts. I grant it, but that confirmeth me. For the name <hi>Biſhop</hi> was then ordinarily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to fixed particular Church Elders: But our queſtion is not <hi>de nomine</hi> but <hi>de re,</hi> an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> &amp; <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> were <hi>above</hi> ſuch Biſhops. Call them Apoſtles (as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> proveth that the Fathers oft call them) or call them Evangeliſts, or Arch Biſhops or General Biſhops or Dioceſans or Provincial Biſhops, it is not the name that is our Controverſie. It proveth that the Apoſtles did ſettle a ſort of <hi>General Overſeers</hi> to gather and take care of many <hi>inferior Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Churches,</hi> to ſucceed them in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary part of their Office.</p>
            <p>§ 20. But another argument fixeth me in this opinion, and that is, that when it is fully proved that Chriſt inſtituted ſuch a Diſparity and Superiority he that will affirm that this doth not now continue and bind us, muſt prove the repeal or revocation, or prove that he did make this eſtabliſhment but for a time, and how long that was. But Scripture plainly aſſerteth that he <hi>then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi> the foreſaid <hi>Diſparity,</hi> and hath any as plainly proved that he <hi>repealed it,</hi> or <hi>confined</hi> it to that Age? It is not proved that I have ſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:60966:15"/>
And to aſſert this without proof is, 1. To make Chriſts <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions</hi> to ſignifie but what mans fancy thinks meet, and make us the Maſters of his Laws, before we will be ruled by them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a charging Chriſt with temerity or diſhonourable mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability, as Inſtituting one form of Church Miniſtry and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for one Age, and changing it preſently for another.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It ſeemeth a dangerous taking Gods Name in vain, by affirming ſuch a mutability of him, and change of his Laws, without any proof.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It defameth the ſtate of his Church when it was under Perſecution, and when Heaven and Earth after rejoiced in its deliverance, as if all that time it had been corrupt by owning the foreſaid Diſparity. And it's dangerous Preſumption to Father on God that which he never did, and never owned.</p>
            <p>§ 21. But no doubt but the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of this <hi>Superior Office</hi> or <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> are undetermined by God (ſave as by General Rules) and may be altered.</p>
            <p>As 1. Whether there ſhall be <hi>One only</hi> or <hi>Two</hi> ſuch General Miniſters in one and the ſame Dioceſs or Province. Chriſt ſent out his Preachers by two and two. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> went out by Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were together at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Grotius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> think that for the firſt times, till the Chriſtian <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> became one Communion, the great Cities <hi>(Rome, Alexandria, Antioch, &amp;c.)</hi> had each two Congregate Churches, and two Biſhops (were it but for language ſake.) And as I think the Jewiſh and Gentile Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Miniſters, during the time of Miraculous Gifts, (while no Chriſtian Magiſtrates Ruled) were the two Witneſſes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Apocalypſe, ſo I conjecture that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were the radical inſtances of them.</p>
            <p>And when two join together it may take off envy from each.</p>
            <p>Yet this is undetermined in Scripture and left to humane Prudence. If two cannot agree, how will ſuch agree others?</p>
            <p>§ 22. The Scots had at firſt a General viſiter, that was really a General Biſhop. But the Viſitors aſpiring and abuſe changed that way. But I am told that in <hi>Ulſter</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> each Claſſical Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod chuſe two Grave Divines, and ſend them out to Preach in any Congregation in that Claſſis, where they ſee cauſe. As where there are young raw men, or men ſuſpected of Hereſy,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60966:16"/>
or men of ſcandalous fame; and to admoniſh and counſel ſuch; and to tell the People that if they had any thing againſt their Miniſters, they ſhould tell them, and they would try them in the Claſſical Synod: I think this is real and laudable Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whatever name it have.</p>
            <p>§ 23. It is alſo undetermined how large the Dioceſs be of the ſaid General Miniſter (while he excludeth not Inferiors.) As Prudence would teach the Apoſtles to Preach in ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, and not all in one (when they left <hi>Jeruſalem.)</hi> So Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon teacheth Men ſtill to divide and know their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Provinces.</p>
            <p>§ 24. It is undetermined how long each one ſhall ſtay in one City or place: As <hi>Paul</hi> did long at <hi>Epheſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 25. And it is left to Prudence how many ſubordinate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Churches there, ſhall each overſee, ſo they overthrow not the ſaid ſubordinate Officers and Churches.</p>
            <p>§ 26. And it is left to Prudence what ſecular Lands or Riches they ſhall have (called <hi>Glebe.)</hi> And what ſecular ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour they ſhall have. As to be Barons and Lords, or to ſit in Parliaments, though Reaſon ſaith that Laws about Religion and the Church affairs, ſhould not be made without the advice of them who are ſo greatly intruſted with Religion; And yet that their Riches ſhould be ſuch as may not be too ſtrong a Temptation to Senſuality, Worldlineſs, Pride and Tyranniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over their Brethren.</p>
            <p>§ 27. There are three ranks of Biſhops: Two if not all three of Divine Inſtitution; And when any one of the three would ſuppreſs the other two, they are corrupted into a ſinful Tyranny.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The ordinary Presbyters are <hi>Epiſcopi Gregis,</hi> Biſhops over the Flocks: So called and proved not only by <hi>Grotius (paſſim)</hi> but by moſt Papiſts, and Proteſtants; ſpecially expoſitors on <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Churches being firſt gathered uſually under ſome one Paſtor, and he taking in the ripeſt of his Converts or Diſciples to become his aſſiſting Presbyters, and to avoid diviſions, that <hi>one</hi> (or ſome other) was choſen to be <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopus Praeſes,</hi> the <hi>Preſident Biſhop</hi> of that particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate Church: As the incumbents in big Pariſhes are with us. And tho I can prove no Inſtitution of this but by Gods
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60966:16"/>
General Commands (of doing all in Order, Unity and to Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication) yet we have reaſon to believe that it was begun in the Apoſtles days, if <hi>Jerom</hi> ſay true about <hi>Mark</hi> at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> who died before <hi>John.</hi> And I find no party of Chriſtians againſt it of many hundred years, perhaps not of a thouſand, for even <hi>Aerius</hi> called it not unlawful: And the Novatians, Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, and other Sects were Zealous for this ſort of Epiſcopacy.</p>
            <p n="3">III. And that a Superior ſort of Succeſſors to the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts were of Divine Inſtitution I have proved before.</p>
            <p>§ 28. The appropriating the name of BISHOPS to this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rank, here called the Dioceſanes, contrary to Scripture and Truth, hath proved a miſchievous ſnare for Deceit and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. For hereby firſt our Innovators have denied the Pariſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents to be true Paſtors; ſecondly, And the Pariſh Churches to be true Political Churches for want of proper Biſhops or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, but only parts of the Dioceſan Church; As if that were <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fimae ſpecei.</hi> 3. By this they have made the ignorant Laity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that thoſe ordained by the <hi>Proeſtotes,</hi> the parochial Preſident Biſhops, are ordained by no Biſhops at all, and ſo muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained. And 4. they are become the grand Enemies of Epiſcopacy, putting down many hundred Biſhops to ſet up one alone. And yet <hi>perfrictâ fronte</hi> have called ſuch as are for more, <hi>Antiepiſcopal</hi> and themſelves the Epiſcopal party. Juſt as if one Schoolmaſter or Phyſition, ſhould put down many hundred that he may be the only Schoolmaſter and Phyſition, or one Judge put down all the Juſtices and Mayors, and then impudently ſay that they are againſt Phyſitions, Schoolmaſters and Juſtices, and he only is for them.</p>
            <p>But who can expect Truth or Modeſty from Ungodly, Worldly, Proud, Tyrannical Men.</p>
            <p>Tho it is not the Name that is our Controverſie; I allow them the Name of Dioceſanes. Yet abuſe of Names hath been of miſchievous effects.</p>
            <p>§ 29. Such Dioceſane or General Biſhops as put down all the Particular fixed Biſhops and Churches, are not only no ſort of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of Chriſts Inſtitution, but are Pernicious Enemies to Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy and the Churches. As nominal Apoſtles would have been had they put down all the Particular Churches and Biſhops which they ſhould overſee; or a General Commander that would put down all the Collonels and Captains.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:60966:17"/>
§ 30. To refuſe to be ordained by ſuch uſurping Enemies, and to diſown them, is not to refuſe true Epiſcopacy.</p>
            <p>§ 31. If theſe uſurping Biſhops would ſwear Men to obey them, and refuſe to ordain any that will not Aſſent, Conſent, Subſcribe or Covenant, to ſin againſt God by Omiſſion or Commiſſion, eſpecially many great and hainous ſins, he that refuſeth ſuch ordination may truly ſay, he could not be ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; the Biſhop was the refuſer and not he: And he hath better ordination that is ordained by Pariſh Biſhops on lawful Terms.</p>
            <p>§ 32. Yet if the Chriſtian Prince make a true Dioceſan that putteth not down the Pariſh Churches, to be of the <hi>Quorums,</hi> and have a Negative voice in Ordinations, of ſuch as he will own and maintain; I think none ſhould ſcruple ſubmiſſion: For while Dioceſans are good Men, it ſeemeth to be a way ſafe and orderly.</p>
            <p>§ 33. There are two degrees of depoſing the Pariſh Paſtors:</p>
            <p n="1">I. When ſomewhat eſſential to their Office it ſelf is denied <hi>de ſpecie.</hi> (As Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> would have the Office made and ſpecified by the Will and Intention of the Ordainer.) This <hi>only</hi> the <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaters</hi> are guilty of.</p>
            <p n="2">II. When the Eſſentials of the Office are owned, but the <hi>exerciſe</hi> ſinfully reſtrained. This the Old Engliſh Canons and Biſhops were guilty of. But it unhappily was by fitting their Canons to the State of the Pariſh Prieſts that came newly out of Popery, and were by ignorance and errour unfit for their Office and Work.</p>
            <p>But of all this I treated with unqueſtionable evidence of Truth in my Treatiſe of Epiſcopacy, which is yet unanſwered.</p>
            <p>§ 34. Thoſe that only abuſively reſtrain the Pariſh Paſtors in the exerciſe of their Offices, and are but miſgoverning Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſans, may yet be owned as true Miniſters <hi>de ſpecie</hi> tho we muſt not own their ſinful Miſgovernment: But thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the very Office of the Pariſh Paſtors in any eſſential part, and their Churches, are no true Miniſters of Chriſt <hi>de ſpecie,</hi> nor to be owned as ſuch while they will be the ſole Paſtors of many hundred Congregations.</p>
            <p>§ 35. How came this General Epiſcopacy that was to gather and fix Churches to be ſo much ceaſed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. By the difficulty and coſtlineſs of the work of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60966:17"/>
Travels and Labours: Miniſters choſe the eaſier ſtate of a fixed particular Miniſtry. 2. The particular Biſhops living among Heathens, found work enough on thoſe within their reach, and ſo by degrees conjoined the two Offices of General and Particular Epiſcopacy into one. 3. And when the Heathen near them were converted, ambition drew them to enlarge their Particular Churches into one Dioceſan Church, inſtead of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the new Swarms into a new Hive, under a true particular Biſhop. And thus Satan hath by ſubtilty, reduced the Churches to be too like to the Heathen World, by killing Religion, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into Hypocritical Ceremony and meer Names, while one Biſhop will needs undertake the work of many Score or Hundreds, which he cannot poſſibly perform.</p>
            <p>§ 36. <hi>Q.</hi> How prove you that the Largeneſs of the Dioceſs altereth the Species of Epiſcopacy and Churches?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It doth not at all if it put not down the ſubordinate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Paſtors and Churches; But if it turn them into half-Paſtors and Chappels, by deſtroying their eſſence it is eaſily proved: Becauſe it is two ſorts of Communion that ſpecifie the two ſorts of Churches and Paſtors. The loweſt particular ſort is for preſential perſonal Communion, of ſuch as may perſonally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and may know each other, and may at leaſt ſometime aſſemble for ſuch Communion: But National, Provincial or Dioceſane Communion is but by diſtant agreement in the ſame Profeſſion, among perſons perhaps many hundred Miles diſtant that never ſee each other. And the Miniſterial Work doth accordingly differ. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> maintaineth that in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture times there were no Biſhops that had any more than a Congregation to whom he Preached and Perſonally Officia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

            <p>§ 3. The Priviledges of ſome that are not Disfranchiſed or Excommunicate, may yet be ſuſpended while they are under trial. For as nothing but Capital Crimes or Excommunication for Impenitence after due Admonition doth cut them off, ſo while they have rendered this juſtly queſtionable, juſt Legal Tryal muſt needs ſuſpend their queſtioned right, till Judgment decide it, whether they be impenitent or not, or their Crime be Capital.</p>
            <p>§ 4. In the Jewiſh State, many hainous Sins were to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Death.

And dead men can be no Church Members on Earth: Therefore this Death for Sin was an Excommunication and more. Therefore they that Plead that any ſuch ſhould be tolerated becauſe the Jews were often ſuch and not Excommunicated, is to plead the example of Criminals againſt the expreſs Letter of the Law, and argue <hi>à facto prohibito contra legem prohibentem.</hi> And whether Mr. <hi>Galaſpi</hi> and others have proved any more than Church-Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt any but thoſe that were to be put to Death, I leave the Reader to conſider.</p>
            <p>§ 5. It is a Controverſie, whether the Church be in the Common Wealth (or Kingdom) or the Common Wealth in the Church: And the former is by moſt aſſerted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Under Infidel or Heathen Kings that are out of the Church themſelves, the Church is in the Common Wealth. 2. And under Chriſtian Kings or other Soveraigns, the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches are in the Common Wealth as parts in the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60966:18"/>
whole. 3. And as the Common Wealth is taken ſo largely as to comprehend Pagans in Inferior Magiſtracy (as in the days of the firſt Chriſtian Emperors; there the Church is in the Common Wealth.</p>
            <p>But take the Common Wealth as meerly and truly Chriſtian, and it is the ſame thing with the National Church, and one is not in the other, being but two Names for one thing.</p>
            <p>§ 6. The appropriating the Name of the Church to the Clergy as diſtinct from the Laity, is the Plot or Part of Popiſh Tyranny and Fallacy: Implying falſly that the National Church muſt be ſpecified and unified by a Prieſtly Head, Monarchical or Ariſtocratical; and that a King is not a perſon ſacred enough to be the Supream Head in his own National Church; Nor the people Holy enough to be its Materials: As if Lords, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Citizens and other Lay Chriſtians were no parts of the Church, when Great Magiſtrates are Nobler parts than a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Ignorant Vicious Curates and Prieſts.</p>
            <p>§ 7. From this Cheat they have claimed the ſole Power as of Divine Right, of making Canons that ſhall be obliging Laws, and of being the ſole determiners of Religious Caſes. Too many Presbyterians, and Independants are for this Clergy claim, calling only the Miniſters work, the exerciſe of Chriſts Kingly Office. But the Frenchified Prelatiſts much more.</p>

            <p>§ 1. AFfirmatively. 1. A Baptiſmal Confederacy, to be all the true Subjects of one God, one Chriſt and Holy Ghoſt, againſt the Devil, World and Fleſh.</p>
            <p>§ 2. 2. A Conſent to live as Chriſtians in Love to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and to addict our ſelves to the good of one another, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the welfare of the whole Body, and to do as we would (juſtly) be done by.</p>
            <p>§ 3. 3. To be all the Loyal ſubjects of one Chriſtian Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns Power.</p>
            <p>§ 4. 4. To be all for the publick Worſhiping of God and our Redeemer in Chriſtian Aſſemblies, guided and ruled by Chriſtian Paſtors (or Biſhops) qualified and deſcribed by Chriſt in his Word the inſtituter of the Paſtoral Office, and not of any new ſort of humane Miniſtry, or uncapable perſons that are wanting in any thing eſſential to the Office.</p>
            <p>§ 5. 5. To take the Sacred Scripture for the Word of God, and the ſufficent Rule of Divine Faith and Holy living; And to profeſs an explicite Belief of the Creed as it was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us from the Apoſtolick Churches, and to take the Lords Prayer for the ſummary rule of our deſires and hopes; and the Decalogue as owned and expounded by Chriſt, for the ſummary rule of our Obedience, with the Sacraments inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him.</p>
            <p>§ 6. 6. To profeſs Obedience to true Authority in Parents, Magiſtrates and Paſtors and all true Governours, ſo far as they are empowered by God, and to obey God above all, and no men againſt him and his Laws. And Rulers to profeſs to obey God, and Rule as his Miniſters for the Common welfare and to promote the obedience of Gods Laws.</p>
            <p>§ 7. 7. For Magiſtrates, Paſtors and Parents, to profeſs their endeavour to promote the true Preaching of the Goſpel, and the tranſmitting of it in Purity to Poſterity, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and not unjuſtly forbid or hinder the publication and practice of it.</p>
            <p>§ 8. Negatively, 1. It is not meet that this confederacy ſo appropriate the Body of the National Church, to any one
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60966:19"/>
Party or Sect though it ſhould be (or thought to be) ſounder or better than the reſt, excluding any that have all the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries before named, though they have many tolerable errors and imperfections.</p>
            <p>§ 9. It is not lawful to make things unneceſſary to be taken or uſed as neceſſary to the National Church Unity. Nor to make ſnares and impoſe them by ſuch needleſs Laws, to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or eject any true and tolerable Miniſters; much leſs the ſoundeſt; impoſing things ſinful or needleſs, or that are unfit to be the Conditions of Unity, and ſo unavoidably excluding capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conſcionable worthy men for want of complying with thoſe terms, is the commoneſt cauſe of Schiſm in the Chriſtian World, and the effect of Ignorance, Pride and Tyranny, none being more worthy to be excluded than ſuch Schiſmatical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluders, that make the Laws that ſhould be the bonds of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, to be the greateſt Engines of Diviſion.</p>
            <p>§ 10. The preſent Orthodox Proteſtant Nonconformiſts, are as truely Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> juſtly ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as any Dioceſans or Conformiſts in the Land, and if they be not better confuted than hitherto they have been, they may truely be ſaid to be the ſoundeſt, moſt judicious, and moſt conſcionable, and the moſt peaceable Members of this Church. And to deny ſuch Nonconformiſts to be true and honourable parts of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is but ſuch an effect of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Arrogance and Slanders as is the ſhame of the ſpeaker, and implieth ſome diſhonourable definition of the ſaid Church. And they that make their mutable Forms and Ceremonies eſſential to the Church, make a Ceremony of the Church it ſelf, and cannot anſwer the Papiſts that challenge us to prove its antiquity: Our Liturgy is not ſo old as <hi>Luthers</hi> time.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Rome</hi> by claiming to be the <hi>whole</hi> Church, hath made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny think that it is not ſo much as a part; ſo Conformiſts calling themſelves the <hi>whole</hi> Church of <hi>England,</hi> hath tempted many to take them for no part.</p>
            <p>§ 11. But yet unſound and hurtful Members may be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and corrected, when they are not ſilenced or caſt out: And proving them true parts doth not prove them to be ſound parts, or ſuch as muſt not be rebuked. But tender avoiding ſin, by preferring Gods Law before Mans, and founding our Concord on Chriſts inſtituted capable terms, and not on the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60966:20"/>
Sand of enſnaring humane Impoſitions, is far from being the mark of unſound Members. Yet meerly to tolerate them to Preach in deep Poverty that deſerve moſt encouragement, is not free from Injury and Schiſm.</p>

            <head>Chap. VIII. <hi>How far this Confederacy and Concord bindeth the Members of a National Church to Conformity to the common ſence and practice.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>§ 1 VVHoever is convinced that Chriſtian Kingdoms or National Churches are of Chriſts Inſtitution, muſt needs know that it is the duty of all its Members, to do their beſt to preſerve them and promote their welfare as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in that form; and not only to ſeek their own Salvation, or the proſpering of their particular Churches or Parties, not only to ſeek the common good of Chriſtians as ſuch in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; But to keep up the National Polity in all lawful things in the way of their ſeveral places and callings. For he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be a Deniſon in any lawful Society, that promoteth not its well faring.</p>
            <p>§ 2. And here it is a grand duty to know the diſtinct Rights of the Governing and the Governed part. And to know that though they are diſtinct, they ought not to be oppoſite but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct.</p>
            <p>A fancy hath been by one of late divulged, that it is a hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous crime to ſay that the King and People have a ſeparate or ſeparable intereſt; So far may raſhneſs precipitate the ignorant: That King and Subjects have a diſtinct intereſt is paſt all doubt: That theſe intereſts ought not to be oppoſite or ſet againſt each other is alſo doubtleſs. And that they are diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is doubtleſs; elſe they would never fall out about them. And that they are faultily divided: And no doubt but they may and muſt be divided Numerally and Notionally, ſo they be not oppoſite.</p>
            <p>§ 3. What I ſay of Kings I muſt ſay of Parents and Paſtors, and Tutors: When the Subjects are various and really divided Numerically, there the Accidents are divers and divided: For the Accidents cannot be the ſame and indiviſible that are in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſubjects. But the rights of Rulers and Subjects are diverſe;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60966:20"/>
And the Perſons or Subjects of theſe Rights are diverſe and ſeparate <hi>in ſenſu Phyſico:</hi> Therefore the Rights are diverſe and Phyſically ſeperate.</p>
            <p>§ 4. The <hi>Genus</hi> and fixed part of the <hi>Species</hi> being ordained by God himſelf, the mutable Form (Monarchy, Ariſtocracy and Mixt,) and the determination of the Perſon or Line is by men, and that is by mutual Conſent and Contract.</p>
            <p>None can force a man to be King, or Paſtor againſt his Will. And Government is a ſtate of great care and great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to Soul and Body: And will any man in his Wits under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it without ſecurity to his own intereſt? The Kings di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and ſeparate intereſt, is 1. His own Life, to be ſecured againſt Treaſon. 2. His Honour as Gods chief Officer, and in a ſort repreſenter, which is therefore Gods own Honour in him. This is made diſtinct and Phyſically ſeparate (tho not oppoſite) in the Fifth Commandment. And the doubt whether that Commandement be part of the firſt or ſecond Table, or rather partly of each as the <hi>Cardo utrinſque,</hi> doth make it a hard queſtion, what intereſt is the higheſt: Of which <hi>Michael Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> hath ſubtilly treated.</p>
            <p>The King alſo hath a diſtinct intereſt 3. In his Family and Perſonal Eſtate. 4. And in ſuch neceſſary aid of Men and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, as may enable him to Govern and Defend the Land: Tho the Subjects may as Proprietors make limiting Contracts to ſecure their own Propriety and Intereſt.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Peoples right</hi> is in general the <hi>common good and ſafety,</hi> and particularly to be <hi>defended,</hi> and their <hi>contracted form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment not overthrown;</hi> nor <hi>the Kingdom to be given up to a Foreign Power,</hi> or any Uſurper, much more that <hi>none that will execute ſuch Papal Tyranny</hi> as is determined of in the <hi>General Council at</hi> Laterane <hi>ſub Innoc.</hi> 3. to <hi>deſtroy</hi> or <hi>exterminate</hi> the <hi>Kingdom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they would Damn their Souls by forſaking ſound Religion;</hi> I ſay that no ſuch be <hi>their King,</hi> or <hi>Potent Governour.</hi> Becauſe <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere</hi> and <hi>perdere</hi> are inconſiſtent: And they who <hi>deſign</hi> it and <hi>profeſs their ſubjection</hi> to <hi>any Power or Law</hi> or <hi>Religion</hi> that <hi>obligeth</hi> to it, are to be ſuppoſed <hi>to be doing it:</hi> Eſpecially if their <hi>prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> ſhew their purpoſes, and <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> be ſet in Power that are <hi>under the ſame Obligations:</hi> And though a <hi>party</hi> or <hi>perſon</hi> muſt fly or ſuffer rather than Embroil the Kingdom in War or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion for their defence; Yet a <hi>whole Kingdom,</hi> cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60966:21"/>
of the right of <hi>ſelf defence,</hi> unleſs by <hi>Gods Sentence</hi> on their <hi>notorious forfeiture of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 5. The <hi>Kings Intereſt</hi> is <hi>chief</hi> in <hi>Majority, in genere cauſe efficientis.</hi> And the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> chief in <hi>Meliority, in genere cauſae finalis,</hi> it is falſe that the King who is <hi>ſingulis major,</hi> is <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis Minor</hi> in <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Jure regendi:</hi> But it is true that the King tho <hi>ſingulis melior (melioritate Relativd)</hi> is not <hi>univerſis me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior)</hi> for <hi>finaliter,</hi> the King was made for the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> rather than the <hi>Kingdom</hi> for the <hi>King:</hi> And yet both <hi>King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> are made by <hi>God and for God;</hi> that is, for his <hi>Will</hi> or Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and his <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Honour:</hi> And as it is the <hi>Honour</hi> of Gods <hi>Soveraignty, Wiſdom and Juſtice</hi> that is glorified in the <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> ſo even the honour of Magiſtracy is part of the <hi>final meliority:</hi> As Gods Love glorified in the common good, is another part of it: And ſo God is the Beginning and the <hi>End, and All in All.</hi> And this is the Rulers Intereſt.</p>
            <p>§ 6. The People have no <hi>Jus regendi,</hi> Governing Authority to <hi>uſe themſelves,</hi> or to <hi>give to others:</hi> So falſe is the Principle of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and <hi>Laud,</hi> and many others, that make them the Fountain of Power. They have the Power called <hi>ſtrength</hi> (in which a Horſe excelleth a Man) but not Authority. If any Nation be <hi>Democratical</hi> it is not becauſe men are born with any right to Political Government, but only to Private Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government. But becauſe <hi>Contract</hi> hath ſo ordered the <hi>Form</hi> of Government. And indeed tho a <hi>City</hi> may be <hi>Democratically</hi> Governed, I know not how any great Nation can poſſibly be ſo: So that I think there is ſcarce any true Democracy in the World.</p>
            <p>For to chuſe Governours is not to Govern: And thoſe that by the People are choſen are an <hi>Ariſtocracy. Rome</hi> was not all the <hi>Roman Empire:</hi> What right then had the <hi>Populus Romanus</hi> to Govern the <hi>Empire?</hi> This was not like Democracy, where the Majority of the whole body Governs.</p>
            <p>The ſame I may ſay of <hi>Venice</hi> as they Govern all that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them. It is truely an Ariſtocracy.</p>
            <p>§ 7. Mankind is by dullneſs and ſloth, ſo far drowned in Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, that the great concerns of <hi>Souls, Bodies</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> are diſordered and almoſt hopeleſly confounded by the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of thoſe that will be the Rulers of them. I. Soul matters and Church matters are ravelled by Ignorant Proud Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60966:21"/>
Prieſts, and have been ſo above 1300 years: The things of Religion being myſterious, and Students Dull and Impatient of hard Study.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Diſeaſes and concerns of the <hi>Body</hi> are ſo abſtruſe, that if among one thouſand that practiſe Phyſick there be ten that do not kill any of their Patients, they eſcape well that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape their Hands: All the Neighbours about us hurt us not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we truſt them not: But Phyſicions kill far more than Enemies.</p>
            <p n="3">III. And I would it were not ſo with Politicians, who will be the determiners of the affairs of Kingdoms and Churches: where an error may be pernicious to the Society and Nation. The beſt Politician that ever I knew was wont to lament, that Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers and Divines uſually ſtudied what the Law of the Land ſaith, and what Gods Law ſaith, and never well ſtudied what a Law <hi>in genere</hi> is, what <hi>Government</hi> and the ſeveral <hi>Cauſes</hi> of it are, and being Ignorant in Political Doctrine, underſtand not the words or things that they talk of: And all through uncapableneſs and ſloth.</p>
            <p>§ 8. How commonly do ſuch diſpute the foreſaid caſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Prince or People be the chief, without diſtinguiſhing <hi>Majority</hi> and <hi>Meliority?</hi> How oft do they ſpeak of their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Right, without diſtinguiſhing, <hi>ſeparate</hi> or diſtinct from oppoſite? How oft do they falſly tell us that the People are the Fountain of Power? And how oft do they tell us that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <hi>(Monarchical</hi> or <hi>Ariſtocratical)</hi> are a meer Truſt, and Rulers only the Peoples <hi>Truſtees,</hi> without diſtinguiſhing what is of God in it, and what is of man, and what truſt God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth to them, and what men commit? And what power people have by <hi>Nature,</hi> and what by Contract.</p>
            <p>§ 9. I have oft proved that Political Government of Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is ſo far different from Self-government, that it is not the contribution of the Self-governing power of individuals given up to one, that maketh political power. It's fully proved,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that <hi>God is the prime Soveraign,</hi> from whom all Power is given. There is no Power but of God. 2. And God hath gone before man, and hath inſtituted Government himſelf, by the Law of Nature and of Scripture, and hath not ſtaid for man to do it? How can man be the Fountain of that which God hath inſtituted before him? He hath not left man to his own
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60966:22"/>
choice whether he will have Government or not; but hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him by the obligations of Neceſſity and Command. 3. And God hath made Univerſal Political Laws, for Societies and Legiſlation is the firſt part of Government. 4. And he maketh Rulers as his Miniſters and inſtituteth their Office <hi>in ſpecie</hi> to be for the promoting of obedience to his own Law and for his Glory and the common good: So that it is of Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution I. That there be humane Governors as Gods Officers. II. That finally they be for his Glory, and the common welfare. III. And that materially they take God's Laws for the prime Laws of their Government: As that they puniſh ſins againſt the Ten Commandments, according to their weight: And thus far they are God's Truſtees. And if the People forbid any of this, it is but Nullity and Rebellion againſt God.</p>
            <p>But the People are <hi>Proprietors,</hi> and may limit the Ruler in the diſpoſe of their <hi>Propriety:</hi> And they have the choice of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> or <hi>Line,</hi> and <hi>Family</hi> that ſhall rule them; who it ſhall be, and whether <hi>One,</hi> or <hi>Many,</hi> or <hi>How many:</hi> For theſe and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances God hath not previouſly determined, (ſave that his <hi>Providence</hi> making ſome one by Conqueſt or ſtrength to be only able to rule and protect them, impoſeth on them a neceſſity of conſenting to that One.) And in theſe things the Ruler is the Truſtee of the People, but not in the former; ſo that in the prime eſſential parts of power the People are but the Objects, and the King is to them (in different degrees) the Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtee of God for the <hi>People,</hi> as the Shepherd is his Maſters Truſtee for the Sheep, and not the Truſtee of the Sheep.</p>
            <p>The ſame I ſay of true Paſtors of the Churches: God hath ſpecified their Office, tho' the People may circumſtantiate it.</p>
            <p>§ 10. Princes having the Power of Legiſlation even about the <hi>undetermined circumſtances of Religion,</hi> as well as things ſecular, and alſo to enforce <hi>Obedience to God's Laws,</hi> all Subjects are bound to obey them herein; yea tho' they ſo far miſtake as to chuſe the circumſtances that might have been better choſen, if they command not ſin: For who doth any thing ſo well but it might have been done better? For inſtance, ſhould they chuſe a tolerable, but leſs perfect Verſion and Meeter of Pſalms, or Tranſlation of Scripture, or form of Publick Worſhip, or Time, Place, Utenſils, Miniſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Concord in thoſe otherwiſe not the beſt, may be better and a greater duty, than for better to be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60966:22"/>
ſingular, diſobedient and dividers, or the encouragers of other mens ſingularity and diviſions.</p>
            <p>§ 11. If there were no Law or Mandate of the Prince for ſuch concord as aforeſaid; yet becauſe a <hi>National Church</hi> ſhould have the comfort, beauty and ſtrength of as much concord as can be attained without greater hurt than it will compenſate; all the Members of it ought to ſtudy the maintenance of ſuch unity, concord and harmony; and if the Paſtors and Churches agree on any ſuch lawful circumſtances, to comply and conform to ſuch agreement; and to ſhun affected cauſleſs ſingularity. In ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>Auguſtine</hi> rightly reſolved to do as the Church did where he came: It being a diſturbing diſcord, for one man to be odd againſt a lawful Cuſtom without cauſe. As for inſtance, if one would affect to be covered with his Hat at Prayer or Pſalmody when the reſt are uncovered; or to uſe a geſture contrary to all the reſt. Conformity in things lawful, beſeemeth them that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs themſelves Members of ſuch National Churches as conſiſt of United Confederate Congregations.</p>
            <p>§ 12. But if on pretence of Concord or Confederacy, yea or Laws, any would tyrannically impoſe ſinful things, or elſe make things lawful ſo much more neceſſary than in themſelves they are, as to become the neceſſary Conditions of Union or Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, excommunicating, perſecuting, or unchurching all that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from them, and appropriating National Church Memberſhip only to thoſe that obey ſuch enſnaring Canons or Agreements; It is not lawful to own or countenance ſuch Uſurpation and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, nor to deny thoſe that they deny or condemn, to be true parts of the National Church: It being only Concord in things eſſential that is neceſſary to the Eſſence, and Concord in parts integral that is neceſſary to Integrity, and Concord in convenient Accidents that is neceſſary to the accidental Comelineſs of the Church. And contrarily, Concord againſt Eſſentials nullifieth a Church, and Diſcord againſt Eſſentials nullifieth a Member; and want of Integrals rendereth it maimed; and want of due Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents uncomely; and ill Accidents (in Concord or Diſcord,) partly ſcabbed and leſs beautiful.</p>
            <p>§ 13. I earneſtly entreat therefore all ſober Chriſtians to take heed leſt the ſecret deſire of ſeeming more pious or tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienced than other godly people, and of getting applauſe for ſuch tenderneſs, and of being reputed ſtricter than others, ſhould tempt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60966:23"/>
them into opinions or practices of unneceſſary diſtance, ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and diviſion. Pride is a deep rooted ſin in Nature; and it maketh our reputation with the ſtricter people, oft to become a ſelfiſh Intereſt, as ſtrong as riches and wordly preferments are with the looſer ſort of men: And it maketh it to ſuch as hard to undergo the ſharp cenſures of the cenſorious, and to bear the imputation of want of Piety and Conſcience, as to undergo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment and want. And hereby, young ignorant Apprentice Lads and Women, being uſually the moſt cenſorious, ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the real Governours of their Paſtors, and of the Church; eſpecially if Perſecution alſo caſt them for a livelihood on the Peoples Charity: And ſo it ſeemeth to make it the Controverſie, whether the Churches and Paſtors ſhould be governed by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, or by cenſorious Women and Boys. Satan hath more Baits to angle with than one; and more than one way of deceiving. Thoſe that are above the ſordid bait of riches or preferment, or great mens favour, may yet be overcome by the over-valuing the love and praiſe of a Sect, or of miſtaken religious perſons; eſpecially in a time when the Clergy is grown infamous and contemptible by ignorance, worldlineſs, or malignity, and it is become a diſgrace to be numbred with them.</p>
            <p>§ 14. But Satan hath taught no ſmall part of our Academick Students and our Clergy, a way to fruſtrate all that I have ſaid, by accuſations againſt my ſelf, as if it were ſufficient to turn all into ſcorn, if they could charge any ſin on my perſon, or by impudent <hi>falſhoods</hi> either feign me to contradict my ſelf, or if they do the work of the Father of Lies by his proper act and imitation. On one ſide I am daily reviled by the Separatiſts and Antinomians, as over-conformable. On the other ſide I am reviled for Non-conformity, and told, that my practice is contrary to all that I write and preach for Peace: And it is anſwer enough for them to calumniate, and ſay that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn my ſelf, as if this did juſtifie, both extreams in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent perſevering in enmity to Peace.</p>
            <p>§ 15. To Mr. <hi>Long</hi> therefore, and ſuch other Calumniators, who inſtead of a rational Confutation of my Arguments, anſwer by accuſing me as of a contradicting unpeaceable life. I ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. One would think with men that have any pretence to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, honeſty or honour, it ſhould be eaſie to know that when the Controverſie is, about Church-Government, Oaths, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60966:23"/>

            <p n="2">2.

            <head>Chap. IX. <hi>That Chriſt hath Inſtituted no true Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Man, of any larger extent than National, much leſs Univerſal; nor of Foreign Juriſdiction: And that the French pretended Ariſtocracy, with the Popes Primacy and Patriarchate, is as bad or worſe than Papal Monarchy.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>§ 1. POpery and Clergy Uſurpation which have corrupted, and broken and confounded the Chriſtian Churches, on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Government, Unity and Order, have riſen out of the Ruines of Chriſtian Magiſtracy: The true Unifying Heads of Chriſtian Kingdoms and National Churches, being depoſed by the Pope and Clergy, their Power hath faln into the hands of the depoſers.</p>
            <p>§ 2. The means by which this was accompliſhed were theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When there was no Chriſtian Magiſtracy, the Chriſtians by voluntary conſent, to avoid Pagan Tribunals, made their Biſhops their choſen Arbitrators to decide their differences. And <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> finding them in poſſeſſion of it, and having no Lay-men ſo wiſe, and good, and meet, continued them in it; yet without the Power of the Sword.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The pious Chriſtians were deſirous that their own freely choſen Paſtors ſhould rule them, having no others ſo fit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Princes were ſo taken up with Wars, and ſecular things, that they had no leiſure to mind it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Princes and Rulers grew ſo ignorant, wicked and debaucht, that themſelves and all others almoſt thought them unmeet for ſuch holy work. They neglected the ſtudy of the Word of God, which ſhould have made them wiſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Clergy not only took the advantage of the ignorance and viciouſneſs of Princes, but cheriſhed them herein, and told them Scripture and holy work, were for the Prieſts and not for Princes.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They debaſed and prophaned the Order of Magiſtrates, falſly pretending, that their Office was but for the Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for worldly Peace, and the Office of Prieſts only was for the Soul.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They by degrees turned the <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Foreign Churches and Nations, into <hi>one Government</hi> over all.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:60966:24"/>
8. When the Roman Empire was broken into many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, the National pretence of the Pope or Councils could reach but to ſome one of them; and ſo the Pope ſlightly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all, and turned the Imperial Univerſality, into a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial Univerſality, and the Roman World into the whole World, or elſe they had fallen.</p>
            <p n="9">9. In all this they took the advantage of the Ignorance of Princes and Lords.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And of the Wars and Enmity againſt each other ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in with the ſide that was likeſt to advance them.</p>
            <p>§ 2. To this day Popery is upheld by the ſame means by which it was ſet up; eſpecially by the Ignorance, Ungodlineſs, and Slothfulneſs of Kings and Lords: Did they exceed the Clergy as much as <hi>Moſes, Joſhua, David, Solomon, Jehoſaphat, Hezekiah, Joſiah, Nehemiah, Zorobbabel,</hi> did the Prieſts, and as much as the Heathen Emperors, <hi>Titus, Trajan, Adrian, Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus Pius, Antoninus Philoſophus, Alexander Severus,</hi> &amp;c. did their Prieſts, they would be honoured above the Prieſts as they were: The Emperors then were thought fit to be <hi>Pontifices Maximi;</hi> and as in the times of the Ancient Family-power, an <hi>Abraham,</hi> an <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and a <hi>Jacob,</hi> and a <hi>Job,</hi> and a <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> were thought fit to have the higheſt Government in matters of Religion, ſo would it be ſtill. And a <hi>Samuel</hi> would be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and King. But as God will honour thoſe that honour him, ſo thoſe that deſpiſe him ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</p>
            <p>§ 3. The true way therefore to put down Popery, is for the Prince and Magiſtrates to claim their proper Power (yet not to uſurp the Prieſthood) and to ſtudy, love, and practiſe the Law of God, and take their Power and Laws to be only and meerly ſubſervient to the Power and Laws of God: And to ſtrive to underſtand theſe ſo clearly, as to be able to judge ſound Preachers from unſound, and to know whom to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, whom to tolerate, and whom to ſuppreſs. It is Kings that have ſet up Popes, by putting down themſelves, and Popes have ſet in to pull them down, to ſet up themſelves: And it is Kings that muſt pull down Popes by reaſſuming their own Power and Work; and that muſt be by becoming fit for it.</p>
            <p>§ 4. That Prince who granteth that his Office is but for the Body, and for Secular Ends, and the Prieſts only for the Soul, inviteth all his Subjects to honour every Prieſt before him, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60966:25"/>
to account him baſe as worldly things are to be accounted as dung in compariſon of the things of the Spirit and Eternity: Yea every good Chriſtian who is commanded to exhort each other daily, and to comfort one another with the remembrance that we ſhall be for ever with the Lord, would be far more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable than a King; as the Soul is above the Body, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven better than Earth.</p>
            <p>§ 5. He is not worthy of Parental Honour from his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that careth only for their Bodies, and ſeeketh not to make them the Children of God, and the Heirs of Heaven, and to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord: And if Princes be below the work of Parents, they are below their Honour: And if they will not be included in the work of the Fifth Commandment, how can men give them the honour of that Commandment.</p>
            <p>§ 6. They that will have a Univerſal Prelate or Council to Govern the matters of Religion through all the World becauſe of the unskilfulneſs of Kings and Magiſtrates ſhould in reaſon, alſo be willing on the ſame Grounds to have an Univerſal King or Parliament to Govern all Kings, becauſe ſome are Ignorant or Slothful; or an Univerſal Phyſicion, Philoſopher or School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter.</p>
            <p>§ 7. God hath given the World often ſuch Counſellors and ſuch Judges, as have been fit to judge in matters of Religion, and to Judge Biſhops and Preachers: Why elſe do our Laws ſubject them to Kings and Judges? Had all Lands but ſuch Judges as through Gods Mercy <hi>England</hi> hath now, or ſuch as were Sir <hi>Matthew Hale,</hi> and divers others in our Age, and ſuch Counſellors as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had for the moſt part, or ſuch Lawyers as <hi>France</hi> it ſelf hath had, and the Palatinate, and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it would convince the World that Laymen may be fit to judge the Clergy, even in matters of Religion. And why may not Princes attain as much wiſdom and honeſty as their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors and Judges? The Chriſtian Nations have been more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to a <hi>Conſtantine, Jovian, Valentinian, Theodoſius Senior, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius Junior, Marcian, Leo, Anaſtaſius,</hi> and many other ſuch; and <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Recaredus,</hi> and divers of his Succeſſors, and <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Carolus Mag. Ludov. Pius</hi> (ſave their compliance with the Pope) than to any Biſhops or Councils, even for Reformation, againſt Hereſies and Clergies Sins.</p>

            <head>Chap. X. <hi>Whether an Univerſal Church-Government be of Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Succeſſion in the continued parts of their Office?</hi>
            </head>
            <p>§ 1. THough thoſe that take it for mutability and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding to change their Judgments after that the School, or their Leaders or Intereſt hath once fixed them, do cenſure me for changing and repenting, that temptation ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with me, to deny Learning and Repenting, till I know at what Age we muſt fix our <hi>ne ultra,</hi> or who be the Teachers that we muſt believe as infallible, while we diſpute againſt Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane as well as Papal Infallibility.</p>
            <p>§ 2. I therefore penitently confeſs that I was long averſly ſuſpicious of National Churches, and National Church-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, becauſe I could not ſee how thoſe that held theſe could confute Popery: For I thought that by the ſame reaſon that Presbyters muſt have Biſhops over them, and Biſhops, Arch-Biſhops, and they Metropolitans or Patriarchs; theſe alſo muſt have ſome body over them, to <hi>Ordain them,</hi> and to <hi>Govern them.</hi> And becauſe I denied the latter, I denied alſo the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and thought Epiſcopacy would infer Popery.</p>
            <p>§ 3. And leſt any ſhould fall by the like temptation, and Papiſts ſhould plead my Principles as for them, or ſhould infer that if National Churches and Prelacy be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church Soveraignty is ſo alſo, I ſhall here tell thoſe that may have the like temptations, how I eſcaped this: And I will add the reſt of the difficulties that ever ſeemed to me to be of conſiderable weight to tempt an impartial man to Popery, and tell the leſs ſtudied how to anſwer them better than the moſt can do.</p>
            <p>§ 4. I have long known that Popery doth not eſſentially conſiſt in the other Errours about Doctrine or Worſhip, as Images, praying to Saints and Angels, Maſſes, Relicts, Merits, Juſtification, Free-will, Purgatory, Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If a Greek, or Armenian, or Abaſſine, hold theſe and no more, he is not therefore a Papiſt. You may call them Integral parts of Popery if you will, but not eſſential. The Eſſence is only the Opinion of <hi>Univerſal Humane Church Soveraignty, and a Church Univerſal Unified and formally Conſtituted thereby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:60966:26"/>
§ 5. This is conſiderable, 1. <hi>Quoad Rationem Rei;</hi> 2. And <hi>quoad Rationem Nominis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Thing,</hi> it is ſuch a <hi>Soveraignty feigned,</hi> whether in a <hi>Monarchy, Ariſtocracy,</hi> or any mixt or other Form, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Uſurpation of Chriſt's Office, and making a Vice-Chriſt, which is an Antichriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>Name,</hi> it is called <hi>Popery</hi> from them that place this Soveraignty in the Roman Pope (though it would be the ſame thing, if they placed it in the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 6. Of theſe there are three ſorts of Papiſts: 1. Some place it in the Pope alone: 2. Some in the Pope and a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council or Clergy agreeing: 3. And ſome in a General Council, the Pope being only <hi>Principium Unitatis,</hi> as having the <hi>primam ſedem,</hi> priviledged ordinarily to call them, and moderate. And in the Intervals of ſuch Councils, in an Ariſtocratical Colledge of all the Biſhops in the World, governing <hi>per literas formatas:</hi> This laſt as moſt irrational I have at large confuted: It is the other two that deſerve further confutation.</p>
            <p>§ 7. And ſeeing it is the <hi>ſumma Poteſtas,</hi> or Soveraignty that is the unifying and denominating Form of a Political Society, it clearly followeth that thoſe that now go under the name of Papiſts or Roman Catholicks, are indeed of three diſtinct ſort of Churches, and not as they pretend of One. But names not underſtood delude the ignorant, ſaying it is but One Church, maketh it not One.</p>
            <p>§ 8. They uncharitably and very hurtfully miſtake, 1. Who ſay that Popery eſſentially began when God and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted the Biſhops, and Pride in many abuſed that mercy. 2. And they that ſay it eſſentially began when Image-worſhip began. 3. And they that date it from the aſſumed Name of <hi>Univerſal Biſhop, or Head of the Univerſal Church</hi> (which <hi>Leo</hi> I. aſſumed and <hi>Phocas</hi> gave <hi>Boniface)</hi> as long as they meant not the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church on all the Earth,</hi> but only the <hi>Univerſal in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> which was long meant.</p>
            <p>§ 9. Now among all temptations to Popery, I never found any of difficult weight but theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Apoſtolical Office continueth in its ordinary continued Part and Work. But Univerſal Church Government is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary continued Part and Work of the Apoſtolick Office. <hi>Ergo</hi> Univerſal Church-Government (continueth) (that is, <hi>de jure divino.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:60966:26"/>
II. The Superiority of one National Church Government is <hi>Jure Divino. Ergo,</hi> ſo is the Superiority of an Univerſal Church Government.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Roman Policy ſeemeth greatly advantageous for the Preſervation, Honour and Propagation of Chriſtianity in the World, and hath much upheld it.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The ſcandalous diviſions of the Reformed and other Churches, are ſo diſhonourable and weakening, and dangerous to Chriſtianity, as ſeemeth to make the Roman Policy and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The Errors of the Proteſtants in their Oppoſition to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, are ſo many and groſs, and their unjuſt accuſations of the Papiſts ſo palpable, eſpecially their Expoſition of the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo Partial, Erroneous and Hoſtile as ſeemeth much to make their Cauſe more ſuſpected than the Papiſts.</p>
            <p>§ 10. Theſe Reaſons which prevailed with ſuch great Men as <hi>Eraſmus, Caſſander, Grotius,</hi> and many others, need a more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate anſwer than moſt Proteſtants are prepared to give, which we ſhould find were the Papiſts by Liberty of Religion let looſe to open Diſputes among us: I have tryed ſome Judicious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters with the firſt of theſe, and have had but ſuch anſwers as are defective and inſufficient.</p>
            <p>§ 11. The Anſwer which ſatisfieth me is this.</p>
            <p>We muſt diſtinguiſh, 1. The Apoſtles Power as Promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Chriſts Law, and a Legiſlative Power to make Laws of their own.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Between a Legiſlative and a Judicial and Executive Power.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Between an <hi>Univerſal</hi> and an <hi>Indefinite</hi> Power and Exerciſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Between a Power to be uſed perſonally, disjunct, each one his part in his own Province, and a Power in many conjunct making one Political Perſon or Supreme, as in an Ariſtocracy.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Between proper Regiment, where <hi>Authorit as Imperantis</hi> is the formal Object of the Subjects Obedience; and Contract or Conſent for Brotherly Agreement and Communion. And ſo between a Confederacy and a Political Society; and between Inequality in Teachers and Perſwaders, and Inequality in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders.</p>
            <p>§ 12. This much preſuppoſed, we muſt enquire what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Power was, that we may know how much of it is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued as ordinary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:60966:27"/>
And, I. Names uſed by Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt, were not uſeleſs to the notifying of the things ſignified by them. And <hi>Apoſtolus</hi> ſignified much more than <hi>Epiſcopus.</hi> To be an Apoſtle was by Chriſts own Mouth, or ſpecial Revelation from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to be one ſent Indefinitely to be his ſpecial Witneſs and Meſſenger to publiſh his Goſpel to Infidels, and work Miracles to confirm it, and gather Churches hereby. But a Biſhop as ſuch had not this Miſſion and Power.</p>
            <p>§ 13. II. The Apoſtles Power to ſpeak of Chriſt, his words and works as Eye and Ear-witneſſes, is not continued to Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; no more than the confirming Power of Miracles.</p>
            <p>§ 14. III. The number of Twelve and Seventy two were a National Form fitted to the Jewiſh State, and not an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal: And this National Form went before that part of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Work and Power, which was to be Univerſal or Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</p>
            <p>§ 15. IV. The Apoſtles made no Univerſal Laws of their own, but only promulgated the Laws of Chriſt; which by his Word and Spirit he taught them: And to that end, he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and gave them his Spirit to lead them into all Truth, and bring all to their remembrance; and they were ſent to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (indefinitely) to Convert them and Baptize them, and to teach them to obſerve all things that <hi>Chriſt had commanded them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cryer is not the Law-maker, though he proclaim the Law.</p>
            <p>The Obligations to Infant-baptiſm and the Lords day, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome as <hi>Apoſtolical Laws,</hi> are from Chriſt himſelf (as I have proved elſewhere at large) the Apoſtles being Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized Witneſſes and Promulgators. And had they done it by the extraordinary promiſed Spirit, it had ſo been Chriſts own Law-giving; no other having that promiſe of the Spirit to make a new Word of God, or Univerſal Law, by bringing all his Commands to remembrance, and leading them into all Truth.</p>
            <p>The determinations, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. were alſo the delivery of the Law of Chriſt, the Holy Ghoſt giving them the certain under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it: And it's like that as two of the four Caſes (For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication and Idol-Communion) were of known Morality, ſo the other two (ſtrangled and Blood-eating) if not ſo, were not of Univerſal Obligation; but only to thoſe Gentiles that lived among the offended Jews.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:60966:27"/>
The like may be ſaid about the Inſtitution of Deacons, and Biſhops of ſingle Churches: If they did not Inſtitute them as in Chriſts Name, by his Command or Spirit, but had Authority from him to do it as Apoſtles. It was under the promiſe of the Spirits Infallible Guidance, and a Temporary Work, in which they have no Succeſſors: For Chriſts Church would never be formed, nor his Laws and Word ſetled perfect, if we muſt have Men in all Ages, to add to his Church Ordinances and Officers, and to make him new Laws and a new Word: How big would his Bible be then at the laſt? Why have no new Scriptures as his been ſo made theſe 1600 years. I hope our Volumes of Councils will not go for ſuch.</p>
            <p>§ 16. V. The <hi>occaſional determination</hi> of <hi>Queſtions</hi> about <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Circumſtances</hi> (as long Hair, the Vails, the Love-feaſts, the time of Collections for Charity, and divers ſuch were not Univerſal but Local, and not of Immutable but occaſional Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Obligation; and were but ſuch as National and Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Governors may determine, without any Univerſal Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power. The <hi>Genus</hi> or Rule by which they muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined (Edification, Love, Concord, Peace, Decency, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,) being Gods Laws.</p>
            <p>§ 17. VI. There is great difference between what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did as Segregate or Diſ-junct each one in his Province, and what they did as an Ariſtocratical Perſon or College unitedly. They Ordained Elders, gave the Holy Ghoſt, ſetled Churches, decided Controverſies, wrote Books and Epiſtles, ſingly each one in his Province, and met not to write any one Book or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle by a Major College-Vote in one Body. And though their Books now oblige all the Church that have them, yet, 1. At the firſt writing they obliged only the Churches or Perſons to whom they were written, and only after by parity of Reaſon bind others that have them. And every ordinary Paſtor that writeth a Book that is ſound Divinity, bringeth an Obligation on all that read it, to obey it according to the Evidence of truth. The Obligation of the Apoſtles Books and theirs, is <hi>Extenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Indefinite</hi> or Univerſal to all that read or hear it: But the Degree of the Obligation <hi>Intenſively</hi> is greater from the Apoſtles Writings, becauſe of their extraordinary Spirit.</p>
            <p>§ 18. VII. The deciſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. was not by a General Council nor a Pope; No ſuch Council was called: But they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60966:28"/>
were ſent and appealed to, as Men of moſt infallible fitneſs to decide that Caſe; and if they did it as a College, it was only as a National Church College, ſuch as <hi>de formâ</hi> the Jews Nation had, in which relation they were firſt ſetled: For as <hi>Twelve</hi> they were only ſo related; others being added to be ſent with them to the Centiles. And beſides and after that, we never read that they did any thing but in their ſeparate Provinces and Perſonal Capacity.</p>
            <p>§ 10 VIII. And as they never did as an Univerſal Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical College, by Vote make new Univerſal Laws to the Church, much leſs by any ordinary continued Power, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they as ſuch a College, exerciſe <hi>Judicial</hi> or Executive power, but did it in their ſingle Capacities only in their proper Provinces; and that was partly by an ordinary power (of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof and Excommunication) which continueth; and partly by an extraordinary miraculous power, of delivering to Satan for Corporal puniſhment, which power is ceaſed with them (Tho' Papiſts in a mock-imitation, deliver the Excommunicate to the Secular powers, to be kill'd, as if theſe were Devils.) As for the Univerſal Laws that tell whom to Excommunicate, they are Chriſts own Laws, and Rules of Judgment: To which if men may add the like, no wonder if they make <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie</hi> as they pleaſe, and Excommunicate and deliver to Satan (their Magiſtrates) whom they will; and if he that was an Orthodox Saint this year, be burnt (without change) as an Heretick the next; and it be never certain till the end of the World, what is <hi>Hereſie</hi> or <hi>Sin,</hi> and what not.</p>
            <p>§ 20. IX. It being certain then that the Apoſtles did not, as an Ariſtocratical Supreme power over the Univerſal Church, Exerciſe <hi>Legiſlation, Judgment</hi> and <hi>Execution,</hi> much leſs by any ordinary continued power, it followeth that they have no Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors that have ſuch power; and all <hi>Government</hi> being contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe three parts, there is <hi>de Jure</hi> no <hi>Univerſal Governour.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. You may next ask, Who then muſt Make or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate a Pope? Is it a Superior? Contrarily, If a Pope may be made by Inferiors (as they do) a Patriarch, a Metropolitan, an Archbiſhop and a Biſhop may <hi>quoad eſſe</hi> be validly made by Men of the ſame Order. Yea and Presbyters too where Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Order and Church ſafety forbid it not.</p>
            <p>§ 3. It is ſo far from being true (as I once fooliſhly thought) that National Church Supremacy inferreth Popery, that it is a neceſſary or very great means againſt it, without which (though particular Souls may be ſaved from Popery) a Nation cannot long, nor ever was that I have read of. For Popery is but the Invading of the power of all other Biſhops and Kings: And for each one to reaſſume his own power, is the direct Depoſing of the Pope. As if one King or Senate claimed the Government of all Kings and Senates, how ſhould theſe Uſurpers be Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but by <hi>every</hi> King and Parliaments reaſſuming their own?</p>
            <p>§ 4. But then every party that differeth in the Form of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Government, muſt not pretend that it is only <hi>their Form,</hi> that is the Bulwark againſt Popery. National Church Concord and Strength may be kept up by a Supreme Chriſtian Prince or State with a Concordant Miniſtry, whether among themſelves United as the Scots in General Aſſemblies, or as in <hi>England</hi> by Archbiſhops, Biſhops and Convocations, obeying the Laws of Chriſt, and the juſt Laws of the King and State that are made for determining needful Circumſtances; ſuppoſing ſuch Biſhops qualified and choſen juſtly, and uſurping none of the Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers power.</p>
            <p>§ 5. That National Laws about matters of Religion may and muſt be made, and that Princes conſulting with Paſtors muſt make them, and that theſe are not to extend to all the World, is a truth unqueſtionable.</p>
            <p>In <hi>England</hi> the Law muſt command us to uſe Engliſh Bibles, but not all over the World. It is meet to bind the Churches to uſe one Tranſlation of the Scriptures. Elſe one will ſay, Your Text or what you alledge is not in my Bible, and another, It is not in mine. And many inconveniences would follow. And one Form of Catechiſm, one Form of Confeſſion, one Metre of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60966:30"/>
ſinging Pſalms, and about the Sacraments and other Offices one Form moderately impoſed or agreed on is convenient.

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We deny not but <hi>Unity,</hi> Concord, Power and Riches, and the great number of Adherents, is a great advantage to Chriſtianity againſt Infidels: And all theſe are Gods Gifts, and as ſuch do good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But the abuſe of them though it do not quite fruſtrate the genuine Effects, yet ſo depraveth them, that it's a doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the hurt to the common Chriſtianity be not greater than the advantage. If Unity were maintained in Chriſts way it would have far better Effects than in the Papiſts way.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yet we deny not but the Providence of God hath made uſe of the Roman Power, Numbers, Concord and Riches, to uphold the common Cauſe. But all is not Good that God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruleth and uſeth to good, permitting Man to cauſe the Evil. As a Man may uſe the Cruelty without cauſing it, of a Hound, a Ferret, or a Hawk, againſt the Prey, to fulfil his juſt will.</p>
            <p>Had National Kingdom Churches been kept up under true Chriſtian Kings and Paſtors, and theſe Kings and Paſtors in Dyets and Councils, kept due Confederacies by Conſultation and Contract without mutual Juriſdiction, the common Cauſe had been better promoted than it hath been by Popery, that hath ſhamed it and weakened it by Perſecutions, Diviſions, Treaſons and Wars.</p>

            <p n="2">2. The Biſhops have made the greateſt Schiſms and Diviſion in the Church that ever was made, by ſinful Uſurpation and Corruption, and Impoſitions, and Perſecutions, Unchurching the far greateſt part of Chriſtians, and appropriating the Church Title to his own Sect alone. All the Bloody Murders of the <hi>Waldenſes, Bohemians,</hi> and other Proteſtants, the Inquiſition, the preſent Wars that <hi>France</hi> hath involved <hi>Europe</hi> in, are on pretence of Unity: We like not the Unity that Satan main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth, and that at ſuch a rate of Blood.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But I have before and elſewhere proved that the Proteſtants for all their Diviſions have a far better Unity than the Papal Church hath, ſo that this Queſtion is elſewhere and here ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently anſwered.</p>

We deny not but where Controverſies ſhew our Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences among our ſelves, one Party muſt needs be in an Error, either <hi>de re,</hi> or <hi>de nomine.</hi> But we agree in all that's neceſſary to Salvation and Brotherly Love: And Pride, and Envy, and Malignity, are more the Cauſes of our Diſagreement than our Religion. Eſpecially unskilfulneſs in <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>ſtating Caſes.</hi> I have endeavoured to ſhew in many Books (eſpecially my <hi>End of Doctrinal Controverſies,</hi> my <hi>Catholick Theology</hi> and <hi>Methodus Theologiae)</hi> that our Differences are moſt in <hi>Words</hi> whoſe ſence is not mutually underſtood.</p>
            <p>How many Loads of Controverſal Volumes are written by Papiſts againſt each other? And what heavy Charges of Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Filthineſs, Hereſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have even General Councils and Hiſtorians laid on the Popes and many Councils? And note, that the Pope or Council is the Eſſentiating Form of the Papal Church as ſuch; and therefore an Unholy or Debauch'd, or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick Head, proveth that the Church is Unholy or Heretical: Becauſe the Form denominateth; and is Eſſential. But it is

not ſo with the Proteſtants, that own no Univerſal Head but Chriſt, who is Infallible and perfect.</p>
            <p>This much I thought needful to add againſt them, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend an Inſtitution of Chriſt, for a Political Univerſal Head, and a Foreign Juriſdiction; above a National Church or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kingdom.</p>

            <p>§ 2. In general, All ſin is to the Soul what Sickneſs is to the Body, and hath ſome tendency to deſtruction. And the increaſe and abounding of Sin, is a dangerous Prognoſtick: ſins of Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Gluttony, Drunkenneſs, and Fornication, when they grow common and impudent, ſeldom go unpuniſhed.

And brutiſh Wretches ſcarce take it for a ſhame.</p>
            <p>Sins of Injuſtice and Unmercifulneſs, eſpecially Rich Mens oppreſſion of the Poor, Landlords grinding their Poor Tenants, and Judges, Juſtices and Lawyers unrighteouſneſs in Suits and Judgments, are Sins threatned by the Prophets as the fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Deſtruction.</p>

§ 3. But eſpecially when Rulers are the Leaders in Sin, and the Patrons of the Wicked. The Sins of Men in publick Place are publick Sins, and ſooner bring publick Judgments, than the Sins of private Men. The publick Authors of the late Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Wars of <hi>Ireland, Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> had a deep part in the Puniſhment as they had in the Guilt.

When Men ſhall affectedly keep Whores as the way to pleaſe the Court by Conformity to the King, as if it were an Honour or no great Diſhonour; what can be expected from ſuch horrid wickedneſs, but Publick, Divine, Revenging Juſtice?</p>
            <p>§ 4. When did it ever go well with <hi>Judah</hi> or <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they had a fooliſh wicked King? How eaſie is it for ſuch a King and a fooliſh wicked Senate or Parliament to undo a Nation, by Laws of Hereſie, Cruelty, Perſecution, Diviſion and Iniquity? How ordinarily do ſuch make Snares for the Conſcionable, by commanding them on pain of Fining, Impriſonment, or Death, or Baniſhment, to do ſomething that God forbiddeth, or not to do what God commandeth; and then to cry them down, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and ruine them, as unruly, diſobedient, deſpiſers of all Order and Government, Schiſmaticks and Rebels?

            <p>§ 5. Great is the advantage that Supreme Rulers have, to put the Name of Evil upon Good, and of Good on Evil, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Vulgar to ſay as they?

            <p>§ 7. But the great Cauſe of the Ruine of a National Church, is the Ignorance, Viciouſneſs, Pride, Malignity, Covetouſneſs, and Perſecuting Cruelty, of a Degenerate, Carnal, Worldly Clergy.</p>
            <p>Magiſtracy and Miniſtry are Gods great Ordinances, by which as his Inſtruments, and partly Repreſentatives, he doth by an eſtabliſhed Order, govern and keep up Order and Piety in the World. Magiſtrates repreſent him in his Super-eminence and Ruling Power: And Miniſters in his Guiding and Sanctifying Wiſdom and Love. And God (that will not ordinarily turn ſetled Order into Miracles) worketh by theſe, according to the aptitude of the Inſtruments, and the Receivers. And where there is kept up a wiſe and holy Magiſtracy and Miniſtry, when and where did it ever go ill with ſuch a people, by any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick deſolation?</p>
            <p>§ 8. If Miniſters be Ignorant, or unskilful in their publick Work, they will be deſpiſed. If they be Worldly and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous the Poor will reproach them. If they be Drunkards, Gluttons, Unclean, Idle, or any way Senſual, they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the common Scorn: But if they be Enemies to ſerious Godlineſs, or Revilers, or Perſecutors of Godly Men, the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will be encouraged to be like them and hardned in their Sin; but Pious and Sober men will abhor them as the Servants of Satan, though they will not therefore caſt off their Honour to the true Miniſterial Office and Work.</p>
            <p>It is not an Honourable Office, or a Reverend Garb, and Name and Title, that will hide the ſhame of Ignorance, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs, Senſuality or Malignity. Their White Cloathing and Sacred Titles, which render their filthineſs more viſible and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60966:33"/>
odious. Bad Men will prove a greater injury to Sacred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, than open Enemies. And it is not the Holineſs of the Office, or the Goodneſs of Laws and Order, that will ſerve to Reform or make Happy a Church or Nation, in the hands of wicked Men.</p>
            <p>§ 9. Therefore when Biſhops ſhall be ſuch, who Ordain and Govern the Inferior Clergy, that Church or Nation is near loſt and ruined. If bad Princes chuſe bad Prelates; and they Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain bad Miniſters, and ſavouring nothing but Wealth and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, ſhall prove the Jealous Adverſaries of Piety, and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of the moſt ſerious Chriſtians, and Encouragers of the malignant, vicious and profane, that Church and Nation is next to dead, though it have a Name to live, and be called, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and Rich; how comely ſoever its Order and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be, and though its Doctrine and profeſt Opinions be Orthodox.</p>
            <p>§ 10. And it will yet render the caſe more deſperate, if the ſame carnal, worldly, malignant Biſhops and Clergy ſhall grow juſtly reputed the Adverſaries of the moſt Learned, Judicious, Godly, and Laborious, and Powerful Preachers, and ſhall ſeek to Silence, Diſgrace and Oppreſs them. The ſober part of the Nation will then be tempted to take them as the Devils Militia, armed againſt Chriſt and Mens Salvation; and this the more wickedly as doing it in Chriſts Livery and in his Name.</p>
            <p>§ 11. And if ſuch a Clergy ſhall in enmity to the Godly, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the profane Lords, Knights and Rich men of the World, and make them their upholders and patrons and party, to ſtrengthen them in their ſin, the Confederacy will threaten Gods Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on them all.</p>
            <p>§ 12. And yet the caſe will be more deſperate, if the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch power ſhall bring an Univerſal Infection of Idleneſs, Senſuality, and Factious Enmity to ſerious Godlineſs, on the Univerſities and other Schools of Learning, and ſhall make them to be Nurſeries of Ignorance, Errour, Impiety and Malignity. And if the Prelates and Prieſts ſhall teach their Pupils and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates to account men of Conſcience that obey not their ſinful Impoſitions, to be Fanatical Schiſmaticks, and on pretence of bringing Schiſm into diſgrace, ſhall caſt their dirt in the Face of Piety, and ſo train up youth into an enmity and ſcorn of that which ſhould have their chiefeſt Love and Labour. Alas, if ſuch
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60966:33"/>
a Serpentine Generation, ſhall for ſtaying ſo many years in Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Luſt in Univerſities, be thought to have right to take the charge of multitudes of Souls, that never took juſt care of their own, and to have right to Church Dignity and Maintenance, if any bad Patron will but preſent them; how ſad a caſe is ſuch a Church and Nation in? They will bring their Ignorance and Malice into the Pulpit, and then thoſe hearers that know bitter from ſweet, and the unclean from the clean, will loath their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And when the Prieſt ſeeth that he is deſpiſed or loathed, he will become the Enemy of thoſe that diſeſteem him; and ſo he will become a Wolf to the Flock: And then it is the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly part that muſt be his Friends and Companions in Sin, whom he will harden to their own Deſtruction: Thus hath a bad Clergy been the ruine of many Churches.</p>
            <p>§ 13. And this will prove ſo ſtrong a Temptation to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious part, to diſaffect the Miniſtry, and to go too far in ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as that Schiſms and Pernicious Diviſions will be ſoon multiplied: And then Perſecution muſt be tryed on them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Light and Love.</p>
            <p>§ 14. But the Immediate dividing and diſſolving of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and overthrow of the Peace of Chriſtian Kingdoms, is by Ignorant, Malicious or Tyrannical Laws or Canons, that impoſe things forbidden of God, on pain of ejecting, and ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the moſt Faithful Miniſters, and ſcorning and ruining the moſt Religious People, that will not ſell their Souls for World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Intereſt, nor to humour the ill deſigns of Tyrants. Theſe ſnares are often made by meer malice and revenge, as <hi>Daniel</hi> was forbid to pray; Becauſe they could find no fault or accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt him except it were concerning the Law of his God. Eſpecially when, ſome great quarrels have exaſperated revenge.</p>
            <p>§ 15. But uſually error concurreth with Malice, while Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Pride make Prelates and Prieſts ſtill confident that all their Opinions and Impoſitions are juſt and blameleſs; and that all are willfully erroneous that refuſe them: So rare is a humble underſtanding.</p>
            <p>§ 16. And it fixeth a National Church in this way to ruine, when ſuch an unworthy Miniſtry muſt be continued till they die, and there is no great viſible hope of removing them. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulties muſt be overcome, before one Pariſh can get a cure of ſuch?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:60966:34"/>
§ 17. And yet worſe is it, when there is ſmall hope of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when the bad Prieſt is dead; but the corrupt Fountain is ſtill ſending forth polluted Streams; and Money and Friendſhip chuſe the Man: And when the worſt Man that hath but Money enough to buy a Patronage ſhall have the choice of a Paſtor for Mens Souls.</p>
            <p>§ 18. And yet worſe will it go, when the Keys, which are the moſt peculiar part of the Priviledge and Office of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, ſhall be exerciſed by Lay Civilians, in the Biſhops name, without his judging or conſent. And Government by the Word is managed by ſuch Men, in the manner that Secular Affairs are managed, without due reverence to holy things.</p>
            <p>§ 19. And worſt of all is it, when the Body of the Nation is by ſuch means brought to ſo much ignorance and ſinfulneſs, that they would have it ſo; And are glad to have ſo much counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to their malignity and ſin; and follow their malicious Military Leaders.</p>
            <p>§ 20. And laſt of all when their madneſs hath drawn their own Swords againſt each other, or provoked God to let in a Foreign Enemy on them, then they muſt expect that God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the quarrel of his Covenant; ſpecially when after great Mercy and long Patience they would not know the time of their Viſitation, nor in their day the things that belong to their peace, but defend their ſin.</p>

            </head>
            <p>§ 1. TO tell what particulars need Reformation, I have done ſo oft to the great diſpleaſure of the guilty, that I have no encouragement to offend them more, by doing it again.</p>
            <p>§ 2. And to give the true Hiſtory of original, cauſes, and progreſs of our corruptions, diſorders and diviſions, will not be endured by them that ſtill juſtifie their own and Predeceſſours ſin, and can ſee no fault in any but thoſe that they firſt make and then call their adverſaries. I have found that the moſt notorious matters of fact will be denyed furiouſly by ſuch men, even what
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60966:34"/>
hath been ſaid and done in their preſence and mine, before a multitude of Witneſſes, Biſhops, Doctors and divers others: Yea things ſaid and done in Parliaments and Armies and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notified, are by ſuch men contradicted with rage. Therefore I will not here tell the World, either what or who have been the cauſes of our ſufferings and dangers; having long purpoſed to have done it in a Treatiſe by it ſelf, called [REPENT, O ENGLAND] and therein I. To declare my own Repentance. II. To tell thoſe called Presbyterians what they muſt Repent of. III. And thoſe called Separatiſts. IV. And thoſe called Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians. V. And thoſe called Prelatical, eſpecially the Ruling part. But God ſeemeth to deny me time for that intended Work.</p>
            <p>§ 3. That which I ſhall now add, is, I. To ſhew what there now is in the Engliſh Conſtitution, fitted to Chriſts Inſtitution of a true National Church. II. What is yet wanting. III. And what are the Remedies.</p>
            <p>§ 4. I. I begin with that which is Good and Laudable: Not only to avoid offence by unprofitable finding faults, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to rectifie thoſe prejudiced cenſures that call Good Evil, and run away from Gods Mercies under the falſe name of Sin. This hath had no ſmall hand in our Diviſions, ever ſince the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at <hi>Frank-ford</hi> and our firſt Reformation. The Adverſaries of Popery did lay more of the perſonal Crimes of the Papiſts Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Prieſts (and Monks too) on the Office and Order than they ſhould have done.</p>
            <p>§ 5. I. The National Church of <hi>England</hi> is rightly conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under one Supreme Royal Government as the Unifying Head, as I have proved.</p>
            <p>§ 6. II. It is duely conſtituted of profeſſed Baptized Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Churches as the ſubject matter.</p>
            <p>§ 7. III. It hath National Laws which profeſs their ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency to the Law of Chriſt, and the Nullity of all that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
            <p>§ 8. IV. It maketh none Magiſtrates but profeſſed Chriſtians: No nor Burgeſſes and chooſers of Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>§ 9. V. It hath Dioceſans that are General Overſeers of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular Churches, as Succeſſors to the Apoſtles and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts in the ordinary parts of their Office, which I before prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Chriſts Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:60966:35"/>
§ 10. VI. It juſtly maketh Biſhops Members of Parliament, it being unfit to make Laws for Religion without the Paſtors no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and advice.</p>
            <p>§ 11. VII. It juſtly giveth large maintenance and honours to the Superior Clergy, that they may be a Protection to the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, and a relief to the poor, and keep up Religion from the contempt and ſcorn of Worldly men.</p>
            <p>§ 12. VIII. The King is juſtly the donor of ſuch honours and great revenues.</p>
            <p>§ 13. IX. The Pariſh Miniſters according to the true Legal Reformed Church of <hi>Englaend,</hi> are acknowledged true Paſtors, as to all the eſſentials of the Paſtoral Office (Word, Sacraments, Keys, Diſcipline and Ordinations.)</p>
            <p n="14">14. X. The Inferior Miniſters in Tythes and Glebe have moſtly a laudable maintenance.</p>
            <p>§ 15. XI. All the Pariſh Churches are to diſtinguiſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating Members from Non-communicating Inhabitants, and to refuſe the ſcandalous and unconfirmed, not ready or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring confirmation. And the Offices of Abſolution and Burial are fitted to the Faithful, were Diſcipline executed.</p>
            <p n="16">16. XII. Yet our Law for Diſſenters Aſſemblies, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth them all true Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who agree in the eſſentials, notwithſtanding their diſſent in divers leſſer things (as no doubt they are.)</p>
            <p>§ 17. XIII. We uſe one and the ſame Tranſlation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and uſually the ſame verſion of Pſalms, Time, Place, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſils, ſo far as allowed.</p>
            <p>All theſe are laudable parts of the Conſtitution of a National Church.</p>
            <p n="18">18. XIV. To which I may add that we all renounce all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Univerſal and Forreign Juriſdiction, Civil and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal: And all Traditions that pretend to be ſupplemental and perfecting to the Scripture; and all Infallibility of Popes and Councils.</p>
            <p>None of this therefore needeth a Reformation. But what then doth?</p>
            <p>§ 19. <hi>Anſ.</hi> All theſe things following. I. The entrance into the Church by Baptiſm of Infants, is done ſo lightly and raſhly while the Parents are forbidden to ſpeak a word there, as Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating their Children to God or Covenanting for them, but all
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60966:35"/>
is laid on ſuch Godfathers as never own the Children, nor ever intend to do what they Vow. And Baptiſm is refuſed if Croſſing be refuſed.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Biſhop only being to Confirm all in many hundred or ſcore Pariſhes, where one of many hundred is not known to him, much leſs examined by him; Confirmation is commonly made a deceiving Ceremony, and the Tranſition from the State of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Members into the State of Adult Communicants is made ſo wide, that the Church too little differeth from Catechumens, that I ſay not from thoſe without.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Pariſhes are many ſo large, that the Incumbent knoweth not his Church-Communicants, nor how many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds or thouſands ſtay away.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Canons, though they nullifie not the Incumbents Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorſhip, yet fetter him by unjuſt reſtraint from the due exerciſe of it.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Faithful, able, godly men, are kept and caſt out of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, for not ſinning againſt God, or not obeying unneceſſary and unfit terms of Miniſtration.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. And on the ſame account thouſands of the Religious Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are denied Communion, and caſt into Priſons; and ruined by Fines; and till lately forbidden all Publick Worſhip (above four.)</p>
            <p n="7">VII. The Decretive Power of the Keys of Excommunication and Abſolution is in the hands of Lay-men uſed <hi>pro formâ</hi> in the Biſhops name.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Patrons have too much power in chuſing Pariſh Paſtors for all the Land, without the Flocks conſent, and ſufficient cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Patrons qualifications.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Biſhops are choſen without due conſent or election of the Synods or People.</p>
            <p n="10">X. Ordinations are made by Biſhops without Synods, or any Presbyters but a few whom the Biſhop taketh <hi>pro formâ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">XI. The Epiſcopacy of Incumbents being denied by many, it is grown a common imagination that none are Ordained by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops that are not Ordained by Dioceſans.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. The Perſonal ignorance, viciouſneſs, and diſability of a great part of the Miniſtry is of all the reſt the worſt and hardeſt to be reformed.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. The too looſe tryal of the Ordained, and their neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry qualification much cauſeth this.</p>
            <p n="14">
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:60966:36"/>
XIV. And the corruption of the Univerſities is the Seminary and Nurſery of our ſins and dangers.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. Many dangerous Oaths or Covenants and Profeſſions are hurtfully impoſed on the Miniſters and People, by which Guilt and Diviſions are increaſed.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. And to compleat our dangers, an enmity or deep jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie is ſetled between the Publick Prieſts, and a great part of the moſt ſeriouſly Religious People of the Land. This diſtance hath long been cauſing, and the cauſes are ſtill continued. The badneſs of Prieſts in the time of Popery, and their contemptible inſufficiency in the beginning of the Reformation tempted many zealous Proteſtants to too hard thoughts of the generality of them. No Party hath been faultleſs. It fell out that the Exiles in <hi>Germany,</hi> who were moſt zealous in Religion againſt Popery and all ungodlineſs, followed <hi>Geneva,</hi> and ſet themſelves too much againſt Biſhops and our Liturgy, that they might not partake of the ſins of Popery. But Dr. <hi>Ri Cox</hi> that had been K. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. Tutor, and had a great hand in making our Liturgy, drew <hi>Horn</hi> and others to him, and forced our Liturgy on them at <hi>Frankford,</hi> and prevailing againſt them, drove them to <hi>Geneva,</hi> thinking that Reformation ſhould receive as much of the antient Forms and Ceremonies, as were not true Popery, nor forbidden of God, that the Papiſts might not challenge us as Noveliſts.</p>
            <p>On theſe terms of difference they came over into <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on both ſides generally godly Proteſtants. The Queen <hi>(Eliz.)</hi> took part with the Conformiſts, and made them Biſhops and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitaries, and diſcountenanced the Nonconformiſts. The firſt Race of theſe good Biſhops loved the godly Nonconforming Preachers, and connived at them, and encouraged them in their fervent, plain Preaching, and pious Living. But as that Race wore out by death, Biſhopricks having great honour, power and wealth, had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeekers; and ſeekers had many friends: And he that loveth wealth and honour moſt, is like to ſeek it moſt; and he that moſt ſeeketh is likeſt to find: And the greateſt Lovers of the World are the worſt men: And ſo Biſhops (not all at once, but) by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees were altered. Then the Nonconformiſts not only refuſing to be Biſhops, but too many declaring their Judgments to be for their fall, the Biſhops having more power, reſolved firſt to caſt them down, and to do their utmoſt to root them out: And made their Book of Canons and Acts of Uniformity fitted to that uſe.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60966:36"/>
And ſo the Enmity turned into a ruining War, became remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſave that on both ſides the godly and moderate lived peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, lamenting the extreams of the reſt. Qu. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and K. <hi>James I.</hi> having ſilenced many hundred Diſſenters that were of great worth &amp; extraordinary piety, and the Biſhops cauſing this, and in jealouſie of the ſtricteſt People forbidding them to faſt and pray together, and ſome other exerciſes of piety, and in K. <hi>Charles I.</hi> days carrying it yet higher to greater ſeverity, and this ſetled them in an Enmity to Biſhops as the Enemies of ſerious Piety, and the Biſhops more ſought to root them out of the Land: Till <hi>Laud</hi> carrying it further, and ſeeking a Coalition with thoſe that were for a Foreign Juriſdiction (Univerſal Councils with a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian Power, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> raiſed jealouſies in Parliaments, who being for their Liberties againſt Arbitrary Government, were the more againſt thoſe Biſhops that ſeemed to be for it; till Innovation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking the Scots, the Engliſh Lords encouraged by them, and the Iriſh murdering two hundred thouſand Proteſtants, affrighted <hi>England</hi> into a miſerable War, and made the moſt zealous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of Popery and Ungodlineſs, think that the Papiſts would deſtroy them all, if they did not help the Parliament to defend them. And the Scots would not help them, unleſs the Parliament would engage in the Scots Covenant againſt the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Prelacy, which proved a ſinful ſnare of Diviſion to all the Land. And the War ending in the Parliaments Conqueſt, and they conquered again and caſt out by their own Army, many Divines of the Dioceſan Judgment beſides the ſcandalous were caſt out: And the Reſtored Parliament recalling K. <hi>Charles II.</hi> (with his Clergy) the exaſperated came back with a reſolution of revenge, and the grand deſign of ſome was to begin where <hi>Laud</hi> left, and to extirpate Puritans, and to that end to get all power in Church and Univerſities, into the hands of the greateſt Enemies of the Nonconformiſts, and to get <hi>Laws</hi> of doubled cruelty made accordingly to root them out; which ſo far proſpered, that Univerſities and Miniſtry are ſufficiently diſpoſed into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and oppoſition to the Nonconformiſts; who are too ready to think that <hi>they</hi> and their <hi>well-wiſhers</hi> are (though not the <hi>only</hi> ſerious Religious part of the Land, yet the <hi>main body</hi> of them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to one; and that the main body of the <hi>hot Adherents to their Adverſaries,</hi> are the generality of the <hi>ſenſual, wordly,</hi> and <hi>profane;</hi> who uſe their Ceremonies as <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Whore did her Sacrifices
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60966:37"/>
and Vows, to encourage her to take her fill of Love till morning.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>differing manner</hi> of the <hi>Religious Devotions</hi> of theſe <hi>two parties,</hi> maketh the <hi>diſtance</hi> ſeem <hi>remedileſs,</hi> if ſome Moderate Peace-makers prove not the Cement. One ſort are all for <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by habit,</hi> called <hi>extempore;</hi> as Judges, Parliament and Lawyers ſpeak their minds; and ſay that <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Liturgies</hi> daily repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are uſually ſaid without life or fervency, as Boys ſay an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and little move men. The other are for the ſame Liturgy and Words, and too many deride <hi>all other praying:</hi> Whereas ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber unprejudiced men can make a ſerious uſe of both.</p>
            <p>But thus a Clergy modelled at the entrance of King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond into a ſet oppoſition to the way of the zealouſly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious People called Puritans (ſpecially by the intereſt and wrath of a few hot Doctors after made Biſhops,) are taken by the ſaid people for the Captains of Prophaneneſs.</p>
            <p>§ 20. Having ſeen what our Diſeaſes are, it is eaſy to know what muſt be the cure: But ſo hard to accompliſh it, that I muſt name the remedies with deſpair, unleſs the Almighty God will do it by means yet quite beyond our proſpect, yea to cure any one of all theſe Maladies requireth a power more than Mans.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>But is not our firſt Reformation and our Canons and preſent Laws of Conformity, a ſufficient means of Concord without any new Reformation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If ſo, why did King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth require Bucer to write for more, which he hath done in his <hi>Scripta Anglicana?</hi> And why was the <hi>Reformatio Legum Eccleſ.</hi> (prefaced by <hi>John Fox)</hi> Written by men Commiſſioned by him?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Are the ſame Canons fit for Papiſts, Prieſts and Proteſtant Preachers? Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> tells you that of nine thouſand Pariſh Prieſts, (beſides all others ordained) there did not much above eight hundred take the Reforming Oaths to keep their livings, ſo that there were above eight thouſand Papiſts Pariſh Prieſts in our Reformed Church; unleſs that Oath made them all true Proteſtants And what wonder if theſe were excuſed from Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and forbidden to Preach till they were further licenſed.

I will venture, though I know it will diſpleaſe the impenitent to ſay, that I will pitty that Miniſter more than a poor Publican or Drunkard, who will juſtifie, 1. All our Canons. 2. And all the Laws made as for Uniformity and againſt Nonconformiſts, and their Execution to the ſilencing of about two thouſand ſuch Miniſters, and the Death of many of them in and by impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ruine of the Eſtates of them and many more thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Godly People, 3. And the preſent ſtate of the Pariſh Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, where the alterations of the Liturgy ſhew that the Incumbents muſt not be called Paſtors, and ſuch as Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> Dean of <hi>Lincoln</hi> are allowed to publiſh, that <hi>[Inauditus erat Parochorum Paſtoratus ante hujus ſeculi &amp; antecedentis delirium] The Paſtor-ſhip of Pariſh Prieſts was never heard of before</hi> the <hi>Dotage</hi> (or Madneſs) of <hi>this</hi> and the <hi>foregoing Age.</hi> And ſo there is but one Paſtor and Church in a Dioceſs.

            <p>§ 21. I. Chriſtening by Baptiſm, muſt not be made an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Ceremony, but uſed as one of the greateſt actions of all the life of man: Parents being ſeriouſly taught to know what it is to enter their Child into the holy Covenant, and to Dedicate their Child to God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, renouncing the World, the Devil, and the Fleſh: And the Parents or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parents, and not perfidious diſſembling God-fathers, muſt ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſe their careful education.</p>
            <p>§ 22. II. The tranſition of thoſe Baptized in Infancy into the ſtate of Adult Communicants, muſt be made by an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſolemn owning of their Baptiſmal Covenant, and that by ſuch Paſtors as have time to examine and inſtruct them, and not made a deceitful Ceremony called Confirmation, by a Dioceſan that hath perhaps many hundred thouſands in his Dioceſs.</p>
            <p>§ 23. III. The Pariſhes muſt be known to the Paſtors that take the Charge of them, and the three ſorts of Inhabitants diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. 1. Thoſe that are of another Church (as Papiſts <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> or of no Church. 2. Thoſe that are Catechumens and ſubmit to be Catechized and Hear, 3. Thoſe that are Communicants. And each Pariſh muſt have Miniſters for <hi>number</hi> and <hi>quality</hi> ſuited to the number of Souls, and fit to know them and perform their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken Office.</p>

            <p>§ 25. V. Nothing ſinful or unneceſſary to Miniſtry or Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, muſt be impoſed as neceſſary Terms, nor Godly able Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters Silenced or Perſecuted cauſeleſly, that do more good than hurt.</p>
            <p>§ 26. VI. They that Worſhip not God in all our Forms and Ceremonies, or that are too ſcrupulous, muſt be tolerated to Worſhip as they can by themſelves, ſo be it, their Doctrine and Worſhip and Converſation, and Unpeaceableneſs be not into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.</p>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60966:38"/>
And if the Chancellors or Civilians Courts be kept up, they muſt be the Kings Magiſtrates, and uſe only ſuch power as Magiſtrates may uſe.</p>
            <p>§ 28. VIII. Thoſe that by the Laws are to be excluded from the Communion of the Churches (publick and tolerated) ſhould not have the power of chooſing Incumbents: Nor thoſe that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude themſelves. Nor ſhould thoſe Patrons that chooſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent that ſhall have the Place and Tythes, hinder any perſon from chooſing to whom he will voluntarily truſt the peculiar Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral care of his own Soul; Nor ſhould men be hindered from the <hi>publick</hi> or tolerated Miniſtry of ſuch as they ſo chooſe.</p>
            <p>§ 29. IX. Ordinations ſhould be made after ſufficient tryal of the Learning and Abilities of the Ordained, in Preaching and Praying, as well as upon a full teſtimony of his Pious and Upright Converſation, and no Inſtitution to a Title granted till the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners have leave, warning and time, to know the man, and ſhew their acceptance or diſſent, and be impartially heard.</p>

            <p>§ 31. XI. Pariſh Churches muſt be acknowledged true Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and the Presbyters to be <hi>Epiſcopi Gregis,</hi> and the Incumbent that hath Curates to be <hi>Epiſcopus Praeſes,</hi> as well as the Dioceſans to be General or Archbiſhops. And Ordination by Preſident Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops not called Null, or ſaid to be no Epiſcopal Ordination: But the corruption of the Miniſtry by unqualified men is ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a thing, that if the Supreme Power give the Dioceſane a Negative power as of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> without whom no Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall entitle any man to any Benefice, (leaving Incumbents on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to chooſe their own Curates, and to concur with the Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan in other Ordinations) there will be no juſt cauſe of refuſing ſuch Dioceſans Power or Ordination.</p>
            <p>§ 32. XII. An utterly inſufficient, heretical, malignant, ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcandalous Miniſter is not to be maintained nor tolerated; and due means muſt be uſed to keep and caſt ſuch out.</p>
            <p>§ 33. XIII. The purging of the Univerſities, and the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating of their Government and Tutoring to Godly, Wiſe and Conſcionable men, is one of the greateſt points of neceſſary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.

§ 34. XIV. The ſad diſaffection like enmity between the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and the moſt Religious People muſt be healed: which will be eaſily done in thoſe Pariſhes, where the Miniſters Preach Judiciouſly, Experimentally, Spiritually and Powerfully, and live Piouſly, Charitibly, Juſtly and Temperately, and love good men, and rebuke the wicked, and put due difference between the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and the vile, thoſe that ſerve God and thoſe that ſerve him not, thoſe that ſwear and thoſe that fear an Oath: and make not the Church like the Commons or Wilderneſs. And where the Dioceſans are the encouragers of ſerious Godlineſs, and duely rebuke the Enemies and neglecters of it, and the vicious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane. I have never ſeen the place where ſuch an exemplary wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Miniſtry did not win the Hearts of the Nonconformiſts, and became not very dear and amiable to them, and uſually drew them to Concord where before they differed.</p>
            <p>§ 35. But it muſt be a wiſe and godly King that muſt be the principal means to accompliſh all this, if ever it be done; ſuch a one that underſtandeth Gods Law and Intereſt and his own and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms real welfare, may do that by good Laws and Prudent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which ſhall be to parties of erroneous opinions, a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful byas to incline their Judgments to go right: One man we may have more hope of making wiſe than of multitudes. I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have a uniting ſettlement by the choice of a wiſe Prince and Parliament, yea or of Dioceſanes of Wiſdom, Piety and Peace, than by the choice of any of the extreams, whether Separatiſts, or the Laudian New Church men, that are for a Forreign Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. But through Gods great mercy the moſt of the Godly able Nonconformiſts Miniſters, falſly called Presbyterians, of my acquaintance, are ſo much for Truth and Peace and Concord, that they would rejoice to live under ſuch Biſhops, as were <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzene, Baſil, Chryſoſtom, Auſtin,</hi> or ſuch as <hi>Beadle, Uſher, Downame,</hi> (tho an angry man) <hi>Jewel,</hi> Dr. <hi>Parker, Grindal, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinton, Sandies, G. Abbot, Rob. Abbot, Hall, Carlton, Morton, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, Brownrig</hi> and ſuch like. And are moſt Epiſcopal Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts, and would chooſe none but healing Terms.</p>
            <p>§ 36. And now what ſhall I gain by this Diſcourſe? I am ſure of the cenſure of both the extreams. And I expect that few ſhould much regard what I have ſaid: but that ſcorners will ſcorn ſtill, and Fools hate Knowledge, and that Lies carry on Murders and he that is the Father of both, by both carries on his work in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:60966:39"/>
But great is the Truth and will prevail at laſt, but whether on this ſide the new Heaven and Earth I know not.</p>
            <p>§ 37. I conclude with an earneſt requeſt to Godly peaceable men that they conſider well before they ſpeak againſt a Nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Church, or for any above National under one humane Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that they will read my old diſpute of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about Apoſtolick Succeſſions with the additions of this Commentary and fuller proof, and Mr. <hi>Tho.

And that by this diſtinction of Biſhops they will expound my Treatiſe of Epiſcopacy, and my Church Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Councils and former Biſhops.

            <head>Chap. XV. <hi>The Caſe of Toleration of Diſſenters from the Common Laws and Cuſtoms of a National Church more particularly anſwered.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>§ 1. THIS caſe about Toleration in and from a National Church hath been oft put to me and oft and largely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. And to what uſe ſuch a work will ſerve I am unable to conjecture, except it be to ſatisfie the Writers Conſcience, and ſet right the thoughts of them that deſire what they cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; And whether God will ever raiſe up a Generation, that wearied with Diviſions and the direful effects, and forced by ſome Prince of Piety or Intereſt, to conſent to a healing Peace and Concord, God knoweth and not I.</p>
            <p>§ 2. But I will once more venture to repeat a Moral Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtication, <q>
                  <hi>That I think it</hi> (ex cauſis) <hi>exceeding probable that either</hi> England <hi>will have Popery ſetled in Power by a French Conqueſt in the French Faſhion, by the compliance of thoſe of the Engliſh Clergy who are for a Foreign Church Juriſdiction: Or elſe God will conſtrain the preſent Governours by the ſenſe of their own intereſt if not of the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Religion and the common good, to open the publick Church Doors to that Concord which they have been lockt againſt by the Act of uniformity and ſuch like above thirty years, and the unplacable Enemies of Peace will caſt down themſelves.</hi>
               </q>

            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:60966:40"/>
For I am paſt doubt of what my dear friend Judge <hi>Hale</hi> ſaid to me, that <hi>[It muſt be a new Act of Uniformity that muſt heal this Church.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 3. And ſhould we treat of ſuch a ſubject as Concord and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, with whom ſhould it be? If it be not with fit perſons, we have found that it will be in vain and worſe. It's God that muſt make peace between the Wolf or Lion, and the Lamb, and not ſuch as I.</p>
            <p>§ 4. 1. If we treat with <hi>Proud Men,</hi> they will have no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord but by mens granting their unjuſt demands, and ſubmitting to their Wills, whatever God and Reaſon ſay againſt it. And they muſt be in Rule and the moſt Worthy and Innocent be at their mercy.</p>
            <p>§ 5. 2. If we treat with Worldlings and Self-ſeeking men, their Worldly intereſt muſt be the meaſure of Concord: And how various, mutable and unrighteous is that like to be?</p>
            <p>§ 6. 3. If we treat with malignants their terms of peace, will be directly or indirectly the ſuppreſſion of ſerious Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>§ 7. 4. If we treat with Factious Schiſmaticks, Hereticks or Papiſts, their terms will be only that which furthereth and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth their ſects.</p>
            <p>§ 8. 5. If we treat with Fools, they will not underſtand the caſe nor the reaſon that is urged: They will not diſtinguiſh of Places, Times, Perſons, Cauſes, the Sence of Words, but rage and be confident in confuſion.</p>
            <p>§ 9. 6. If we deal with Timorous Cowardly Hypocrites, or low and ſelf-ſaving Spirits, they will but be <hi>Nicodemites,</hi> and not venture on danger or difficulty, but ſtay till they ſee which way will be ſtrongeſt and moſt for their advantage: Or till Governors drive them on. And then it's well if they do but conſent.</p>
            <p>§ 10. 7. Shall we then leave all to the ſober godly peaceable men? It may that way do ſome perſonal and private good, but I fear they will be ſo low as to be contemned and ſo few that in the Crowd and Noiſe of rage, they will not be heard, nor regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſs as little <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> they get up into a Tree by the help of ſome extraordinary Superior: So that there is ſo little hope of the ſucceſs of any ſuch attempt, and I have written ſo much of it long ago, almoſt in vain, that I will ſay now but this little following.</p>
            <p>§ 11. 1. The Terms of Toleration muſt differ according to the different Caſe of the Superiors and Impoſers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And according to different Cauſes of Diſſenters.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:60966:40"/>
3. And according to their different Capacities and Relations.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And according to their different temper and behaviour in managing their cauſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And as Rulers are able or unable to ſuppreſs them without more hurt than good.</p>
            <p>§ 12. I. If Superiors have made Diſſenters by ſinful Laws, the Peace muſt be more than a Toleration, by changing thoſe Laws. <hi>Shall the Throne of Iniquity have Fellowſhip with God, when they frame Miſchief by a Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 13. II. A Diſſenter that oppoſeth the Eſſentials of Religion, or teacheth Damnable or Treaſonable Doctrines, muſt be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced from thoſe that only refuſe to be Perjured, or Lie, and make a ſinful Covenant and Promiſe, or Profeſſion, or that ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſome ſmall unneceſſary thing which to them ſeemeth ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods Laws.</p>
            <p>§ 14. III. A poor weak woman or unlearned man, muſt not be impoſed on and dealt with on the ſame terms as a man of wit and learning: Nor the Laity as the Clergy.</p>
            <p>§ 15. IV. Thoſe of a meek and quiet Spirit may be more ſuffered than turbulent unpeaceable men, though it be in the ſame material points that they diſſent. Therefore much muſt be left to the Will of the Rulers, who can difference between Man and Man when the Law cannot.</p>
            <p>§ 16. V. In a Country where the Preaching of faulty men (though elſewhere uſeful) is unneceſſary by reaſon of a full number of better (if ſuch a Land there were) the ſilencing of ſuch men is more allowable than elſewhere. And even Hereſie and many faults may have impunity, though not a juſtifying toleration, in a time and place where puniſhment and ſuppreſſion cannot be uſed without apparent doing more hurt than good. Rulers are not bound to do what they cannot do. And they cannot do that which they muſt not do, becauſe it will do more hurt than good.</p>
            <p>§ 17. VI. In a Country where the publick Miniſtry and Churches are ſo depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the Intereſt of the Church and Religion lieth more in ſaving People from them than in Uniting with them, there the Tolerated muſt be moſt countenanced and ſtrengthen'd; But in a Country or Age where the Intereſt of Religion lyeth moſt in the publick Churches, and the Diſſenters are a weak miſtaken ſort of ſcrupulous honeſt People, there the Tolerated Churches ſhould be like ſo many Hopitals where weak People are cheriſhed; but it's not deſireable that it be the common caſe of all the City or Country.</p>
            <p>§ 18. Obj. <hi>But ſuch Toleration will multiply Separatiſts, and weaken the Church: They will be ſtill reproaching it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>§ 19. Obj. <hi>But long experience telleth us that ſuch a work is impoſſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It only telleth us that it is unlikely: Becauſe, <hi>Pride, Worldlineſs, Malignity, Selfiſhneſs</hi> and <hi>Madceſs</hi> have got ſo large poſſeſſion on Earth; and forſaking God's Government hath given Satan power over ſo much of Mankind. But God can caſt out Satan, and interpoſe days with nights, and Summers with Winters, and turn <hi>Bedia as</hi> into ſober Societies: It is but bringing men to their wits, as the Prodigal was. To give ſo great a number of Great men, Clergy men, Students, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched ignorant perſons, true Grace as the healing of National Churches, as in moſt of the Chriſtian World are, now the mortal Enemies of Peace (while they cry it up.) This I confeſs is ſo unlikely, as ſcarce to be hoped for: But God can force them by their own Argument: He can make them know that they muſt give Peace to their Friends that in vain have long begg'd it, or ſuffer from their Enemies worſe than they have done to their innocent Brethren. If we will not open the Church doors to Unity, that have long been ſhut againſt it, God hath Keys that can open and no man ſhut them. Even Heathen Rulers oft ſaved the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians from the zealous cruel blinded Jews, and <hi>Gallio</hi> drave them from the Judgment Seat. Chriſtian Jews were ſaved, when <hi>Veſpatian, Titus, Trajan,</hi> and <hi>Adrian</hi> deſtroyed about three miſſions of the Infidels. And if our Frenchified <hi>Foreign-Juriſdiction-men,</hi> ſhould think to eſcape and proſper by a bargain of Coalition, they may be miſtaken, or ſpeed worſe than if they ſuffered.</p>
            <p>But I hope God will rather convince a prevailing part that All that they have got theſe thirty years (or thrice thirty) by their way of ſilencing, ruinating, reproach and violence, hath not been a due compenſation, for all that they have done by it, againſt Miniſters, People, Rulers, and themſelves, and the Unity, Love, Strength and Safety of the Land: And that if they will hear none at home, God will ſo feelingly Preach to them from abroad, as to tell them, that if Love and Peace with Brethren ſounder than they, at home ſeem hateful to them, yet worſe it worſe, and great Foreign Enemies are more terrible. They that can bear <hi>Reboboam</hi>'s Yoke, may under <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s beforced to ſad cryes. Thunder awakeneth when ſoft talk will not. It's a thundering voice that can be heard over Sea and Land. Cannons are as loud as Thunder, or may be heard as far.</p>
            <p>§ 20. But what is the difficulty in the way to Concord? Had thoſe that could eaſily do it, but opened the Church doors at firſt but to the liberty of Preaching a Lecture when the Incumbent conſented; much more had they made a new healing Act of Uniformity, which ſhould have eaſed Conſcience of the fears of deliberate Perjury, Lying and Profaning holy things, and had the Conforming by petitioning Rulers, ſhewed that this was their deſire, what would have rendered it impoſſible?</p>
            <p>But <hi>forma non recipitur in materiam indiſpoſitam:</hi> It's in vain to talk of healing to yet ancapable men.</p>
