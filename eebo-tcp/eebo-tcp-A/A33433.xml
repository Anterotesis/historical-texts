            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat we interrupt your more serious Studies with the offer of this Piece, the injury that hath been and is done to the deceased Author's ashes not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleadeth our excuse, but engageth you (whose once he was, and within whose walls this standard of wit was
<pb facs="tcp:61498:3"/>
first set up) in the same quarrel with us.</p>
            <p>Whilst <hi>Randolph</hi> and <hi>Cowley</hi> lie embalmed in their own native wax, how is the name and memory of <hi>Clieveland</hi> equally prophaned by those that usurp, and those that blaspheme it? By those that are ambitious to lay their Cuckows eggs in his nest, and those that think to raise up Phenixes of wit by firing his spicy bed about him?</p>
            <p>We know you have not without pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate resentments beheld the prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of his name in some late Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vended under it, wherein his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are murthered over and over in barbarous Latine, and a more barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Translation: and wherein is scarce one or other Poem of his own to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute for all the rest. At least every Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riasier of his hath a fulsom Dragooner behind him, and <hi>Venus</hi> is again une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally yoaked with a sooty Anvile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beater.
<pb facs="tcp:61498:3"/>
               <hi>Clieveland</hi> thus revived dieth another death.</p>
            <p>You cannot but have beheld with like zealous indignation how enviously our late Mushrom-wits look up at him because he overdroppeth them, and snarl at his brightness as Dogs at the Moon.</p>
            <p>Some of these grand Sophys will not allow him the reputation of wit at all: yet how many such Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors must be creamed and spirited to make up his <hi>Fuscara</hi>? And how many of their slight productions may be gig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of one of his pregnant Words? There perhaps you may find some leaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gold, here massie wedges; there some scattered rayes, here a Galaxy; there some loose fancy frisking in the Ayr, here Wit's Zodiack.</p>
            <p>The quarrel in all this is upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing merit, and eminence his crime. His touring Fancy soareth so high a pitch
<pb facs="tcp:61498:4"/>
that they fly like shades below him. The Torrent thereof (which riseth far above their high water mark) drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their Levels. Vsurping upon the State Poetick of the time he hath brought in such insolent measures of Wit and Language that despairing to imitate, they must study to understand. That alone is Wit with them to which they are commensurate, and what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth their scantling is monstrous.</p>
            <p>Thus they deifie his Wit and Fancy as the Clown the plump Oyster when he could not crack it. And now instead of that strenuous masculine stile which breatheth in this Author, we have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an enervous effeminate froth offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as if they had taken the saliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Pill before they set pen to paper. You must hold your breath in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usal lest the Iest vanish by blowing on.</p>
            <p>Another blemish in this monster of perfection is the exuberance of his
<pb facs="tcp:61498:4"/>
Fancy. His <hi>Manna</hi> lieth so thick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground they loath it. When he should only fan, he with Hurricanos of wit stonnieth the sense and doth not so much delight his Reader, as oppress and overwhelm him.</p>
            <p>To cure this excess, their frugal wit hath reduced the World to a <hi>Lessian</hi> Diet. If perhaps they entertain their Reader with one good Thought (as these new Dictators affect to speak) he may sit down and say Grace over it: the rest is words and nothing else.</p>
            <p>We will leave them therefore to the most proper vengeance, to humour themselves with the perusal of their own Poems: and leave the Barber to rub their thick skulls with bran until they are fit for Musk. Only we will leave this friendly advice with them; that they have one eye upon <hi>John Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deskant</hi>'s Executor, lest among his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Minims of Art and Nature he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb facs="tcp:61498:5"/>
their slight Conceits: and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the Royal Society, lest they make their Poems the counter-ballance when they intend to weigh Air.</p>
            <p>From these unequal censures we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to such competent Iudges as your selves, in whose just value of him <hi>Clieveland</hi> shall live the wonder of his own, and the pattern of succeeding Ages. And although we might (upon several accompts) bespeak your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, yet (abstracting from these) we submit him to your severer Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and doubt not but he will find that Patronage from you which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired and expected by</p>

            <head>A short Account of the Author's Life.</head>
            <p>HE was born at <hi>Hinckley,</hi> a small Market Town in the County of <hi>Leicester,</hi> if we may esteem that small which glorieth in so great a Birth.</p>
            <p>His Father was the Reverend and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Minister of the Place. <hi>Fortes creantur è fortibus.</hi> Being thus well descended for a vein of Learning he even lisped wit, like an English <hi>Bard,</hi> and was early ripe for the University, who was one.</p>
            <p>To cherish so great hopes, the Lady <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> drew forth both her breasts. <hi>Christ</hi>'s College in <hi>Cambridge</hi> gave him Admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n, and St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s a Fellowship. There he lived about the space of nine years, the delight and ornament of that Society. What Service, as well as Reputation he did it, let his Orations and Epistles speak; to which the Library oweth much of its Learning, the Chappel much of its pious Decency, and the College much of its Renown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61498:6"/>The Rayes which he thus shed upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, reflected upon himself. But that which alone may suffice for his honour is, that after the Oration which he addressed to that Incomparable Prince, of Blessed Memory, <hi>Charles</hi> the First, the King called for him, and (with great expressions of kindness) gave him his hand to kiss, and commanded a Copy to be sent after him to <hi>Huntington,</hi> whither he was hastening that Night.</p>
            <p>Thus he shined with equal light and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence until the general Eclipse; of which no man had more Sagacious Prognosticks. When <hi>Oliver</hi> was in Election to be Burgess for the Town of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as he engaged all his Friends and Interests to oppose it, so when it was passed, he said with much passionate. Zeal, That single Vote had ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both Church and Kingdom. Such ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock the good Prophet beheld in <hi>Hazael</hi>'s face. Such fatal Events did he presage from his bloody beak. And no sooner did that Schrich Owl appear in the University but this Sun declined. Perceiving the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracism that was intended, he became a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntier in his Academick Exile, and would no longer breath the common Air with such Pests of Mankind.</p>
            <p>From thence he betook himself to the
<pb facs="tcp:61498:6"/>
Camp of his Sovereign, and particularly to <hi>Oxford</hi> the Head-Quarter of it, as the most proper and proportionate Sphere for his Wit, Learning and Loyalty; and add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no small Lustre to that with which that famous University shined before.</p>
            <p>His next Stage was the Garrison of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ark,</hi> where he was Judge Advocate, until the Surrender: and, by an excellent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of both, was a just and prudent Judge for the King, and a faithful Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for the Countrey. There he drew up that gallant Return to the Summons of the Besiegers, which spake him, and the rest that were embarqued with him, resolute to sacrifice their Lives to their Loyalty, had not the King's Especial Command, when first he had surrendred himself into the hands of the <hi>Scots,</hi> made such stubborn Loyalty a Crime. And here again he was <hi>Vates</hi> in the whole import of the word, both Poet and Prophet: for, beside his passionate resentment of it in that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Poem, The King's Disguise, upon some private Intelligence, three dayes before the King reached them, he foresaw the Pieces of Silver paying upon the Banks of <hi>Tweed,</hi> and that they were the price of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign's blood, and predicted the Tragical Events.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61498:7"/>Thenceforth he followed the Fates of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>istressed Loyalty, for which, when he had been long imprisoned at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed his Petition to <hi>Oliver</hi>; wherein he courteth his freedom with such insinuations as might neither do violence to his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor betray his Cause.</p>
            <p>After many intermediate Stages (which contended as emulously for his aboad, as the seven Cities for <hi>Homer</hi>'s Birth) <hi>Grays-Inn</hi> was his last: which when he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobled with some short residence also, an Intermitting Fever seized him, whereof he died. A Disease at that time Epidemical: and if it had taken him only away (so publick was the loss) it deserved to carry the name of a Common Mortality.</p>
            <p>He was buried upon the first day of <hi>May</hi> (for which nothing but the 29. can attone) in the Parish Church of St. <hi>Michael Royal</hi> upon <hi>College Hill London, Anno</hi> 1658. To which being attended by many Persons of Learning and Loyalty, Mr. <hi>Edward Thurman</hi> performed the Office of Burial, and the Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> (now Lord Bishop of <hi>Chester</hi>) Preached his Funeral Sermon, and made his Death Glorious.</p>
            <p>And now there wanteth nothing but a Monument for him: and in this Book he
<pb facs="tcp:61498:7"/>
hath erected one to himself, which Envy may repine at, but cannot reach.</p>

               <l>Now the Church Militant in plenty rests,</l>

                  <l>If ever I have a Man, Square-Cap for me.</l>

               <head>The Character of a Country-Committee-man, with the Ear-mark of a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questrator.</head>
               <p>A Committee-man by his Name should be one that is possessed, there is number enough in it to make an Epithet for <hi>Legion.</hi> He is <hi>Persona in concreto</hi> (to borrow the Solecism of a Modern Statesman.) You may translate it by the <hi>Red-Bull</hi> Phrase, and speak as proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Enter seven Devils <hi>solus.</hi> It is a well truss'd Title that contains both the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and the Beast; for a Committee-man is a Noun of Multitude, he must be spell'd with Figures, like Antichrist wrapp'd in a Pair-Royal of Sixes. Thus the Name is as monstrous as the Man, a complex notion, of the same Lineage with Accumulative Treason. For his Office it is the Heptar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, or <hi>England</hi>'s Fritters; it is the broken meat of a crumbling Prince, only the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty is greater; for it is here as in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of Loaves, the Voyder exceeds the Bill of Fare. The Pope and he rings the Changes; here is the Plurality of Crowns
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61498:59"/>
to one Head, joyn them together and there is a Harmony in Discord. The Triple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed Turn-key of Heaven with the Tripleheaded Porter of Hell. A Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee-man is the Reliques of Regal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but, like Holy Reliques, he out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulks the Substance whereof he is a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. There is a score of Kings in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, as in the Reliques of the Cross there is the number of twenty. This is the Gyant with the hundred hands that wields the Scepter; the Tyrannical Bead-Roll by which the Kingdom prays back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and at every Curse drops a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee man. Let <hi>Charles</hi> be wav'd, whose condescending Clemency aggravates the Defection, and make <hi>Nero</hi> the Question, better a <hi>Nero</hi> than a Committee. There is less Execution by a single Bullet, than by Case-shot.</p>
               <p>Now a Committee man is a party-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd Officer. He must be drawn like <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> with Cross and Pile in his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; as he relates to the Souldiers, or faces about to his fleecing the Country. Look upon him Martially, and he is a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of War, one that hath bound his <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> up in Buff, and will needs be of the <hi>Quorum</hi> to the best Commanders. He is one of <hi>Mars</hi> his Lay-Elders, he shares in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61498:59"/>
the Government, though a <hi>Non</hi>-conformist to his bleeding Rubrick. He is the like Sectary in Arms, as the Platonick is in Love, keeps a fluttering in Discourse, but proves a Haggard in the Action. He is not of the Souldiers and yet of his Flock. It is an Emblem of the Golden Age (and such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he makes it to him) when so tame a Pigeon may converse with Vultures. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks a Committee hanging about a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Bandileers dangling about a fur'd Alderman have an Anagram Resemblance. There is no Syntax between a Cap of Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and a Helmet. Who ever knew an Enemy routed by a Grand Jury and a <hi>Billa vera</hi>? It is a left-handed Garrison where their Authority perches; but the more preposterous the more in fashion; the right hand sights while the left rules the Reigns. The truth is the Souldier and the Gentleman are like <hi>Don Quixot</hi> and <hi>Sancha Pancha,</hi> one fights at all Adventures to purchase the other the Government of the Island. A Committee-man properly should be the Governour's Matress to fit his Truckle, and to new-string him with si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news of War; for his chief use is to raise Assessments in the Neighbouring Wapen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.</p>
               <p>The Country people being like an <hi>Irish</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:61498:60"/>
Cow that will not give down her Milk, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less she see her Calf before her: Hence it is he is the Garrison's Dry-Nurse, he chews their Contribution before he feeds them; so the poor Souldiers live like <hi>Trochilus</hi> by picking the Teeth of this sacred Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile.</p>
               <p>So much for his Warlike or Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-Face, which is so preternatural, that it is rather a Vizard than a Face; <hi>Mars</hi> in him hath but a blinking Aspect, his Face of Arms is like his Coat, <hi>Partie per pale,</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier and Gentleman much of a scantling.</p>
               <p>Now enter his Taxing and deglubing Face, a squeezing Look, like that of <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sianus,</hi> as if he were bleeding over a Close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool.</p>
               <p>Take him thus, and he is in the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Purse an Authentick Gypsie, that nips your Bung with a Canting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: not a murthered Fortune in all the Country but bleeds at the Touch of this Malefactor. He is the Spleen of the Body Politick that swells it self to the Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Whole. At first indeed he Ferreted for the Parliament, but since he hath got off his Cope he set up for himself. He lives upon the Sins of the People, and that is a good standing Dish too. He veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Axiom, <hi>Iisdem nutritur ex quibus
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61498:60"/>
componitur</hi>; his Diet is suitable to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. I have wondred often why the plundred Country-men should repair to him for succour; certainly it is under the same Notion, as one whose Pockets are pick'd goes to <hi>Mal Cut-purse,</hi> as the Predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in that Faculty.</p>
               <p>He out-dives a Dutch man, gets a Noble of him that was never worth six pence; for the poorest do not escape, but Dutch-like, he will be dreyning even in the driest Ground. He aliens a Delinquent's Estate with as little Remorse, as his other Holiness gives away an Heretick's Kingdom; and for the truth of the Delinquency, both Chapmen have as little share of Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. <hi>Lye</hi> is the Grand Salad of Arbitrary Government, Executor to the Star-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and the High-Commission; for those Courts are not extinct, they survive in him, like Dollars changed into single Money. To speak the truth, he is the Universal Tribunal: for since these Times all Causes fall to his Cognizance; as in a great Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Diseases turn oft to the Plague. It concerns our Masters the Parliament to look about them; if he proceedeth at this rate, the Jack may come to swallow the Pike, as the Interest often eats out the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal. As his Commands are great, so he
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61498:61"/>
looks for a Reverence accordingly. He is punctual in exacting your Hat, and to say, Right his due, but by the same Title as the upper Garment is the Vails of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner. There was a time when such Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel would hardly have been taken upon suspicion for Men in office, unless the old Proverb were renewed, That the Beggars make a Free Company, and those their Wardens. You may see what it is to hang together. Look upon them severally, and you cannot but fumble for some Threds of Charity. But oh, they are <hi>Termagants</hi> in Conjunction! like Fidlers, who are Rogues when they go single, and joyn'd in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort, Gentlemen Musicianers. I care not much if I untwist my Committee-man, and so give him the Receit of this Grand <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take a State-martyr, one that for his good Behaviour hath paid the Excise of his Ears, so suffered Captivity by the Land-Piracy of Ship-money; next a Primitive Freeholder, one that hates the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is a Gentleman, transgressing the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of Delving <hi>Adam.</hi> Add to these a Mortified Bankrupt, that helps out his false Weights with some Scruples of Conscience, and with his peremptory Scales can doom his Prince with a <hi>Mene Tekel.</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:61498:61"/>
These with a new blew-stockin'd Justice, lately made of a good Basket-hilted Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, with a short-handed Clerk, tack'd to the Rear of him to carry the Knapsack of his Understanding; together with two or three Equivocal Sirs, whose Religion, like their Gentility, is the Extract of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres; being therefore Spiritual, because they are Earthly; not forgetting the Man of the Law, whose Corruption gives the Hogan to the sincere Juncto. These are the Simples of this Precious Compound; a kind of Dutch Hotch-Potch, the <hi>Hogan Mogan</hi> Committee-man.</p>
               <p>The Committee-man hath a Side-man, or rather a Setter, hight a Sequestrator, of whom you may say, as of the Great <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>'s Horse, where he treads the Grass grows no more. He is the States Cormo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, one that fishes for the publick, but feeds himself; the misery is, he fishes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Cormorant's Property, a Rope to strengthen the Gullet, and to make him disgorge. A Sequestratour! He is the Devil's Nut-hook, the Sign with him is always in the Clutches. There are more Monsters retain to him, than to all the Limbs in Anatomy. It is strange Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do not apply him to the Soles of the Feet in a desperate Fever, he draws far
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61498:62"/>
beyond Pigeons. I hope some Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank will slice him and make the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He is a Tooth drawer once remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; here is the difference, one applauds the Grinder, the other the Grist. Never till now could I verifie the Poet's Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the ravenous Harpie had a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Visage. Death himself cannot quit scores with him; like the Demoniack in the Gospel, he lives among Tombs, nor is all the Holy Water shed by Widows and Orphans a sufficient Exorcism to dispossess him. Thus the Cat sucks your breath, and the Fiend your blood; nor can the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood of Witch-finders, so sagely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted with all their Terrour, wean the Familiars.</p>
               <p>But once more to single out my emboss'd Committee-man; his Fate (for I know you would fain see an end of him) is either a whipping Audit, when he is wrung in the Withers by a Committee of Examinations, and so the Spunge weeps out the Moisture which he had soaked before; or else he meets his Passing-peal in the clamorous Mutiny of a Gut-foundred Garrison: for the Hedge-sparrow will be feeding the Cuckow, till he mistake his Commons and bites off her head. What-ever it is, it is within his desert: for what is observed of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61498:62"/>
some Creatures, that at the same time they Trade in productions three Stories high, Suckling the first, Big with the second and Clicketing for the third: a Committee-man is the Counterpoint, his Mischief is Superfetation, a certain Scale of Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for he ruines the Father, beggars the Son, and strangles the hopes of all Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

List him a Writer, and you smother <hi>Geoffry</hi> in Swabber-slops; the very name of Dabler over-sets him; he is swallowed up in the phrase, like Sir <hi>S. L.</hi> in a great Saddle, nothing to be seen, but the Giddy Feather in his Crown. They call him a <hi>Mercury,</hi> but he becomes the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61498:63"/>
Epithet, like the little Negro mounted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Elephant, just such another Blot Rampant. He has not Stuffings sufficient for the Reproach of a Scribler; but it hangs about him like an old Wifes Skin, when the Flesh hath forsaken her, lank and loose. He defames a good Title as well as most of our Modern Noble Men; those Wens of Greatness, the Body Politick's most pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Humours, Blistred into Lords. He hath so Raw-bon'd a Being, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you render him, he rubs it out and makes Rags of the Expression. The silly Country-man, who seeing an Ape in a Scarlet-coat, bless'd his young Worship, and gave his Landlord joy of the hopes of his House, did not slander his Complement with worse Application, than he that names this Shred an Historian. To call him an Historian is to knight a Mandrake: 'tis to view him through a Perspective, and by that gross <hi>Hyperbole</hi> to give the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of an Engineer to a Maker of Mouse-traps. Such an Historian would hardly pass muster with a Scotch Stationer in a Sieveful of Ballads and Godly Books. He would not serve for the Breast-plate of a begging Grecian. The most cramp'd <hi>Compendium</hi> that the Age hath seen since all Learning hath been almost torn into
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61498:63"/>
Ends, outstrips him by the Head. I have heard of Puppets that could prattle in a Play, but never saw of their Writings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. There goes a Report of the <hi>Holland</hi> Women, that together with their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they are delivered of a <hi>Sooterkin,</hi> not unlike to a Rat, which some imagine to be the Off-spring of the Stoves. I know not what <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> adulterates the Press but it seems much after that fashion, else how could this Vermin think to be a Twin to a Legitimate Writer; when those weekly Fragments shall pass for History, let the poor man's Box be entituled the Exchequer, and the Alms-basket a Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine. Not a Worm that gnaws on the dull Scalp of Voluminous <hi>Hollinshed,</hi> but at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Meal devour'd more Chronicle, than his Tribe amounts to. A Marginal Note of <hi>W. P.</hi> would serve for a Winding-sheet, for that man's Works, like thick-skinn'd Fruits, are all Rinde, fit for nothing but the Authors Fate to be pared in a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory.</p>
               <p>The Cook, who serv'd up the Dwarf in a Pye (to continue the Frolick) might have lapp'd up such an Historian as this in the Bill of Fare. He is the first Tincture and Rudiment of a Writer, dipp'd as yet in the preparative Blew, like an Almannack
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61498:64"/>
Well-willer. He is the Cadet of a Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleteer, the Pedee of a Romancer; he is the Embryo of a History slink'd before Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity. How should he Record the Issues of Time, who is himself an Abortive? I will not say but that he may pass for an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian in <hi>Garbier</hi>'s Academy; he is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much of the size of those Knot-grass Professors. What a pitiful Seminary was there project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! yet sutable enough to the present U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversities, those dry Nurses, which the Providence of the Age has so fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, that they are turn'd Reformado's: But that's no matter, the meanner the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It is a Maxim observable in these days, That the only way to win the Game is to play Petty <hi>Iohns.</hi> Of this number is the Esquire of the Quill; for he hath the Grudging of History, and some Yawnings accordingly. Writing is a Disease in him, and holds like a Quotidian; so 'tis his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity that makes him an Author, as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> was beholding to the Falling-sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to vouch him a Prophet. That nice Artificer, who filed a Chain so thin and light, that a Flea could trail it (as if he had work'd Short hand, and taught his Tools to Cypher) did but contrive an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem for this Skip-Jack and his slight pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions.</p>

                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:61498:64"/>Methinks the Turk should license Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, because he prohibits Learning and Books. A Library of Diurnals is a Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe of Frippery; 'tis a just <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Limbo</hi> of the Infants. I saw one once that could write with his Toes, by the same token I could have wished he had worn his Copies for Socks; 'tis he without doubt from whom the Diurnals derive their Pedigree, and they have a Birth right accordingly, being shuffled out at the bed's feet of History. To what infinite numbers an Historian would multiply, should he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

They tug at the Pen, like slaves at the Oar, a whole Bank together; they write in the Posture that the <hi>Suedes</hi> gave fire in, over one another's heads. It is said there is more of them go to a Suit of Cloaths than to a <hi>Britannicus</hi>: in this Polygamy the Cloaths breed, and cannot determine whose Issue is Lawfully begotten.</p>
               <p>And here I think it it were not amiss to take a particular how he is accoutred, and so do by him as he in his <hi>Siquis</hi> for the Wall-ey'd Mare, or the Crop Flea-bitten, give you the Marks of the Beast. I begin
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61498:65"/>
with his Head, which is ever in Clouts, as if the Night-cap should make <hi>Affidavit,</hi> that the Brain was pregnant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To what purpose doth the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> lie in so dully in her white Formalities: sure she hath had hard Labour; for the Brows have squeezed for it, as you may perceive by his Butter'd Bon grace, that Film of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micastor; 'tis so thin and unctuous that the Sun-beams mistake it for a Vapour, and are like to Cap him; so it is right Heliotrope, it creaks in the Shine and flaps in the Shade: whatever it be, I wish it were able to call in his ears. There's no proportion between that Head and Appurtenances; those of all Lungs are no more fit for that small Noddle of the Circumcision, than Brass Bosses for a <hi>Geneva</hi>-Bible. In what a puzzling Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality is the poor Soul that moves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two such ponderous Biasses? His Collar is edg'd with a piece of peeping Linnnen, by which he means a Band; 'tis the Forlorn of his Shirt crawling out of his Neck: indeed it were time that his Shirt were jogging; for it has serv'd an Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiship and (as Apprentices use) it hath learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its Trade too, to which effect 'tis marching to the Paper-mill, and the next week sets up for it self in the shape of a Pamphlet. His Gloves are the shavings of

               <p>But I must draw to an end; for every Character is an Anatomy-lecture, and it fares with me in this of the Diurnal-maker, as with him that reads on a begg'd Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, my Subject smells before I have gone thorow with him; for a parting Blow then. The word Historian imports a sage and solemn Author; one that curles his Brow with a sullen Gravity, like a Bull-neck'd Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, since the Army hath got him off his Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, who Presbyter like sweeps his Breast with a Reverend Beard, full of Native Moss-Troopers: not such a squirting Scribe as this, that's troubled with the Rickets, and makes penny-worths of History. The Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege-Treasury that never had in Bank a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a <hi>Harry</hi>-groat, shut up there in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick solitude, like one that is kept to keep possession, had as good Evidence to shew for his Title, as he for an Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:

so, if he will needs be an Historian, he is not Cited in the Sterling acceptation, but after the Rate of Blew-caps Reckoning, an Historian Scot.

               <head>The Character of a <hi>London</hi>-Diurnal.</head>
               <p>A Diurnal is a puny Chronicle, scarce Pin-feather'd with the wings of Time. It is a History in Sippets: The English Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads in a Nutshel: The Apocryphal Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's Book of <hi>Maccabees</hi> in single sheets. It would tire a Welshman to reckon up how many <hi>Aps</hi> 'tis removed from an Annal: for it is of that Extract, only of the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er House, like a Shrimp to a Lobster. The Original Sinner in this kind was Dutch, <hi>Gallobelgicus</hi> the Protoplast, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Mercuries</hi> but <hi>Hans-en-kelders.</hi> The Countess of <hi>Zealand</hi> was brought to bed of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61498:66"/>
an Almanack, as many Children as days in the year. It may be the Legislative Lady is of that Linage, so she spawns the Diurnals, and they at <hi>Westminster</hi> take them in Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption by the names of <hi>Scoticus, Civicus, Britannicus.</hi> In the Frontispiece of the old Beldam Diurnal, like the Contents of the Chapter, sitteth the House of Commons judging the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel.</hi> You may call them the Kingdoms Anatomy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the weekly Kalendar; for such is a Diurnal, the day of the Month with what Weather in the Commonwealth. It is taken for the Pulse of the Body Politick, and the Emperick-Divines of the Assembly, those Spiritual Dragooners, thumb it according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Indeed it is a pretty <hi>Synopsis</hi>; and those Grave <hi>Rabbies</hi> (though in the point of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity) trade in no larger Authors. The Country-carrier, when he buyes it for the Vicar, miscals it the Urinal; yet properly enough, for it casts the Water of the State ever since it staled Blood. It differs from an <hi>Aulicus,</hi> as the Devil and his Exorcist, or as a black Witch doth from a white one, whose office is to unravel her Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>It begins usually with an Ordinance, which is a Law still-born, dropt before quickned by the Royal Assent. 'Tis one of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61498:67"/>
the Parliament's By-blows, Acts only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Legitimate, and hath no more Sire than a Spanish Gennet that is begotten by the Wind.</p>
               <p>Thus their <hi>Militia,</hi> like its Patron <hi>Mars,</hi> is the Issue only of the Mother, without the Concourse of Royal <hi>Iupiter</hi>: Yet Law it is, if they Vote it, in defiance to their Fundamentals; like the old Sexton, who swore his Clock went true, whatever the Sun said to the contrary.</p>
               <p>The next Ingredient of a Diurnal is Plots, horrible Plots, which with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sagacity it hunts dry-foot, while they are yet in their Causes, before <hi>Materia pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> can put on her Smock. How many such fits of the Mother have troubled the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and for all Sir <hi>W. E.</hi> looks like a Man-Midwife, not yet delivered of so much as a Cushion? But Actors must have Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Suitable to their Plots are their Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, Skippers and Taylors, Spaniels both for the Land and Water. Good conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Intelligence! For however <hi>Pym</hi>'s Bill may inflame the reckoning, the honest Vermine have not so much for Lying as the Publick Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:61498:67"/>Thus a zealous Botcher in <hi>Moorfields,</hi> while he he was contriving some Quirpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut of Church-Government, by the help of his outlying Ears and the <hi>Otacousticon</hi> of the Spirit, discovered such a Plot, that <hi>Selden</hi> intends to combat Antiquity, and maintain it was a Taylor's Goose that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd the Capitol.</p>
               <p>I wonder my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> is not once more all-to-be-traytor'd, for deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Lions to settle the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Array in the Tower. It would do well to cramp the Articles dormant, besides the opportunity of reforming these Beasts of the Prerogative, and changing their profaner names of <hi>Harry</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> into <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Eleazar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppose a Corn-cutter being to give little <hi>Isaac</hi> a cast of his Office should fall to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Brows (mistaking the one end for the other, because he branches at both) this would be a Plot, and the next Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal would furnish you with this Scale of Votes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resolv'd upon the Question, That this Act of the Corn-cutter was an absolute Invasion of the Cities Charter in the representative forehead of</hi> Isaac.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resolv'd, That the evil Counsellours about the Corn-cutter are Popishly affected and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Resolv'd, That there be a publick Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving for the great deliverance of</hi> Isaac's <hi>Brow-antlers; and a solemn Covenant drawn up to defie the Corn cutter and all his Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Quixots</hi> of this Age fight with the Windmils of their own heads, quell Monsters of their own Creation, make Plots, and then discover them; as who fitter to unkennel the Fox than the Tarrier that is part of him?</p>
               <p>In the third place march their Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; the Roundheads Legend, the Rebels Romance; Stories of a larger size, than the Ears of their Sect, able to strangle the Belief of a Solifidian.</p>
               <p>I'll present them in their order. And first as a Whifler before the show enter <hi>Stamford,</hi> one that trod the Stage with the first, travers'd his ground, made a Leg and <hi>Exit.</hi> The Country people took him for one that by Order of the Houses was to dance a Morrice through the West of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Well, he's a nimble Gentleman; set him upon <hi>Banks</hi> his Horse in a Saddle rampant, and it is a great question which part of the Centau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There was a Vote passing to translate him with all his Equipage into Monumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Gingerbread; but it was crossed by the female Committee, alledging that the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61498:68"/>
of his Image would bite their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by the Tongues.</p>
               <p>This Cubit and half of Commander, by the help of a Diurnal routed his Enemies fifty miles off. It's strange you'll say, and yet 'tis generally believ'd he would as soon do it at that distance as nearer hand. Sure it was his Sword for which the Weapon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salve was invented; that so wounding and healing (like loving Correlates) might both work at the same removes. But the Squib is run to the end of the Rope: Room for the Prodigy of Valour. Madam <hi>Atropos</hi> in Breeches, <hi>Waller</hi>'s Knight-errantry; and because every Mountebank must have his <hi>Zany,</hi> throw him in <hi>Hazlerig</hi> to set off his Story. These two, like <hi>Bel</hi> and the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> are always worshipped in the same Chapter; they hunt in couples, what one doth at the head, the other scores up at the heels.</p>
               <p>Thus they kill a man over and over, as <hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Sternhold</hi> murder the Psalms with another of the same; one chimes all in, and then the other strikes up as the Saints-Bell.</p>
               <p>I wonder for how many Lives my Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> took the Lease of his Body.</p>
               <p>First <hi>Stamford</hi> slew him, then <hi>Waller</hi> outkill'd that half a Barr; and yet it is
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61498:69"/>
thought the sullen Corps would scarce bleed were both these Manslayers never so near it.</p>
               <p>The same goes of a Dutch Headsman, that he would do his office with so much ease &amp; dexterity, that the Head after Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should stand upon the Shoulders. Pray God Sir <hi>William</hi> be not Probationer for the place; for as if he had the like knack too, most of those whom the Diurnal hath slain for him, to us poor Mortals seem untoucht.</p>
               <p>Thus these Artificers of death can kill the Man without wounding the Body, like Lightning, that melts the Sword and never singes the Scaberd.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>William</hi> whose Lady is the Conquerour; This is the City's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion and the Diurnals delight; he that Cuckolds the General in his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; for he stalks with <hi>Essex,</hi> and shoots under his belly, because his Excellency himself is not charged there; yet in all this triumph there is a Whip and a Bell; trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late but the Scene to <hi>Roundway Down,</hi> there <hi>Hazelrig</hi>'s Lobsters turned Crabs and craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led backwards; there poor Sir <hi>William</hi> ran to his Lady for an use of Consolation. But the Diurnal is weary of the arm of flesh, and now begins an <hi>Hosanna</hi> to <hi>Cromwel</hi>; one that hath beat up his Drums clean through
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61498:69"/>
the Old Testament; you may learn the Genealogy of our Saviour by the names in his Regiment: the Muster-master uses no other List but the first Chapter of <hi>Matthew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With what face can they object to the King the bringing in of Foreigners, when themselves entertain such an Army of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews?</hi> This <hi>Cromwel</hi> is never so valorous as when he is making Speeches for the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation; which nevertheless he doth somewhat ominously with his Neck awry, holding up his ear as if he expected <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>'s Pigeon to come and prompt him. He should be a Bird of Prey too by his bloody Beak: His Nose is able to try a young Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, whether she be lawfully begotten.

What we wonder at in the rest of them is natural to him, to kill without Bloodshed; for the most of his Trophies are in a Church win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, when a Looking glass would shew him more Superstition. He is so perfect a hater of Images, that he hath defaced God's in his own Countenance. If he deals with men, 'tis when he takes them napping in an old Monument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then down goes Dust and A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61498:70"/>
chews the cud. He said Grace once as if he would have fallen aboard with the Marquess of <hi>Newcastle</hi>; nay and the Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal gave you his Bill of fare; but it proved a running banquet, as appears by the Story. Believe him as he whistles to his <hi>Cambridge</hi>-Teem of Committee-men, and he doth wonders. But holy Men, like the holy Language, must be read backwards. They rifle Colleges to promote Learning, and pull down Churches for Edification. But Sacrilege is entail'd upon him. There must be a <hi>Cromwel</hi> for Cathedrals as well as Abbeys; a secure sin, whose offence carries its pardon in its mouth: for how shall he be hang'd for Church-robbery, that gives himself the benefit of the Clergy?</p>
               <p>But for all <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Nose wears the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minical Letter, compar'd to <hi>Manchester,</hi> he is but like the Vigils to an Holy day. This, this is the Man of God, so sanctified a Thunderbolt, that <hi>Burroughs</hi> (in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable Blasphemy to his Lord of Hosts) would style him the Archangel giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing battel to the Devil.</p>
               <p>Indeed as the Angels each of them makes a several Species; so every one of his Soldiers makes a distinct Church. Had these Beasts been to enter into the Ark, it would have puzzled <hi>Noah</hi> to have sorted

them into pairs. If ever there were a Rope of Sand, it was so many Sects twisted into an Association.</p>
               <p>They agree in nothing but that they are all Adamites in understanding. It is a sign of a Coward to wink and sight, yet all their Valour proceeds from their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>But I wonder whence their General's purity proceeds; it is not by Traduction: if he was begotten a Saint it was by equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal Generation; for the Devil in the Father is turn'd Monk in the Son, so his Godliness is of the same Parentage with good Laws, both extracted out of bad manners; and would he alter the Scripture, as he hath attempted the Creed, he might vary the Text, and say to Corruption, <hi>Thou art my Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is he that put out one of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's Eyes by clouding our Mother Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity; and (if this Scotch Mist farther prevail) he will extinguish the other. He hath the like quarrel to both because both are strung with the same Optick Nerve, Knowing Loyalty.</p>
               <p>Barbarous Rebel! who will be reveng'd upon all Learning, because his Treason is beyond the Mercy of the Book.</p>
               <p>The Diurnal as yet hath not talk'd much

Had it been done among the Cavaliers, it had been just; then the Israelite had spoiled the Egyptian; but for <hi>Simeon</hi> to plunder <hi>Levi,</hi> That! That! You see, Sir, what Use I make of the Doctrine you sent me; and indeed since you change Style so far as to nibble at Wit, you must pardon me, if to quit scores, I pretend a little to the Gift of Preaching. Sir, I expected to hear from you in the Language of the lost Groat, and the Prodigal Son, and not in such a Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivy of Language; but I perceive your Communication is not always Yea, Yea; now and then a little Harlotry-Rhetorick. You say that your Man is entred our Ark: I am sorry you were so ignorant in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as to let him come single. The Text had been better satisfied, if you had pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bear him company; for then the Beasts had entred by Couples: But though he came alone, yet well lined it seems, with 133 <hi>l.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> Sure your Hue and Cry hath good Lungs, it would have been out of breath else, before it had reached the Eight pence. This is the Summ; but why you

call it the Precise Summ, since it is thus fallen away, I understand not. But how come you to reckon so punctually? Did <hi>Ananias</hi> tell it upon the Table Dormant? What year of the Persecution of the Saints? I wonder you did not rather count it by the Shekels, that is the more sanctified Coyn. You mistake in the Sanctuary you speak of; for that which your Man hath taken is <hi>Welbeck,</hi> one of our Chappels of Ease, not the Mother-Church, our Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Newark</hi>; but the best is they are both without the reach of your Sacrilege.

I suspect your hand was troubled with the Palsie, when you wrote of a Judge; your Man however shall find me an Advocate; for what say you to an occasional Meditation? Reflect but upon your self, how you have used your Common Master, and I doubt not but you will pardon your Man.

it is the provission of so many savoury Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, wholsome Instructions, even so many pious Collections, as might worthily have entitled you to the comfortable Subsistence of a well-gleb'd Vicarage.

Pamphleter, one of these Haberdashers of small Wares, without his <hi>Videlicets</hi> or his <hi>Vtpotes.</hi> An ingenious Metaphor needs no spokes-man to the Apprehension, but is entertain'd without a pimping <hi>Videlicet.</hi> A <hi>Videlicet</hi> is an <hi>Hic Canis</hi>; it argues a Bungling Writer, as that a Painter. But wherein Incoherent? Because it shows wherein the same Man may both condemn and acquit the same Man. Why, is that such a Riddle? May not I commend you for a Single-soul'd Rythmer, one that can Chime All-in to an Execution, and yet use the Scotch Proverb, and turn your Nose where your Arse was in point of State-policy. Though you have a pretty Faculty in Country-<hi>Tom</hi> and <hi>Cambery-Bess,</hi> yet faces about in State-affairs. A diverse <hi>Quatenus</hi> commends and vilifies, condemns and acquits. But a Pox of all English Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick.

Why, Captain Puff will blow it away. My Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary, I perceive, has eaten Garlick, and wholly relies upon the Valour of his Breath; and indeed I question not the strength of that, I find it sufficiently in the Rankness of his Language.

But, see the Prowess of our <hi>Domitian</hi>; hee'l kill this Fly him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and not with an Axe, or a Bill of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder. He scorns to cry Clubs; hee'l not oppugn it with the Votes of the Houses, with the Judges Opinions; nor are we so mad to enter the Lists of such a Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. But this is but one of his ordinary Solecisms. The Speech must be consider'd as when first made; then the Houses had not Voted; then the Judges had not determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and (what's as Material as any thing) the Rabble had not yell'd for Justice and Execution then; and therefore to commit them with this Speech, what were it but to phancy a <hi>Prolepsis?</hi> to antedate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants that were not yet in being? so that if any thing add to the strength of the Speech, beside its own Nerves, it is the weakness of the Confuter, not of the Reader.

Therefore the Earl of</hi> Strafford <hi>is not guilty of High Treason</hi> Now he breaks the neck of this <hi>Ergo</hi> thus: <hi>If three or four other Treasons be objected and prov'd, though they be at a loss in one, this doth not straight e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince his Innocence.</hi> To this Belief he will draw you (as he says) by a Comparison.

and I am afraid I shall be laughed at, if I speak any thing in defence of the King: yet (thanks be to God) there's no great need on't. His Majesty's Vertues are his strongest Guard. A King, like a Porcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, is a living Quiver of Darts; every Beam of Majesty is a <hi>Fulmen Terebrans</hi> to his Blaspheming Enemies. My Fellow-traveller stept aside a little to give his Brain a Stool, and now is return'd into the Road, <hi>His Lordship,</hi> he says, <hi>multiplies and is fruitful in Absurdities.</hi> 'Tis true by an equivocal Generation; for so he begat your Pamphlet, meeting with the putrid Matter of your Invention, as the Sun pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth Insect Animals. The Absurdity is, <hi>he hath no Notion of Subverting the Law Treasonable, but by Force</hi>; and here we must score up the second Quibble, for then (he says) <hi>This Argument will never subvert the Law, as having no Force.</hi> Truly I am of a mind, that if my Antagonist were both to Dispute and Answer himself, he would have the best on't, and that's the Course he takes here. He frames an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument where none is intended. His Lordship says he knows no other, nay and there is no other; but he doth not infer the latter from the former, therefore there is no other, because he knows no other;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61498:80"/>
so that this is a Brat of your own Brain, not drawn from his Lordship's Ignorance (as your scandalous quill foam'd at the mouth) but from your own Impudence; and if it halt (as you say) it confesses its Father, it halts before a Creeple. You do well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to let Nature work to help your lame Dog over a Stile, to cast it, as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, in a right Frame. <hi>There is no way of Subverting the Law but what I know; but I know no way of Subverting the Law but by force.</hi> You would be loath a man should say this is no Syllogism; and yet 'tis true. There's no Figure will give it a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement to hide its head in. I could give you a Remove now and set you upright; but I had rather you should take it asunder, and my Lord and you part Stakes; part Propositions; He the <hi>Major,</hi> you the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> because in the first you say there is so much Knowledge, in the latter so much Ignorance.

But he makes a Transition from Common Law to Common Reason, and he hopes to be scored up for that Quarter-Quibble, but I cannot afford it. <hi>If nothing but Force can subvert Law, then Iudges when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce false Iudgments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> stop lawful Defences, let loose the Prerogative,</hi> and all that Rout of Instances which he hath rallied up, <hi>do not subvert the Law.</hi> Well, to do you a Courtesie, they do not.

The Law in this Case suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers a <hi>Deliquium,</hi> but she is not dead. The Subversion of Laws is Root and Branch. A Castle may be dismantled, made unser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, and yet 'tis not said then to be quite overthrown. When you usurp'd the Chair of Logick and made a false Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism, were the Laws of Logick then sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted? No, but Trangress'd; so that if our Author suffer by Injustice (as I hope you are more Historian than Prophet) he
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61498:81"/>
will not involve the Laws in his Ruine. Your <hi>Apostrophe</hi> to <hi>Tressilian</hi> is a true <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strophe,</hi> for 'tis from the Cause; for will ye introduce a Parity in Offences too? Scan the Cases and you shall find them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse. But give me lieve by the way to admire your Phrase of the <hi>Iron Laws.</hi> 'Tis a good Argument to me that there is no Alchymy, otherwise the Corruption of so many Judges, by this time had turn'd them into Gold: but my Lord must Dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Do you carry the Knapsack of his Arguments? My Lord hath a fine time on't, that you should feed him thus with a Spoon? 'Tis thus; <hi>The Earl of</hi> Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford<hi>'s Practices have been as high as any. The Practices of</hi> Tressilian <hi>have been as high as High Treason.</hi> I wonder where you got all this Logick; at <hi>Furnival</hi>'s Inn? But I know the Reason of it, because <hi>Plutarch</hi> attributes Logick to a Fox, and King <hi>Iames</hi> maintains Discourse in a Hound, that's it which puts you upon Sillogisms. You would be loath to come short of any of your Fellows. For the words of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> (which are only my Lord's, and which indeed I had as lieve he should justifie as I) you must know they are a Comparison: now Comparisons are betwixt things of the same kind: <hi>As high as any,</hi> that is, in the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61498:82"/>
rank of Misdemeanours. The Painter, when his Picture would not sell for a God, made a special Devil of it, and so he vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Though my Lord cannot yield that the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Practices should be sublimated into Treason; yet place them in the front of any lower Offences, and it seems he will pass it. This Similitude of mine doth not run of all four, no more must you think of that, <hi>As high as any.</hi> But to make few words; suppose I should grant you your Conclusion, that the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Practices were as high as Treason, yet if they be not specified by Statute for Treason, my Lord doth justly abstain his hand from his Dispatch. You ask how these words should sound in the mouth of a Judge. Truly I have not the measure of your Ears, they are of too large a size for me. I being a Judge hold your Guilt to be as high as Treason, yet having no Law to give me Commission, I'll have no hand in your Sentence: So that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing all Cases to be like this, I grant you the Assizes would be in vain; the Judges Circuit would be like the wheeling of a Mill, move continually, but never nearer their Journey's end: but when the Law hath provided sufficiently, unless in a Case as this, Extraordinary, the Vanity and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61498:82"/>
Mockery which you speak of recoils upon him that first discharged them. For your last, where you would have Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>'s Oath to be prefer'd before my Lord's Suspicion, I would willingly answer as he did with Meditation; at the first time no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as much at the second, and at the third <hi>Vous avez</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Vane.</hi> You say his Oath gets an addition of Belief from the Speeches before and from the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials that day; so that you imply what I dare not say, that it is not full of it self, but wants a Supplement of Credit to gain our Faith. As for the words Recorded whencesoever they had their Venom, it seems they were poyson'd; (for to that, and not to their Pregnancy do I attribute it) that they swell'd into such a bigness, that one Testimony appear'd double: But that you should entitle Mr. <hi>Pim</hi> to this Mistake, that he should look through a Multiplying Glass in a Case so weighty as that of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; the Gentleman's known Integrity saves me the labour of his Defence. So that the Testimonies being but such, though the Charges be many; be the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> as high in his Practices as it pleases my Lord to make him, yet my Lord's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pthong may easily be justified, and the Earl both at once Condemn'd and Sav'd.

my self in private Recess, and my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment to the Publick so inoffensive, that in all this time, neither Fears nor Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies have scrupled at my Actions. Being about three Months since at <hi>Norwich.</hi> I was fetch'd by a Guard before the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and sent Prisoner to <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and if it be not a new offence to make an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry wherein I offended (for hitherto my Fault was kept as close as my Person) I am in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duced to believe that next to my adherence to the Royal Party, the Cause of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement is the Narrowness of my Estate; for none stand Committed whose Estate can bail them. I only am the Prisoner who have no Acres to be my Hostage. Now if my Poverty be Criminal (with Reverence be it spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) I implead your Highness, whose Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Arms have reduced me to it, as Accessary to my Guilt. Let it suffice, my Lord, that the Calamity of the War hath made us poor, do not punish us for it. Who ever did Penance for being Ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Is it not enough that we are stripp'd so bare, but it must be made in order to a severer Lash? Must our Sores be engraven with our Wounds?

pays use upon use. I beseech your Highness put some Bounds to the Overthrow, and do not pursue the chase to the other World. Can your Thunder be levell'd so low, as our Groveling Condition? Can your Towr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit, which hath quarried upon King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, make a stoop at us, who are the Rubbish of these Ruines.

Your Strain is so happy and hath the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for so Matchless, as if you had a double Key to the Temple of Honour to let in your Lordship's self and exclude Competitors. It's you, my Lord, have cut the Clouds and reach'd Perfection, who having mounted the Cliff, lends an hand to me, who am labouring in the Craggy Ascent. So towring are the Praises you please to bestow on me, and my Desert so groveling, that to shew you my Head is not worthy your Height, it is not able to bear them; it grows giddy with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice.

It is an excellent Breathing for a puissant Wit to overbear the World in the Defence of a Paradox; and a good Advocate will weather out the Cause, when there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Truth nor Invention. I perswade my self you had never undertaken to write my

Panegyrick, but that you saw it was to combat with the Tide, and to put your Abilities to the utmost Test in so unlikely a Subject. Little do you think what store of Opposers your Opinion will breed you; for though you be so powerful in the Art of perswasion, that should you turn Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, there would need no more but to Towl the Bell for Religion, yet this is an Heresie where you stand alone, and like <hi>Scaeva</hi> in the Breach, with your single Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour duel an Army. Now, my Lord, if I be not mistaken, I have found the Motive that induced you to oblige me; you are tyed by your Order to give Protection to the Weak and Succourless; so I must change my Addresses, and thank your Red Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band for my Commendations.

The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions you visit you carry along with you, and by a Victorious Industry make them pay Tribute to your Understanding. Not like a number of our Roaring Gallants, who return so empty and without their Errand, as if their Travel (like Witches in the Air) were nothing but the Waftage of a deluded Phantasie, perswading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that they Circle the Globe, when
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61498:90"/>
the Card they sail by is nothing else but a slumbring Imposture. But methinks we are too Grave, Sir. What if we unbend a while, and presume to tell you, that in all your Errantry there is no Adventure so much affects me, as that of the Nun, where I cannot determine, whether your Love it self were more Exotick, or the form of accosting it: For although it be natural for Jealousie to study Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,. and every Cuckold within his own Precincts to be an Engineer; yet never before have I heard of a Mistress fenc'd with a Portcullice, or an amorous Visit manag'd with the Caution which suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Kings use in an Enterview.

Had your old Romancing Spirit possess'd you, the Brandish'd Blade would have freed the Lady from her Enchanted Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.

St. <hi>Laurence</hi>) broil'd on a Gridiron? But see how Customs vary with the Clime. As there are some Regions who salute one another by putting off their Shooes instead of their Hats; so it seems, where you have been, there is as different a form of Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment or Commitment. The Prisoner is at large and without the Grates, wishing for Admittance, and she at whose Suit his Soul is arrested, close clap'd up and abridg'd of Liberty. Sure at this Grate those Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Lovers, call'd Platonicks, had their first Training. Those Queasie Gamesters that diet themselves with the very Notion of Mingling Souls, without putting the Body to farther Brokage than kissing of Hands and twisting of Eye-beams. For your part, Sir, you are none of those puling Stomachs: You have an Appetite for a whole Cloister. It is but Trifling sport for you to pull down an Out-lyer, unless you leap the Pale and let slip at the Herd. I wonder what Exorcisms the Abbess us'd to get quit of the <hi>Incubus</hi>; for had she not check'd your Hovering Temptations, I am confident by this time you had trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the Covent, and turn'd the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery into a <hi>Seraglio.</hi> But in sober Sadness, why a Nun, Sir? How came you out of the Active Torrent into that Solitary

Creek? Princes seldom Treat of Matches, but in foraign Dominions. Your Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on takes greater State, as fixing upon one of another World. Had your Passion been Centred on the Beauty of her Soul, I had look'd upon it as the Act of your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Such a Love might justly have been Christned by the name of Zeal, being settled on a Person, with whom to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amour'd is in a sort to take Orders. Hence it is there want not some who suspect your Religion, left equivocating from the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her Person to that of her Profession, you should turn Monastick. Others, who are better acquainted with the warmth of your Temper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are rather solicitous for the Church in General, lest with <hi>Luther</hi> you should marry a Nun, and so with him make her a Joynture in a new Religion. If this be your Plot, Consider, I pray you, how difficult it is to Innovate farther in this Age of Novelties, when the World is so spent in new Inventions, that for want of Gain, even Rust and Rottenness are flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished over with a seeming Verdure. Not one of all those Beldam-Heresies that did Penance formerly by the Doom of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, but hath cast her Skin since these Confusions, and giveth her self out for a Blooming Virgin. But I think I may spare
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61498:91"/>
this piece of Counsel, I dare be your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgator for meddling with Religion. That which fir'd your Spirits was the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the Enterprize; nor could you entertain a more Aspiring Phrensie, but by making Love to a Glorified Body. Tell me, I pray you, how many Beads did you drop in Wooing? By what Liturgy did you frame your Courtship? Laick Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are here scandalous; nor will it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to say, you languish without her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion. A Sensual Man is able to vitiate the Vestal Flame, even by his Martyrdom; other Lovers in the Jollity of their Trope are wont to Canonize their Mistresses, as being of opinion that the Native Rubrick of their Cheeks hath hallowed them. Will you run Counter to that Consecration and degrade a Saint by Mortal Addresses? If you have no room in your Calendar for Persons upon Earth, yet do not profane a Probationer of Heaven; as if the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est way to rectifie Superstition, were, with our Modern Reformers, to bow it into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism. Let me advise you, Sir, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve your self back from this Carnal Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege. Catch not at <hi>Herostratus</hi> his Fame by setting fire on the Temple, and dispute not a share of Guilt with <hi>Lucifer,</hi> in caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a second Fall of Angels. Nay, never
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61498:92"/>
Start, Sir, nor look about at the Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for I perswade my self, that those Divines who allot to each of us a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telar Angel for our Protection, would not prejudice their Opinion, should they leave her to her own Tuition, as hardly knowing in such a Person how to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between the Charge and the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian. Sir, I was entreated by our Noble Friend, that what my Phancy suggested upon this Subject, I would mould into Number; but I must beg your pardon, it being a Request with which to comply were to be your Fellow-criminal, and by a Conformity of Guilt pervert a Votary: for even my Muse is Vow'd and Vail'd too, she is set apart for the Service of my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, and what is that but entring Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the true Religion. The Truth is this; she is so chastely confin'd to that sole Employment; that should I in Verse at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to yield you an account how much I honour you, not a whole Grove of Laurel would bribe her to a Distich: whereas in Transitory Prose, were I a Master of all those Languages, which I make no question but you have gain'd by your Travels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I should hold them all too few to give you sufficient Assurance that I am, <hi>SIR,</hi>

               <head>Who was delivered for our Offences, and rose again for our Iustification.</head>
               <p>THE Athenians had two sorts of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mysteries, two distinct times, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> and <hi>August,</hi> for their Celebration: but when King <hi>Demetrius</hi> desir'd to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into their Fraternity, and see both their Solemnities at once, the People past a Decree, that the Month <hi>March,</hi> when the King requested it, should be call'd <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> and after the Ceremonies due to that Month were finished, it should be translated to <hi>August,</hi> and so at the second return of this new Leap year they accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished his Request. Two greater Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are the parts of my Text, the Passion and the Resurrection; several times appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate for either <hi>Good Friday</hi> or <hi>Easter.</hi> But as the Athenian Decree made <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> and <hi>August</hi> meet in <hi>March,</hi> so give me lieve by a less <hi>Syncope</hi> of Time to contract <hi>Good Friday</hi> and <hi>Easter</hi> both to a day, as the Passion and Resurrection are both in my Text; <hi>Who was delivered for our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:61498:93"/>
&amp;c. And I may the rather link them both on a day, because the Text is willing to admit some Resemblance. The Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the Morning make the day, saith the Holy Spirit; the Method of my Text observes as much: here is the Evening, the Passion, when our Saviour strip'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of those Rags of Mortality, and lay down in the Bed of Corruption, where he stays not long; but the Morning breaks in the Resurrection, <hi>when this Corruptible shall put on Incorruption, and this Mortal shall put on Immortality.</hi> So then my Text is a Day from Sun to Sun, <hi>Soles occidere &amp; redire possunt,</hi> from the Sun-set of his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Sun-rise of his Resurrection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Dew of his Birth is as the Dew of the Morning.</hi> There is a Morning-Dew and there is an Evening-Dew; the Evening-Dew, the Tears that are shed at the Sun's Funeral, and they may justly decypher the Passion; the Morning-Dew, the Tears of Joy and Welcom at his new Return; and what is that but a Transcript of the Resurrection?</p>
               <p>My Discourse then must be changeable, compos'd of a Cloud and a Rain-bow.</p>

Nothing but Joy and Triumph, Pomp and Pageants at the Resurrection. But methinks St. <hi>Paul</hi> puts new Cloth into an old Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, mends the Rent of the Passion with the Resurrection. <hi>Can the children of the Bride-chamber weep while the Bridegroom is with them?</hi> While the Resurrection is in the Text, who can Tune his Soul to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his Passion; again, by the Waters of <hi>Babylon</hi> is no singing the Songs of <hi>Sion.</hi> When Grief hath lock'd up the Heart with the story of the Passion, what Key of Mirth can let in the Anthem of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection?

               <p>I begin with the Evening, and so I may well style the Passion, since the Horrour thereof turn'd Noon into Night, and made a Miracle maintain my Metaphor. The
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61498:94"/>
Sun was obscur'd by Sympathy, and his Darkness points us to a greater Eclipse. The Sun and the Moon, what are they but Parables of our Saviour and the Soul of Man? The Moon is the Soul; I am sure her Spots will not Confute the Similitude. I might here slacken the Reigns of my Comparison, and shew you how the Moon of her self is a dark Body, and what Light she partakes, she receives it from the Sun at second hand. How every Soul is by Nature sinful and in the Shadow of Death, till <hi>the Light that lightens the Gentiles, till the day-spring on high visit us.</hi> I might pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue my Allegory in the Eclipse. The Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the Earth intercepts the Beams of the Sun, and so the Moon suffers an Eclipse. Pleasure and Profit, those two Dugs of the World what are they but Earthly sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows that Eclipse the Soul, and deprive it of the sweet influence of the Sun of Righteousness. But I hold me to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor, my Text will warrant the Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel. As the Moon is Eclipsed by the Earth, so she her self Eclipses the Sun. The Soul is not only sinful, but makes God suffer; <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61498:94"/>
the Wounds that thy Sins have made. <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus est Deliquium propter Delicta nostra. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquium</hi> and <hi>Delictum</hi> proceed both from a Root. He had never been delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death, but for the Gaol-delivery of our Offences. See the Difference betwixt God's and Man's Eclipse. Man's sets God and him at odds; God's reconciles them. The Moon when she is Eclipsed is always in Opposition with the Sun. The Soul will sin, though she be at Enmity with God for't: but the Sun when he is Eclipsed is always in Conjunction with the Moon. God will be Friends with Man, though he purchase the Union with his Passion, and seal the Covenant with his own Blood. But that all things which concern the Passion may be miraculous, wee'l proceed in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and restrain that to Order and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, which put Nature out of Frame, and threatned the World with Confusion. Consider then my Text, like the Veil of the Temple rent in twain, <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>And well may my Text be divided by the Temple, since our Saviour shadowed both parts of it under that Nation. <hi>I will

The Death of the Cross, all the Languages upon it cannot express it: but we see the Sun better by looking into the Waters, than by affronting his Beams. The only way to comprehend the Sufferings of our Creator, is by feeling the Pulse of the Creature. What shall I say to the Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Rocks? The Lapidary tells you how the Compassionate Turcoise confesseth the Sickness of his Wearer by changing colour. The whole Rocks suffered with our Saviour, they were cleft; and shall not this rend our stony hearts? O that <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s Men were not now a Fable! <hi>Caucasus</hi> is supple in comparison of our Breasts. Marble can weep, whilest we are Pumices. <hi>Moses</hi> his Rod will sooner fetch a River out of a Rock, than a Tear from a Rebellious Sinner. The Earthquake is the next Miracle. <hi>Tremble thou Earth at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Iacob.</hi> She tottered under the Burden of so great a Sin. She had lost the Author of her being, and so might well be struck with a dead Palsie. 'Tis a good Observation of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that among all

the absurd Opinions of the old Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; who held the Soul to be Fire; some Air, some Water; none ever had so gross a Soul as to conceive it to be Earth. O that in this case we were Earthy-minded! That we were affected with this Religious Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie! Then should we see that <hi>Motus Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidationis,</hi> the Motion of the Heavens as well as the Earth. We must <hi>work out our salvation with fear and trembling.</hi> But the Earth hath quaked so long till it hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened the Dead: nor is it a wonder that the Dead live, when Life it self can die. Heaven descends into the Bowels of the Earth, and, to make up the Anagramm, the Graves open and the Dust ariseth. Thus were all things shuffled, and Nature rung the Bells backwards, as if every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture desir'd to bear the Burden of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Elegy. <hi>Attendite &amp; videte — Behold and see if ever, there was sorrow like unto my sorrow. Cyrus</hi> to be revenged of a River cut it into so many Channels, that it lost its Name. This is the way to allay a Grief, to divide it into so many streams, to pour it into other Bosoms; but even this is denied to our Saviour. The Sons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> do not now petition to drink his Cup: They would not now be one on his right hand, another on his left; no, he is
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61498:96"/>
crucified betwixt two Thieves. The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Companions augments his Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. He was born among Beasts, and doth he not die so too? Man without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is like unto a Beast that perisheth. Betwixt two Thieves. You see Vice to Vertue is two to one: Vertue is in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, Vice in the Circumference; vast is the Circuit; <hi>Vniversus orbis, the whole World lies in Wickedness,</hi> whilst Vertue like the Centre is but an Imaginary point.

To what end then do you demand that of of the Steward whereof the Lord and Master makes a voluntary tender? In vain do you court the Inferiour Streams, when the Spring-head prevents your expectation. It is our Duty to trace his Commands, not to outstrip them.
