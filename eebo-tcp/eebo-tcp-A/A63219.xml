         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and
you Gentlemen of this Jury, the Priſoners who ſtand now
at the Bar, are indicted for murther. Murder, as it is
the firſt, ſo is it the greateſt Crime, that is prohibited in
the Second Table. It is a Crime of ſo deep a ſtain, that
nothing can waſh it away but the Blood of the Offender,
and unleſs that be done, the Land in which it is ſhed, will
continue polluted. My Lord, as murder is always a very great
crime, ſo the murder, which is now to be tryed before your
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41250:6"/>
Lordſhip, is, it may be, the moſt hainous and moſt barbarous
that ever was committed. The murder was committed upon
a Gentleman, and upon a Magiſtrate, and I wiſh he had not
therefore been murdered, becauſe he was a Proteſtant Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I will not ſpend much of your time in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my obſervations before hand, becauſe I muſt in this
Caſe crave leave to do it in the concluſion of the Evidence. For
I, that have made a ſtrict examination into this matter,

               <p>My Lord, upon the diſcovery of the late horrid Plot.—</p>

               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr,</hi> Attorney General.</speaker>
               <p>If your Lordſhip pleaſe, you may
call it ſo, for tis to be feared they have not yet given it over:
But upon the diſcovery of that Plot (call it late or preſent)
Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> (whom, I ſuppoſe, the Jury all
knew, and every man, that lived there abouts, muſt needs
remember to have been a very uſeful and active Juſtice of
the Peace) had taken ſeveral examinations about this matter,
and perhaps ſome more than now are extant: (but we have
proof he had ſome) and was very induſtrious in finding out
the principal Actors in this Plot, among whom, ſome Prieſts
and Jeſuits foreſeeing their own danger, and likewiſe the
overthrow of a deſign which they had been ſo long in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving,
they had ſeveral Conſultations how to prevent the
diſcovery. And as they are men, who never ſtick at
blood but rather account it meritorious to ſhed it, though
never ſo unjuſtly when their Intereſt may be profited by it,
they did reſolve to ſecure themſelves and their deſign by take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away the life of this Gentleman. In order thereunto they
had ſeveral meetings, and the place of their meeting, you will
find by the Evidence, to be at the Plow Ale-houſe, and there
they did conſult how to take away the life of Sir <hi>Edmondbury
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41250:7"/>
Godfrey,</hi> And they made ſeveral attempts to do it: one while
they dogg'd him into the fields, another while they ſent
people to ſpie when he came abroad, that they might follow
him into ſome dark Alley, or other obſure or unfrequented
place, and there diſpatch him; and at laſt, after many attempts,
they ſucceeded in that wicked one, when the Murder was
committed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My</hi> Lord, there are contained in this Indictment ſix Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
all principals, three of them, I think, are Preiſts, or
at leaſt two of them are ſo, that is, Father <hi>Girald</hi> an <hi>Iriſh</hi> man,
Father <hi>Kelly</hi> likewiſe of the ſame Nation, and one <hi>Vernat,</hi>
whether a Preiſt or Lay-man, I know not. Theſe Preiſts
(as they are always the firſt that contrive miſcheife, ſo they
are always the firſt that fly puniſhment) have taken care for
themſelves and run away, and left their blind followers, the
Priſoners at the Bar, whom they had drawn into this bloody
act, alone to anſwer for it.</p>
               <p>The day, when this murder was committed, was <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
the 12th of <hi>October</hi> laſt; and <hi>I</hi> muſt deſire your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
to take notice of the day, for upon that much of the
Evidence will depend. And we ſhall prove, that as they
did before ſend ſeveral times to Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey's</hi>
houſe to get intelligence of his going abroad, ſo this very
day in the morning, <hi>Hill</hi> one of the priſoners at the bar
came to his houſe upon pretence of buſineſs with him,
and as we gueſs, and have reaſon to believe, to learn
whither he went that day: <hi>Green</hi> (another of the priſoners)
had been there before on the ſame errand. And ſo much
we ſhall prove to you by the people of the houſe Sir
<hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> happened about noon, or ſome time
in the afternoon of the ſame day (as we have it by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of one of the parties) to be at an houſe near Saint
<hi>Clements</hi> Church, where theſe murtherers had notice he
was, and had prepared a trap for him as he came back.
They had appointed men to watch him and give them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
when he did come back, and whatever his buſineſs was
at the houſe that he was in (for it cannot yet be known) he
ſtaid there till about ſeven or eight a clock at night: And your
Lordſhip knows that at that time of the year it is then dark.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41250:7"/>
He coming from about St. <hi>Clements</hi> Church towards his own
houſe near <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> notice was given to the Murderers of his
approach near to <hi>Sommerſet-houſe.</hi> And thus they had laid their
Bloudy contrivance: Some of them were appointed to meet
him at the Back-gate of <hi>Sommerſet-Houſe,</hi> and to inform him that
there was a Quarrel in the Yard, and He being a man alwayes
careful to keep the Peace and Puniſh them that broke it, they
thought it a very apt means to train him into the Yard. And
when He came near the back-gate they did accordingly acquaint
him that Two of the Queens Servants were fighting in the yard,
and that they needed his preſence to part and quiet them. He at
firſt, thought it might be but ſome ordinary idle ſcuffle, and was
not willing to go down, but being very much importun'd by
them, down he went through the back-gate into the yard,
where were indeed two men ſcuffling together, but counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitly,
the one was <hi>Berry</hi> the Priſoner here, the other was <hi>Kelly</hi>
the Prieſt that is run away. And when Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi>
was come, and within their reach, then, as it was before contrived,
the Fray of it ſelf ended, and <hi>Berry</hi> goes to the lower water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
and <hi>Mr. Praunce</hi> (who was in that ſoul fact, but hath
ſince repented, and hath made this diſcovery) to the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
to keep back any caſual paſſengers for a little while, till
ſuch time as the murder was over.</p>
               <p>My Lord, Things being thus prepared, whileſt Sir <hi>Edmund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury
Godfrey</hi> ſtood ſtill, or was returning, having no more to
do there, after the ſcuffle was thus appeaſed, <hi>Green</hi> one of the
Priſoners, coming behind him, puts a Cravat, or a Twiſted
linnen cloth, (which he had ready for the purpoſe) about his
Neck. And He, <hi>Hill,</hi> and thoſe holy Fathers <hi>Girald</hi> and <hi>Kelly</hi>
(with great veneration be it ſpoken, for men of their Order to
ſtain their hands with the bloud of an Innocent Gentleman, and
that in ſo Treacherous a manner) All ſet upon him, and very
manfully, being Four upon one, and he altogether ſurprized,
threw him down and Strangled him. And this was done (as
it is eaſie to imagine) without much noiſe, ſo that I doubt not
but many that were near the place might be ignorant of it and
did not hear it.</p>
               <p>My Lord, Though the thing was done with a great Zeal, and
a very good will to diſpatch him, yet it ſo happened, that when
<hi>Mr. Praunce</hi> came back from keeping Sentinel at the Gate, there
was ſome life left in Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> he did ſtir his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41250:8"/>
feet, and thereby they perceived that he was not quite dead. But
to make through work with him, <hi>Green,</hi> (who begun, and was
to give an accompliſhment to this bloudy fact) takes hold of his
Head and twiſts his Neck round, and ſtamps upon his Breaſt,
the marks of which outragious cruelty did plainly appear in his
body after it was found</p>
               <p>My Lord, after they had thus kill'd him, <hi>Girald</hi> the Prieſt
thought he was not yet dead enough, and was very willing to
run him through with Sir <hi>Edmundbury's</hi> own Sword, but that was
not liked by the reſt, leſt it might be diſcovered by a great effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of bloud in that place: and ſo they forbore it for that time.
Having thus diſpatch'd him, they removed him to the Chamber
of <hi>Hill</hi> where they kept him ſome time, and after that to another
Chamber. I will not be particular herein becauſe the Witneſs
will give the beſt account of it. But after ſome time, (I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
it may be obſerved) 'twas on Monday night (two nights
after the fact was committed) they brought him into another
Room and laid him there, with a Cloak thrown over him. And
I mention this laſt ſo particularly, becauſe he then happened to
be ſeen by another witneſs here preſent, who concurs as to his
lying there dead, and that he ſaw him by the help of a dark Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn,
of which, and other Circumſtances, I ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to make uſe hereafter.</p>
               <p>My Lord, After he had lain in <hi>Sommerſet-Houſe</hi> ſome days,
they thought it was high time to remove him, or rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
him: for having now killed him they did endeavour to kill
his Reputation, and lay the blame of this foul murder upon
the innocent Gentleman, as if he had killed himſelf: And on
<hi>Wedneſday</hi> night, which by computation was the 16<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi>
they carried him out of <hi>Sommerſet-Houſe</hi> in this manner. <hi>Hill</hi>
having late in the night procured a Sedan, they made a ſhift
by bending the body to a fit poſture to crowd him into it; and
<hi>Berry</hi> one of the murderers and Porter of <hi>Sommerſet-Houſe</hi> was of
all men moſt proper to help them out with privacy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was agreed between them, that whenever a man ſhould
come before and make an hem, it ſhould be a ſign to <hi>Berry</hi> to
open the Gate. And my Lord, having put him into the Sedan,
<hi>Mr. Praunce</hi> and <hi>Girald</hi> firſt carryed him out in it to <hi>Covent Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
and there they reſted, being ſomething wearied with their
burden, and two more ſupplied their rooms, and carried him to
<hi>Long-Acre.</hi> Then <hi>Girald</hi> and <hi>Praunce</hi> took him up again and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41250:8"/>
carried him to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Church near <hi>So-ho:</hi> And when they
had him there, they got an horſe ready and mounted him upon
it, and <hi>Hill</hi> was ſet behind him to hold him up; by which means
they carried him to the place where he was found, and there to
accompliſh the laſt part of their deſign, which was to murder
his Reputation after they had killed his body, they took his own
Sword and run him through, and left him in ſuch a manner,
as that (according to the weakneſs of their underſtanding)
the world ſhould conclude he had killed himſelf. In that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was the Gentleman found. I have but little more at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to trouble you with, and that ſhall be to ſhew you what
the murtherers did after they had committed this fact. They
gave an account of it the next morning to <hi>Mr. Praunce,</hi> who
went no further than the Sedan went, which was to the <hi>Grecian</hi>
Church: and the Prieſts were ſo far from any remorſe, and had
ſo little of humanity, (I believe there is none can think had
much of Divinity) that they did in a paper ſet down a Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of this Heroick Act: and I doubt not but by this time it
is ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> where it finds as great Approbation, and cauſes
as great Joy as their other Acts of a like nature have heretofore
done. Some days after the Fact was done, and to their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
honour thus by themſelves recorded, ſome of theſe Prieſts
had a meeting at the <hi>Queens head</hi> at <hi>Bow,</hi> and there was the
Paper produced and read, at which they were very merry, and
were ſo loud that ſome of the houſe overheard them, and do yet
remember that they read and were merry at a paper which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey.</hi>

particulars muſt ariſe from one who was party to the Fact, yet
my Lord, I will undertake before I have done, ſo to fortifie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

other Teſtimony, and the things will ſo depend upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and have ſuch a Connexion that little doubt will remain
in any mans mind that is come hither without prepoſſeſſion, but
that Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> was murthered at <hi>Sommerſet-Houſe,</hi>
and that the perſons who ſtand now Indicted for it were the

               <p>My Lord, upon the ſixth of <hi>September</hi> laſt, I did go
before Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> and there upon Oath gave in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
depoſitions, and after that I had made Oath of thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
we took the Record along with us home again. And
on the 28<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> after we had taken two or three Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of this Record, we went before Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> again,
and Swore all the Copies we had taken, and ſo made them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords.
My Lord, after that, the buſineſs was made known to
the Council by my ſelf, and upon <hi>Monday</hi> Mr. <hi>Godfrey</hi> came to me,
which was I think the 30<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> and did tell me what
affronts he had received from ſome great perſons (whoſe names
I name not now) for being ſo zealous in this buſineſs. And my
Lord, he told me that others who were well inclin'd to have the
diſcovery made, did think that he had not been quick enough in
the Proſecution, but had been too remiſs, and did threaten him
that they would complain to the Parliament, which was to ſit
the 21<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> following. My Lord, that week before
Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> was miſſing, he came to me, and told me
that ſeveral Popiſh Lords, ſome of whom are now in the <hi>Tower,</hi>
had threatned him, and asked him what he had to do with it. My
Lord, I ſhall name their names when time ſhall come. My Lord,
this is all I can ſay, He was in a great fright and told me he went in
fear of his life by the Popiſh party, and that he had been dog'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

            <p>My Lord, Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> and <hi>I</hi> were of a very
ancient acquaintance for above forty years, we were bred up to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether
at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>- School and continued in that acquaintance
all along, except in the time of the War, and were for many
years together in Commiſſion for the peace, both for this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and this City, We met at the Quarter-Seſſions for <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>
the ſeventh of <hi>October,</hi> which was Monday, as I take it, and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there, we went after the Court was up and dined with the
head Bayly, as the cuſtome is; where Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi>
and I did diſcourſe ſeveral things about this Plot; I ſaid to Sir
<hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> I underſtand you have taken ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations
about this Plot, that is now made publick, true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſaid he, I have, but, I think, I ſhall have little thanks
for my paines, or ſome ſuch words: ſaith he, I did it very
unwillingly and would fain have had it done by others;
why, ſaid I, you did but what was your duty to do, and
it was a very good act: pray, Sir, have you the examinations
about you, will you pleaſe to let me ſee them; no, <hi>I</hi> have them
not, ſaid he, I delivered them to a perſon of quality, but as ſoon
as <hi>I</hi> have them you ſhall ſee them. But, ſaid <hi>I, I</hi> ſhould be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41250:10"/>
very glad to underſtand, Sir <hi>Edmondbury,</hi> that the depth of
the matter were found out, <hi>I</hi> am afraid, ſaid he, of that,
that it is not, but diſcourſing further, he ſaid to me, <hi>Upon my
Conſcience, I believe, I ſhall be the firſt Martyr.</hi> Why ſo, ſaid
<hi>I,</hi> are you afraid? No, ſaid he, <hi>I</hi> do not fear them, if they
come fairly, and <hi>I</hi> ſhall not part with my Life tamely. Why
do not you go with a man, ſaid <hi>I,</hi> if you have that fear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you? Why, ſaid he, <hi>I</hi> do not love it, 'tis a clog to a man,
but, ſaid <hi>I,</hi> you ſhould do well to keep a man: <hi>I</hi> obſerve you
never go with one.</p>

               <p>I ſuppoſe my Lord, it is not unknown to you that he
made ſuch an open Confeſſion before the King.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Look you Sir, I will tell you for that, I do not know
that ever he made a Confeſſion to contradict what he had ſaid
upon his Oath.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, he had accuſed you upon Oath, but afterwards,
you ſay he confeſſed that it was not true; but that Confeſſion
that it was not true, was not upon Oath: How is he then guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Perjury?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hill.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, if a man can ſwear a thing, and after deny
it, he is certainly perjured.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>If a man hath great horrors of Conſcience upon him,
and is full of fears, and the guilt of ſuch a thing diſorders his
mind, ſo as no make him go back from what he had before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
upon Oath, you can't ſay that man is perjured if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he
don't forſwear it: But I believe no body did believe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41250:15"/>
becauſe his firſt diſcovery was ſo particular, that every
man did think his general denyal did only proceed from the
diſturbance of his mind. But have you any mind to ask him
any Queſtions?</p>

this Occaſion, I deſire <hi>Mr. Praunce</hi> may give an Account of one
thing. He was Concerned in this very Fact, and there was
no other way to get any Proof of it, than by the diſcovery of
one among themſelves. He was once of that Religion, or elſe
he had never been Concerned in this thing. And your Lordſhip
will find, that <hi>Mr. Praunce,</hi> whilc he was of that Religion,
and not ſure of his Pardon, was under ſome Diſturbances and
Fears, which prevailed with him to come before the KING, and
deny what he had Sworn. But my Lord, which is very Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,
this Gentleman that had made that denyal before
the KING, was ſo far Convinc'd, that he had done amiſs
in it, and ſo troubled that he had done it, that he deſired
Capt. <hi>Richardſon</hi> (as ſoon as he Returned back to Priſon) to carry
him back to the KING again: for he muſt go back, and
make good that Confeſſion which he at firſt had made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For it

Capt. <hi>Richardſon</hi> may be Sworn.</p>

               <p>My Lord, upon the Sunday Night before
the Prorogation of the laſt Parliament, I Received a Letter
from one of the Lords of the Council, to bring up <hi>Mr. Praunce</hi>
before the Lords of the Committee for his Examination. When
I brought him thither, I found <hi>Mr. Praunce</hi> was diſturbed, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41250:16"/>
deſired to ſpeak with the KING; and I carried him into the
Kings Cloſet, where he fell down on his Knees, and ſaid, <hi>He
was Innocent, and they were all Innocent;</hi> and that was the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of all he ſaid. I then had him up to the Council, where
he ſaid the ſame thing. The Lords asked him, Whether any
body had been Tampering with him, he anſwered no. My
Lord, when I came home, I was no ſooner got within the
Doors, but he begg'd of me (for Gods ſake) to go back to
the KING, and to acquaint Him, not only that what he had
now ſaid, <hi>was Falſe;</hi> but that all which he had ſworn before, <hi>was
Truth.</hi> And if his Majeſty would ſend him a Pardon, he
would make a great Diſcovery. And my Lord, more than
that, he ſaid, It was Fear, that made him Recant; and he
gave a full ſatisfaction, that it was only out of an Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
that his Life was not ſecure, that his Trade would
be loſt among the <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> and in caſe he had his
Pardon, and were Saved, he ſhould have been in danger of

for <hi>Four Thouſand Pounds</hi> to undertake to Kill a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
My Lord, he did Promiſe to undertake it, but fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of his Promiſe, afterwards. <hi>Le Faire</hi> met him, and
told him it was done. And told him, he ſhould have
half that Reward to help to carry him off; and withall,
carryed him into the Room where the Body was. And
he will tell you, that <hi>Praunce</hi> was in the Room when he ſaw
him; and though he never knew <hi>Praunce</hi> before, yet when
he met with him in the <hi>Lobby</hi> of the Lords Houſe, he
knew him again, and Charged him as the Man that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
this Fact. And he will Acquaint your Lordſhip,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41250:17"/>
that <hi>Le Faire</hi> ſaw the Body likewiſe, and gave Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi>

               <p>They told me it vvas to be done to Night. I
asked vvho it vvas, they ſaid it vvas a very material Man: For
he had all the Informations that Mr. <hi>Oates.</hi> and Dr. <hi>Tongue</hi>
had given in; that ſeveral had been imployed in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, that ſeveral Attempts had been made, and that
they had miſs'd ſeveral Opportunities, and had not done
it till then; but if he should not be taken out of the way,
and the Papers taken from him, the buſineſs would be
ſo Obſtructed, and go near to be Diſcovered, to that
Degree, that they would not be able to bring this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to paſs, but muſt ſtay till another Age before they
should Effect it. I asked him again, who it was, he
ſayd he would not tell me, but it was a very material
Man. I told him, that according to my Promiſe I would
Aſſiſt; but in ſuch a Caſe, I ſhould need a great many
Men to be with me, he being ſo conſiderable a Perſon. I
asked him then, where the Money was, that was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
promiſed? he told me no worſe a Man was En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
for it, than my Lord <hi>Bellaſis,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to pay it.</p>

               <p>I parted with him then, but came not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to my Promiſe. I was to meet him at the Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
at <hi>Somerſet-Houſe</hi> that night; but I knew their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
was to Murder ſome body, and I would not come.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41250:18"/>
I ſaw him no more till Monday Night, then I met him
in Red-Lyon-Court, where he put up his Cane to his
Noſe; as who ſhould ſay, I was to blame in not keeping
my Promiſe. And we went together to the <hi>Grey-Hound-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern</hi>
in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> where he charged me with my breach of
Promiſe. I told him I was taken up by other Company, and
unleſs they would tell me who it was I was to Kill, I would
have no hand in it: For I did not know but that it might
be my own particular Friend. And I would not murther
any private perſon, unleſs I knew who it was, and for
what Reaſon. Well, ſays he, we will tell you more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
if you meet me to night at <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> at nine a
Clock. I did meet him exactly at that time in the Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
where we walk't and talk't a great while. And then
he took me into the middle of the Court, and told me,
you have don ill, that you did not help in this buſineſs;
but if you will help to carry him off, you ſhall have half
the Reward. Why ſaid I, <hi>Is he Murdered? Yes,</hi> ſaid he;
<hi>May not I ſee him,</hi> ſayd I? <hi>Yes, you may,</hi> ſayd he: and ſo took
me by the hand, and led me into the Room through a
dark Entry. In the Room were a great many, I can't tell
who they all were.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41250:19"/>
and he had got about his Neck, ſuch a kind of a faſhion'd
Cravat as this about my Neck; and I went to try, and
could not get my Finger in betwixt. So I ſaw him, his
Boſome was all open, and I knew him preſently: For
thoſe Jeſuits that were there, were not thoſe who had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
me to inſinuate my ſelf into his Acquaintance; and
ſo they thought I had not known him. I Asked who it
was, they ſaid it was a man that belong'd to a perſon of
Quality. I was mightily ſtruck and daunted, when I
knew him: I would ſain have perſwaded them to have
Tyed Weights at his Head and Feet, and Thrown him
into the River, and afterwards I would have dragg'd for
him, and took him up there. But they did not think
that ſo ſafe. <hi>No</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>we will put it upon himſelf, there
are none but Friends concerned.</hi> I Asked <hi>Le Faire,</hi> how they
would get him out? They ſaid, <hi>In a Chair.</hi> Then I Ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, which way they would get him into the Chair,
and out of the Gate. They ſaid <hi>The Porter was to ſit up
to let them Out.</hi>

my ſelf, and ſaid, It was too Early to carry him out
yet; but about <hi>Eleven</hi> or <hi>Twelve</hi> a Clock would be a better
time. And I aſſured them I would come again. Said <hi>Le Faire</hi>
to me, <hi>Upon the Sacrament you took on Thurſday, you will be at
the Carrying Off of this Man at Night.</hi> I promiſed him I would.
And he went away, and left me there. I made what ſpeed
away I could, for I was very Unſatisfied in my ſelf;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41250:19"/>
having ſo great a charge upon me, as the Sacrament of the
Alter, which after the diſcovery of the Plot, was Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
to me twice a Week to conceal it, I could not tell
how to diſcover: I went then to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> but very reſtleſs
and diſturbed in my mind; and being perſwaded by what
God was pleaſed to put into my mind, calling to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
that ſome Murders had been already committed, and
greater ones were dayly intended, I was at laſt convinc't, and
could not longer forbear diſcovery. I wrote to the Secretary of
it, and went to the Parliament and gave in my information.
And one day I met with Mr. <hi>Praunce</hi> in the Lobby, and knew
him, and apprehended him.</p>

               <p>I underſtood aftewards that he was taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuſpicion, becauſe at that time, his Maid had made a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovery,
that he was about that time out of his Lodgings.
And while he was there in the Conſtables hands Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>
came by, and he deſired to ſee him; and preſently after I came
thither, and the Conſtable asked him, Mr. <hi>Praunce,</hi> will you
ſee Mr. <hi>Bedlow?</hi> No, he ſaid, he would not: Then he put
his Hat over his eyes that I might not ſee his face, and kept
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41250:20"/>
it ſo. The preſs being great, and being deſirous to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
my ſelf, I ſpoke to the Guard to put all out that had
no buſineſs there, and they cried out, that all ſhould avoid
the Room but <hi>Mr. Bedlow</hi> and his Friends. And when he
was going out with the reſt, he lift up his Hat to ſee his way;
and though before I did not mind him, yet I happened at
his paſſing by me to caſt my eyes upon his face, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knew him, and cried, Oh! pray Sir ſtay, you are one of
my friends that muſt ſtay here. And I preſently charged my
Guards to take charge of him. Saith the Conſtable, he is
my Priſoner: Is he ſo, ſaid I? Then you have a very good
Priſoner, and pray look ſafe to him. And then when I went
into the Houſe of Lords, I made out my charge againſt
him.</p>

               <p>No, for then there would have been ſome

               <p>Becauſe ſome have been of opinion, that he
hanged himſelf, and his Relations to ſave his eſtate run him

               </speaker>
               <p>There was more done to his neck than an
ordinary ſuffocation; the wound went through his very heart,
and there would have appeared ſome blood, if it had been
done quickly after his death.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Skillard.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>He was a lean man, and his muſcles if he had
died of the wound, would have been turgid: and then again
all ſtrangled people never ſwell, becauſe there is a ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation
of all the ſpirits, and a hindring of the Circulation
of the blood.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Skillard.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I believe four or five days. And they might
have kept him a week and he never ſwell'd at all, being a
lean man. And when we ript him up, he began for to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trify,
we made two inciſions to give it vent, and the liquor that
was in his body did a little ſmell. The very lean fleſh was ſo

near turned into putrefaction, that it ſtuck to the Inſtrument
when we cut it.</p>

               <p>Upon friday, the very ſame day the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman

through the body under the left Pap.</p>

               <p>Now, my Lord, as theſe were meetings
before the fact was committed to conſult how to do it; ſo
we at the beginning told you of a meeting after it was done,
and that was at <hi>Bow.</hi> We ſhall therefore call ſome Witneſſes

               <p>Do you remember you were ſent of a meſſage

and the Jury.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cary.</speaker>
               <p>I remember it very well; there were three Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that ſent for me to the <hi>Queens-Head,</hi> and I being ſent for
did come, and when I came up ſtairs, they asked me if I
knew <hi>Poplar,</hi> I ſaid I knew it very well. Then they asked
me if I knew Mr. <hi>Dethick,</hi> I told them I thought I did. Then
ſaid they, you muſt carry this Letter to <hi>George Dethick,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> at
<hi>Poplar,</hi> and deliver it to his own hands, and to no body elſe.
Accordingly away I went, and carried the Letter: I went to
the door, and asked if he were within; his Man ſaid he was
above ſtairs, but they would call him to me; and calling him
to me, Sir, ſaid I, there are ſome Gentlemen at the <hi>Queens-Head</hi>
at <hi>Bow</hi> that have ſent me with a Letter to you. So he looked
upon the Letter, and, ſaith he, go and tell them I will be with
them preſently. So, may it pleaſe you, my Lord, I came
again, and when I came, the Gentlemen were there ſtill. Well,
ſaid they, go and drink a Glaſs of Claret, which ſtood upon
the Table, and they gave me Six-pence, and I went away.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I was upon the twenty fourth

<hi>Praunce</hi> was ſent for, to ſpeak his knowledge concerning this
Murder, and he then gave a general Account of things, which,
becauſe it did relate to that Bench, and this Corner, and
that Room, and that Paſſage, and that Gallery, it was

thought fit to appoint my Lord Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and the

what I did take upon the place, This was done here, and

they were ſitting when Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> was coming
down; then the Corner into which they drew him when they

ſtay, which was at the Stairs that lead to the Upper Court,
then a little door at the end of the Stables, which lead up
a pair of Stairs, and at the head of the Stairs a long dark
Entry, and at the top of thoſe Staires, a door on the left
hand, which being opened, ſhew'd us eight ſteps, which
lead up to the Lodgings that were Dr. <hi>Godwins:</hi> In which

and poſitively, as if any body ſhould walk to <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi>
door. But afterwards, when the Lords did deſire to know
whither the Body was carried, he ſaid, it was into ſome Room
of the houſe by the Garden; for this is an Outer part of the
Houſe, which any body may do any thing in, without their
knowledge that are within. And he undertook to lead them
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41250:26"/>
to the place as well as he could; and ſo away we went
through the long dark Entry that leads into the Outer Court
of the Great Houſe; and croſsing the Quadrangle, he leads
us to the <hi>Piazza,</hi> and down a pair of Stairs, and ſo far,
ſaid he, I am ſure I went; then, aſſoon as we were down the
Stairs, there is a great Square Court, then he began to ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
as if he did not know his way, but there was no way
but to go on hovvever, and on vve vvent, and coming croſs
the Court, vve came into ſeveral Rooms, and going through
them, vve came up Stairs again, and ſo into ſeveral other
Rooms again. Sure, ſaid he, vve vvere here, but I can't
tell, and he vvas in a great Diſtraction vvhat Room he ſavv
the Body in; but, ſaid he, thus far, I am certain I am
right; vvhich vvas according to the Paper, and I refer my
ſelf to that.</p>

               <p>This way of Anſwering is like the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that was taken lately amongſt ſome of them. A Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was asked when he ſaw ſuch a Prieſt? He denied that he
had ſeen him in fourteen dayes. But then comes one and
proves to his face, that he was with him in Company all Night,
within a Week and Ieſs. I, ſayes he, that's true, but I ſaid I
had not ſeen him in Fourteen Dayes. And ſo they may take
Oaths to ſerve the King faithfully all the Dayes of their
Lives, but in the Nights they may murther him, and keep
their Oaths for all that.</p>

kept very good hours, and he always waited at Supper, and
never went abroad after he came in to wait at Supper: and the

               <p>My Lord, it is an extraordinary little
place; as ſoon as you get up eight ſteps, there is a little ſquare
Entry, and there is this Room on the one hand, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-Room
on the other. I think there is a pair of ſtaires to
go down at one corner of the Entry, as I think, but the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
was laid in a little ſquare Room at the head of the ſteps.</p>

               <p>For my own part I will not judge you:
but that his Body ſhould be carried there about nine a clock at

'tis very ſuſpitious, that if you were in the Houſe, as you ſay
you were, and uſed to go into that Room every day, you

               <p>To tell you the truth, I thought the man
ſo clear of this Fact, that I never trouble my head with it;
but when Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> came to my houſe, I told him
that he was never in our houſe by day-time, except being <hi>Cuſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion-layer</hi>
in the <hi>Chappel,</hi> he uſed to come at half an hour after
eleven, and many times he did deſire me, becauſe we were
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41250:35"/>
Proteſtants, to put in a little fleſh meat with ours; ſometimes
he would ſit down and eat his meat in the Kitchin, and his
Wife with him; and his Wife would ſay to him, 'tis a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom
time, pray ſee that you come home betimes. I did
not at all remember the day of the month at the firſt, nor the
Action; but my Husband and I have ſince remembred. We
were deſired by them once to eat a Fowl with them, and my
Husband did command me the Sunday after to invite them to
dinner with us, and I went in the morning very early, I think,
and bought a dozen of Pidgeons, and put them in a Pye, and
we had a Loine of Pork roaſted; and when he was gone to
the <hi>Chappel</hi> on Saturday in the afternoon, his Wife came to me
and ſaid, my Husband is not well, and when he comes home
will ask for ſomething of Broth; and away ſhe went to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
to buy ſomething to make Broth of. While ſhe was at
Market, her Husband came home, and asked where his Wife
was? why, Mr. <hi>Greene,</hi> ſaid I, ſhe is gone to Market: what
an old Fool, ſaid he, is this, to go out ſo late, ſuch a night as
this is? but ſaid he again, I will go to the Coffee-houſe, and
drink a Diſh of Coffee, and pray tell my wife ſo. In the
mean time ſhe returned, and by that time ſhe had been above
a little while, he came in again. And Mr. <hi>Greene</hi> being there,
my Husband came in, and called to me, prithee, ſweetheart,
what haſt thou got for my Supper? prithee, ſaid I, ſweetheart
thou art always calling for thy Victuals when thou comeſt in.
Then Mr. <hi>Greene</hi> goes to the ſtairs, and calls to his Wife,
and bids her bring him down ſome victuals, and ſhe brings
down the Bread and Cheeſe, and he ſtayed there till it was
nine a Clock; and then ſaith Mr. <hi>Greene</hi> to his Wife, let us
go up, for there is a Fire.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. At. G.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I think, he hath taken the Oaths
of Allegiance and Supremacy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Well, pray Sir go on with your Story.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ravenſcroft.</speaker>
               <p>If it pleaſe you, upon a Saturday, a little
before Chriſtmaſs, there was ſomebody taken, I think it was one
M. <hi>Praunce,</hi> for I never ſaw the man, neither do I know him
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41250:36"/>
at all: and it was reported that he was taken upon the Death
of Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury Godfrey,</hi> and I was glad to hear it. My
houſe was in the <hi>Savoy.</hi> and my Fathers houſe is in <hi>Holborn;</hi>
and I uſed often to go and ſee my father, and coming home
again, I went to ſee the Maid at her new Houſe, ſhe had not
been long there, and ſhe was ſtanding at the Dore of the Houſe.
I asked her what News? ſays ſhe, here hath been a man here
that tells us that <hi>Praunce</hi> hath diſcover'd ſeveral of the Murderers
of Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury Godfrey,</hi> and they talk up and down
ſtrangely of it, and ask me whether my Husband be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with him? then ſaid I to her, is he? ſhe anſwered me very
well, they have been often together, and ſo ſhe told me the
people did mutter and talk of her Husband; but ſaid I,
what ſays your Husband to it? ſays ſhe, he deſies <hi>Praunce</hi> and all
his works. Said I, where is your Husband? ſaid ſhe, he is within;
I was very glad to hear it, for, ſaid I, he living in <hi>Somerſet Houſe,</hi>
and being acquainted with <hi>Praunce,</hi> I am glad to hear that your
Husband can be ſo Couragious; ſo I went away and came
again thither the next morning, and found he was taken the
night before. All that I ſay then, is that it, was a good
Evidence of his innocency, that when he had notice of it he did
not Fly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>So then your diſcourſe was after <hi>Archbold</hi> had been
there.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ravenſcroft.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Archbold</hi> was there before me, and had
ſpoken this in their Company. I ſpake with her that night,
and the next morning too; and all that I ſay is, it Fight be a
ſign of Guilt, as no doubt it is, <hi>Adam ubi es?</hi> and Couragiouſneſs
is a ſign of innocency, then this man is innocent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>But you ſay ſhe told you they were acquainted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ravenſcroft.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I have one thing more to ſay.
Upon the occaſion of theſe things, this Woman hath been
often with me, and hath deſired to know of me what Defence
ſhe ſhould make, for I ſaw <hi>Hill</hi>'s Wife and <hi>Berry</hi>'s Wife
were all ſimple people without Defence for themſelves, and
they did deſire that I would Examin and ſee ſome of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
and ſee how it was, and ſhe had gotten me ſome
papers, and I Conferred them together, there are witneſſes
that will atteſt the Copy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. At. G.</speaker>
               <p>What is all this to the purpoſe? only this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
hath a mind to ſhew that he can ſpeak Latin.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ravenſcroft.</speaker>
               <p>I thank God I can ſpeak Latin as well as
any man in the Court.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ravenſcroft.</speaker>
               <p>I declare it my ſelf, if this man were
Guilty, rather than I would ſpeak for him, if there wanted
a Hangman, I would do it my ſelf.</p>

               <p>Becauſe I have been called to an account before,

our Sentinels off about 3 or 4 of the Clock in the afternoon.</p>

by the loſs of the Trade, prevailed with him to deny what he had confeſſed.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Attor. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I muſt crave leave to ſpeak a word, or two;
and the Evidence having been ſo very long, I ſhall be exceeding ſhort. I
intended (when I began to open the Evidence) to have made ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
after the Evidence ended; to ſhew how each part of it did agree,
and how the Main was ſtrengthned by concurrent Circumſtances. But in
truth, the King's Evidence did fall out much better than I could expect,
and the defence of the Priſoners much weaker than I could foreſee. So
that, I think, the proof againſt the Priſoners is ſo ſtrong; and ſo little hath
been alleadged by them in their Defence, that it would be but loſs of time to
do, what I at firſt intended. Only I will obſerve, that Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> doth
agree with Mr. <hi>Praunce,</hi> as far forth as is poſſible; that is, in thoſe parts
of the Fact of which he pretends to have any knowledge. Yet had they
never any communication one with another, as both have Sworn. And
your Lordſhip will obſerve in how many particulars they do agree;
namely, as to the Dark Lanthorn, as to the Covering of the Body in
the Room; how they intended to carry the Body out in a Sedan, and
the reſt. So that if they had laid their heads together to contrive a Story,
they could hardly have agreed in ſo many circumſtances; and yet this
they do without diſcourſing with each other beforehand.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I muſt likewiſe obſerve to you, that the Servants of the Plow
Ale-houſe concur as to the Meetings there: The Maid agrees as to the
Priſoners coming to Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi>'s Houſe, and to the time, <hi>viz.</hi>
that Saturday Morning; nay, to the very Hours of Nine, or Ten a Clock;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41250:39"/>
That the Conſtables Relation of the poſture in which the Body was found
in the Field, doth perfectly agree with the Account that the Murtherers
gave thereof to Mr. <hi>Praunce</hi> the next Morning. The Chirurgions do
agree with Mr. <hi>Praunce,</hi> as to the manner of Sir <hi>Edmonbury Godfrey's</hi>
being killed, the ſtrangling, the bruiſing of his Stomach, the twiſting of
his Neck. And the Witneſſes from <hi>Bow</hi> make it out, that <hi>Dethick</hi> was ſent
for; that they had a Dinner there. The Boy proves that he over-heard
them reading ſomething about Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> and that they
were very Merry; and that for his liſtning, he was threatned to be kickt
down ſtairs.</p>
               <p>So that, I think, there never was an Evidence that was better fortified
with circumſtances than this: My Lord, I ſhall be bold to ſay, here is
certainly as much Evidence, as the matter is capable of. It is not to be
expected that they ſhould call Witneſſes to be by, when they do ſuch foul
Facts; ſo that none can Swear directly the very Fact, but ſuch a one as
was an Actor in it. All Circumſtances relating to the Fact, both before,
and after, are made out by concurrent teſtimony. And, my Lord, I muſt
obſerve, that it was a Murther committed through zeal to a falſe Religion,
and that Religion was a bond of ſecrecy. We all know, his Majeſty hath
been graciouſly pleaſed by his Proclamation, to propoſe a Pardon, and a
Reward to the Diſcoverers. And yet almoſt without effect; Their zeal to
their falſe Religion was a greater obſtacle, than the Proclamation was an
incitement, to the Diſcovery. And I do believe, if Mr. <hi>Praunce</hi> had not
had ſome inclination to change his Religion, you had ſtill been without
ſo clear a Diſcovery of this Work of Darkneſs, as now you have. I ſhall
ſay no more, but conclude to the Jury with that ſaying, that I remember
in the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi> (in the caſe of a Murther too, though of another
Nature,) <hi>Judg.</hi> 19. 30. <hi>The People ſaid there was no ſuch deed done, nor
ſeen, from the day that the Children of Iſrael came out of Egypt:</hi> And I may
ſay, there was never ſuch a barbarous Murther committed in <hi>England,</hi>
ſince the People of <hi>England</hi> were freed from the Yoke of the Pope's Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
and as 'tis ſaid there, ſo ſay I now, <hi>Conſider of it, take advice, and
ſpeak your minds.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I would only make one Obſervation to your
Lordſhip, which is this; I do not find they do in the leaſt pretend to tax
Mr. <hi>Praunce,</hi> that any Perſon hath bribed him to give this Evidence; nor,
that there was the leaſt Reward ever propoſed to him to bear Witneſs
againſt them, not ſo much as the hopes of that Reward contained in the
King's Proclamation; yet Mr. <hi>Praunce,</hi> if he had had a mind to bear falſe
Witneſs, might have laid hold of that opportunity; but ſo far was he from
pretending to diſcover any thing, that he denied all when he was firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.
But after he was in Hold, and likely to be brought to Juſtice,
and lying under the conviction of a Guilty Conſcience, then, and not till
then does he diſcover it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:41250:39"/>
There is no Objection in the world to be made, but
that ſince this Diſcovery, Mr. <hi>Praunce</hi> hath retracted what
he ſaid before, but he gives you a very good account of
it; the Terrors of Conſcience he then lay under, the
Fears that he ſhould not be pardoned, and the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
he had from the Threats on their ſide, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of his utter ruine, put him upon that Denial.</p>
               <p>But, my Lord, He tells you likewiſe, That as ſoon as
ever he was brought back to the Priſon, he owned all he
had ſaid at firſt, and deſired he might be carried back
again to Teſtifie the Truth of what he had firſt Sworn to.
This, my Lord, he gives you an Account of, and the ſame
Account does the Keeper of the Priſon give too. I have
nothing to ſay more, but onely juſt to obſerve the many
Circumſtances whereby Mr. <hi>Praunce</hi> his Teſtimony is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified.
Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> does agree with him in every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
as far as his knowledge went: The Maid of the
Houſe agrees with his Teſtimony; that ſays, She ſaw
<hi>Green</hi> at Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi>'s ſeveral times, though
here he denies he knew him. That ſhe ſaw <hi>Hill</hi> there
that very Morning her Maſter was miſſed: That he
talked with her Maſter a Quarter of an hour: That ſhe
knew him by a very good token; not onely by his Face,
but alſo that he had the ſame Clothes on then he hath
now.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Praunce</hi> hath likewiſe told you of another Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
the meeting at the <hi>Plow-Alehouſe,</hi> where
they laid the whole Deſign of Intrapping Sir <hi>Edmondbury
Godfrey:</hi> and herein he is Fortified by the Concurrent Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of the Maſter of the Houſe, and the Servant
too, though they now deny that ever they had been in
his Company there; or that they ſo much as knew <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald;</hi>
though when they were examined at the Council-Board,
they ſaid, they knew <hi>Girald,</hi> but not <hi>Kelley:</hi> and
now they are preſt with it here, <hi>Hill</hi> retreats to this,
That he knows one <hi>Girald,</hi> but not <hi>Girald</hi> the Prieſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:41250:40"/>
My Lord, I think the Matter is ſo fully, and ſo plainly
proved beyond exception, that there needs no great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
in the Caſe: It is impoſſible that Mr. <hi>Praunce</hi> a
man of that mean Capacity ſhould invent a Story with
ſo many Circumſtances, all ſo conſiſtent, if there were
not truth at the bottom of it. He ſhews you the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
places, from place to place, where they decoyed
him in, and how they diſpoſed of him, to the time
they carried him out. And in each of theſe Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
there is not the leaſt improbability or cauſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe
him. It hath been already ſo fully repeated, and
the plainneſs of the Evidence is ſo convincing, that I need
not make more Obſervations upon it; But ſubmit it to
your Lordſhip and the Jury.</p>
            </sp>
            <div type="text">
               <head>Then the Lord Chief Juſtice directed the Jury
in this manner:</head>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Chief Juſtice.</speaker>
                  <p>Look you, Gentlemen of the Jury, This is an Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
for Innocent Blood that hath been ſhed, and your
buſineſs is to ſee if you can find out the Murderers.</p>
                  <p>We would not add Innocent Blood to Innocent Blood:
but on the other-ſide, If you have received Satisfaction
ſo much as the Nature of the Thing can bear, then the
Land is defiled, unleſs this be ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>Now for that I will urge the Witneſs and their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
no further than it does appear; for You and
VVe are all upon our Oaths to do uprightly, neither to
Spare Murderers, nor Condemn the Innocent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:41250:40"/>
In the firſt place, VVe began with Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and he
told you, that he had ſome Converſe with Sir <hi>Edmondbury
Godfrey,</hi> and that he was threatn'd by ſome, and had no
good will for his pains, in taking thoſe Examinations he
had taken, and he was afraid his Life was in danger. This
he tells you was the Diſcourſe before-hand, and this is
produced to lead you to conſider what ſort of perſons they
were, of whom he was likely to have theſe Fears; for his
Fears did ariſe from his having done his part, as a Juſtice
of Peace, in taking the Examinations upon Oath.</p>
                  <p>For the Teſtimony of the Fact they produce firſt Mr.
<hi>Praunce,</hi> wherein you will do well to obſerve all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
that he goes by, before the Fact, and all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
in the Tranſaction of that Affair, and the Parties
by whom it was to be Acted: Firſt he tells you how long
it was before they could entice him to conſent to ſuch a
Villany as this was, To Murder a Man; he tells you by
whom he was thus enticed, which makes the Story more
probable; that is, by <hi>Girald</hi> and <hi>Kelley</hi> (two Prieſts) and
he tells it you ſtill more probably by their Doctrine, that
it was no ſin; but it was rather an Act of Charity to kill
a Man that had done, and was like to do them miſchief: So
that if you conſider the perſons that Preached to him, and
the Doctrine they taught, it carries a great ſhew and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of Truth in it ſelf. When they had met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at the <hi>Plow</hi> ſeveral times (which was deny'd by ſome
of them, but is moſt manifeſtly proved by the Maſter
of the Houſe, and the Boy) and the wiſht for time was
come; for they were to watch the opportunity, and Mr.
<hi>Praunce</hi> was to be at home, and they would call him to
give his helping hand; he tells you, That Mr. <hi>Hill</hi>
did go that Morning; for though he talks of an Errand
before, yet to keep to that which is moſt preſſing in
the Evidence, he went to Sir <hi>Edmondbury's</hi> Houſe.
This he ſeems to deny; but the Maid does Swear
it expreſly upon him; and ſays, She came firſt to
him, and went up Stairs, and then came back again,
and ſtill he was there. And ſhe ſwears poſitively ſhe
knows him by his Face, and by the Clothes he then
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41250:41"/>
had on, which are the ſame Clothes he hath on now,
and that that is the Man that was with her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;
and this, which they cannot diſprove, half proves
the matter.</p>
                  <p>VVhat had he to do at Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfry</hi>'s
Houſe? But that would be an hard puzling Queſtion
to be put to him; VVhat did you there? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is to deny it; but the Maid proves it upon him,
as well as <hi>Praunce.</hi> So that I would have you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
how many VVitneſſes you have to one thing or
another, all conducing to this point.</p>
                  <p>You have firſt Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> that tells you the Diſcourſe
that paſſed between Mr. <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> and him,
the Maid tells you, that both theſe Men were there, one
at one time, and the other at another; and you have
Mr. <hi>Praunce</hi> that knew the whole Affair, who tells
you ſo likewiſe, and that they were reſolved to do the
VVork that day, in ſo much that if they could not
doe it, as they had before contrived it (and Sir
<hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> was ſenſible that he was Dogg'd
up and down) <hi>Girald</hi> did reſolve to dogg him to his
own Door, and kill him in the Lane that leads to his
Houſe, he would have run him through himſelf; and
this <hi>Girald</hi> is one of thoſe Prieſts, whoſe Church counts
it no ſin, but an Act of Charity, to Murther a Chriſtian,
to propagate Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>When they had way-laid him and watcht his coming,
from what place Mr. <hi>Praunce</hi> cannot tell; for he knows
nothing but what they told him, and they only named in
general, that he was Lodg'd in St. <hi>Clements;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
one comes to acquaint him, that they would intice
him in at the VVatergate, by <hi>Sommerſet</hi>-Houſe, and they
would do it with art enough, for they never want a
contrivance for ſo charitable an Act; and it was upon
this pretence, that there were Two men a wrangling and
fighting, and then he being a Juſtice of the Peace, was a
Perſon that would part the Fray eaſily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:41250:41"/>
And it was a probable invention: for Sir <hi>Edmundbury God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi>
was a Man that was as willing to do all acts of Juſtice
as any one, and as little afraid to do it; for the Witneſs
tells you before, that he ſaid, if they did do him a miſchief,
they muſt do it baſely, for he did not fear the beſt of them
upon fair play. Then when he was deſired to get himſelf a
Man to follow him, he ſlighted the advice: And we all know,
that he was a Man of ſingular Courage, and therefore it was
the eaſier to lay a trap for him. Then ſaith <hi>Praunce,</hi> When
he was got in, <hi>Berry</hi> and I were to have ſeveral Poſts, which
we were to go to, I to one place, and <hi>Berry</hi> to another; and
I ſtaid, ſaith he, till <hi>Green</hi> threw the Cravat about his Neck,
and was aſſiſted by <hi>Girald</hi> and the reſt that were there. And
then, as ſoon as we could imagine the thing to be done, <hi>Berry</hi>
comes in, and <hi>Praunce</hi> comes back from his ſtanding, and by
ſome Motions findes that he was alive, and that till <hi>Green</hi>
twiſted his Neck round; which the Chirurgions ſay was plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Broken Neck, and nothing of the Wounds which were
in his Body were given him while he was alive.</p>
                  <p>When they had done this, he tells you, they carried him
to Mr. <hi>Hill</hi>'s Chamber: <hi>Berry, Girald, Kelly</hi> and the reſt, all
helpt him in, and there they leave him. Then <hi>Praunce</hi> goes
away. This was on Saturday-night. Then <hi>Praunce</hi> comes
again on Munday-night, and finds him removed to another
Chamber hard by, where he ſaw him by the light of a Dark
Lanthorn, with ſomething thrown over his face; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
on Tueſday-night following, they did remove him
back to <hi>Hill</hi>'s Lodgings, and there he lay till Wedneſday-night,
when they carried him out.</p>
                  <p>Saith <hi>Praunce,</hi> I ſaw him that night; I was the Man that
help'd to carry him out, for it was <hi>Praunce</hi> and <hi>Girald</hi> that
carried him firſt, and it was <hi>Green</hi> and <hi>Kelly</hi> who went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and took him up afterward. He tells you, they ſet
him upon an Horſe-back, and <hi>Hill</hi> behind him. They carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him out in a Chair, which was a thing that uſed to come
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41250:42"/>
in and go out there, and ſo the leſs notice would be taken of
it. I will obſerve to you afterwards on the Priſoners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
what is ſaid for them to all this.</p>
                  <p>But as to <hi>Praunce,</hi> you ſee he hath given you an Account
from the top to the bottom, from the firſt Tranſaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, from the time of his being called by them to
help in the Murder, and from his ſeeing the Handkerchief
twiſted about his Neck, his Neck twiſted round; how they
diſpoſed of his Body at firſt, what removes they made, and
when they carried him out, who were in company, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
them, and what became of him at laſt.</p>
                  <p>He ſays, he ſaw him ſet up before <hi>Hill</hi> on Horſeback, and
they told him, they had thrown him in a Ditch, and <hi>Girald</hi>
had run him through with his own Sword, and in that
poſture, and in that place, the Conſtable found him: The
Chirurgions tell you, that it was by the twiſting of his
Neck, and the Strangling, that he was kill'd, and not by
the Wounds; and the very bruiſings which <hi>Praunce</hi> ſpeaks
of, were found upon the view of the Body. So that here is
not any one thing, that is not backt either in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
circumſtance or other; beſides Mr. <hi>Praunce</hi>'s Teſtimony,
who (alone) could give the Narrative of the Fact.</p>
                  <p>And it is no Argument againſt Mr. <hi>Praunce</hi> in the world,
that he ſhould not be believed, becauſe he was a party, or
becauſe he after denyed what he firſt ſaid: Firſt, becauſe you
can have no body to diſcover ſuch a Fact, but only one
that was privy to it: So that we can have no Evidence, but
what ariſes from a party to the Crime: and in the next place,
his denyal after he had confeſſed it to me, does not at all
ſound as an act of falſhood, but fear; it is not a good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to ſay that he is not to be believed, becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
what he once ſaid: for he tells you, he had not his
Pardon, he was in great Conſternation; the horrour of
the Fact it ſelf, and the loſs of his Trade and Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41250:42"/>
was enough to do it. But how ſhort was his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal,
and how quick was his Recantation! for he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
it before the King not upon Oath: he Swore it upon
Oath, but he denies it upon his Word only; but by that
time he got home to <hi>Newgate</hi> with Captain <hi>Richardſon,</hi>
he fell down on his knees, and begg'd him for God's ſake
to carry him back to the King, for what I did ſay at firſt,
ſaid he, is true, and this denyal is falſe. And here could
be no tampering, no contrivance made uſe of; no, 'tis
plain there could be no art uſed to make him retract from his
firſt Teſtimony. And theſe are the particulars as to <hi>Praunce</hi>
his Evidence.</p>
                  <p>Then comes Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> and tells you, that he was
commanded by <hi>le Faire,</hi> and the Prieſts he was acquainted
with, to inſinuate himſelf into the acquaintance of Sir
<hi>Edmundbury Godfrey;</hi> they did not tell him why; they
themſelves knew privately wherefore, and they did intend
him as an inſtrument to do it, as appears afterwards. He tells
you, he got into his acquaintance, by pretending to go for
Warrants for the good Behaviour and the Peace, as he
knew Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> was willing to have the Peace
kept; and he was with him every day almoſt, for a Week
or more.</p>
                  <p>Then the Prieſts come a little nearer, and tamper'd with
him to kill a man, an ill man for their turn, and that
Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> ſhould be very well rewarded, he ſhould have
Four thouſand pounds to kill that Gentleman; but ſtill they
kept the name ſecret. He promiſed them fair, but broke
his word. Afterwards he meets this Companion that he
had moſt confidence in, and being tax'd with his breach of
Promiſe, ſaid he, I had buſineſs, I could not come. Well,
ſaid his Companion, you ſhould have been as good as your
word; but the thing is done, the perſon is killed, and I
would have you help to carry him away. He promiſes to
do it, and to meet him at <hi>Somerſet</hi>-houſe; accordingly he
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41250:43"/>
comes upon Munday in the Evening, and about 9 or 10
of the Clock at night, Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> ſwears, that in this
Chamber that <hi>Praunce</hi> ſays he was laid in, he did ſee the
Body, by the help of a dark Lanthorn; and his Face was
covered with a Cloak or a Mantle, or ſome ſuch thing
thrown over him.</p>
                  <p>And theſe two men, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Praunce</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> as
the Counſel have obſerved, had not any Confederacy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
for they both ſwear, that they never had any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
at all; and if it be ſo, then it is impoſſible for two
men ſo to agree in a tale with all circumſtances, if they
never converſed together, but it muſt be true.</p>
                  <p>It is hardly poſſible for any man to invent ſuch a Story,
for <hi>Praunce</hi> it is, I believe. I finde it is no hard thing
for the Prieſts to contrive ſuch an Action; but for two
Witneſſes to agree in ſo many material Circumſtances with
one another, that had never converſed together, is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
                  <p>If all this had been a Chimaera, and not really ſo, then
<hi>Praunce</hi> muſt be one of the notableſt Inventors in the
world: And there muſt have been the mightieſt chance in
the world, that Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> and he ſhould agree ſo in all
things; and that the Maid ſhould ſwear that <hi>Hill</hi> was there
that Morning; and that the Conſtable ſhould finde the
Body, juſt as they told <hi>Praunce</hi> they had left him.</p>
                  <p>So that upon the matter you have two Witneſſes almoſt
in every thing; for Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> ſeeing him in the place
murdered, is a plain Evidence that the thing was done; and
all the other Witneſſes, ſpeaking to Circumſtances both
before and after, make the Evidence plain, that theſe were
the Perſons who did it. And I ſee nothing incoherent in
all Mr. <hi>Praunce</hi>'s Teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:41250:43"/>
I would not urge this ſo, if I was not ſatisfied in my own
Conſcience that the Relation is true in the Priſoners defence,
there is but one thing, that hath any ſort of weight; for the
young Gentlevvoman talking of his being conſtantly at
home at eight of the Clock, is nothing, for ſhe ſays they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
go to Bed about nine a Clock, and they give no Anſwer
to this, but that it could not be done in their Houſe but they
muſt know of it; but doe not ſhow how that muſt needs be;
ſo that all their Evidence is ſlight, and anſwers it ſelf, or
elſe not poſſible to be true. All the Teſtimony that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
in this matter, is that which <hi>Berry</hi> produces; and
that is concerning the Sentinells who kept the Guard that
Wednesday Night the Body was carried out, and he ſays
there was no Sedan carried out. And although this Evidence
be produced but by one of them, yet 'tis to the Benefit of
them all three; for if it were certain and infallibly true, that
the Sentinells did ſo watch at the Gate, that no Mortal could
go out of the place; and if the darkneſs of the Night might
not hinder him from ſeeing what might go out; or that Mr.
<hi>Berrys</hi> Voice being known to him, he might not call to him,
and ſo Mr. <hi>Berry</hi> might open the Gate without any great
Caution, or more particular Obſervation by the Sentinel, ſo
that this might eſcape his obſervation or remembrance, and
yet that the Sentinel be an honeſt Man and ſpeak true as he
thinks to his beſt remembrance, which <hi>I</hi> leave to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.
But there is one thing the other Sentinel tells
you, that about eight or nine a Clock (for he went off at
tenn) there was a Sedan brought in, and he did not ſee it go
out; and ſo ſays he that watched from tenn to one, and this is
the only thing which hath any Color in it, in behalf
of the Priſoners. But he that ſays there was no body went
out, ſays alſo that he never ſaw the Sedan; but the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
that was relieved, ſays; that he ſaw it go in. Now how
far that ſingle Teſtimony of <hi>Nicolas Wright</hi> the Sentinel will
weigh, who ſays that none went out, I leave with you,
which may be miſtaken either by reaſon of the darkneſs of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41250:44"/>
the Night, or thoſe other Particulars I have obſerv'd to
you.</p>
                  <p>But this is all that can overthrow the whole series of
the Evidence that hath been given by Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> upon
whom I find not the leaſt reflection, except you will call
that one, which to me as it is circumſtanced, is rather an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for him then againſt him, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> his going off from what
he ſaid. And what <hi>Sr. Robert Southwel</hi> ſays is regardable, that
when he ſhewed them the Place where he was ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
the Houſe to which he was firſt carried, he did it very
readily and confidently, but was puzled to find out the
Room where he was removed, when he ſaw him by the dark
Lanthorn, and would not poſſitively aſſert where it was,
which ſhews the integrity of the Man, who would elſe have
gone through without bogling; for if all were a Ly, why
ſhould he ſtick at one thing more then another, but have
ſhewn ſome Room or other? but when he was confident,
he appeared ſo, and when he was doubtful he appeared ſo,
and ſo ſhewed himſelf an honeſt Man.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the particular matters, and as near as I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
all that hath been materially offered for the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
againſt the Kings Evidence. For the Teſtimony of the
Landlord <hi>Warrier</hi> and his Wife, it is plainly ſpoken of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
time, for it was the Saturday after the Thurſday he
was found, the 19<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October.</hi> So that they ſpeak nothing
but what is true, and yet nothing to the Purpoſe; for the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
is of that which was done the 12<hi>th,</hi> but they ſpeak of a
time when the Tragedy was paſſed, ſo that there is only the
ſingle Evidence of one Witneſs, the Sentinel, which muſt be
oppoſed to all the concurring Evidence given againſt them.</p>

               <sp>

                  <p>That is nothing, for we ſpeak only of this Gate,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41250:44"/>
the great Gate, but I will tell you what there is that does
not ariſe from theſe Witneſſes, but from the nature of the
thing they were about, and the Perſons that tranſacted it, that
gives credit to the Teſtimonys of the Witneſſes, ſo as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
any one to believe them, as things ſtand at this day in
reference to the known deſign of the Prieſts to ſubvert our
Religion, for they muſt juſtify one ill by another, and the
miſchiefs they have done will not be ſafe, unleſs they do
more.</p>
                  <p>And for the Prieſts being the Preachers of Murder, and
your ſin, that' tis Charity to kill any man that ſtands in their
way. Their Doctrine will make you eaſily believe their
Practice, and their Practice proves their Doctrine; ſuch cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
as theſe we have not known in <hi>England</hi> till it was brought
out of their Catholick Countrys; what belongs to ſecret
Stranglings and Poyſonings, are ſtrange to us, though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in <hi>Italy.</hi> But now your Prieſts are come hither to be the
Popes Bravo and to Murther Men for the honor of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and as they are Inhumane, ſo they are Unmanly too: for
Sr. <hi>Edmondbury Godfry</hi> had not been afraid of two or three
of your Prieſts, if they would have dealt fairely with him.</p>

                  <p>You muſt ſay and believe as your Prieſt will
have you, and in ſuch actions as theſe, as your Prieſts ſuggeſt
to you, ſo does the Devil to your prieſts; If you are upon
the matter neceſſitated to what they will have you think;
for though your Prieſts Preach up freedom of Will, yet
they allow none to the underſtanding. They hold you may
do good or evil, but will not ſuffer you to underſtand right
and wrong, for you cannot be perfectly theirs, if you have
any thing of your own to guide your ſelves by.</p>
                  <p>I know that every body of that party is apt to ſay their
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41250:45"/>
Prieſts own no ſuch thing, but it is notoriouſly known to
all the World that they both Print it and Practiſe it. What
ſhall any of you diſpute the Power of a Pope ſaith a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite,
or of a Pope and a Council ſay the moſt moderate
Prieſts? Have you power to ſay how far you will be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt
and how far not? you may as well bound the Sea,
and bid it go thus far and no farther, as limit the Popes
Authority. I wonder any Man ſhould be of that Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and yet keep his Reaſon, much leſs turn from our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to theirs, if he conſiders how they impoſe, and what
Miſchiefs and Blood you are involved in, by your Prieſts
that have Allarmed the Nation. For I will affirm, the
greateſt miſchief the Papiſts have received, come from their
Prieſts, who have ſuch unworthy and unmanly ways of
ſetting up their Religion: What do they think it an Act
of Charity to kill men, or is the Chriſtian Religion or yours,
to be promoted by ſuch means as theſe? No Gentlemen,
'tis the fault of your Doctrine, and 'tis a monſtrous miſtake
in you, if you think that you have any power of your own,
whilſt you continue in their perſvvaſion.</p>
                  <p>I know ſome will aſcribe all to Conſcience that guides
them, and that even theſe miſchiefs are but the effects
of their Religious obedience; but they are indeed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of the blindneſs of their obedience. I wonder
how any Man can have the Face thus to diſorder a whole
Nation, and yet pretend Conſcience for it. Let no Man
tell me, Oh! Sir, We deſire none of theſe Miſchiefs you
talk of: What, not if Religion requires it, or if the Pope
ſays it does? Hath not the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> decreed,
that every Popiſh Prince ought to root out Heresie upon
pain of Damnation? You muſt: can you go and tell the
Pope how far you will believe, or what you ought to do?
You may as well tell me that if he vvere once with us, and
had the Power he once had, he would leave us to our ſelves,
and that if he had the ſame Ability, he would not have the
ſame Tyranny.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:41250:45"/>
And therefore all the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholik Gentlemen in <hi>England</hi>
would do very well to conſider, how much it concerns Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
not to give offence; And if they cannot at this time live in a
Proteſtant Kingdom with ſecurity to their Neighbours, but cauſe
ſuch fears and dangers, and that for Conſcience ſake, let them keep
their Conſciences, but leave the Kingdom. If they ſay, why
ſhould not we ſtay here while we do no miſchief; alas that's not
in your power. You cannot be quiet in your own Religion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
you diſturb ours; and therefore, if to ſhew your Conſciences,
you acquit the Country, and let the inconveniencies light on your
ſelves only, I ſhould then think you had Zeal, though not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Knowledge; and not aſcribe it to any Plot, but to the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicities
of underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>But in ſhort, there is a monſtrous Evidence of the whole Plot
it ſelf by this fact; for we can aſcribe it to none, but ſuch ends as
theſe, that ſuch a man muſt be kill'd; for it muſt be either becauſe
he knew ſomething the Prieſts would not have him tell, or they
muſt do it in Defiance of Juſtice, and in terrour to all them that
dare execute it upon them; which carries a great Evidence in its
ſelf, and which I leave to your conſideration, having remembred
as well as I could, the proofs againſt them, and all that is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
for them. Add to this, the Condition that we are in at
this time, and the eagerneſs of the purſuit that theſe Prieſts make
to gain the Kingdom, that for my own part I muſt put it into my
Litany, <hi>That God would deliver me from the deluſion of Popery,
and the Tyranny of the Pope:</hi> for it is a Yoke which we who have
known Freedom cannot endure, and a Burden which none but that
Beaſt who was made for Burden, will bear. So I leave it to your
Conſideration upon the whole matter, whether the Evidence of
the Fact does not ſatisfie your Conſciences, that theſe men are
Guilty. And I know you will do like honeſt men on both
ſides.</p>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> J. Wyld.</speaker>
                  <p>But though I am of another Perſwaſion than you,
and know you have no Charity for me, yet I have Charity for you.
And if I ſhall ſay any thing, it is out of a zealous Affection I have
for your Souls; God knows, I ſpeak it upon no other grounds;
though the Offence be horrid, yet <hi>I</hi> commiſerate your perſons.</p>
                  <p>For the Nature of your Offence it is Murder; He that ſheds
mans blood, by Man ſhall his blood be ſhed; for in the Image of
God created he him. So ſaith God to <hi>Noah,</hi> intimating and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
thereby, That the intention of God Almighty in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of that Law, was the preſervation of mankind: and that he
will not admit or ſuffer his Image to be defaced or deſtroyed. If
it ſhall be accounted Treaſon againſt Earthly Princes to deface their
Images, is it not much more Treaſon againſt the great God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, to deface his Image, who is the King of Kings and
Lord of Lords. The Greatneſs of this Sin ſtruck ſuch a damp and
horrour upon the Soul of <hi>Cain,</hi> that it made him cry out, his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
was greater than he could bear, or, as our Bibles have it in
the Margin, his Iniquity was greater than could be forgiven; and
it ſhall come to paſs, that whoſoever meeteth me, ſhall ſlay me.
Being Conſcious to himſelf, that it was juſt and lawful, that
whoſoever did meet with him ſhould ſlay him. And God himſelf
doth ſet forth the hainouſneſs of this offence, when he tells him,
his Brothers blood cry'd to him, that is, cried unto God from the
Earth, for Vengeance. Blood it is of a crying nature, and will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ceaſe crying, till it find out the Man-ſlayer.</p>
                  <p>It is an Offence ſo hainous in the Eye of God, that he will not
endure it in a Beaſt; God ſaith, he will require it of a Beaſt. And
doth God require Blood of a Beaſt, a brutiſh Creature void of all
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41250:48"/>
Reaſon, and will he not require it much more of Man, whom he
hath endued with thoſe two great Faculties of Reaſon and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding?
And certainly if Murder in general be enquired after,
<hi>I</hi> may well ſay this of yours, there hath not been committed a more
impudent and barbarous Murder in this Civiliz'd Nation by one
Subject upon another. And obſerve how you did effect this Murder,
with baſeneſs enough. See the baſeneſs of it: As the Devil was
the Father of Lies, ſo he was a Murderer from the beginning; and
you firſt begun your Murder with an Helliſh ſtudied and premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
Lie. Knowing that this Gentleman was a perſon very vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in the Execution of his place, that would omit no Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of doing his Office; you pretend you have occaſion for him,
and by this means draw him into your ſnare; where what you do,
you do cowardly and baſely, firſt diſarm him, then fall all upon
him, and murder him; as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith of the ungodly
man, firſt gets the Righteous man in his Net, and then raviſheth him.</p>
                  <p>Had ſuch a thing as this been acted by us Proteſtants in any Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Country in the World, I doubt there would ſcarce have been
one of us left alive. They would not have taken this courſe that
hath been taken with you, to admit us to a fair Trial; no, they
would have made their own hands their Avengers: But God be
praiſed, we are of another Religion, and of another Perſwaſion.
We leave Vengeance to God, and under him to the Magiſtrate, who
beareth not the Sword in vain, as you now find.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>I</hi> could abſtract folly from wickedneſs, certainly it was one
of the greateſt pieces of folly and ſottiſhneſs in the world: For
what could be your end in it? Did you think that all the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
in <hi>England</hi> were lodged in Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey?</hi> that
if he were taken out of the way, there were not men of Spirit and
Courage, as faithful and diligent as he was? Trouble not your
ſelves, nor let thoſe of your Perſwaſion trouble themſelves, there
are a numerous Company of Magiſtrates in this Kingdom, that will
do the ſame thing, and act in, and execute their Offices with the
ſame Courage.</p>
                  <p>And as to the manner of the Murder, whom have you deſtroy'd?
A Magiſtrate; For what? For the Execution of his Office. One
that was a Conſervator of the Peace; and whoſe ſtudy it was to
preſerve you in Peace, on him you have violated the Peace, and
nothing leſs would ſatisfie you than his precious Life. An Affront
to the Law, to the Magiſtrate, to the King, to the Nation; yea to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41250:48"/>
God himſelf, upon whom an higher Affront could hardly have
been put. For the Magiſtrate is Gods Ordinance, God hath ſet him
up to avenge himſelf upon the wicked, and to reward the good;
and he doth not bear, as it is a ſign by you he hath not born, the
Sword in vain.</p>
                  <p>I might ſay much more concerning the hainouſneſs of this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
but had I the tongue of Men and Angels, <hi>I</hi> could not ſay
enough to ſet out the horrour of it. And now let me tell you, <hi>I</hi> do
not ſpeak this to inſult and domineer over you; <hi>I</hi> praiſe God <hi>I</hi> am
of another ſpirit; he knows <hi>I</hi> have another end in what <hi>I</hi> ſay, and
my end is meerly this, to perſwade you from the foulneſs of your
fact, to make a good uſe of it; that the horridneſs of your ſin, may
make the greater and deeper impreſſions on your Spirits; and ſo
make your repentance more ſincere and efficacious. Had you as
many years to live as you have hours, it were little enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
this horrid Offence. But on the other ſide, as that will be little
enough, yet let me give you this comfort, you have time enough,
if you make a good uſe of it, to make your peace with God.</p>
                  <p>Pray let me dehort you from one thing; and that is this, Do not
be of the Opinion of thoſe wicked miſcreants the Jeſuites, that have
put you upon this matter; for I have ſo much Charity for you as
to believe, they made it a matter of Religion to you, and juſtifiable
upon that account. Do not think ſo, for the Law of God is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible,
and no power under Heaven can Licenſe to murder. So that
though the Offence in them is abominable, yet in you 'tis an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
too, and an horrid one. And when you have conſider'd it
as ſuch, I then deſire you to take a right courſe to make your peace
with God: For you muſt paſs under another Judgment than that
of man, and that ſhortly you muſt ſtand before the Judge of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth. And therefore if by this means you can prevent
that future Judgment, you will have Juſt cauſe to thank God that
you had your puniſhment here on earth. Therefore let me adviſe
you to ſpend every minute you have left, in a free acknowledgment
of all your Offences: For certainly ſome ſin went before, or this
had never come after. One ſin dogs another, and makes way for
the Commiſſion of another.</p>
                  <p>And what muſt you rely upon? not upon any traſh or trompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
not upon any merit of your own, there is but one Saviour and
Mediatour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And I would adviſe you in the
words of that great Cardinal, one that was one of the greateſt men
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41250:49"/>
of your Religion, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> I mean, who, having made a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny,
which was the ſafeſt way for ſecuring Heaven, made the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
thus, <hi>To truſt Only upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for Life and
Salvation;</hi> which I adviſe you to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> have now done what <hi>I</hi> intended to ſay to you; and what <hi>I</hi> have
ſaid, <hi>I</hi> ſpoke to deliver my own Soul, and upon no other account.
<hi>I</hi> now pronounce the Judgment which the Law hath appointed to
paſs upon ſuch Malefactors; and that is this;</p>
                  <p>That you go from hence to the place from whence you came, and
from thence to the place of Execution, where you ſhall be ſeverally
hanged by the Neck, till you are ſeverally dead; and the Lord have
mercy upon your Souls.</p>
