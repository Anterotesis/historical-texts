            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen I conſider with my ſelf, how many Truths have (in their dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) gone forth like the Morning, &amp; are now riſen unto a glorious day, unto the amazement and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe, who were grand Oppoſers of them; (though I know truth hath, and ſtill ſhall have many Adverſaries; whilſt the face of the covering, and the vail ſpread o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all Nations remains undeſtroyed; yet I know too, that Truth's bare breſts are Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Prooff againſt all the daring darts of Satan, and all the furious attempts and ſtormes of the fleſh;) I cannot but abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly rejoyce in the glory of its ſtrength. How many things have in ſeveral Ages (as well as in Ours) been cryed up for truths? And how hath God blown upon them, that
<pb facs="tcp:103295:3"/>
they have withered, and the whirlewind hath taken them away as ſtubble? Again, how many Truths have been cryed downe as Blaſphemy and Errour, the beames of whoſe glory are now ready to dazzle and obſcure all the glory of the fleſh? Sometimes tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thoſe (through the goings forth of God in it.) who have been the mightieſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, inſomuch that (ſtanding amazed a while) they have ſoon been ſwallowed up in the power of it: And Oh that mine eyes might behold more of that day of Gods power, and of the out-lettings of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his holineſs; that the tall Cedars of <hi>Lebanon</hi> might be bended, and the Oakes of <hi>Baſhan</hi> aſhamed; that the creature and its glory might be brought low, and men who are now like bullocks unaccuſtomed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the yoak, might be made willing, and the Lord alone exalted in them, by them, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them.</p>
            <p>Did we but ſeriouſly conſider, how moſt men are adorned with living names <hi>(viz.</hi> of Believers, Chriſtians, Proteſtants, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> whilſt they are indeed dead, (as will appear, ſeeing there are no ſymptomes of life in them) we could not but ſtartle at it: what is the profeſſion, or Religion, of moſt part of men,
<pb facs="tcp:103295:3"/>
but formal and fleſhly? Are they not like thoſe barbarous <hi>Lettoes,</hi> who were alwaies in the fields and woods, heard uttering theſe words, <hi>Feru Feru Maſco Lon:</hi> but being demanded the reaſon, they replyed, <hi>That they knew nothing, but that they had been ſo of long taught by their Anceſtours.</hi> Mens mouths are now filled with Forms, and they are daily crying out, The Temple of the Lord. the Temple of the Lord; God, and Chriſt, and Spirit; when 'tis evident, they have no more then what Education affords, nay leſſe, becauſe not moralized; wherein Heathens out-ſtript them: they know not God, did they, they could not lightly Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme him; they go Chriſtleſs, and have not received the Spirit of wiſdome in the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and knowledge of him; and this makes them to cry out that whatſoever is not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their fleſhly Forms, is Errour, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Blaſphemy, becauſe it will not hold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to carnal principals, unto which they muſt needs reduce all things, who have no principal of life within them; ſuch are thoſe who are called Chriſtians, and yet reel to and fro through wine and ſtrong drink, and ſwell by reaſon of Oathes, living in abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; of which ſort of men, moſt of our
<pb facs="tcp:103295:4"/>
Pariſh-Churches are conſtituted: ſuch men have not diſcerning ſpirits, neither are they competent judges, becauſe enemies to Truth, as well as Errour; wherefore the Author betakes himſelf to the Chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>i. e.</hi> one that is ſo indeed.</p>
            <p>I know many men (as well as my ſelf) will be ready to cry out. Blaſphemy, Blaſphemy, at the firſt view of the Title-Page; yet I could wiſh that they would imbrace the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles counſel, <hi>Prove all things, bolding faſt that which is good:</hi> Call all things to a ſerious examen, and reject nothing hand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-head, take nothing upon truſt, without a fore-examining of every circumſtance, leſt in the one, they ſhould reject truth in ſtead of errour; and in the other, embrace errour in ſtead of truth.</p>
            <p>The Author hath a long time waited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on learned men, for a ſatisfactory anſwer to theſe Arguments; but hath received none: his hopes are, that the publiſhing of them will be a means to produce it, that he may receive ſatisfaction, and others may be held no longer in ſuſpence, who are in travel with an earneſt expectation of a ſpeedy reſolution, as well as he. I ſhould deſire thoſe who view it, but eſpecially thoſe who undertake to
<pb facs="tcp:103295:4"/>
anſwer it (for my hopes are, that ſome one will) to conſider, firſt, that to ſay, Such an Argument is invalid, and weak, and not worth the Anſwering, is no convincing way of arguing, nor able to yield the leaſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to a doubting ſpirit. Secondly, that invectives, railings, or reproachful terms, are no convincing Arguments (as all men of a ſober judgement well know;) at theſe rates the weakeſt man may ſubvert the ſtrongeſt Controverſie: yet theſe have been the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our times, both in Preſs and Pulpit. Thirdly, to prohibit the progreſs of it can no wayes unſcruple doubting ſpirits, amongſt whom (for the preſent) I number my ſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting an Anſwer to theſe enſuing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and that God will be with him that undertaketh it, and give in a ſpirit of meekneſs, and of wiſdome, in the revelation and knowledg of truth, ſhall be the matter of his prayers, who deſires truth may be cleared up, and ſhine like the noon-day, and all error confounded, and vaniſh before truth, like a miſt before the Sun.</p>

For that this onely is the matter in conteſtation, you very well know, having both heard my confeſſion before the Committee, and remembring how when I was urged to declare my judgement concerning the Deity of Chriſt, I waved the queſtion, as neither being that I was accuſed of, nor which I had yet ſufficiently ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed, to engage my ſelf publickly therein. As for my opinion touching the Holy Spirit, it is thus:

               <p>The Major is evident: for if he ſhould be both God, and diſtinguiſhed from God, he would be diſtinguiſhed from himſelf; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth a contradiction.

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let any man here think to flie to that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant refuge of making a diſtinction between the Eſſence and Perſon of God, ſaying that the holy Spirit is diſtinguiſhed from God, taken Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, not Eſſentially: For this wretched diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (to omit the mention of the Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) is not onely unheard-of in Scripture, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103295:10"/>
ſo to be rejected, it being preſumption to affirm any thing of the unſearchable nature of God, which he hath not firſt affirmed of himſelf in the Scripture; but is alſo diſclaimed by Reaſon. For firſt, it is impoſſible for any man, if he would but endeavour to conceive the thing, and not delude both himſelf and others with empty terms, and words without underſtanding, to diſtinguiſh the Perſon from the Eſſence of God, and not to frame two beings or things in his minde, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently two Gods. Secondly, If the perſon be diſtinct from the Eſſence of God, then it muſt needs be <hi>ſomething;</hi> ſince <hi>nothing</hi> hath no acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and therefore neither can it happen to it to be diſtinguiſhed. If ſomething, then either ſome finite or infinite thing: if finite, then there will be ſomething finite in God, and conſequently, ſince by the confeſſion of the adverſaries every thing in God is God himſelf, God will be finite; which the adverſaries themſelves will likewiſe confeſs to be abſurd. If infinite, then there will be two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finites in God, to wit, the Perſon and Eſſence of God, and conſequently two Gods; which is more abſurd then the former. Thirdly, to talk of God taken imperſonally, is ridiculous, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no example thereof in Scripture, but becauſe God is the name of a <note n="*" place="margin">By Perſon, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, as Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phersdo, <hi>ſuppoſitum intelligens,</hi> that is an intellectual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance compleat, and not a mood or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtſtence, which are fantaſtical &amp; ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs terms, brought in to cozen the ſimple.</note> Perſon, and ſignifieth him that hath ſublime domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or power: and when it is put for the moſt high God, it denoteth him who with So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign and abſolute autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ruleth over all; but none but a perſon can rule

The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is undeniable. For further confirmation

Holy Spirit improperly: For let him turn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf every way, and ſcrue the words as he pleaſes, yet ſhall he never be able to make it out to a wiſe and conſidering man, how it can poſſibly be ſaid, that any one heareth from another what he will ſpeak, who is the prime Author of his ſpeech, and into whom it is not at a certain time inſinuated by another. For this expreſſion plainly intimateth, that whatſoever the Holy Spirit ſpeaketh to the Diſciples, is firſt diſcovered and committed to him by Chriſt, whoſe Embaſſadour he is, it being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to an Embaſſador to be the Interpreter nor of his own, but of anothers will.

The antecedent is plain by <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 35, 36. The conſequence is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable: for if God ſhould give all things to all, and yet recieve of anothers, he would both give all things, and not give all things; have all things of his owne, and have ſomething of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; both which imply a contradiction.

The <hi>Minor</hi> is confirmed by <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> where the divine Author ſheweth, that the Angels are all Miniſtring Spirits, in that they are ſent forth; as he before intimateth Chriſt to be Lord, becauſe he ſitteth at the right hand of God. Thus <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 2. declareth the Soveraignty of God, in ſaying that he ſitteth in Heaven. The <hi>Minor</hi> is further proved thus:</p>
               <p>He that receiveth a command for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of ſomething, doth Miniſter:</p>
               <p>He that is ſent forth, receiveth a command for the performance of ſomething:</p>

               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is evident to common ſence, ſince it ſuiteth with none but Miniſters and inferiours to receive commands.

of Chriſt, unleſs, having firſt proved that Chriſt is ſupream God, he will grant that whatſoever is ſpoken of him, is ſpoken of him as God; or can make good that to be ſent at leaſt may agree to him as God.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is plain by <hi>Acts.</hi> 12. 17. <hi>Foraſmuch then as God gave them the like gift</hi> (meaning the Spirit) <hi>as he did unto us, who have believed on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, was I one that could withſtand God?</hi> The <hi>Major,</hi> though of it ſelf ſufficiently clear, is yet further evidenced thus:</p>
               <p>He that is not the giver of all things, is not God.</p>
               <p>He that is the gift of God, is not the giver of all things:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is apparent from <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 25. <hi>God giveth to all, life, breath, and all things.]</hi> The <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> is proved thus:</p>
               <p>He that is himſelf given, is not the giver of all things:</p>
               <p>He that is the gift of God, is himſelf given:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is undeniable, for otherwiſe the ſame would be the giver of all things, and yet not the giver of all things, inaſmuch as he himſelf, a principal thing, is given, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth a contradiction. The <hi>Minor</hi> needeth no
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103295:13"/>
proof. Moreover, a gift is in the power, and at the diſpoſal of the giver; but it is groſs and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to imagine that God can be in the power, or at the diſpoſal of another. Neither let any man here think to evade, by ſaying, that not the Holy Spirit himſelf, but onely his gifts are imparted to men; Since both the more learned adverſaries themſelves confeſs, that the Perſon of the Holy Spirit is given together with his gifts, and the Scripture putteth the matter out of doubt, if you conſult <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 20. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5. In both which places, the Holy Spirit is ſaid to be given contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinctly from his gifts and operations: in the firſt, contradiſtinctly from the inſtruction flowing from him; in the other, contradiſtinctly from the love of God diffuſed in our hearts by him. Whence we may draw this Corollary, that if the Perſon of the Holy Spirit be out of favour given to certain men, as the aforeſaid places teſtifie, then he was not perſonally preſent with them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and conſequently, by the conceſſion of the adverſaries themſelves, cannot be God, ſince they will not deny that God is always perſonally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with all alike. But I foreſtal the following Argument.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Major is plain: for if God ſhould change place, he would ceaſe to be where he was before, and begin to be where he was not before; which everteth his Omnipreſence, and conſequently, by the confeſſion of the adverſaries themſelves,

               <p>The Minor is evident from <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13, 14, 15. The Major is confirmed thus:</p>
               <p>He that is taught of God, hath an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtinct from that of God.</p>
               <p>He that heareth from God what he ſhall ſpeak, is taught of God:</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Minor is manifeſt from <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. where our Saviour Chriſt having ſaid, in verſ. 26. <hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have heard from him</hi> (the Father) <hi>theſe things I ſpeak.]</hi> In verſ. 28. he expreſſeth the ſame ſence thus: <hi>[According as the Father hath taught me, theſe things I ſpeak.]</hi> The Major is of it ſelf clear: for he that is taught, hath an unknowing underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſince none can be taught what he knoweth already; and he that teacheth, hath a knowing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, otherwiſe he could not teach another ſomething; but it implieth a contradiction, that the ſame underſtanding ſhould at the ſame time be both knowing &amp; unknowing of the ſame thing.

               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is plain: for conformity muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween twain at leaſt, elſe it will not be conformity, but Identity.

Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himſelf maketh interceſſion for us, with grones unutterable: But he that ſearcheth the hearts, knoweth the minde of the Spirit; for he maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for the Saints, according to the will of God.</hi> Neither let any man here reply, that there is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103295:16"/>
no mention made in the Greek either of the will of the Spirit, or of the will of God: For firſt, the word <hi>intercede,</hi> which ſignifieth to make ſuit for ſomething, implyeth both the will of him that maketh the ſuit, for if he did not will the thing, he would not make ſuit for it; and alſo the will of him to whom the ſuit is made, for were he not endued with a will, it would be bootleſs to make ſuit unto him, all ſuits whatſoever being made to bend the will of him to whom they are made: ſo that this, without any more, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſheweth that the Holy Spirit hath a will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct in number from that of God; ſince the one ſueth, the other is ſued to at the ſame time, and for the ſame thing. Secondly, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in Engliſh rendred Mind, doth here ſignifie the ſame with Will or Deſire, as appeareth from the 6. and 7. verſes of this Chapter, and alſo from the verb <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>according to God,</hi> yet is this, in the judgement of the Engliſh Tranſlators themſelves, the ſame as if it had been ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But this paſſage of the Apoſtle, doth further afford us a ſecond and third impregnable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Holy Spirit's being inferiour to God. For firſt, he is here ſaid <hi>to make interceſſion for us</hi> (as we before urged his praying to Chriſt, <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> 9.) and that <hi>with grones unutterable;</hi> which is not ſo to be underſtood, as if the Holy Spirit were here ſaid to help our infirmities, onely by

ſuggeſting petitions and groanes unto us (as is <hi>commonly,</hi> but <hi>falſly</hi> affirmed) for the very words of the context ſufficiently exclude ſuch a gloſs; ſince they ſay, <hi>that the Spirit himſelf,</hi> not <hi>we by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> (as we have it in the 15. verſe of the ſame chapter) <hi>maketh interceſſion for us:</hi> yea, <hi>vicarious interceſſion,</hi> as the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifieth: But to help others infirmities, <hi>by making interceſſion;</hi> and, what is more, <hi>vicarious interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for them,</hi> is not to inſtil petitions into them, but to pour out petitions apart in their behalf; as is apparent both from the thing is ſelf; ſince none can intercede for himſelf, all interceſſion (at leaſt ſuch as is here ſpoken of) requiring the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſe of a third perſon; and by the Collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of verſe 34. of the ſame Chapter, and 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 1. Heb.</hi> 7. 25. Neither let any man think to baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle off this place, (which is written with a beam of the Sun, and hath together with that, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13, 14. quite nonpluſſed, not onely Modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, but the Fathers themſelves,) by ſaying, that this is improperly ſpoken of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: for, beſides that he hath no other ground to ſay ſo, but his own preconceived opinion touching the Deity of the Holy Spirit, he ought to know that the Scripture, though it ſpeaketh ſome things of God in a figure, and improperly, yet doth it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſay any thing that argueth his inferiority <hi>to,</hi> and dependance <hi>on</hi> another. But this paſſage of the Apoſtle plainly intimateth, that the Holy Spirit is inferiour to God, and dependent on him; otherwiſe what need had he to make interceſſion to God, and that with grones unutterable, for the Saints? Secondly, the Holy Spirit is here diſtinguiſhed from <hi>him that ſearcheth the hearts;</hi> and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103295:17"/>
this deſcription is made uſe of to put a difference between God and the Holy Spirit: but how could this be done, were the holy Spirit alſo a ſearcher of the hearts? For can a deſcription that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, yea alike common to twain (for ſo the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries hold concerning God, and the Holy Spirit) be ſet to diſtinguiſh the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? For inſtance; <hi>to prepare the Paſſover for Chriſt,</hi> is an action common to <hi>Peter</hi> with <hi>John,</hi> for they twain were ſent by Chriſt to that purpoſe, and did accordingly perform it; ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 8, 13. wherefore can a deſcription taken from this action, be fit to difference <hi>Peter</hi> from <hi>John?</hi> and is it ſuitable to ſay, <hi>He that prepared the Paſſeover for Chriſt, was a greater Apoſtle then John?</hi> would not this plainly argue, that <hi>John</hi> did not prepare the Paſſeover for Chriſt? So that it is apparent, that the Holy Spirit is not a ſearcher of the hearts. If therefore it would not follow that the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is God, although it had been ſaid in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that he ſearcheth the hearts, unleſs he had ſuch a faculty originally, and of himſelf (for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinders but that God may confer it upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as we ſee by the Scripture, that he hath <hi>de facto</hi> conferred it on Chriſt, <hi>having given him all judgement,</hi> and that <hi>becauſe he is the Son of man,</hi> John 5. 22, 27. for ſuch judgement requireth that he be a ſearcher of the hearts) If, I ſay, it would not even then follow that he is God; how clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how irrefragably doth it on the contrary fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that he is not God, but hath an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtinct <hi>from,</hi> and inferiour <hi>to</hi> that of God; inaſmuch as he is diſtitute of ſuch a perfection, as the ſearching of the hearts, which is inſeparable from the divine majeſty?

inſtrument whereby they guide, govern, ſanctifie, and endow the Church; and to intimate, that whereas men, before they gave their names to Chriſt, lived according to the Prince of this world, the unclean Spirit, that worketh in the Children of diſobedience; they ought henceforth, being ſequeſtred from the world, and admitted into the Church, to reſign up themſelves to the guidance of the Holy Spirit, whom God and Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, and ſend to order and direct the Church. Neither can it be rightly inferned, that becauſe the Holy Spirit is here ranked with the Father and the Son, therefore he is equal to them: by this account, when the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 21. ſaith, <hi>I charge thee</hi> (Gr. I obteſt) <hi>before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the elect Angels, that thou ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality:</hi> joyning the elect Angels with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, in ſo great a matter as obteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to excite an Evangeliſt to do his duty with ſincerity; this would imply, that the elect Angels are equal to the Father and the Son. Nor doth it follow, that becauſe it is ſaid, not <hi>into the names,</hi> but <hi>into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;</hi> therefore they three have but one Name, power, or dignity; ſince by the like reaſoning I might argue, that becauſe Chriſt, Luke 9. 26. ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me and of my words, of him ſhall the Son of man be aſhamed, when he ſhall come in the glory of himſelf,</hi> (ſo it is in the Greek) <hi>and of the Father, and of the Holy Angels;</hi> therefore the Father, the Son, and the Holy Angels, have but one and the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame glory. For that the Holy Spirit is not rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Father, and the Son, as being equal
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103295:18"/>
to them, is evident by other punctual places of the Scripture, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6. where when the mention of him is joyned with that of the Father and of the Son, he is expreſly, and emphatically excluded from being either <hi>that one God, or that one Lord</hi> of Chriſtians, by being contradiſtinguiſhed from both: but if he be neither <hi>that one God,</hi> nor <hi>that one Lord of Chriſtians;</hi> as the Apoſtle, not onely in the fore-quoted places, but elſewhere alſo plainly teſtifieth; ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5, 6. <hi>Yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all the things, and we for him. And one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all the things, and we by him:</hi> he cannot be equal to the Father and the Son, but is onely the chiefe Miniſter of both, peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent out to Miniſter on their behalf that ſhall inherit ſalvation.</p>

For God the Father maketh no diſcovery of himſelf to the world im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; and Chriſt, to prove his Authority and Miſſion from God, appealeth to the works which he did by the finger of God, the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 20. compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 28.

            <p>AFter I had thorowly ſifted this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, I found that the Adverſaries, who ſo much cry down Reaſon, ſaying that we muſt renounce it when we ſpeak of Divine Myſteries, and ſimply reſt in the words of the Scripture, do notwithſtanding in the upſhot wave the Scripture, as giving a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain teſtimony to their doctrine in this point, and ground themſelves on the meer conjectures of their own Reaſon. For thus they argue: The holy Spirit, if he were not omnipreſent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently God, could not inſpire and dwell in ſo many men at one time. For anſwer hereunto, I will onely ask them one Queſtion, which if they reſolve, I will then tell them how the holy Spirit, though he be not omnipreſent, may inſpire all the faithful in the world at one time. Our Saviour, in the fourth of <hi>Mark,</hi> explaining the Parable of the ſower, ſaith, in verſ. 15. <hi>[And theſe are they by the way ſide, where the word is ſown: but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh the word that was ſown in their hearts.]</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe now that the ſeed of the Word be ſown in

ten thouſand places at one time, as it happeneth on every Lords day, How can Satan, whom the Adverſaries will deny to be omnipreſent, come and immediately ſnatch the Word out of the hearts of the greateſt part of the hearers? The ſame Reſolution that they ſhall give to this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, will I apply to their own Objection. If this be not ſufficient, take yet more proofs, that may ſeem to evince the omnipreſence of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſpirit. Thus is he ſaid <hi>to have been a lying ſpirit in the mouth of four hundred falſe prophets,</hi> 1 King. 22. 22, 23. (and there is the ſame reaſon between four hundred, and four millions.) Thus is he ſaid <hi>to hold the impenitent</hi> (who make the greateſt part of mankinde) <hi>in his ſnare,</hi> and <hi>to take them captive at his will,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. ult. <hi>To blinde the mindes of them that believe not,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 4. <hi>To dwell in the ungodly,</hi> Rev. 2. 13. <hi>To ſhew the wicked whatſoever they practiſe,</hi> Joh. 8. 38. Yea, <hi>to deceive the whole world,</hi> Rev. 12. 9. &amp; 20. 2, 3. If they dare not, for all this, to affirm the unclean ſpirit to be omnipreſent, Why do they on leſs ground conclude the omnipreſence of the holy Spirit, eſpecially when the Scripture ſo plainly teſtifieth that he changeth place, as <hi>Joh. 15. 26. But when the Advocate is come, whom I will ſend you from the Father, the Spirit of Truth which proceedeth</hi> (or, <hi>goeth out) from the Father, he ſhall teſtifie of me.</hi> How could the holy Spirit <hi>be ſent,</hi> and <hi>go out from the Father to the diſciples,</hi> if he were already with them, and could not but ſtay with the Father? <hi>Gal. 4. 6. Becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent out the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> This ſheweth that the Spirit was not in their hearts before, otherwiſe he needed not <hi>to be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103295:25"/>
ſent out into them.</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 12. <hi>The things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the Goſpel unto you with the holy Spirit ſent down from heaven.</hi> Could the holy Spirit be ſent down from heaven, if he were already upon the earth, and continued ſtill in heaven? For, that the coming of the holy Spirit down from heaven is properly to be taken, appeareth by the very ſight, in that <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt <hi>did ſee the Spirit deſcending from heaven in a bodily ſhape like a dove, and he abode on Chriſt, Joh.</hi> 1. 32. compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 21, 22. where the words of the Scripture are diligently to be heeded; for it is not ſaid, that <hi>the bodily ſhape did deſcend,</hi> but <hi>the Spirit in the ſhape:</hi> ſo that the deſcent did primarily and by it ſelf agree to the holy Spirit; but in a ſecondary way, and by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to the ſhape which he had aſſumed. Now is it poſſible to deſcend out of heaven to the earth, and not change place? Or is there any thing better then an ocular demonſtration to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince a change of place? Certainly, if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, and much more which may be alleadged, it is yet true that the holy Spirit doth not go from place to place; what aſſurance can I have, when the Scripture ſaith of any one whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, <hi>that he is ſent,</hi> or <hi>cometh down,</hi> or <hi>goeth out,</hi> that he moveth from one place to another, and doth not abide where he was before? Neither is it rightly done by the Adverſaries, when againſt ſo many evident Scriptures they alleadge one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure paſſage, <hi>Pſal. 139. 7, 8. Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit? or whither ſhall I flee from thy preſence? If I aſcend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold thou art there.</hi> For, to omit that the Pſalmiſt, as the precedent and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103295:25"/>
words, yea the paſſage it ſelf cited at large doth ſhew, intendeth onely to prove the omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God himſelf, and not of his Spirit; and that divers of the very Adverſaries, as namely the Divines of the Aſſembly in their Annotations on this place, do by <hi>Spirit</hi> here underſtand the <hi>knowledge</hi> or <hi>power</hi> of God, and not the holy Spirit: ſhould it be granted that theſewords, <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit?</hi> are meant of the holy Spirit, yet do they import no more, then that <hi>David</hi> could go into no place; but the Spirit could be there with him; and ſo ſign fie, not that he is in all places at one time, but can be in them at ſeveral times, accordingly as <hi>David</hi> ſhould come into them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſhould it be further granted, (what the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries are not able to evince) that <hi>Davids</hi> meaning is, that he could go into no place where the Spirit was not preſent; yet would not this preſently argue, that he was there preſent in his perſon or ſubſtance (as the Adverſaries conceive, when they ſay that he is Omnipreſent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God) ſince it is ſufficient for the truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that he is in every place by his knowledge, ſo that a man can be in no place whatſoever, but the holy Spirit will know where he is. This Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſence, which I verily believe belongeth to the holy Spirit, doth not hinder him to go from one place to another. Yea, whoſoever diligently look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into <hi>Davids</hi> words, ſhall finde that he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Pſalm to aſſert no other Omnipreſence to God himſelf, then that of knowledge and power. For he openly ſpeaketh of the knowledge of God in the firſt ſix verſes, ſaying in the ſecond of them, <hi>Thou underſtandeſt my thoughts afar off.</hi> Which implyeth that the perſon or ſubſtance of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103295:26"/>
God himſelf was not upon the earth with <hi>David,</hi> otherwiſe he would underſtand <hi>David's</hi> thought neer at hand, and not afar off. But in the tenth verſe, which is an explication of the three prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ones, he ſpeaketh of the hand of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is wont to be underſtood his power. Afterwards, verſ. 11. and 12. he returneth to the knowledge of God, whereof he had before ſpoken. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the main current of the Scripture runneth that way, and plainly intimateth, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or ſubſtance, or ſhape of God (I ſpeak the language of the Scripture; ſee <hi>Job 13. 7. Will ye accept his (God's) Perſon? will ye contend for God?</hi> Heb. 1. 3. <hi>Who being the brightneſs of his</hi> (God's) <hi>Glory, and expreſs Image of his perſon</hi> (Gr. <hi>ſubſtance)</hi> John 5. 37. <hi>And the Father himſelf which hath ſent me, hath born witneſs of me. Ye have neither heard this voice at any time, nor ſeen his ſhape:)</hi> is nowhere elſe but in Heaven. Neither let the Adverſaries reply, that if I aſcribe an univerſal knowledge of humane affairs to the holy Spirit, this very thing will evince him to be God. For firſt, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready excepted the ſearching of the heart, proving in the twelfth Argument that it agreeth not to the holy Spirit. Secondly, had the holy Spirit an Univerſal knowledge, as of other things, ſo alſo of the heart, yet would not this prove him to be God, unleſs he had this knowledge originally and of himſelf. For it is apparent from the Scripture, <hi>John</hi> 5. 22. that God hath given all judgement unto Chriſt, and conſequently all knowledge, without which that judgement cannot be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. But if he hath given all knowledge unto Chriſt, he can as well give it to the holy Spirit: Wherefore, let the Adverſaries, when they are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103295:26"/>
from their opinion by that invincible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from the Interceſſion which the holy Spirit is ſaid to make for the Saints, ceaſe to take up the ſame weapon, and contend, that the holy Spirit, inaſmuch as he maketh interceſſion for the Saints, muſt needs know all their wants, and ſo be God. For is not Chriſt alſo ſaid to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for the Saints? and doth he not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede with God as a man, and ſo as a man know all their wants? But if Chriſt, as a man, and ſo as a Creature, maketh interceſſion unto God for the Saints, and knoweth all their wants, why not the holy Spirit alſo, though he be a created Spirit, and not God?</p>
            <p>As for the dwelling of the holy Spirit in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons, though I might forbear to ſhew in what manner this is done, untill the Adverſaries had anſwered my Querie, yet will I (for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of ſuch as are ſtudious of the truth) here declare it. He dwelleth therefore in all the Saints diſperſed through the whole world, not in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or ſubſtance, for then his perſon or ſubſtance would fill the world, and dwell in all men a like, whereas the indwelling of the holy Spirit is by the Scripture made a peculiar priviledge of the Saints, <hi>Rom 8. 9. But ye are not in the fleſh, but in the Spirit, if ſo be (or for) the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> Wherefore he dwelleth in them by his Gifts, or Effects, (ſince no other dwelling can be imagined) which is an Expreſſion frequent in the writings of the Adverſaries themſelves, but that they are wont to forget it when they reaſon about the Godhead of the holy Spirit.</p>
