            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Abrief <hi>MEMORIAL</hi> of what hath been done in former Times, concerning the Making and repairing of <hi>DOVER HARBOUR,</hi> and the preſent ſtate thereof.</head>
            <p>ALthough the firſt defence of <hi>Dover</hi> Harbour was a round Tower made by a private perſon, one <hi>John Clarke</hi> Prieſt, Maſter of the <hi>Maiſon de Dieu,</hi> about the year 1500, in which he made many Rings to faſten and moore Ships, and for the ſafety and pleaſantneſs of it was called, <hi>Little Paradiſe.</hi> Yet when the making a formal and regular Harbour came into conſideration, and that it was the opinion of all skilful Mariners of that time, that a mean Harbour at <hi>Dover</hi> would be more beneficial than an excellent Harbour in any place elſe about the Coaſt of <hi>England:</hi> Sir <hi>John Thomſon,</hi> Parſon of St. <hi>James</hi> in <hi>Dover,</hi> ſtirred up the Townſmen to entertain the project of obtaining a Harbour, and repreſent the deſign to King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> who unanimouſly joyning together, did imploy the ſaid Sir <hi>John Thompſon</hi> to the King for that purpoſe, allowing him for his ſupport in his addreſſes, and following the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, 4. <hi>

               </hi> — 10 <hi>
                  <abbr>s.</abbr>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King liked the deſign ſo well, that he forthwith ordered 500 <hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr>
               </hi> out of his own Coffers to make a beginning of the work, and gave the Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the <hi>Maiſon de Dieu</hi> to Sir <hi>John Thomſon,</hi> an Hoſpital valued at 120 <hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr> per an.</hi> founded for relief of poor Souldiers from beyond Sea, fourteen days <hi>gratis</hi>) and appointed the ſaid Sir <hi>John Thompſon</hi> to be principal Surveyor of the Works, and under him four others to be Overſeers.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Thompſons</hi> deſign was to erect a Wall, which he called a Peere, from <hi>Hacliffe</hi> Chappel (being the South-weſt part of the Bay) directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Eaſt, about 131 Rods in length. But this Peere was not finiſhed, by 350 Foot ſo far as the Foundation was laid, (called the Mol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>-Head) conſiſting of great Rocks, brought from <hi>Hacliffe,</hi> the <hi>Caſtle Roy,</hi> and <hi>Folk-ſtone.</hi> This Peer was begun on St. <hi>Anns</hi> day, <hi>Anno</hi> 1533.</p>
            <p>A poor man one <hi>John Young,</hi> who firſt with a Nut-ſhel, then with an Egg-ſhel, and laſtly with a ſmall Veſſel, made proof what weight thoſe things could raiſe and bear in the water, firſt found out the carrying huge Stones of 20 Tuns apiece and more, by tying Iron Chains to them at low Water, and then buoying them up with empty Veſſels, and ſo dragging them up to the Peer where they were to ſink them, the Chalk and filling for the Peer being carried thither in great Boats, called a Gaboth, which had nine Keels. The King gave this man in reward of his invention, a Penſion for his Life of 4 <hi>
                  <abbr>d.</abbr> per diem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King ſpent 50 thouſand pounds upon the Works, and ſeveral times in perſon viewed them, often imploying the Counſel and direction of all skilful men in Water-works, both at home and abroad: But by reaſon of the Kings abſence at <hi>Bullen,</hi> his ſickneſs at his return, his Death, and Nonage of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> there was no Proviſion made for maintenance of the Works which had been done about the Peer. And they coming once in ſtate of decay, nothing was done towards it till Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, when for two years ſome matter was attempted, the Mayor of <hi>Dover</hi> and his Brethren having got licenſe under the Great Seal to gather monies throughout <hi>England;</hi> but the Workmen being ill paid, all was given over again.</p>
            <p>Before the end of the Work a South-Weſt wind brought a marvelous quantity of Beach and Boulder-ſtone, never ſeen before on that Coa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> that by this, and the Peer decaying through want of Proviſion for its ſupport and maintenance, and eſpecially by the poorer ſort diſorderly pulling the Timber and Iron of that in pieces, was not looked after; the Haven was ſo loſt, that a Boat drawing but four foot water could not enter into the mouth thereof.</p>
            <p>Thus the decay of the Haven at <hi>Dover,</hi> and the loſs of <hi>Calais,</hi> hapning both about one time, made ſuch an utter deſolation there, that of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> brave rich and populous Town, it became preſently a poor and deſolate Village: But ſtill there remained a ſtrong opinion in all men, for renewing the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in that place.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> therefore granted to the Town of <hi>Dover</hi> towards repairing their Harbour, free Tranſportation of 30000 quarters of Wheat, 10000 quarters of Barley and Mault, and 4000 Tun of Beer, free of Cuſtom and Impoſt; which Patent of the Queen was ſold to <hi>John Bird</hi> and <hi>Thomas Wats</hi> Merchants, at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <hi>per</hi> Tun, which Act was to continue for 7 years. By all which it is evident, how it hath been the immediate Care of the Kings and Queens of this Realm, and of the Parliaments thereof, to protect and preſerve this Harbour at <hi>Dover,</hi> tending ſo much to the Honour of the Crown, ſafety of the Nation, and advantage of Trade.</p>
            <p>For,
<list>
                  <item>1. It is ſeated on the Narrow, between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> ſo that Foreign Ambaſſadors, and other Great Perſonages, and Strangers do uſually Land there; where they find all good accommodations for their travel to <hi>London.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. It is the principal ſeat of all Juriſdiction within the Ports, the Courts of Admiralty and Chancery being conſtantly held here.</item>
                  <item>3. It is a great Store-houſe of Proviſions for his Majeſties Navy, there being in this Port one of his principal Victualling-Offices for the Fleets when they ſhall be at Sea: And in the late War was ſeen to be of great uſe and benefit to his Majeſties Service.</item>
                  <item>4. In time of War the Harbour of <hi>Dover</hi> is a great protection and ſafeguard to his Majeſties Ships of the lower Rate, when they find the Enemy too ſtrong for them at Sea: And a great advantage at other times, when they may take liberty to Cruiſe the Channel at pleaſure, and ſecure their Prizes in ſew hours; of which in the late War with <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>France</hi> there was ſufficient experience.</item>
                  <item>5. The Harbour of <hi>Dover</hi> being in its ſituation the chiefeſt Port in the Southern part of <hi>England,</hi> between <hi>Harwich</hi> and <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> is of great importance to the Ships of Merchants in time of Peace; where upon accident of a Leak or other dammage, they may preſently put in here, and be fitted for their intended Voyage.</item>
                  <item>6. The Cuſtoms of this Port have in times of Trade, before the late Civil Wars, (peculiar only to this Port) amounted to Fifty Thouſand pounds <hi>per annum.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>7. His Majeſties Frigats of the 4 or 5 Rates, and under, out of the Downs and Channel, may and have uſed to come into this Harbour, and there Victual, Waſh, and Tallow, and go to Sea again in few Tides.</item>
                  <item>8. This Port is and always hath been a great Nurſery for able Mariners, and a proper ſtation for Pilots to conduct Ships through all the Flats and Sands, either in his Majeſties Service, or Merchants.</item>
                  <item>9. That the moneys payable by the ſaid Act of the 14. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. was by the Act to be Collected by his Majeſties Officers of the Cuſtom-houſe, and by them to be paid to the Commiſſioners of <hi>Dover</hi> Harbour, who received only 9300 <hi>
                        <abbr>l.</abbr>
                     </hi> thereupon. Which not being ſufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the work, the ſaid Harbour is ſince much impaired, and by the many Storms that have lately hapned, the Sea hath gained much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. So that unleſs ſome ſpeedy Remedy be taken, not only the ſaid Harbour, but the whole Town is like to be loſt inevitably, to the Ruine of many hundred Families, and the Univerſal damage of the Nation.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore humbly recommended to the Wiſdom of the Parliament, to make ſuch proviſion for remedy thereof, as the neceſſity of the Work requires, and hath always been the care of former times.</p>
