            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>: you ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther find Senſe nor Reaſon in Animadverſions upon the Biſhops Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Paragraph contains a Conceſſion of the Cauſe in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie between the Biſhop and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> upon ſuppoſition it to be ſtated as Dr. <hi>Gunning</hi> and Dr. <hi>Pearſon</hi> do atteſt: yet is he much unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with many things of general concernment: as</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, That <hi>Kings and Biſhops are of ſuch inſeparable dependance, that they muſt needs ſtand and fall together; and all who are enemies to one, muſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108600:3"/>
needs be Enemies to the other.</hi> Nor was this paſſionately affirmed by the Biſhop: for if men may argue a <hi>posteriori,</hi> from the effect to find out the cauſe, or that men may take warning from others harms, then do I affirm that no where in the Chriſtian world, that ever Chriſtian men (if they be worthy to be called ſo) did ever caſt off their obedience to Epiſcopal Government, but when they acquired force proportionable to their will, they did, or did attempt to ſubvert the State Government ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in perſon or Specie; beſides in reaſon if men may arrogate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a licenciouſneſſe of caſting off their obedience to the Church, what then can reſtrain them to their obedience to the State? for it is the ſame Spirit which commands men to hear the Church, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Higher powers; and if this were not to the Church governed by Biſhops, I would deſire <hi>D. E.</hi> to ſhew any Church in <hi>Christ endome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Calvin</hi> otherwiſe governed; and certainly <hi>D. E.</hi> upon better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration cannot believe our Saviour to have with his blood eſtabliſhed a confuſed Church, to continue till his next coming again, without any Order or Government, eſpecially having the conſtant cuſtome of Chriſtianity to the contrary; and he that is poſſeſt, hath title good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, untill he be evicted by a better title or arguments than <hi>D. E.</hi> can find againſt this. How much <hi>D. E.</hi> is in his Judgement for the Order of Biſhops, will appear by and by in his ſecond Objection againſt the Biſhops aſſertion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>D. E,</hi> his firſt Argument againſt the Biſhops aſſertion is, that, <hi>It is clear from Story, that Kings were in all parts of the World, in their most flouriſhing state, defore ever Biſhops were heard of; and no reaſon can be given; why what hath once been, may not be with the ſame convenience again;</hi> a pretty convenient argument this is: why certainly <hi>D. E.</hi> is not ſo very a Heathen, as not to believe the Biſhop to be a Chriſtian, or that the Biſhop did not ſpeak to Chriſtians, or affirm this of a Chriſtian State? Why let <hi>D. E.</hi> ſhew that ever in the Chriſtian world, Epiſcopal Government was rejected, and yet Regal continued (unleſs in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when King <hi>James</hi> was a child, and made an Inſtrument to advance the Kirks ſeditious ends) and he ſays ſomething; unleſſe <hi>D. E.</hi> by his convenient argument would utterly aboliſh Chriſtianity from us, and introduce Paganiſm and Heatheniſm again amnog, which he very handſomely proſecutes in his next argument, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Biſhops, <hi>as they are eſtabliſhed by Law in</hi> England, <hi>are purely the Kings ſubordinate Miniſters in the management of Eccleſtaſtical affairs which his Majesty may conferr upon whae Order of men he pleaſes, though they be as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108600:3"/>
much Lay perſons at you or I am. It is therefore very injurious to the Kings Authority, to aver that he could not otherwayes uphold and maintain it, than by preſerving the undue, and as ſome think Antichriſtian Dignity and prelation of his inferiour Officers;</hi> So that one of theſe two conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do inevitably follow, either that Chriſt left no Epiſcopal Power and Miniſters in his Church, or elſe that by the Law eſtabliſhed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it and they are utterly ſuppreſſed; and the Biſhops in all acts of Preaching, Baptizing, Conſecrating, Ordaining &amp;c. are not Chriſts but purely the Kings Miniſters. And in truth I do not know any thing which hath rendred Chriſtianity, and all Chriſtian Religion, nay, and Gods taking our Nature upon him, to redeem and ſave mankind, ſo vile as this argument hath done. I deſire to be ſatisfied as a Chriſtian, to know what Chriſt hath eſtabliſhed, that does any way repugn my duty as a man which I ow my King. I am ſure he moſt certainly and poſitively commands all obedience to Kings and higher Powers. I am ſure the Adminiſtration of the Sacrament, the Preaching of Chriſt crucified, the Burial of the Dead, and conſecrating proper places for Gods Worſhip and Service, and Ordaining ſeparated perſons for ſuch purpoſes, no way hinders the Kings Supremany over all the perſons of his Subjects; even in theſe very caſes; but they are as much his Subjects, after ſuch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination as before. Nay I affirm, that in a Church planted; the free exerciſe of this power in all Kings Dominions, and all Glebes, and endowments whatſoever are Donations and Conceſſions from them, Nor was the practice of Chriſtians (when there was a Chriſtian Church and no Chriſtian State, though <hi>D. E.</hi> thinks it abſurd and inſignificant to diſtinguiſh them) ever better to Princes in their obedience than in the primitive times.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſhewed that the Biſhops, nor any thing ordained by our Saviour, is any ways injurious to the King. I deſire the Reader to take notice how much <hi>D. E.</hi> hath verified his Judgement for the Order of Biſhops, which makes it a meer Civil Sanction, and ſo hath not any dependence on, or creation by Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He ſayes, that Biſhops are of ſo little uſe to ſupport Regal Dignity (which is founded upon a diſtinct Baſis of its own) that upon enquiry it will be found, none have been greater enemies to it than ſome Biſhops;</hi> for want of argument to ſhew that Biſhops are no ſupport to Regal power, <hi>D. E.</hi> here only affirms againſt ſome Biſhops to have been Enemies to it; and I can tell <hi>D. E.</hi> of twenty times more Biſhops have been active &amp; ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for it; and ſo <hi>D. E.</hi> if he wil have the perſonal faults of particular men
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108600:4"/>
to make Epiſcopacy dangerous to Regality, will have above twenry to one againſt him, and therefore to advance it, it is therefore abſurdly done of him to charge <hi>Crimine ab uno Diſce omnes</hi> upon the Biſhop here, when as he himſelf hath nothing elſe to make good his excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For want of argument againſt the Biſhops aſſertion, that the Biſhop is the ſole Paſtor of all Congregations in his Dioceſs, <hi>D. E.</hi> is ſure he ſays (but it is only upon his own Authority, &amp; <hi>Gratis dictum)</hi> it can be defended by thoſe arguments which maintain the Popes ſupremacy, which is all one, as if <hi>D. E.</hi> ſhould be ſure that my going to Church, can only be maintained by thoſe arguments which are alleged to maintain Maſs; and therefore I ſhould never come there; and if he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood a little Logick, he would have found he had proved the Biſhops aſſertion by the practice of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> (though no Saints of his) which he brings againſt it; for to bid and command, is the Predicament of Relation to ſomething ſubject to it; and if <hi>Paul</hi> may bid the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> command his fellow Elders, then neceſſarily, muſt the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi>'s fellow Elders be ſubject to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> which is (I believe) as much as the Biſhop will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I commend <hi>D. E.</hi> that in his 3. objection he charges the Biſhop, page 3. that <hi>ſuch as come not in by the door, to be Thieves and Robbers ought to be understood of ſuch Miniſters as ſpeak to Congregations without the Biſhops Licenſe;</hi> whereas the Biſhop then only charges Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> not to come in by the door, but to be a Thief and Robber, becauſe he had not only robbed the Right-full Vicar of <hi>Kidderminſter</hi> of his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but of his means and maintenance, <hi>D. E.</hi> therefore does very well to ſet up a man of ſtraw this cold weather, and get himſelf heat by threſhing of it: but if <hi>D. E.</hi> be good at Addition, he is no leſs at Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, and therefore takes no notice of the Biſhops inſtance of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copper-ſmith, and <hi>Demas, Philetus,</hi> and <hi>H<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meneus,</hi> for <hi>D. E.</hi> his objection againſt preaching without a Licenſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ordination, <hi>becauſe it cannot be diſſolved, much leſs hindered in the free uſe, except for moral and notoriouſly vicious miſdemeanors:</hi> I grant that power indiſſoluble, becauſe a divine inſtitution; yet does it not therefore follow, that the exerciſe of it may not be ſuſpended upon abuſe of it. However <hi>D. E.</hi> puts the cart before the horſe, in affirming it impoſſible to be diſſolved, much leſs impeached, or hindred in the free uſe of it. For his 2. objection <hi>of being unreaſonable for one Miniſter of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108600:4"/>
the Goſpell to ſilence another, and the Biſhop to be no more.</hi> He himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore granted it in <hi>Paul</hi>'s bidding, and <hi>Peter</hi>'s commanding the Elders, and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> were but Miniſters of the Goſpell; and if <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> might bid and command, then might <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> forbid, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, for <hi>cujus eſt velle, ejus eſt nolle.</hi> But it is well here he allows the Biſhop to be a Miniſter of the Goſpell, and ſo Chriſts, whereas, page 2. he makes him purely the Kings. And now let me tell <hi>D. E.</hi> that the Judges of Aſſize are fellow ſubjects with himſelf, yet for ought I know, may proceed againſt, and hang him, if he mends not his manners. Nor hath <hi>D. E.</hi> got ſo great a Goal of the Biſhop in affirming our Saviour to put the Scribes and Phariſes to ſilence by Argument only; for the Scribes and Phariſes were rightfully in <hi>Moſes</hi> chair, and had not as Thieves and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers invaded the rights and juſt poſſeſſions of other men, as the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians did; nor in that formality as Presbyterians had they, or now have any right or power to teach the people, and if it be not true (which he ſaith, the Biſhop layes to their charge) of preaching nothing but ſedition and treaſon, as contrary to their principles, I am ſure it is no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Practice, and ſo they are the more manifeſt Hypocrites in being ſo.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>D. E.</hi> 4<hi>th.</hi> objection is injurious and falſe: for in all ages, the Church did, and might in point of Conſcience, injoyn penance for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, or private faults, although forgiven, or not taken notice of by Temporal Powers, without any breach, or diſturbance of the publick Peace; neither do I find, or believe, that the Biſhop does affirm the Church diſtinct from the State, to have any coercive power.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>D. E.</hi> 5<hi>th.</hi> objection is ſo wild and impertinent, that I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the Biſhop did never dream of ſuch a conſequence as he there puts, where things are commanded by them who have no right, or Authority to do it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And whereas <hi>D. E.</hi> in his ſixt objection againſt the Biſhop, <hi>would have it an unconſcionable thing to go againſt any pretence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or practice of Primitive times, and to impoſe in Gods worſhip, things confeſſedly needleſs and trivial; and therefore what the Biſhop un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſionately tells us, that our Laws do well to puniſh, even with non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admiſſion to the Sacrament, ſuch as will not or perhaps dare not kneel.</hi> I am unwilling to diſpute with any man, where the terms of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter are not firſt defined, much leſs where my Adverſary, and I, it may be, mean quite contrary things by them. I ſay then by Conſcience, I underſtand alwaies a rightfull power commanding, or forbidding any
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108600:5"/>
thing, and if any ſubordinate power to which I am ſubject, commands contrary to it, then to ſubmit to the penalty, but never to reſiſt the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Now would I know what Law of God forbids me to kneel at the receiving the Sacrament, or otherwiſe I cannot plead conſcience againſt it, if I be injoyned to do it by any Authority to which I am ſubject, and therefore our Laws do well to puniſh thoſe who will not conform; and that kneeling and outward geſtures are not trivial and needleſs (as <hi>D. E.</hi> is pleas'd to tearm them) in the worſhip and ſervice of God, is evident both by the old Law and Goſpell, and conſent of all men in all ages and places, untill denyed by our late, and now Hypocrites and Reformers. I ſay that outward geſtures are commanded by our Saviour himſelf, in Gods worſhip; for when the Devil tempted our Saviour, he bid him not ask any thing of him, but fall down and worſhip him; which was only an outward geſture; but our Saviour told that, it was writen that thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve: to worſhip God therefore with an outward worſhip, is commanded by our Saviour. And I pray, what is God jealous of in the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of falling down and worſhiping any creature, but that that ſhould be given to it, which is only due and proper to him? and by the Authority of all ſtorys, men did ever, whereſoever they apprehended a Deity, worſhip it with outward worſhip. It may be it was a trivial and needleſs thing in <hi>Moſes,</hi> at another time to put off his ſhooes, it was not ſo when God bid him put them off, becauſe the place was holy. But <hi>D. E.</hi> hath two reaſons againſt the Biſhops reaſon for non-admiſſion of ſuch as will not kneel at receiving the Sacrament, <hi>viz.</hi> that it become not the Law-givers to endanger the Churches peace for their ſakes; one is, <hi>it did much more become all Law-givers in the things of God, to obſerve the Law of Chriſt, which is a Law of Love and Liberty.</hi> When <hi>D. E.</hi> ſhews that kneeling, or obſerving things duly required of us in Gods ſervice does become deſtructive to Chriſts Law of Love and Liberty, then he ſays ſomething: in the mean time, I think <hi>D. E.</hi> to be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous proper inſtrument to plead for Love and Liberty in Religion; for his love it appears by his Animadverſion, and for his Liberty, ſure his Religion is yet to chuſe. His ſecond <hi>is the Churches peace to be more endangered by preſſing things doubtfull, than by the forbearance of them; for ſince by enforcing of ſuch things as God hath no where commanded, our Christian Liberty is enfringed, from hence it follows, if it ought not, yet we may lawfully refuſe ſuch impoſitions, as our Saviour did, not waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hands before meat, and the Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>in caſe of Circumciſion.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:108600:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
What, though God hath not commanded things in his worſhip and ſervice, ſhall therefore nothing be done in it? nothing leſs; for it is ſufficient to me, that God commands me to hear and obey the Church, and commands the Church to do all things decently, and in order, in his worſhip and ſervice; what things therefore the Church commands for decency and order in Gods worſhip, if they be not contrary to Gods Laws, are not things doubtfull, but ought in conſcience to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, upon penalty of the breach of Gods Law, in not hearing and diſobeying the Church. For <hi>D. E.</hi> his inſtances of our Saviours, and the Apoſtles refuſing to obſerve the Phariſes in waſhing of hands, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſſion, it is both blaſphemous and falſe; for our Saviour was in the power of the Phariſes, in reference to the Ceremonial Law; and therefore <hi>D. E.</hi> cannot aſſume to himſelf like liberty with our Saviour, and Circumciſſion being typical was fulfilled by our Saviour, and the uſe of it a denyal of his coming in the Fleſh.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Nor is that a Rope of Sand, which the Biſhop affirms, <hi>that from diverſity in external Forms, ariſes diſlike, from diſlike enmity, from enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty oppoſition; thence Schiſm in the Church, and Sedition in the State:</hi> For as <hi>Socrates</hi> objects to <hi>Eutyphro,</hi> that there muſt neceſſarily be ſomething to which men in difference muſt indifferently ſubmit to, or their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions will be endleſſe: and if the eſtabliſhed Rules in the Church for Gods Worſhip and Service, be not that thing to which <hi>D. E.</hi> and I muſt indifferently ſubmit to, then is there nothing in the power of <hi>D. E.</hi> or my ſelf, which can preſcribe another; and ſo by conſequence there can be no decency nor order in the Worſhip and Service of God, but all things therein left in confuſion and diſorder, which is expreſſly againſt the Divine Canon.</p>
            <p>Nor did ever <hi>D. E.</hi> or any ſeditious men, begin at Sedition directly, but alwayes pretended conſcience, and made Religion a ſtalking horſe thereunto, according to that of the Poet, <hi>Quoties vis fallere Plebem Finge Deum.</hi>

            <p>And I chalenge <hi>D. E.</hi> to inſtance in any Age or Place, where men invaded the Peace of the Church, but they at leaſt attempted the like in the State: and now ſee how vain and Idle <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll 3 of <hi>D. E.</hi> objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Biſhops aſſertion are: his firſt reaſon is, <hi>that in Diverſity of external Forms, without any diſlike as to the Perſon, the Apoſtles that preached to the Circumciſion, gave the right hand of fellowſhip to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of the Gentiles; although their outward Rites and publick Worſhip were far more different than thoſe, which by any of the most diſtant perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108600:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are now practiſed in</hi> England. So that <hi>D. E.</hi> grants the Biſhop, that external Forms in Gods Worſhip is an Apoſtolick practice, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prejudice to the Biſhop's aſſertion: for, ſince God in our nature hath not left in what external Form he will be worſhiped, but to every Church her liberty; and therefore divers Apoſtles, and divers Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, ever did, and now do uſe divers external Forms in their Worſhip of God; And therefore the Church of <hi>England</hi> may uſe one external Form, different from that of <hi>France,</hi> and that of <hi>France,</hi> another from that of <hi>Greece</hi> &amp;c. without any diſlike; yet doth it not therefore follow, that <hi>D. E.</hi> may raiſe Schiſm in the Church of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> any more than that becauſe the Laws of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> are different, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>D. E.</hi> is not obliged by them, but may make Rebellion and raiſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in them. Certainly if <hi>D. E.</hi> had Logick enough to underſtand his Arguments, I would not wiſh the Biſhop a better Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</p>
            <p>But whereas <hi>D. E.</hi> in his ſecond objection, thinks for want of reaſon he hath ſo ſure a Topick in his inſtance of a Pagan State exiſting without Biſhops, and therefore in Triumph he again objects it; give me leave to ſpeak as a man and Chriſtian. I ſay then, as I am a man I acknowedge Regality to be a ſacred Order and founded by God in Nature, and ſo ever continued both before and ſince the Flood in all the world, where it was not invaded and violated by Seditious men: and that by inherent birth-right I ow my Sovereign Lord the King, all Allegiance next under God; and this being founded in Nature, is an indelible Character, and cannot be diſſolved but by God alone, but is due in all places, whether I be in the Kings Dominions or not; but ſince mans fall, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Nature left him whereby he might attain that bleſſedneſſe from which he fell; therefore God was pleaſed to take extraordinarily our Nature upon him, to redeem us, that by believing on him, and obſerving his commands, we might attain that happineſſe from which our Parents firſt fell, and I acknowledge it his grace, that I am baptized into this Faith. But becauſe <hi>parum eſt jus, niſi ſint qui poſſunt jura gerere,</hi> it had been to no purpoſe for our Saviour to have made a will, unleſſe he had made Executors to execute it; he was therefore pleaſed to ordain 12 Apoſtles, and 70 Evangeliſts his Executors, with power to propagate it to others, untill his next coming again. I ſay this power no wayes intrenches upon the Regal, for it only hath reference to Chriſt and him crucified, and Gods Worſhip and Service: And as the Power no wayes intrenches upon Regality, ſo is there nothing in Chriſts will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108600:6"/>
it, but to advance it. For there we are commanded to pay tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and are taught that Higher Powers are Gods Ordinance, to which men muſt ſubmit for Conſcience ſake: but as this Ghoſtly Power no wayes intrenches upon the Regal, ſo neither doth the Regal upon Kings Converſion to Chriſtianity, annihilate or divide this power, but it is the ſame, and in the ſame manner propagated after as before, and the executors of it, in their Office are immediately Chriſts Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; and as in the Goſpel, ſo under the old Law, the Levites and Prieſts in the Adminiſtration of their Office, were Gods immediate Miniſters: and though Regal Power over the Children of Iſrael were as intire and abſolute as in other places, yet was <hi>Saul</hi> rejected and <hi>Uzziah</hi> ſmote with Leproſie for invading it.</p>
            <p>Nor do I ſee why <hi>D. E.</hi> ſhould be ſo zealous for propagation of a Pagan ſtate, when as it may be he would have found as much occaſion to quarel therein, as againſt the Biſhops in a Chriſtian; for men by the light of Nature, whereſoever they apprehended a Deity, judged it neceſſary to have it worſhiped by ſeparated perſons ordained therunto: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though in Pagan States God was not publickly worſhiped and ſerv'd by Biſhops and Chriſtian Prieſts, yet had they every where ſomething in Analogy thereto, <hi>viz.</hi> a High Prieſt, and <hi>Flamens</hi> to ſerve him in their publick Worſhip, and by conſequence were not ſo very Heathens as <hi>D. E.</hi> And pray what reaſon is there that God under the old Law ſho ld be ſerved by ſeparated perſons ordained thereto, and that moral men by the light of humane Nature, conform thereto, and yet only God in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian States, is fit to be publickly ſerved by ſuch Cattel as <hi>D. E.</hi> and his Fellows?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D. E.</hi> his third Objection is, <hi>that Chriſt's Unity is a Unity in heart and Spirit;</hi> whereas <hi>actus interior &amp; exterior ea<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

E.</hi> is of, appears by the Annimadverſions. And whereas <hi>D. E.</hi> tels the Biſhop in his ear, <hi>that our late wars did not ariſe from the ſeparation of conſciencious diſſentors, but from the violence and fury of unconſcionable Impoſers:</hi> I muſt needs tell <hi>D. E.</hi> it is a loud and ſlanderous lye; for there was nothing impoſed upon the Diſſentors, which was not legally impoſed, and ſo not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, furiouſly, or unconſcionably done, unleſſe <hi>D. E.</hi> can ſhew where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was directly againſt Divine Laws.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:108600:7"/>
Nor were any of theſe conſciencious Diſſentors furiouſly and violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compelled to hold their Livings, but if they liked not the terms, they might have left them: and for theſe men to promiſe Conformity, that they would dayly offer up the publick ſervice of the Church, Bury the dead, viſit the ſick, baptize Infants, and uprightly inſtruct the cure committed to them by their Dioceſan, and do nothing of theſe, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of theſe, preach their own Paſſions and Affections, to make facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſeditions in Church and State; and yet in conſcience deſire the means of the Church, is like to a man that ſtipluates with <hi>D. E.</hi> for a ſumm of money to do a thing, and doing nothing of it, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience deſires of <hi>D. E.</hi> to pay him the mony; ſure <hi>D. E.</hi> would think this man to have little conſcience, and yet ſuch men muſt be <hi>D. E.</hi> his Conſciencious Diſſentors. But ſure the King and Parliament will not ſuffer ſuch an affront to paſs unqueſtioned as to make the King governing by the Laws, to be a violent, furious and unconſcionable Impoſer, and the cauſe of our late warr; and a company of Vermine and Hypocrites, who would be governed by no Laws, and yet furiouſly and violently impoſe their own wills and luſts upon their fellow Subjects, to death and utter ruine, to be the conſciencious Diſſentors.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I will not queſtion the French Proteſtants ſtanding, nor the Dutches kneeling in receiving the Sacrament, in <hi>D. E.</hi> his 8 <hi>th.</hi> objection, nor his profound Learning in the Eccleſiaſtical Laws of thoſe Churches: this I will tell <hi>D. E.</hi> that by his ignorance in Divinity, he grants the Biſhop, that kneeling is eſſential and neceſſary in receiving the Sacrament; for nothing done to a creature, can be Idolatry, if it were not before due to the Creator: and therefore cannot the Papiſts abuſe kneeling at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to Idolatry, if kneeling in the Sacrament were not due to God; and if the abuſe of a thing ſhould take away the uſe of it, then muſt not <hi>D. E.</hi> ſay his prayers, becauſe the Papiſts do Maſs.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>D. E.</hi> in his laſt objection is ſo angry with the Biſhop for <hi>aſperſing the whole order of the Presbyterians, with the faults of Mr.</hi> Baxter, I will tell <hi>D. E.</hi> they are ſuch an Order as are in the cards when the Kings are out; I pray who did incorporate them ſo? or from whence do they derive their order? I grant they are a factious conſpiracy known by that name, and the common Parent of all factions, and the Author of all our late calamities. I hope <hi>D.
