            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LETTER
TO THE
Earl of SHAFTSBURY
this 9th. of July, 1680.
From TOM TELL-TROTH a Downright Englishman.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have lived to see your Lordship Great as well as Popular, and a stout Assertor
of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion and Interest. Wherefore to your Lordship have I
thought fit, in this time of danger to our native Countrey, to lay before you
the great Mischiefs that both the Monarchy and <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion do suffer,
in respect of the present Designs of <hi>Papist</hi> and <hi>Commonwealths-man:</hi> And when I
have discover'd to your Lordship their Intrigues, as far as my strict scrutiny and
search into them (besides sufficient Testimonies from others truely informed) have
satisfied me, I hope we shall take such adequate Measures from them, to satisfie both
your Lordship and this Kingdom, that Ruine and Desolation will come swift on us,
Confusion and every evil Work, if some speedy Remedy be not instantly proposed
by the Wisdom of the great Councel of this Nation.</p>
            <p>And first, my Lord, Your Lordship will please to give me leave to make a Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel,
between the past Actions of the designing men before and after 1641. to the
happy Restoration of the King, by it I shall be able to satisfie your Lordship, that
what was then designed and effected upon the Person of the late King, Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and Government, were the results of such pernicious Counsels and Designs, as
are now hatching by these Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> to the present disturbance, if not ruine of
our flourishing Church and Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis obvious to all that have had any knowledge of the late Transactions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
1640. and after, that the <hi>Papist</hi> seeing our Church so well guarded with purity
of Doctrine and Faith, with innocent Ceremonies, to defend her from the Invasion
of slovenly and dishonourable worshipping of the great God; as well also to avoid
the Superstition and Foppery of the Worship of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Behold what
Emissaries were there sent out, and with what Cloathing to deceive; the <hi>Puritan</hi>
must be drawn in to make an outcry against Canons, Ceremonies, and whatever was
enjoyned by Law in the Worship of God must be <hi>Antichristian,</hi> at least it must be
said unlawfully imposed on their tender Consciences. From sowing these Doctrines,
the poor and the ignorant were taught to believe Bishops to be the very Limbs of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,</hi>
and Superstition and Idolatry brought by them into the Church; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
worthy Patriots, such as <hi>Pryn, Bastwick,</hi> and <hi>Burton,</hi> &amp;c. would smell Popery
and Superstition in Gown, Surplice, Cross in Baptism, worshipping God towards the
East, (a primitive Custom in the Church of God) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then publish to the World the
great care they had to bring things to a due Reformation both in Church and State.
But behold the consequence of this Undertaking; they had no sooner gone about to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61454:2"/>
undermine the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but then 'twas fit time to call in question too the
Miscarriages of State, and to be sure Archbishop <hi>Laud,</hi> who was the most eminent
Assertor of the Rights of the Church, and as true a <hi>Protestant</hi> as ever lived, must be
the first man cryed down by the Teachers and the Rabble, for being Popishly incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
or rather for being a <hi>Papist,</hi> and must be butcher'd too for that supposition;
by his death ended the Tranquillity of the once flourishing Church of <hi>England:</hi> Thus
far had <hi>Papist</hi> hand in hand with Fanatick Rage and Zeal triumphed over us. But
after this, 'twas not enough to bring our Church low, but we must yet go higher—well!
What encouragement has the King given to <hi>Papists</hi> of late, by preferring them
to Places of great consequence in the Government, such as were <hi>Strafford,</hi> &amp;c.—These
Persons, ay those, must be removed for evil Counsellors, or we shall have no
Peace in our <hi>Israel;</hi> accordingly our zealous Teachers sent their Disciples abroad in
all Avenues of the City, to cry down evil Counsellors, for that their design was to
bring in Popery, and destroy Liberty, ay the Liberty of the Subject. And then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth
Ship-money, (a huge burden to what we have felt since) was (against <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
harta</hi>) indeed every thing in the Government found fault with, as either Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishly
or Arbitraily inclin'd, then cry out for Reformation, Reformation. And when
for Peace-sake, our good King had granted many of their unreasonable Demands,
and had deliver'd to their Fury innocent Bloud, to prevent, as he thought, the shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
much more, yet would not their Rage stop here, but at last King, Church, and
all brought to destruction, by the most horrid Rebellion and Villany, as can scarce be
paralell'd in any Kingdom in the World in all its circumstances.</p>
            <p>And now, my Lord, one would think, that this pretended glorious Reformation,
should have produced some Settlement by this time to the tottering Kingdom: No
truly; we found nothing but Sect springing out of Sect, and they that once prayed
and fought together against the Peace of the Kingdom in one Body, and as it were,
under one denomination, are presently dwindled into many little Parties and Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
and every one crying to his Neighbour, <hi>I am holyer than thou art;</hi> so that from
<hi>Papist</hi> sprung <hi>Puritan,</hi> from <hi>Puritan Presbyterian,</hi> from <hi>Presbyterian Independent,</hi>
from thence <hi>Anabaptists, Antinomians, Fifth-Monarchists, Sweet Singers in Israel,
Quakers, Muggletonians,</hi> and the Lord knows what, till by and through the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
of their Persons and Judgements, and the various Frekes of the several Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
all was reduced to a Chaos; so that neither a single Usurper, nor a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
without a King, nor Committee of Safety, nor Keepers of the Liberties, or
Councels of Officers, and Strength of Arms, could produce any Quiet, till God
wonderfully restored Him, whose undoubted Right it was to sway the Sceptre of
these Kingdoms. And thus, my Lord, I have in short given your Lordship an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of what has been acted in those Times: Let me now crave leave further to
make the Parallel with the present Times; and therein if I reflect on some of the
busie and designing men, I hope I shall not break the Laws of Decorum, because
things are brought to that Crisis, that if an honest <hi>English</hi> Heart will not now
speak home to the purpose, (for ought I can see) he may evermore hold his peace.</p>
            <p>Well then, my Lord, Do we not now perceive as clear as the Sun at Noon day,
that the same Men, or Men of the same Principles are again hard at work to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
and destroy both our Church and State too? What divided Interests and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
have there been for Seven Years last past, and more, to bring the King and
Governours into disgrace, by frequent Clubs at Coffee-houses and Taverns, on
purpose to break the Bonds of Unity among us. From these Places, and Sinks of
Sedition and Rebellion, have there not been many of a higher form, who through
Discontent, or love of Faction, and change of Government, or for not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
or preferr'd to the Highest and most Honourable Places therein, have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
all they can to breed Differences between the Two Houses of Parliament,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61454:2"/>
by throwing in some little matter with a Ball of Contention at the end on't, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
to hinder the prosecution of what should tend to the advancement of the
Publick Weal; And what can be more plain, than that such Designs were like those
of 1641. Since, because the Bishops would not herd with Common-wealth-mens In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
(Yet my Lord, I do believe the Bishops are as prudent Men, and can as well
tell the nature of an Oath, together with the Design as well as the Consequence
thereof,) as any States-man I know of in the Kingdom, let them pretend to what
they will; And besides, I am sure their Interest is so interwoven in the Monarchy
of <hi>England,</hi> that neither <hi>Popery,</hi> nor any other Interest besides that of their own
Church as established by Law, can any ways preserve them, unless they will all as
one Man fall down and Worship the great Image, and be all things to all men, that
they may be sure to get something, as many (my Lord) pretended Famous States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have done in the several Changes of Government in these Kingdoms; (but that
is not to be supposed of them,) since they would not, or did ever joyn with any
such Interest as oppos'd Church or State; and thus how did both City and Country,
Clubs, and Coffee-houses ring, that the Bishops were the only opposers of the true
Interest of the Kingdom, and the great occasion why Justice could not be done on
Capital and Notorious Offenders. This, my Lord, is a true spice of old 1641. and
Your Lordship cannot but observe, that it hath brought the Bishops into suspition
with the Vulgar sort, that they are driving on the <hi>Popish Design,</hi> and that there is
not above Two <hi>Protestant</hi> Bishops amongst them all, as they give out.</p>
            <p>Well, but this will not do yet; 'tis not so long since <hi>Laud</hi> was murder'd, and
<hi>Strafford:</hi> People sufficiently smarted under Covenanting Reformers, and Army-Saints,
and 'tis not easy to play the same Game over again the same way; and this
the Designing Men see, and so are said to have other Artifices to rend the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in pieces, and reduce it to its former Chaos or Designed Commonwealth; So
that if neither disquieting or dividing Parliaments, nor secret combining Clubs against
Great Ministers of State, nor a seeming weariness of the Monarchy of <hi>England,</hi> nor
disgracing the Governours of the Church, nor suspition of <hi>Popery,</hi> and the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
thereof, will do the business to exasperate the People, as in 1641. why truly
then comes forth a <hi>PLOT</hi> full of <hi>Treason</hi> and <hi>Popery;</hi> then forsooth the D. must
needs be the Foundation of this <hi>Damnable Plot,</hi> and the Discoverers (who no doubt
have been blessed Instruments to save us at this time from the Paw of Antichrist,)
must be revered as Demy-Gods among the Vulgar, but more especially among the
Precious <hi>Independant</hi> and <hi>Anabaptist</hi> Faction; But not to reflect on the Kings Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
for no doubt deservedly did those suffer who were condemned by the Justice
of our Laws, and many more deservedly may that have had a hand in that perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and Bloody Design against His Majesties Sacred Person and Government. In
this Hurly Burly what a Confusion did it bring the Kingdom into? How did it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate
the King to Prorogue and Adjourn, yea, and Dissolve Parliaments from time
to time? when he could not but so do for the preservation of the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and defeating the Designs both of Popish and Self-designing Men who sought
to disturb it; and so apparent this was, that no Loyal Heart but trembled at it.
Then again forsooth all miscarriages of this nature must be attributed to the D. and
his Party, and given out by the Designing Men, that no Parliaments should ever sit
again, but all would be Arbitrary, and accordingly Guards must be doubled to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
us from <hi>Jesuits,</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> and this Bugbear of <hi>Arbitrary Government.</hi> Now
in the name of <hi>Machiavel</hi> where are we going next? Oh! cries the first and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
among the Designers, Let us but keep off the King from Parliaments till his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
will not answer the Charge of the Crown, and put him into the condition
his Father of Blessed Memory was, that he will be necessitated to call one, then he
shall be obliged to redress all the Grievances, hang all <hi>Plotters,</hi> (provided they be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61454:3"/>
none but such as are <hi>Popishly</hi> inclin'd,) punish Church Offenders, and Saint Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors;
then shall he be obliged to hearken to every thing we shall propose about
the <hi>Succession;</hi> Then we shall be able to make our own terms with him, either we
will have <hi>M.</hi> or we will know why; We will have one <hi>Black Box</hi> or other found
wherein the Writing is that will prove what we would have Legitimate, and <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor</hi>
to the Crown, in opposition to <hi>Royal Word,</hi> and whatever Demonstrations shall
be to the contrary, provided it effectually hinders, and deprives the known, true
and <hi>Lawful Successor</hi> that's <hi>Popishly</hi> affected; and we will never leave Clubbing nor
Meeting, till we have effected this, maugre all former Designs by <hi>Popish Councels,</hi> or
<hi>Protestants</hi> whatsoever.</p>
            <p>Indeed my Lord, it were to be wisht for the quiet and welfare of the Nation,
that these, and such like Designs were laid aside, and every one study to do his own
business, to obey wholsom Laws, then to trust again to new Law-makers: For my
part, My Lord, I wonder what it is these Men would have, if they think that ever
<hi>Popery</hi> or <hi>Arbitrary Government</hi> can govern in this Kingdom, then they have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be thus concern'd: But my Lord, though I am a plain old <hi>English-man,</hi> I
can see as far it may be as one that sees less; and I protest, my Lord, that after
having read over abundance of such ware as little <hi>Andrew Marvel's</hi> Unhoopable
<hi>Wit and Polity,</hi> and the <hi>Independent Comment</hi> amongst it, together with the <hi>Growth
of Popery,</hi> &amp;c. as also the <hi>Naked Truth, Treatises about French Interests,</hi> and the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the Crown,</hi> and all this bustle they have made amongst us. To say the truth,
my Lord, I am <hi>Tom tell Troth,</hi> and between your Lordship and I, I do not believe
there's any need of such Books, or any such Jealousies; for in Gods Name, what can
preserve us, but being zealous for our Religion, and obedient to our Superiors? and
what can preserve them, but the Love of their Subjects, and governing according to
the Laws they have made, and are oblig'd to maintain? and for my part, I don't see
any Invasion of Liberty &amp; Property as they term it; I see indeed a sort of men, will be
always restless and buzzing the vulgar Ear with strange Fears and Jealousies, which
tends to nothing but destruction both of Prince and People. Truly, my Lord, (your
Lordship being a Person of such eminent Parts, and having known most of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Humours of this Land and People this 40 years) I think your Lordship would do
well to find out some of these Underminers of the publick Peace of the Kingdom,
that meet in Taverns, and other publick Houses, and by your strong Arguments
convince them, that this is not the way to bring about their Designs, whatsoever
mixture of Councels they may have; And since your Lordship lives in that great
City wherein these Persons are said to reside, Your Lordship would send them such
unquestionable Rules to walk by, as may tend to the securing of the peace of the
Kingdom, rooting out all Jealousies and Fears of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi>
As also to endeavour to fix them to the old ways of Loyalty and Obdedience,
which are the only paths of Peace to dwell in: Then shall we see that 'twill be our
