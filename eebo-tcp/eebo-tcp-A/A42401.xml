            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But Sir I conceive the beſt way to deal with
this clamorous Heretick is not by extemporal
ſpeaking, but by writing, let the arguments,
anſwers, and replies be ſet down and ſetled on

            <p>But without all peradventure it is a
counterfeit Deed, and the Conditions

nor doth he allow of them, neither
hath he ſet his hand and ſeal to ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed
Hereſies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to maintain that [the divine Nature was united to the
ſinful Nature of Man]</hi> and ſo make the ſecond Perſon in the
Trinity a Sinner, and thereby (as much as in you lies) raſe
the very foundation of Religion; for if he had been ſo,
he could not have been a Sacrifice to take away ſin; but
would have needed himſelf to be purged, wherefore before
the ſecond perſon in the Trinity was united unto the nature of
the Virgin, the holy Ghoſt did ſeparate that ſubſtance
whereof the humane nature of Chriſt was framed from the
leaſt ſtain of ſin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to ſay that all the Scriptures are an Allegory:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38405:7"/>
and ſo overthrow the whole Hiſtory of the Bible, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Redemption, and Salvation of Man. An Allegory is,
when one thing is ſpoken, and another underſtood, but in
the Hiſtory of the Bible the very ſame thing which is (ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
is to be underſtood, except it be when it is contrary to
the <hi>Analogy</hi> of faith, or the Rule of Manners. What? becauſe
St. <hi>Paul</hi> made an Allegory of <hi>Abrahams</hi> having <hi>Sarah</hi> &amp; <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi>
doth it follow that all the Scriptures are Allegories? Or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that was an Allegorie, may we believe there was no ſuch
Hiſtorie?</p>
            <p>Becauſe the Rock was called Chriſt, as in the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.
4. doth it therefore follow there was no ſuch Hiſtorie as of
the Rock in <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. the like may be ſaid of many more.</p>
            <p>Allegories do not therefore overthrow the Hiſtory, but
confirm it. 'Tis then God never conſented to your Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
though you have preſum'd to ſet to his name.</p>
            <p>You ſpeak much in your own praiſe: [that you have been
faithful in the acknowledgement of this Myſterie.]</p>
            <p>You might have remembred, that <hi>propria laus ſordet,</hi> and
that commonly, when a man beareth witneſs of himſelf, his
witneſs is not true. <hi>John</hi> 8. Therefore you ſhould rather
have followed <hi>Solomons</hi> counſel. <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 2. Let ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man praiſe thee, and not thine own mouth.</p>
            <p>For the myſtery you ſpeak of, it is not the myſterie of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
but the myſterie of iniquitie. You do in effect deny
the <hi>Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſay [it is but one God manifeſting himſelf under va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
appearances] when the Deity is one in eſſence, and in
that eſſence there are three diſtinct Perſons, or ſubſiſtences,
the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as appears in
Chriſt's Baptiſm. The Father ſpeaks from Heaven, the ſon
ſtands in the water, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> deſcends in the likeneſs
of a Dove.</p>
            <p>You boaſt [you give to God and man their due, when you

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:38405:7"/>
You are only kind unto the Divel, and would put him in
hope (if it were poſſible) of Salvation; but though perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
you may perſwade your followers to believe it,
yet the father of lies will not credit it; if he did, he would
not have cried out, <hi>torment me not before the time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſay that [God hath been with you to make ſweet and
pleaſant your ſufferings, and <hi>Impriſonment</hi> to you.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is a fearful judgement, when God gives up men ſo far
to believe their own lies, that their own Poyſon becomes
pleaſant and delectable unto them; and that he doth this,
we find</hi> 2. Theſ. 2. 10, 11, 12. Becauſe they received not the
love of the truth, that they might be ſaved: God ſhall ſend them
ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould believe a lie: That they all
might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure
in unrighteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>You boaſt of the ſufferings, as for the truth; when they
are for your abominable Blaſphemie, and bearing witneſs to
lies, for denying Chriſt Aſſention, Seſſion, and the general
day of judgement in that ſenſe which the Scriptures deliver
them unto us, we know there are <hi>Pſeudomartyrs</hi> as well as
true <hi>Martyrs;</hi> and as God comforts and ſupports the one,
ſo the Divel deludes and deceives the other, for it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
to all ſober Chriſtians that read your Book, you ſuffer not
as a <hi>Martyr,</hi> but as a Malefactor, for rotten and deteſtable
Hereſies.</p>
            <p>You complain, [ſome have revil'd you, as a Blaſphemer]
(you ſhould have ſaid rebuk'd you.)</p>
            <p>What they have done I know not, but I am ſure it is their
duty to warn their ſheep to beware of the Wolf (our Saviour
himſelf hath done it. <hi>Beware of falſe Prophets that come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you in Sheeps cloathing but inwardly they are ravening
Wolves. Mat.</hi> 7. 15.) and if they neglect to do it, and the
Sheep periſh, <hi>they ſhall anſwer for their blood. Eze.</hi> 3. 20.
But if they do it, and the Sheep be ſlain, <hi>the Shepherds ſhall
deliver their own Souls. Ez.</hi> 33. 9.</p>
            <p>And certainly a more dangerous Wolf or Heretick was not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38405:8"/>
in the Church from the dayes of the Apoſtles, until this
time: What do I ſpeak of one; if <hi>Pythagoras's tranſmigrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of ſouls could captivate my belief, I ſhould not judge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably,
ſhould I judge that the ſouls almoſt of all the
former Hereticks were tranſported into you; for not any one
of them maintained ſo many damnable opinions. God give
you a ſight of your ſin, and grace to repent; that if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
the ſin of your heart may be forgiven you.</p>
            <p>As for your Book, it is a Labyrinth of errours, and you
your ſelf a blind guid, that run headlong into the pit of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and draw others after you.</p>
            <p>For the Aſperſions which you and your deceived followers
caſt upon us the Miniſters, we regard them not: It is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to be evil ſpoken of by ſuch companions, eſpecially for
the truth, and for righteouſneſs-ſake. But we ſhall leave our
cauſe to God, and pray with the <hi>Pſalmiſt (Pſal.</hi> 35. 1.) plead
thou our cauſe, O Lord with them that fight againſt us (and
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 12.) Deliver us not over unto the will of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
for falſe witneſſes are riſen up againſt us, and ſuch as
ſpeak wrong.</p>
            <p>Before I enter upon this diſputation, it will be requiſite to
ſay ſomewhat of Blaſphemie; becauſe it is much ſpoken of
in the enſuing diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>To Blaſpheme God, is to detract from his ſacred majeſtie,
to offer injurie to his holy name, and diſhonourable, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful
ſpeeches, the ſin of <hi>Pharaoh. Exod.</hi> 5. 2. the ſin
of <hi>Rabſhaketh 2. Kin.</hi> 18. the ſin of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> womans
ſon. <hi>Lev.</hi> 24. 10. The puniſhment of this ſin was death;
when it was manifeſt and notorious. <hi>Lev. 24. 16. Dan.</hi> 3.
29. This ſin is committed three wayes. Firſt, when that is
aſcribed unto God, which is repugnant to his nature, as if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſay he is corrupt, or ſubject unto evil affections. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
when that is taken from him which is proper unto
him, as when any ſhall ſay God is not merciful, good, juſt,
&amp;c. Thirdly, when that is attributed to the creature, which
is proper to the Creator; as when any ſhall ſay the Angels
made the world; or that a meer man can forgive ſins. Or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38405:8"/>
if any ſhall aſſume to himſelf, the name of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> as
did the falſe Prophets, &amp;c. moreover, I may adde that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie
is Blaſphemie, and that Hereticks are Blaſphemers.
Firſt, becauſe they manifeſtly oppoſe the truth, and ſo God,
who is <hi>prima veritas,</hi> upon which account St. <hi>Paul</hi> condemns
<hi>Hymineus</hi> and <hi>Alexander. 1. Tim.</hi> 1. 20. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they make God the Author of their lies; by wreſting
his word to confirm their errours; which is the property of
<hi>Satan,</hi> the patron of lies. Thirdly, becauſe they ſet Gods
ſtamp upon their counterfeit mettal; telling the people it is
Gods gold, when it is no other then Satans droſs, of moſt
of which this Heretick is guiltie; as will appear by the
enſuing diſcourſe: theſe things premiſed I proceed.</p>
            <p>[Chriſt, <hi>(who knew no ſin)</hi> (you ſay) took part of mans
fleſh, and blood, which was ſinful]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, you ſay</hi> [Chriſt took upon him the ſinful nature of all
that ſinned.</p>
            <p>By Chriſt it ſeems you mean the Deity: And by ſinful
nature you mean his Humanitie; for what elſe can be your
ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Which <hi>Propoſition</hi> is both falſe and Blaſphemous; for the
Holy Ghoſt, in the conception ſanctifi'd the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Chriſt was made, and ſeparated it from ſin. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35.
<hi>The Angel</hi> (ſaid the <hi>Holy Ghoſt)</hi> ſhall come upon thee, and
the <hi>power</hi> of the moſt <hi>High</hi> ſhall over-ſhadow thee; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alſo that holy thing, <hi>which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be
called the Son of God.</hi> The holy thing, which ſhall be born
of thee, implies he was holy before he was born.</p>
            <p>And this was done upon ſpecial cauſe. Firſt, that it
might be joyned to the Perſon of the <hi>Son,</hi> which could not
have been, if it had been defiled with ſin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Chriſt</hi> was a <hi>Saviour</hi> as he was both God and
man: If he had been ſinful himſelf, he could not have ſaved
others; but ſhould have ſtood in need of a <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf;
therefore the humane nature of Chriſt was not polluted with
Original ſin, but was ſanctified.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:38405:9"/>
And this ſanctification hath two parts. Firſt, the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page
to the propagation of Original Corruption, and the
guilt of <hi>Adams Sin;</hi> which was on this manner: God in
the beginning ſet down this order concerning man, that what
evil or defect he brought upon himſelf, he ſhould derive the
ſame to every one of his Poſteritie begotten of him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
when any father begets his Child he is in the place
of <hi>Adam,</hi> and conveys into it, beſide the nature of man,
the very guilt and corruption of nature; now, for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this evil in Chriſt, God provided in great wiſdome,
that he ſhould be conceived by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> without any
generation by man, and by this means he took the ſubſtance
of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and not the guilt and corruption of the
ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as your propoſition is falſe, ſo it is blaſphemous;
for you charge <hi>Christ</hi> with Original ſin; for as the ſoul and
body make but one man: So the divine and humane nature
make but one <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not the divine nature alone, as you er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneouſly
ſuppoſe.</p>
            <p>You ſay [the Son proceedeth forth from the father.]</p>

of thoſe two places of Scripture. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. And <hi>Mat.</hi>
25. 31. urged by Mr. <hi>Roſwel,</hi> that you are not able to anſwer
it.</p>
            <p>You farther ſay [I do alſo ſay that the righteous ſhall have
everlaſting life,<note place="margin">Page 8.</note> and the wicked ſhall have everlaſting
Torment; but that doth not prove, there is no Salvation,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38405:9"/>
or Redemption out of Hell; for the word everlaſting, doth
ſignifie ſuch a diſpenſation or adminiſtration of God to
man.</p>
            <p>Which is an abſurd expreſſion; let me help you to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
though it will not help you in the maintaining of your er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
Everlaſting doth ſignifie <hi>Perpetuitatem periodicam, et
Perpetuitatem abſolutam,</hi> and you might ſay, it ſignifies
here <hi>Perpetuitatem periodicam;</hi> but this would be as falſe,
as the other is abſurd: For in the ſame ſenſe that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
eternal life to the Sheep, in the ſame ſenſe he threatens
eternal puniſhment to the damned, but he promiſes eternal
life abſolutely to the Sheep, and therefore threatens eternal
puniſhment abſolutely to the damned. The Text is, <hi>et abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt
iſti ad ſispplictum aeternum, juſti vero ad vitam aeternam,</hi> ſo
there is the ſame perpetuitie to both, and the Scales go e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually.</p>
            <p>I will adde two places of Scripture more, the 1. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.
45, 46. <hi>and if thy foot offend thee cut it off: It is better for thee
to enter halt into life, then having two feet, to be caſt into Hell,
into the fire that never ſhall be quenched: Where their Worm
dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</hi> Mark the words, he
call's it their Worm, and this their Worm never dies, and
wherefore their Worm? Becauſe it torments them: And to
ſhew the certainty of it, our <hi>Saviour</hi> repeats it three ſeveral
times in that Chapter.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 26. where <hi>Abraham</hi> tells <hi>Dives,</hi>
between us and you, there is a great Gulf fixed, ſo that they,
which would paſs from hence to you cannot, neither can
they paſs to us, that would come from thence, a <hi>Caſmos,</hi> a
fixed <hi>Caſmos</hi> never to be removed, and which ſhall for ever
keep them aſunder, which ſome expound to be Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
decree.</p>
            <p>Now where is your boaſting, where is your triumphing;
if you have any Scripture that makes for your purpoſe, produce
it: We have produced Scripture ſufficiently, and ſuch proofs
as neither you nor any of your family can ever anſwer; yet
more ſhall be produced upon the ſame occaſion in the ſecond
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38405:10"/>
diſputation. You urge to prove your wicked errour Chriſts
local deſcenſion into Hell, what if I ſhould grant it, becauſe
it is the opinion of many learned Proteſtant Divines, what
would this make for your purpoſe? They held, he went <hi>ad
Triumphandum</hi> to triumph, (grounding their opinion prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
on <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 10.) you <hi>ad patiendum</hi> to ſuffer, which
is againſt Chriſt's <hi>Conſummatumeſt</hi> it is finiſhed. Becauſe
Chriſt deſcended and returned as a Conquerour, doth it follow,
that the Divels and the damned ſhall return, who are Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors.
Alſo Chriſt laid down his life for his Sheep, are the
Divels and the damned any of the Sheep of Chriſt? You
quote a place out of <hi>Amos 9. 2. Though they dig into Hell,
thence ſhall mine hand take them, though they climb up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
thence will I bring them down, though they hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the top of</hi> Carmel, <hi>I will ſearch and take them out
thence, &amp;c.</hi> Which place is nothing to your purpoſe; for
the meaning is, no place ſhould hide them from the reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
hand of God, except they repented.</p>
            <p>But one thing more you ſpeak there of a diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>What manner of diſpenſations to go to Hell? There
needs no ſuch diſpenſation. <hi>Facilis deſcenſus averni,</hi> broad
is the way, certainly you mean a diſpenſation to come from
Hell; and then the Pope or your ſelf muſt grant it; but he
grants diſpenſations only from <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and ſo it reſteth
upon your ſelf: and if you have ſuch a facultie, why do you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them to lie in thoſe flames? It argues little charitie in
you.</p>
            <p>You are charged by Mr. <hi>Reſwel</hi> for ſaying, that a mans
good works do him no good, and his evil works no hurt;
and in your anſwer I finde this of truth. [That when we
have done all we can, we muſt acknowledge our ſelves to be
unprofitable ſervants,] and indeed ſo we are; yet he that
commanded us to acknowledge that we are unprofitable
ſervants: in the ſame place commands us to do what we can.
To ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate: To give diligence
to make our calling and election ſure, for the pennie is not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38405:10"/>
given to thoſe that ſtand idle in the Market-place, but unto
thoſe that labour in the Vineyard.</p>
            <p>Further, though good works be not <hi>cauſa regnandi,</hi> yet
are they <hi>via ad Regnum,</hi> and therefore God hath prepared
them to walk in <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
            <p>In the third Chapter I finde ſo great <hi>Blaſphemie, Non-ſenſe,</hi>
and confuſion, that I ſhould hold my ſelf diſoblig'd to an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
or confutation; but that, where I am commanded
<hi>not to anſwer a fool in his folly, leſt I ſhould be like him:</hi> There
am I commanded alſo, <hi>to anſwer a fool in his folly, lest he be
wiſe in his own conceit:</hi> Pro. 26. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt Blaſphemie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 3.</note> 
               <hi>you ſay</hi> [Chriſt is at the left hand of God.]</p>
            <p>Which is horrible Blaſphemie:<note place="margin">Page 11.</note> For as the right hand doth
ſignifie <hi>Summam Gloriam</hi> the higheſt glory: So the left hand
of God doth ſignifie <hi>ſummam miſeriam,</hi> the greateſt miſery,
which to maintain that Chriſt is in, is moſt repugnant to
the Scriptures. <hi>Epheſ. 1. 20, 21. Col. 3. 1. Pſal.</hi> 16. 11.
<hi>Rom. 8. 34. Mat.</hi> 16. 9. It is a metaphorical expreſſion, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from the geſture of Princes, who when they mean
highly to honour any man, ſet him at their right hand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 45. 9. Upon thy
right hand did ſtand the <hi>Queen</hi> in gold of <hi>Ophir.</hi> And we
read that <hi>Solomon</hi> did ſet his Mother at his right hand. 1
<hi>Kings</hi> 2. 19.</p>
            <p>Auguſtin <hi>interprets ſitting at the right hand, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</hi>
Sedere eſt judiciariam poteſtatem habere, ad dexteram Dei
eſſe, eſt in ſumma beatitudine eſſe, ſicut ad ſiniſtram in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mâ
Miſeriâ.</p>
            <p>To ſit is to have Judiciarie power, to be at the right hand
of God, is to be in the higheſt degree of happineſs, as at
his left hand, in the greateſt miſerie.</p>
            <p>But who can better expound it, then St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was
led by the Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>Ephe. 1. 20, 21, 22. God hath
highly exalted his Son, and placed him at his right hand in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
places,</hi> where he ſhews the exaltation of his Humane
nature to the higheſt degree of bleſſedneſs that it can be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of: <hi>He hath put all things in ſubjection under his feet,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:38405:11"/>
and that <hi>propter Mortem Crucis,</hi> becauſe he became
obedient to death, even the death of the <hi>Croſs. Phil.</hi> 2. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Allegorical</hi> fancy is as far different from the truth,<note place="margin">Page 11.</note>
as a Goat is from a Sheep, or an Aſſe from a rational man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Non-ſenſe in the contents of your third Chapter,
as all that read it cannot judge it otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Confuſion, in turning the Holy Scriptures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Allegories, where they are to be underſtood literally, and

               <p>You tell Mr. <hi>French</hi> you are not of his Spirit, and I believe

               <p>Neither are you of the ſpirit of Chriſt, for he hates the

is the ſpirit of Chriſt, and your ſpirit, they are not the
ſame.</p>
               <p>Here I meet again with two Hereſies diſputed of,<note place="margin">Page 16. 17.</note> and
confuted before, and therefore I ſhall not need to adde much.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that the deity of Chriſt was not only united
to the nature of man, but to the ſin of his nature, which is
as impoſſible, as for two contraries to agree together in the
ſame ſubject, puritie, and uncleanneſs. Righteouſneſs, and
unrighteouſneſs: Light and darkneſs.</p>
               <p>He was a perfect man in all things, ſin excepted. <hi>Heb.</hi>
4. 15. We have not an high Prieſt which cannot be touched
with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points
tempted like as we were yet without ſin. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26,
27. for ſuch an high Prieſt became us to have who is holy,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38405:11"/>
harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners, and made high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then the Heavens. Who needed not daily as thoſe high
Prieſts to offer up ſacrifice, firſt for his own ſin, and then for
the peoples. And what can be more plaine, that he was
without ſin clearly, as the other high Prieſts were not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
they having need, he having none.</p>
               <p>Again, he took upon him the nature of man; but not the
ſin of his nature. Sin and concupiſcence are not of the nature
of man; but an hereditary diſeaſe that ſticks unto his nature
as doth the Leproſie: For indeed if it had ſtuck to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he could neither have been a Prieſt, nor a ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>Not an high Prieſt, for ſuch an high Prieſt it becommed us
to have who was holy, as in that Text of <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Not a ſacrifice; for that muſt be without ſpot, that muſt
take away ſin: And ſo was Chriſt.</hi> John 14. 30. The
Prince of this world had nothing in him. 1. Pet. 1. 19. A
lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot. 1. Pet. 2. 22. Who
did not ſin.</p>
               <p>And whereas you object he bore our ſins in his body on the
Tree: you could not have brought any place, that makes
more againſt you. Mark the words. He bore our ſins, not
his own: We were the principals. He was but our ſuertie:
He ſuffered not for himſelf; but according to that of <hi>Daniel</hi>
9. 26. <hi>The Meſſias ſhall be ſlain for his people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You urge moreover that place.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 21<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>He hath made him to be
ſin, that knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs
of God in him,</hi> which makes nothing for your purpoſe, rightly
underſtood: For he made him ſin by imputation: God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
his righteouſneſs to us, and our ſin to him: I have
ſhewed you before how he was conceived by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
not begotten by man.</p>

<hi>Origen,</hi> which hath been anſwered already, and that enough
to the ſatisfaction of any good <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> yet becauſe I meet
with it again, I ſhall adde ſomewhat more.</p>
               <p>God doth threaten eternal puniſhments, as he promiſes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

               <p>But for all this, you have the face to tell Mr. <hi>French,</hi> that
this Text proves it not, and tell him that you had anſwer'd it
before, but let us ſee how you have anſwer'd it before.</p>
               <p>Your anſwer was,<note place="margin">Page 8.</note> [that the word everlaſting did ſignifie
a diſpenſation, or adminiſtration of God to man,] which
as I told you before, is an abſurd expreſſion; your meaning
is (as you have ſomewhat expreſt your ſelf in the beginning
of the eighteenth Page) that it ſignifies ſuch a perpetuitie,
as is not abſolute, but hath a Period.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Smith</hi> very ſeaſonably charg'd you to prove it hath
ſuch a ſignification. You inſtance in the <hi>Covenant</hi> God made
with <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was called an <hi>Everlaſting Covenant.</hi>
Your words are.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Covenant which God made with Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 9.</note> was called
an everlaſting Covenant [and this Covenant upon theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
did laſt but for a time, for we read that God did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
make a new Covenant with us, that ſhould never
be ended.]</p>
               <p>To this Mr. <hi>French</hi> replied, I deny that the Scripture you
brought out of the 17. of <hi>Geneſis</hi> is taken in your ſenſe. For
that was an everlaſting Covenant: And indeed ſo it was;
therefore the pains of Hell are eternall, that is, have no Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod.</p>
               <p>To this you ſay. [Sir you ſay nothing but what your

you underſtand not; for the firſt everlaſting Covenant, as

                  <hi>Oh Monſtrum horrendum cui lumen ademptum.</hi> Oh blind
deceived deceiver to ſay, that the covenant God made with
<hi>Abraham</hi> was a covenant of works, when it was a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of grace, as the Scriptures every where prove; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. and in that <hi>Chapter</hi> eſpecially the 16
Verſe Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace,
to the end the Promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
who againſt hope, believed in hope, and therefore
faith was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. And again, in

                  </gap>. to the <hi>Gala. Abraham</hi> believed, and it was imputed
to him for righteouſneſs. I ſee you do not underſtand what
the Covenants are. I ſhall briefly tell you therefore.</p>
               <p>Gods Covenant is his contract with man, concerning the
obtaining of Eternal life upon a certain condition.</p>
               <p>This Covenant conſiſts of two parts; Gods promiſe to
man, and mans promiſe to God.</p>
               <p>The promiſe of God is that whereby he bindeth himſelf to
man, if he perform the Condition.</p>
               <p>Mans promiſe to God is, that whereby he voweth his
Allegiance unto his Lord, and to perform the condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them.</p>
               <p>Again, there are two kinds of this Covenant. Firſt, the
covenant of works, and the covenant of grace. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.
31, 32.</p>
               <p>The Covenant of works, is Gods covenant made with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of perfect obedience, and is expreſſed in the Moral
Law.</p>
               <p>The Moral Law is that part of Gods Word which comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
a perfect obedience from man, as well in his nature as
in his actions, and forbiddeth the contrary <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5. and
1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
               <p>The Covenant of grace is that part, whereby God freely
promiſing Chriſt and his benefits, exacts again of man, that
he would by faith receive Chriſt, and repent of his ſins. <hi>Hoſ.</hi>
2. 18, 19. <hi>Eze. 36. 25, Mala.</hi> 3. 1. And this covenant though
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38405:13"/>
it be one in ſubſtance, yet it is diſtinguiſhed into the old and
new Teſtament, or covenant.</p>
               <p>The old Teſtament, or covenant is that which in <hi>Types</hi> and
Shadows prefigures Chriſt to come, and to be exhibited.
The new Teſtament or Covenant declareth Chriſt already
come in the fleſh, as it is apparently ſhewed in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The Goſpel is that part of Gods Word which contains a
moſt worthy and welcome meſſage; namely, that mankinde
is fully redeemed by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Son of God, manifeſted in the fleſh: So that now, for
all thoſe that repent, and believe in Jeſus Chriſt, there is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
a full remiſſion of ſins together with Salvation and life
everlaſting. <hi>Iohn 3. 14, 15. Acts</hi> 10. 43.</p>
               <p>Thus have I ſhewed you what the Covenant is, and the
difference which, it ſeems plainly, you your ſelf did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
though you taxed another for ignorance.</p>
               <p>But now the Divels and damned are out of this Covenant:
they are under the curſe, they cannot repent, they cannot
truly believe, they are hardned, and therefore no hope of
Salvation to them.</p>
               <p>In the next place of your errours, and abominable abſurd
ſhifts to maintain them, you have found out a prettie diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of everlaſting.</p>
               <p>You ſay [when everlaſting, and the words <hi>for ever</hi> are
mentioned ſingly, they ſignifie a time which ſhall have an
end; but when they are ingeminated, or repeated, as from
<hi>Everlaſting to Everlasting,</hi> or <hi>for ever and ever,</hi> then they
ſignifie Eternitie, or a time without end] or to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
page 18.</p>
               <p>Your own words ſhall confute your errour, your tongue
ſhall make you fall; for if you read <hi>Apoc. 14. Verſe</hi> 11. you
ſhall finde that they that worſhip the beaſt are tormented
with fire and brimſtone. And the ſmoak of their torments
aſcend for ever and ever, <hi>habemus confitentem,</hi> that the pains of
Hell are perpetual, becauſe they are ſaid to endure for ever
and ever.</p>
               <p>Your next anſwer contains ſuch horrible Blaſphemie, that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38405:13"/>
it deſerves rather a reply from the hand of the Hangman,
then an anſwer from the Pen of any man.</p>
               <p>You ſay,<note place="margin">Page 18.</note> (and I tremble to repeat it) [that Hell fire, (not
only) is as eternal as God (but that) God himſelf is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
fire] <hi>viz.</hi> of Hell. A moſt damnable aſſertion, which
is all one, as to ſay, that <hi>Summum bonum</hi> is <hi>Summum malum,</hi>
that he who is the chiefeſt good and happineſs, it ſelf is the
chiefeſt evil. And Hell fire it ſelf, which was made for the
Divels and the damned. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 41. For what can it be
elſe: let the expoſition be what it will, the Playſter will be
too narrow for the Sore.</p>
               <p>God is ſometimes compared, in the Scripture, unto a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
fire, to ſhew the greatneſs of his anger againſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and that except they repent he will burn them up, and
conſume them, as a fire conſumes the Wood, the Chaffe, the
Stubble; but I never heard before, that God was ſaid to be
Hell fire, and I hope ſhall never hear it again.</p>
               <p>You ſaid abſurdly [that David was in Hell, even while he
was upon the earth,] underſtanding Hell locally (as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
for why elſe ſhould you urge it here) which cannot
be. A body cannot be in two places at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you quote the 88. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 6, 7. 'tis common in
the Scriptures, for the Spirit of God to uſe <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> that
is, tranſcendent kinds of ſpeaking, as it is ſaid, that there were
among the <hi>Canaanites</hi> Cities walled up to Heaven, that is,
the Walls were very high. So when the greatneſs of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
afflictions, and troubles of Gods Children is ſet forth,
it is compared unto Hell. <hi>Ion.</hi> 2. 1, 2. Then <hi>Ionas</hi> yrayed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <p>You mention that place in the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10, 11. nothing
to the purpoſe; for that fire there mentioned, is to trie Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
that are built upon Ieſus Chriſt the foundation, the
true corner ſtone, whether they be Gold or Silver; Hay, or
Stubble; if they be of the firſt ſort, they ſhall abide, if of
the ſecond they ſhall burn and vaniſh. Now this fire is not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38405:14"/>
the fire of Hell, nor of Purgatory, (as the Papiſts hold) but
the fire of Gods Word, or the ſpirit working by the Word;
which by the light thereof, that is as clear as the day, when
once it ariſeth in our hearts, doth manifeſt and declare what
is Silver, what is droſs. If any mans work abide he ſhall
receive a reward. <hi>Dan. 12. 3. They that be wiſe, ſhall ſhine

which are compared to fire, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 12, 13. for by

Firſt, there is a civil death, when men are ſo overwhelmed
with miſeries, that they ſeem to be dead and buried whileſt
they are alive.</p>
               <p>The Prophet fore-tells, that they ſhould be brought into
ſuch a condition for their ſins; and yet God ſhould deliver
them out of it, when they repented, which came to paſs;
for they were delivered into the hands of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
and after delivered by the Edict of <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But who can better expound the Prophet, then the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,

So when this corruptible ſhall have put on incorruption, and
this Mortalitie ſhall have put on immortalitie; then ſhall the
ſaying be brought to paſs that is written, death is ſwallowed
up in victory. And that very fitly, for when we die,
death gets the victory over us: when we riſe again life gets
then victory of death.</p>

You bring a place out of the 27. of <hi>Iſaiah v.</hi> 1. which if

               <p>In that day the Lord with his ſore, and great, and ſtrong

               <p>Your laſt Argument overthrows your own cauſe <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 33.
<hi>Tophet</hi> is prepared of old, for the King it is prepared, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
of fire and much wood, the breath of the Lord, like a
ſtream of brimſtone doth kindle it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tophet</hi> was a Temple in the valley of <hi>Hinnon,</hi> wherein ſtood
the abominable Idol of <hi>Saturn,</hi> to whom the Iſraelites offered
up their children: and that they might not hear their mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
cries, they ſounded bells to drown their voices; from
whence it came to be called <hi>Tophet,</hi> of <hi>Toph,</hi> which ſignifies a
bell. By this vallie of ſlaughter, the Prophets do many times
ſet forth Hell, and the torments thereof.</p>
               <p>Again, the Aſſyrians, or the Babylonians were always cruel
enemies to the Church of God, they often invaded their
Country, burnt up their Cities, ſlew their people, and carried
them away captive: wherefore Satan and his Angels, with his
inſtruments are many times compared to the King of <hi>Babel,</hi>
his Souldiers, and his people.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:38405:15"/>
Now in this place the Prophet goes about to ſet forth the
day of judgement, when not onely the Babylonians, but all
the enemies of the Church ſhall be deſtroyed, Satan and his
Angels, Tyrants, Perſecuters, Hereticks &amp;c. and he begins it
in this manner.</p>
               <p>The Lord ſhall cauſe his glorious voice to be heard, and
ſhall ſhew the lighting down of his Arm with the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his anger, and with the flame of devouring fire, with
ſcattering, and tempeſt, and hailſtones.</p>
               <p>For through the voice of the Lord ſhall the Aſſyrian be
beaten down (which ſmote with the rod) with the rod of
his mouth, when he ſhall pronounce the laſt ſentence againſt
them. But what ſhall become of them? they ſhall be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Hell, and all the people that forget God; which hell is here
called <hi>Tophet:</hi> when was this made? of old. But it cannot
hold them all? Yes, 'tis deep and large. There wants fewel?
no, there is fire and much wood. Though it be kindled, yet
it may go out? no, it is like a burning River of Brimſtone,
the breath of the Lord continually kindling it, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is all this? to burn the Aſſyrian and his Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
               <p>This expoſition is plain enough, yet to do it more fully.
<hi>Tranſitus Virgae fundatus quem requieſcere faciet Dominus ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

               <p>That is, upon Satan and his Angels, and the wicked, that

the Beaſt and his image, and receive his mark in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
or hand, the ſame ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath
of God which is poured out, without mixture, into the cup of
his indignation, and ſhall be tormented with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
in the preſence of the Lamb, and the ſmoke of their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
aſcendeth up for ever and ever, and they have no reſt
day nor night, <hi>Apo.</hi> 14. 11. what can be more ſtrong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
you to prove the eternity of the puniſhment of the
damned.</p>
               <p>You conclude [theſe are all the fruits of hell to take away
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38405:15"/>
their ſins] and great fruits they are, if true, to Purge the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
and the damned: it far exceeds the fire of Purgatory, for
that onely purgeth ſome, (as the Papiſts vainly teach) of their
venial ſins, and the temporal puniſhment of their mortal; but
this purgeth all, <hi>Cain, Eſau, Judas, Julian,</hi> the Devil and
damned; but let me tell you, you were not beſt to truſt to it,
but make your peace with God (if it may be) before you come
there: for if you come to be ſhut up in that Dungeon, or, as
in the 20. <hi>Revel.</hi> 10. when you ſhall be caſt into the Lake of
fire and brimſtone, where the beaſt and the falſe Prophet are,
and ſhall be tormented day and night for ever and ever, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
in your own ſenſe) there will be no hope of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
When the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven
with his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance

deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord. 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi>
1. 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>What can be more plain to all, except to ſuch as have their
underſtanding darkned by the ignorance that is in them, and
their minds alienated from the life of God, becauſe of the
blindneſſe of their hearts:<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 10, 11, 12.</note> and becauſe they will not receive
the love of the truth that they may be ſaved; but provoke
God to ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould beleeve
a lye and be damned.</p>
               <p>But you wickedly and vainly boaſt, that you fight againſt
the enemies of the truth, when it appears plainly that you fight
againſt the friends of the truth, nay, againſt the truth it ſelf,
and that you are not a brother of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Page 8.</note> (as you in the pride
of your heart call your ſelf) but a brother of Anti-Chriſt,
whom <hi>Chriſt will destroy with the breath of his mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am come to examine the 5. Chap. which is of Chriſts
aſcenſion and his coming to Judgement, which you blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
and impudently ſtand to deny.</p>
               <p>Your words are [Therefore the Words of Chriſt are not to

               <p>And again, you ſay concerning his comming to judgement,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38405:16"/>
I do believe he is come, and comming daily, and doth ſet up
his Throne in the hearts of his people, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And thus by your fooliſh figures, and ſpiritual (as you
pretend) ſenceleſs ſences, you pervert the Scriptures mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and (to your power) overthrow two Articles of our
faith, both neceſſarie to Salvation.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, I will ſhew the veritie of Chriſts Aſcenſion,
and that it is to be underſtood literally, and not figuratively,
and then confute your cavils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, for the truth of his Aſcenſion we have the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Evangeliſts—</hi> Mark 16. 19. So then, after the
Lord had ſpoken to them, he was received up into Heaven, and
ſat on the right hand of God. <hi>—Luke</hi> 24. 51. And it came to

                  <hi>The manner, firſt,</hi> He led them out as far as to <hi>Bethany,</hi>
and bleſſed them, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 50.—He went apart from them.
<hi>Verſe 51. Thirdly,</hi> a cloud did over-ſhadow him. <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 9.</p>
               <p>The Teſtimony of the whole Church of God, who make
it an Article of their faith. And this was not another body,
but the ſame body which he had before, as the Angels teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.
<hi>Acts</hi> 1. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This ſame Jeſus, whom you have ſeen go into Heaven, &amp;c.
this ſame Jeſus, not another, not a Phantaſtical body, but
his true body.</hi> Iohn 20. 27. Then ſaid he to <hi>Thomas,</hi> reach hither

1. 7.—They ſhall ſee him whom they have pierced.</p>
               <p>Here you ſee is a whole cloud of witneſſes, the Teſtimony
of the Apoſtles, of Angels, and the ſpirit of God. How is
your forehead ſteel'd, that you dare out-face a truth as appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
as the Sun at Noon-day?</p>

But you except againſt the Teſtimony of the Apoſtles, and
ſay [they had not received the holy Ghoſt, but were carnal]
before you Blaſphemed Chriſt, now the Apoſtles; for there

               </p>
               <p>Did not our Saviour breath upon them, ſaying unto them,
receive the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 22. though they had not
recived him in that manner, and meaſure. as they did upon
the day of <hi>Pentecoſt;</hi> yet it doth not follow, they had not
received him before.</p>
               <p>You ſay moreover [that they were carnal.]</p>
               <p>If you mean, totally carnal; 'tis as falſe, as the other, for
our Saviour gives this Teſtimony of them, that they had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him in the Kingdome of Regeneration, and ſhould
ſit upon 12. Thrones, &amp;c. when he ſhould ſit upon his
Throne of glory. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 29, 30. what can be more plain,

[He that aſcended, is the ſame that deſcended, and we do
not read of a body of fleſh and bones that deſcended.]</p>
               <p>But Sir we read that the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
ſo low, as to take upon him our nature. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.

he remains a Prieſt for ever. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
               <p>Then when he had perfected the work of our Redemption,
he aſcended up into Heaven, ſat down at the right hand of
God to make interceſſion for us.—Now who doth this?
He that died, or rather he that is riſen from the dead, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38405:17"/>
who was that? Chriſt. (Chriſt is riſen,) and what is
Chriſt? God and Man in one Perſon, read <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34.</p>
               <p>Inſtance. The ſecond Perſon deſcended, as he was God,
aſcended God and Man; therefore he that aſcended was not
the ſame that deſcended. You erre not knowing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>For though the ſecond Perſon deſcended and took our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon him; yet it was without the confuſion of natures,
or transfuſion of eſſential properties: though he was made,
that he was not God and Man in one Perſon; yet he remained
that he was before perfect God. And therefore he that aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
was the ſame that deſcended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Apoſtle cryes out.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16.</note> Great is the myſterie of godlineſs,
God was manifeſted in the fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of
Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the World,
and received up into glory.</p>
               <p>Next follows the Blaſphemous Inference [if Chriſt be at
Gods right hand in a body of fleſh and bones,<note place="margin">Page 24.</note> why, then
this is to make God to be a body of fleſh and bones alſo,
and ſuch a one as your ſelf, confin'd to a local place.]</p>
               <p>Which doth not follow; for the Godhead was united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Humane Nature without any confuſion of natures, or
transfuſion of eſſential properties. The Word was made
fleſh not by turning the Word into fleſh, but by taking the
Humanitie into the Deitie. Which the Antients thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt.</p>
               <q>Sum quod eram, neceram, quod ſum, nunc dicar utrumque.</q>
               <p>And therefore, for a man to ſay, <hi>in concreto</hi> that Chriſt
hath a body of fleſh and bones, is true; but to ſay that God
hath a body of fleſh and bones <hi>in abſtracto,—</hi> or that
God is confined to a place, is horrible Blaſphemy; for which
you were ſeaſonably taken off by Captain <hi>Harriſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next thing to be conſidered, is the comming of Chriſt
to judgement, which Pillar of our faith you endeavour to

made of, or ſeek to know the particular time of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</hi>
For our God ſhall come, and will not keep ſilence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
fire ſhall go before his face, and a mighty tempeſt ſhall
be ſtirred up round about him. Then ſhall be execute judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
apon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them
of their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed,
and of all their hard ſpeeches, which ungodly ſinners have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
againſt him. <hi>Jude 15. Pſal.</hi> 50.</p>
               <p>The next thing obſervable, that I meet with, is your
quoting that in the 3. of the <hi>Coloſſians Verſe 1. If you be riſen
with Chriſt, ſeek the things which are above, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of which words the ſenſe may be firſt conſidered, and
then what force the conſequence may be to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The things above are primarily the joyes of Heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
2. 9. ſecondarily, the gifts and graces of Gods ſpirit, as
faith, love, ſanctitie; (<q>according to that of <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 17.
<hi>every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
down from the father of lights, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>) which gifts do
far exceed the things below, and are the way to bring us to
the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
               <q>—Non eſt via ad Regnum, ſine primitiis Regni.</q>
               <p>The Apoſtle gives ſeveral reaſons to move us thus to ſeek.
The firſt is, becauſe we are riſen with Chriſt ſacramentally
in Baptiſme, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 13. (being) buried with him in Baptiſm,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:38405:18"/>
wherein alſo you are riſen with him, and really by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
working of the ſpirit of God; which had raiſed them
up from the death of ſin, to the life of righteouſneſs; <hi>Titus</hi>
3. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, becauſe Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God;</hi>
And therefore where our treaſure is, there ſhould our hearts be
alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 21.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe Chriſt ſhould come to judgement.
When Chriſt, who is our life ſhall appear, then ſhall we
alſo appear with him in glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 4. by life here is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
eternal life, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 11. alſo according to that in
<hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9. he is called our life, becauſe he is the Author of
our everlaſting life.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, becauſe he beſtows this life <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 32.</p>
               <p>But when (may it be asked) doth he beſtow all this? At
his appearance. Chriſt appears three wayes. Firſt, corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
<hi>God was manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> 1. Tim. 3. 16.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſpiritually, when he makes himſelf manifeſt to
the eyes of our ſouls by the preaching of his word, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, when he manifeſteth himſelf in glory, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to judge the World, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20, 21. Let our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
be in Heaven, from whence alſo we look for the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: who ſhall change our vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body,
according to the mighty working, whereby he is able even
to ſubdue all things to himſelf. <hi>(In the day when God ſhall
judge the ſecrets of men by Ieſus (Christ.) Rom.</hi> 2. 16.) Not
that we ſhall have other bodies, but the ſame. <hi>Iob</hi> ſayes,
<hi>in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God.</hi> I ſhall ſee him for my ſelf, and
mine eyes ſhall behold, and not another. <hi>Iob</hi> 19. 26, 27.</p>
               <p>But they ſhall have new qualities, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 52, 53, 54.</p>
               <p>And now, how doth that text of <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1. ſerve for your
purpoſe? The truth is, you could not have brought any place
that did more ſtrongly confute your Hereſie. It ſeems plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
you do not underſtand the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>I ſhall adde ſomething before I proceed, concerning the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:38405:19"/>
Allegories,<note place="margin">Page 21.</note> which indeed are not Allegories, but fancies,
by which you overthrow, (as much as in you lies) the true
ſenſe and meaning of the Scriptures, the Articles of ſound
faith, and the foundation of true Religion.</p>
               <p>You ſay <hi>[The Scriptures are an Allegorie]</hi> and to prove
it, you quote <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 24. meaning the 4. 24.</p>
               <p>Which words are. <hi>Theſe things are an Allegory,</hi> that is,
<hi>Abraham</hi> having two ſons, one by a bond maid, the other
by a free-woman: it pleaſed God to ſignifie by theſe two,
the two Covenants.</p>
               <p>Now theſe being an Allegorie doth it prove, that all the
Scriptures are an Allegorie? What is the Hiſtory of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the World? The Hiſtory of the Kings? The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of the Acts of the Apoſtles? And of our Redemption
by Chriſt? If you make ſuch Allegories, you will leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſound in the Word of God. The Holy Ghoſt doth not
ſet down the principles of our Religion, ſuch as are Chriſts
aſcenſion, and his comming to judgement Allegorically,
but plainly; ſo that, he that runs, may read them, and he
that reads may underſtand them.</p>
               <p>And I doubt not, but that it will appear to all that are not
wilfully blind, that your Book is not truth triumphing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the enemies, and aſperſers thereof; but falſhood, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing
truth, and the defenders of it; which, by Gods aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
I have wiped away, and howſoever truth may for a
time be clouded, yet it will break through the thick miſts of
errour and Hereſie, for <hi>The truth is great and will prevail.</hi>
The end of the firſt two diſputations.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
               <p>In this Chapter you go about to overthrow the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Although,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 32.</note> 
                  <hi>you ſay</hi> [I do grant the Reſurrection of the body,
and do not denie it, though you ſay I do.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And again,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 33.</note> 
                  <hi>you ſay</hi> [there were ſome then, as well as now,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38405:19"/>
that think the Apoſtle meant carnally the riſing again of the
ſame body of fleſh and bones.]</p>
               <p>Alſo you ſay (ſpeaking of the Reſurrection of the dead
Page 34.<note place="margin">Page 34.</note> line 21.) <q>this Reſurrection is to be within you, and
you are to know it while you live in this body]</q> and in page 35.<note place="margin">Page 35.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſay, and unſay, and indeed ſay you know not
what; your intention is, ſo neer as I can gather, to deny
the Reſurrection of the body out of the grave, and to allow
only of a Reſurrection from the death of ſin, as may appear
in your anſwer to the 7. Article at the end of your Book, and
to maintain (or rather inſinuate) this, you moſt wickedly abuſe
the Scriptures, confound the ſenſe of them, and pervert the
meaning of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore I will prove the veritie of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the body, and then anſwer your abſurd contradictions
and cavils.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I will prove the Reſurrection of the body, by the
Reſurrection of Chriſts body, who is our head: and then by
the Reſurrection of our own, who are his members.</p>
               <p>Chriſts Reſurrection is confirmed by the Teſtimony of
the four Evangeliſts. <hi>Mat. 28. 7, 9, 10, 12, 14. Mark</hi> 16. 6,
14. <hi>Luke 24. 6, 7. Iohn</hi> 20. 9. And in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 4, 5, 6. firſt,
he was ſeen of <hi>Cephas,</hi> then of the twelve, afterwards of 500
of the brethren at once. The teſtimony of Angels <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.
6. nay, of his enemies, Verſe 11, 12, 13. ſome of the watch
came into the citie, &amp;c. this now is ſo plain, that it cannot
be denied: and I think you will not be ſo deſperately-wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as to ſay, that this muſt be underſtood ſpiritually of a
Reſurrection from ſin, for Chriſt was never dead in ſin, but
purified in the womb—if you ſhould, your Maſter
would confute you. <hi>We know who thou art, even the Holy
one of Iſrael.</hi> If Chriſt be riſen, how ſay ſome among you,
that there is no Reſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12, 13.—If there be
no Reſurrection, then is not Chriſt riſen, but Chriſt is riſen,
therefore there is a Reſurrection, for Chriſt is a publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in the place of all mankinde: he roſe not for himſelf,
but for us all. And therefore the Apoſtle uſes that expreſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:38405:20"/>
as in <hi>Adam</hi> we all died, ſo in Chriſt we ſhall all be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.</p>
               <p>Again, Chriſt is compared to the firſt-fruits, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
is very ſignificant, the firſt-fruits were a ſheaf of the
firſt of the Harveſt, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 10, 11. which was raiſed,
and lifted up before the Lord, and then, not only, that was
holy, but the whole Crop—Chriſt likewiſe was the firſt
and beſt of the Crop: he was firſt lifted up, and then not
only he, but we all become living Sheafs.</p>
               <p>Again, the ſame Corn that is ſown, though it be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the ground, ſprings up again: ſo the ſame body, that
is ſown ſhall ariſe, the qualities thereof being changed, as the
Apoſtle ſays, it is ſown in corruption, it is raiſed in incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
it is ſown in weakneſs, it is raiſed in power: it is ſown
a natural body, it is raiſed again a ſpiritual body; not a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
but a ſpiritual body: a body endowed with ſpiritual
qualities, and they are, firſt, charitie, ſecondly, impaſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
thirdly, agilitie. <hi>The juſt ſhall ſhine as the Sun. Mat.</hi>
13. 43. 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 43, 44. Rev.</hi> 7. 17.</p>
               <p>Or if Chriſt be not riſen, then are we ſtill in our ſins,
but we are not ſtill in our ſins; therefore Chriſt is riſen.</p>
               <p>This argument will clear the matter, if we obſerve the
force of it.</p>
               <p>The Humanitie of Chriſt is united unto the God-head,
from whence it received ſpiritual life, now we are united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſt by the ſpirit which createth faith in us. We, I
ſay, not our bodies only, but our ſouls alſo. And by vertue
of this union, our ſouls and bodies do riſe again, our ſouls
from the death of ſin, and our bodies from the death in the
grave. <hi>If the ſpirit of him that raiſed up Ieſus from the dead
dwell in you: he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo
quicken your mortal bodies.</hi> Rom. 8. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly, the Reſurrection of the body may be proved by
that place in</hi> Iob, <hi>Chap. 19. 25, 26, 27. which is a plain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
of the Reſurrection of the body; obſerve the words.</hi>
I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall stand at the
latter day upon the earth, and though after my skin, Worms
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:38405:20"/>
deſtroy this Body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God: Whom I ſhall
ſee for my ſelf, and mine eyes ſhall behold him and not another,
though my reines be conſumed within me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Job</hi> was then in the condition of a dying man: his skin clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to his bones, he was a meer skeleton, and all wordly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
failed him; and therefore he comforts himſelf with this
meditation of the Reſurrection. I know that my Redeemer
liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand upon the earth at the laſt day.
The word is not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

by the malice of his enemies, yet he ſhould riſe up again and
ſtand, and when ſhould this be? in the latter day.</p>
               <p>2. He argues from our Redeemer to himſelf, becauſe he
ſhall riſe again, I ſhall riſe again: what is done in the head,
ſhall alſo be done in the members.</p>
               <p>3. He ſaith, I ſhall ſee in my fleſh with theſe eyes, and
not with anothers.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, for himſelf, for his benefit, notwithſtanding his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eins were conſumed, though he were in that deplorable
condition. And what can be more plain to prove the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of the body; ſo that if your eyes be not blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that you cannot ſee, you muſt of neceſſity confeſſe
it.</p>
               <p>You ſay,<note place="margin">Page 36.</note> here is a Myſtery] there is no Myſtery; except
one of your own making, and that is ſuch a confuſed one,
as neither your ſelf, nor any man elſe knows what to make
of it.</p>
               <p>You ſay that [the Redeemer was in <hi>Iob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 37.</note> though he knew

               <p>How could that be? doth not his confeſſion of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
of the Reſurrection, nay, of his own Redeemer prove
the contrary? could any man make ſuch an excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of a thing, and in ſuch a manner, as <hi>Iob</hi> doth, and not
know it? can ſuch fruits ariſe from ignorance? Doth not
<hi>Iob</hi> ſay plainly, I know that my Redeemer lives?</p>
               <p>You ſay that <hi>[Iob</hi> was then in darkneſſe] I ſay ſo too,<note place="margin">Page 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

underſtand it of his civil eſtate; for the Sun of his proſperity

was ſet; and therefore he comforts himſelf with a ſpiritual e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
with the Reſurrection; a uſual thing with the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 19. Thy dead men ſhall live together with my
dead body ſhall they ariſe: awake and ſing ye that dwell in
the duſt: for they dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth
ſhall caſt out the dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>See Eze.</hi> 37. from the beginning to
the ending, where God ſignifies the deliverance of Iſrael out
of captivity by the Reſurrection of the dry bones. To this
purpoſe hath the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſed himſelf in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.
8, 9. For we would not brethren have you ignorant, of our
trouble which came to us in <hi>Aſia,</hi> that we were preſſed out of
meaſure, above ſtrength, in ſo much that we deſpaired even of
life. But we had the ſentence of death in our ſelves, that we
ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in God which raiſeth the
Dead.</p>
               <p>But you ſay <hi>[Iob</hi> was then in darkneſſe,<note place="margin">Page 37. 38.</note> uttering words
without knowledge, for which he was reproved, firſt,
by <hi>Elihu,</hi> Secondly, by the Lord, and thirdly, he confeſt it.</p>
               <p>1. Oh horrible, that you ſhould have the impudence to
ſay, or infer, that <hi>[Elihu</hi> reproved <hi>Iob,]</hi> for that moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Confeſſion] when it is plain, as the Sun, that he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
him for ſaying, <hi>I am clean, and there is no unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
in me &amp;c. Iob</hi> 33. 9. doth not <hi>Elihu</hi> reſtrain his words
to the ſame expreſſion. Behold in this thou art not juſt
verſe 12.</p>
               <p>2. You affirm that [God reproved him for it.] By which
it ſeems you know not what you ſay, or care not what you
affirm; for that which God reproved him for, was, for ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too much upon his own innocency.</p>
               <p>And though <hi>Iob</hi> was not thus afflicted for his ſin, but for a
Triall (as appears Chap. 1. and Chap 2.) yet was there mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
enough in him that deſerved it, if God ſhould have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into judgement with him.</p>
               <p>3. You ſay that <hi>[Iob</hi> confeſt it.] Doth he confeſſe that he
had erred in that confeſſion of his, concerning the reſurrection?
or that he had maintained a falſe cauſe? no, God himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines
the contrary Chap. 42. 7. My ſervant <hi>Iob</hi> hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38405:21"/>
the thing that is right, and you have not; and therefore
they were appointed to go to <hi>Iob,</hi> that he might pray for
them.</p>
               <p>The cauſe that <hi>Iobs</hi> friends maintained was: that God did
handle men in this world according to their deſerts, and
therefore <hi>Iob</hi> was a wicked and curſed creature, becauſe thus
afflicted and tormented. <hi>Iob</hi> maintained the contrary, that
God did not alwayes handle men according to their deſerts
in this world; for, many times, the wicked have proſperitie,
and Gods children adverſitie. <hi>Iob</hi> 21. 8.</p>
               <p>Now though the foundation of <hi>Iobs</hi> cauſe were good, yet
in the proſecuting of it, he committed many errours, through
the infirmities of the fleſh, for which God reproved him:
but on the contrary the foundation of his adverſaries cauſe
was evil.</p>
               <p>'Tis therefore a falſe,<note place="margin">Page 38.</note> and an impudent aſſertion, to ſay,
as you do, [that <hi>Iob</hi> never ſpoke the thing that was right of
the Lord, until he ſaid, <hi>now do mine eyes ſee thee,] &amp;c.</hi> Job
42. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>The reaſon that moves you to deny, (or at leaſt to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minde,
and overthrow,) the Reſurrection of the bodie is,
becauſe there is a Reſurrection of the ſoul, and you may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
denie there is no death of the body, becauſe there is a
death of the ſoul in ſin; as <hi>Satan</hi> ſlays both, ſo Chriſt doth
raiſe up both in his members. If the ſpirit of him that raiſed
up Jeſus from the dead be in you, he that raiſed up Jeſus,
ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. but
this hath been ſufficiently proved already; I ſhall only adde
our Saviours argument to the <hi>Sadduces. Mat.</hi> 22. 23, 24.
unto Verſe 32. God is not the God of the dead, but of the
living; for all live unto him, that is, they are alive in his
account, becauſe he hath decreed to raiſe them again.</p>
               <p>I ſhall turn your proof out of the 11.<note place="margin">Page 33.</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> Verſ. the 21, 22,
23, 24, 25. upon your ſelf, Chriſt comes to <hi>Bethany,</hi> where
<hi>Lazarus</hi> lived, who was now dead: <hi>Martha</hi> goes forth to
meet him, ſaying; Lord if thou hadſt been here, my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had not died: Chriſt anſwered, thy brother ſhall riſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38405:22"/>
again; and this is ſpoken of the Reſurrection of the body,
for his ſoul was then in the hands of God. <hi>Martha</hi> replies;
I know that he ſhall riſe again in the Reſurrection at the laſt
day. So 'tis plain, that the Reſurrection was no ſtrange,
and new doctrine then (though it be now ſo to you) <hi>Martha</hi>
knew it, and believed it: as did <hi>Iob</hi> alſo, <hi>Iob</hi> 19. Chriſt
taught it ſaying, <hi>I am the Reſurrection, and the life, Iohn</hi> 10.
25. that is, the cauſe of the Reſurrection of the body, and
the life of the ſoul,<note place="margin">Page 39.</note> not a bare ſigne to ſignifie (as you falſely
and fooliſhly affirmed) but an effectual cauſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 20,
21, 22. alſo he teaches it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 19, 20, 21. where he ſaith
unto the Jews, deſtroy this temple, and in three dayes I
will raiſe it up again, which he ſpake of the temple of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
mark Chriſt, can any thing be more plain, which he
performed accordingly, <hi>Mat. 28. Mark 16. Luke</hi> 24. now

your body is the Temple of the holy Ghoſt, which is in you,

whereby we are united to him, according to that in <hi>Epheſ.</hi>
3. 17. <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by faith:</hi> and
Chriſt is ſaid to dwell in us by faith, becauſe as the body

                  <p>This is alſo falſe, for Chriſt telleth us, that he hath Sheep
that are not called, aswell as Sheep that are called, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.
16. <hi>other Sheep I have which are not called,</hi> that is, that
have not this ſpiritual manifeſtation. Now until men are
called, and converted, we know, they have not the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
of the ſpirit: and we know alſo, that there is a
ſpiritual deſertion, ſometimes for trial as in <hi>Iob,</hi> ſometimes
for correction as in <hi>David,</hi> and yet neither of theſe were
Reprobates.</p>
                  <p>You ſay [what is a Reprobate,<note place="margin">Page 41, 42.</note> but not to have
Chriſt in you.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which is a moſt abſurd definition of a Reprobate: and to
prove it, you produce</hi> Rom. 1. 28. <hi>becauſe</hi> they did not like
or retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate

                  <p>When Reprobation, is a part of Gods eternal decree,
whereby God hath purpoſed to paſs by ſome, that were in the
ſtate of corruption, as well as to elect others unto eternal
ſalvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11, 12, 13. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now how doth your definition ſuit unto this? Nay, how
doth that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28. prove your definition, which was a
ſpiritual judgement inflicted upon the Heathen, for not walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
according to that natural light, which God had imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in their minds; which indeed was a fearful judgement,
whether it be taken actually, or paſſively: if actually, as a
mind approving things to be reproved, and reproving things
to be approved, a mind judging good to be evil, and evil
to be good. <hi>Iob 21. 14. Iſa. 5. 20. Wo unto them that call
good evil, and evil good; that put light for darkneſs, and darkneſs
for light.</hi> Or elſe paſſively, as a mind reprobated, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
of God: and ſuch a mind was in <hi>Abab,</hi> who ſold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
&amp;c. in <hi>Iudas</hi> that ſold his Maſter, in <hi>Eſau,</hi> that ſold his

And to prove it, you mention that of 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 4, 5. Who
will have all men to be ſaved, &amp;c.</hi> which is underſtood of
his revealed will, which is, <hi>if they repent and believe, Iohn</hi>
3. 14, 15, 16. <hi>Mark 1. 15. Mat. 16. 15, 16. Acts</hi> 20. 20,
21. and many more places, ſo that if they repent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
they ſhall be ſaved, if not, for ought that God hath
revealed unto us, they are utterly loſt.</p>
                  <p>But have all men power to repent and believe? By nature
they have not: <hi>For we are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, Ephe.</hi> 2.
5. and God muſt quicken, and put life into us; before there
can be any motion in us: and this he doth put into his elect
by his ſpirit, (the Word and Sacraments being inſtruments)
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 20. which becauſe God doth miniſter by men, it is
therefore attributed to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.

               <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
               <p>The ſubject of this Chapter is the ſin againſt the Holy
Ghoſt, of the which, I could wiſh you were as clear, as
you are ignorant, but your ignorance muſt be your beſt Plea,
otherwiſe, ſcarce any ventured farther to be guiltie of it,
then you have done.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we will ſet down the nature of it, ſo far forth as it
is revealed in the Scriptures unto us.</p>
               <p>It is called the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, not becauſe it is
done only againſt the Deitie of the Holy Ghoſt; for he that
ſins againſt the Deitie of the Holy Ghoſt, ſins alſo againſt
the Deitie of the Father, and the Son, becauſe the three
Perſons are all one God: but becauſe it is againſt the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
action of the Holy Ghoſt, that is, againſt his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Illumination; for albeit this be a work common to the
three Perſons in the Trinity, yet, becauſe the Father, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:38405:24"/>
the Son do effect this by the holy Ghoſt, it is therefore called
the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt onely.</p>
               <p>1. The efficient cauſe of it is obſtinate Malice againſt God
and againſt Chriſt, as in <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate; who when he
was ſtrucken with an arrow, received the blood,
iſſuing out of his wound, into his hands, &amp; he threw it
up deſpitefully into the Aire, and cryed, <hi>Viciſti Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 The object of this ſin is God himſelf, and the mediator
Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29, 30.</p>
               <p>3. The ſubject in which it is found, is onely ſuch as have
been inlightned by the ſpirit of God, and have <hi>taſted of the
good gift of God Heb.</hi> 6. 5. So that the elect cannot commit
this ſin, and therefore they that feel in themſelves a ſure teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of their election, need not deſpaire; for they are kept
by the power of God unto life everlaſting.</p>
               <p>This ſin cannot be forgiven; not becauſe it is greater then the
merit of Chriſt can ſatisfie for; but becauſe, after a man hath
once committed this ſin, it is impoſsible for him to repent;
for the gift of Repentance proceedeth from the Holy Ghoſt
and the Holy Ghoſt remaineth in us through Chriſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
by faith; now no man doth apprehend Chriſt, who
doth maliciouſly deſpiſe and contemn him.</p>
               <p>Out of this which hath been ſpoken, we may thus define
this ſin. The ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt is a voluntary deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
of, and blaſphemie againſt the Son of God, or of that
truth which was before acknowledged concerning him; and ſo
conſequently a Vniverſal defection from God and his Church.
We have an Example of this in the devil, who though he knew
well enough that Ieſus was the Chriſt, yet he never ceaſed
both wittingly and willingly to oppoſe the very ſacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of God in him, together with the kingdom of Ieſus; that
as far forth as he could he might utterly ſupplant the ſame by
the Phariſees. <hi>Mat. 12. 32. Iohn</hi> 3. 2.</p>
               <p>Now Sir, conſider whether thoſe men, that have maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the articles of that faith into which they have been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
(which articles have been and are profeſſed by all the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:38405:24"/>
true Chriſtian Churches in the world, and are firmly g roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the word of God, which is the pillar of our faith)
have committed this ſin, or you that have firſt profeſt, and
afterwards fallen away from the faith, and oppoſed the chief
Articles, or fundamental points of it, (as Chriſts conception,
in ſaying he was conceived in original ſin, and ſo raze the
very foundation of true Religion; for if the root be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
all the Branches muſt be impure: Chriſt then would have
needed a Saviour himſelf, and could not have ſaved others.
2. His Reſurrection, his Aſcenſion, his ſeſſion at the right
hand of God) I ſay, examine your own conſcience, whether
you can be clear or not, who have done all this by your ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
Alegories: for my part I leave it to God to judge, who
ſearches the heart, and knowes whether you have done his
out of malice or ignorance.</p>
               <p>Now it is fit your weak and abſurd deſcription of the ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Holy Ghoſt be examined.</p>
               <p>You ſay [to ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">Page 44.</note> is to rebell, to
war, to reſiſt the ſpirit] and to prove it you bring
Chap. 5. to the <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 17. The words are theſe.
<hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit &amp;c.</hi> and ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
you make the fleſh luſting againſt the ſpirit,
to be the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>A ſin which Gods beſt children are guilty of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Read <hi>Rom.</hi>
7. 21, 22, 23.</p>
               <p>This deſerves to be hiſſ'd at, rather then anſwered: and let
me adviſe you to read more, and write leſſe; For, howſoever
your purblinde ſeduced Followers may beleeve you, yet all
men of ſound judgement will plainly ſee, that it is not the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, that hath inſpired you, but the ſpirit of blindneſſe
and ignorance that hath miſſed you.</p>
               <p>I woulde here conclude this Chapter, but that you confeſſe the
ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt ſhal never be forgiven in this world
nor in the world to come; which is the truth grounded
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38405:25"/>
upon the words of Chriſt <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 32. and therefore by
your own confeſſion, ſuch as commit thisſi nne, ſhall never
be redeemed out of hell.</p>

            <div n="10" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. 10.</head>
               <p>In this Chapter you endeavour to prove,<note place="margin">Page 45.</note> that man ſhall not
be deſtroyed, but onely the ſin that is in man.</p>
               <p>Your words are [Therefore man ſhall not be deſtroyed,
but the work of the Devil in him.]</p>
               <p>Your firſt argument to prove this is: <hi>becauſe God made man,</hi>
therefore man ſhall not be deſtroyed: and you may as well ſay,
Becauſe God made all ſenſitive and vegetable creatures, (as
Beaſts and Plants) therefore they ſhall not be deſtroyed. Are
not the Creatures made ſubject to vanity by reaſon of the ſin
of man? if they be, much more ſhall man that made them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
be ſubject himſelf. What do you think of the old world,
were not they created by God? yet you know they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.
You will ſay this was but a temporal deſtruction: it is
to be hoped, that when the waters roſe upon the earth many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented,
and ſo, though their bodies periſhed, yet their ſouls
were ſaved; but yet the moſt part periſhed both temporally
and eternally, as <hi>Peter</hi> teſtifies 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
               <p>Your 2. Argument is [Chriſt came into the World to ſave
Man,<note place="margin">Page 45</note> the work of God, but all mankinde is the work of God,
therefore Mankind who is the image of God ſhall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed]
is not here a goodly concluſion, that hath more in it
then the premiſes? to anſwer it; though man that is renewed &amp;
reſtored to the image of God ſhall not be deſtroyed; yet man
that is not reſtored to the image of God ſhall be deſtroyed,
though he be his Creature; <hi>for without holineſs no man ſhall
ſee God. Depart from me, I know you not, ye workers of iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, your third argument is [Chriſt came into the
World to deſtroy the works of the Divel, therefore man
ſhall not be deſtroyed] how doth this follow? Your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ought to be thus framed. Chriſt came to deſtroy the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38405:25"/>
works of the Divel in men; therefore thoſe men, in whom
the works of the Divel are deſtroyed, ſhall not be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but there are ſome that have not the works of the Divel
deſtroyed in them, <hi>Jo.</hi> 8. 44. therefore they ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Your fourth argument is [if man muſt die for his own ſins,
and go to Hell with them, in vain then did Chriſt die for
mans ſins] pray, where lies the fault, in Chriſt, or in the man,
that will not applie Chriſts death unto his ſoul for his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<hi>Rom. 9. 30, 31, 32. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 18. A Phyſitian compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
a medicine which is able to cure his patient, and to ſave
him fromdeath; but the patient will not apply it for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie,
according to that in <hi>Jer. 51. 9. Balm was provided
for her, but ſhe would not be cured;</hi> and likewiſe, <hi>the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees

<hi>Peter</hi> confeſſeth as much of himſelf, when he ſaith, Depart
from me, for I am a ſinful man. <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 8.</p>
               <p>But you urge Chriſt came to deſtroy the works of the
Divel, 'tis true; but not in your ſenſe, but in the ſenſe,
which the Scriptures do allow, that is, Chriſt came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the works of the Divel, which he did by his death,
and Reſurrection. He did not only juſtifie us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38405:26"/>
but alſo ſanctifie us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4, 5, 6. &amp;c. Chriſt loved his
Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and
cleanſe it, &amp;c. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5. 25, 26. yet ſo long as ſhe is in this
world the <hi>Jebuſite</hi> will dwell in her coaſt, with whom ſhe
muſt have a continual conflict, which made <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf to
ſay, I am carnal, ſold under ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 14. carnal, but not
totally, as the unregenerate are, but partly carnal, and partly
ſpiritual: the fleſh luſting againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the fleſh; and therefore he cries out, O wretch that I
am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of ſin: mark what
he ſaith, me, and therefore he ſpeaks in the Perſon of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
man. And this may ſerve to ſatisfie Captain <hi>Smiths</hi>
queſtion, whether <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake in the perſon of a Regenerate,
or unregenerate man, in that he ſaith, who ſhall deliver
me.</p>
               <p>You ſay in the concluſion of the tenth Chapter [it is
manifeſt that all men were, and are, the people of
God, though untill this work of Regeneration is
wrought in them, they do not appear to be of God,
but of the Divel.]</p>
               <p>To the firſt part of this aſſertion, I ſhall only oppoſe that
of <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6, 7, 8. for they are not all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which are of
<hi>Iſrael:</hi> neither becauſe they are the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are
they all children: but in <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhall thy ſeed be called, that
is, they which are the children of the fleſh, theſe are not the
children of God, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To the latter part, wherein you do moſt falſely affirm, that
all ſhall be regenerated, I ſhall only ask when <hi>Cain, Judas,</hi>
or <hi>Julian</hi> were regenerated, or when thoſe that are in priſon,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19, 20. which contemned the preaching of <hi>Noah,</hi>
were regenerated?</p>
               <p>I did think to end, concerning this Chapter; but that
looking back to the middle of this Chapter, I finde ſuch a
kinde of judgement that was never heard of before.</p>

               <p>By which if you mean the converſion of a ſinner, as it
ſeems you do, by your inſtance of the example of St. <hi>Paul,
Acts</hi> 9. that cannot be rightly called a judgement, but is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a great mercy that the Lord ſhould convert ſuch a ſinner

               <p>If you mean the judgement of an evil conſcience, which
accuſes men for ſin, I do confeſs it is a very great judgement,
a very Hell upon earth; and though it be begun here in this
life, it doth not follow, that it ſhall not continue hereafter;
for our Saviour tells us, <hi>Their Worm dieth not, and the fire
is not quenched, Mark</hi> 9. 46. which ſhall be fulfilled after
the great and general day of judgment, then they ſhall be caſt

was inflicted on <hi>Egypt, Sodome,</hi> or on the old world, it
makes not for you, but againſt you, for from thoſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
St. <hi>Peter</hi> proves the great and general day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as you may read, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. Verſe</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>But pray, what ſhall we make of this expreſſion (and is of
the Divel) if we leave out the <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> that Paragraph
is abominable non-ſenſe, if it be taken in, we muſt deſire
your own expoſition; for we can expound it no otherwiſe,

               <p>
                  <hi>Contrary to the very words of Chriſt,</hi> Luke 13. 23, 24.

               <p>Chriſtendome is the leaſt part of the World, and thoſe
that truly profeſs Chriſt are the leaſt part of Chriſtendome,
and of thoſe many are called, few choſen. You may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
you are told in Scripture of the ſeed of the Serpent,
and the ſeed of the Woman, and of the continual enmitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them; from whence proceeds that war, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Dragon, and his Angels; and <hi>Michael</hi> and his
Angels <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 7. but for this you have invented a weak,
and contemptible ſhift;</p>
               <p>ſaying, or at leaſt inſinuating that [by the ſeed of the
Serpent is meant ſin.]</p>
               <p>When it is as apparent as the ſight at Noon-day, that by
the ſeed of the Serpent is meant Satan, and the wicked: for
in what ſenſe the ſeed of the Woman is underſtood, in the
ſame ſence is underſtood the ſeed of the Serpent; but the
ſeed of the Woman is underſtood literally, firſt and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally,
for Chriſt the head of the Church, and then for all
that are his<note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 12. 17.</note> members, and therefore the ſeed of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent

for his Angels, and Inſtruments as Perſecutors, Hereticks,

<hi>Iohn 8. 44. You are of your father the Divel, and the works of
your father you will do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further to confirm this your errour, (as you would have
your followers believe) you alledge ſeveral places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to prove that the benefit of Chriſts death belongs to all,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:38405:27"/>
(as in your former Chapter) the places are <hi>Rom.</hi> 11: 32. 1
<hi>Tim. 2. 4. Io.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
               <p>But all this as I ſaid before is under a condition of faith,
that men do believe, and applie it unto themſelves by the
hand of a true, and a lively faith; to this purpoſe is that of
<hi>Rom. 1. 16. Gal. 3. 22. Iohn 3. 16. Acts</hi> 10. 43: (and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there is a generalitie of them, that believe as there is of

benefit of Chriſts death. <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
Mark</hi> 16. 16. and <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16. as thoſe that were ſtung
with the brazen Serpent, and afterwards looked upon it,
were healed, ſo thoſe that looked not upon it died of their
wounds.</p>
               <p>Among thoſe places of Scripture, which you name to
prove this errour, you alledge <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. but the words are
falſified, and the ſenſe perverted by you. You write the

you extend it to ſinners, to all, and ſo pervert the meaning
of the ſpirit of God.</p>
               <p>By what hath been already ſaid, it appeareth plainly, that
all ſhall not be ſaved; but from generals, we will come to
particulars, and firſt, not all the Jews, neither ſhall all the
Gentiles.</p>
               <p>Not all the Jews. <hi>Though the number of Iſrael be as the
ſand of the Sea,</hi> yet a Remnant ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 27.
which words are taken out of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 20, 21. they were
ſpoken of the deſtruction of Iſrael by <hi>Senacherib,</hi> when <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
only eſcaped of all the land: or elſe of the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

were deſtroyed, and a remnant carried away Captive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Aſſyria:</hi> which is prophetically ſpoken of the time of grace,
wherein moſt of the Jews periſhed through incredulitie, and
hardneſs of heart. The conſideration whereof cauſed the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:38405:28"/>
to wiſh he were cut off from Chriſt, for the Salvation
of ſo great a number that periſhed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 3.</p>
               <p>And as there ſhall not be a univerſal ſalvation of the Jews,
ſo alſo not of the Gentiles, for there is a fulneſs of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
as well as a fulneſs of the Jews; but <hi>Plenitudo haec non
ad numerum cunctorum pertinet, ſed ad numerum a Deo praefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum,
Haymo.</hi> Which is plainly ſhewed in <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 4. where
it is ſaid, that of the <hi>Tribes</hi> were ſealed 144. thouſand, not
that there were no more, or fewer; but he ſets down a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number for an indefinite, 144 thouſand, as a great
number, but what are theſe compared to all the reſt in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
time: there were 600. thouſand fighting men; and in
the dayes of <hi>David</hi> 15. hundred thouſand and more, it is
therefore apparent, that but a remnant, <hi>Rom. 9. 27. Though
the children of Iſrael be as the ſand of the Sea, a Remnant ſhall
be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, a fulneſs of the Gentiles there is alſo. After
that I beheld, and loe a great number of all nations, kindred,
and people, &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 9. he doth not ſay there, that all
nations, and kindred, and people were ſealed; but, a great
multitude of them: which multitude compared to them that
are left, is but as an handful to an harveſt, and as the glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Grapes, when the Vintage is ended, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
himſelf teſtifies, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 14, 15. if a Prince ſhould preſs
throughout his Dominions three, or four out of every pariſh,
and then draw them together, they would be a great army,
or multitude; but then compare them to thoſe which are left,
and they will be but a few, which ſhould warn us to take
heed to our ſelves: the fewer there ſhall be ſaved, the more
careful ſhould we be to make our calling and election ſure,
by well-doing and walking in the wayes of Gods Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements:
and alſo to be thankful to God that hath called us,
and left others, as we ſee many thouſands, that have not the
means of Salvation, both in the eaſt and weſt <hi>Indies:</hi> and
to expreſs our thankfulneſs by our fruitfulneſs, left God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move

end of the World ſhall be called and converted, Chriſt
himſelf hath taught it. But what is this for the ſalvation of
thoſe many thouſands that have died long before from
the time of Chriſt in their infidelity and hardneſſe of heart,
contemning the Goſpel, and blaſpheming his name, doth not
the Apoſtle tell us plainly they ſhall be cut off? and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of branches cut off? are they not caſt into the fire.

by the Scripture, and received by all the Chriſtian Churches
in the World; and this under the colour of a ſpiritual judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which God inflicts upon unbeleevers, and obſtinate
ſinners in this life: as though, becauſe there were an inward
judgement, therefore there ſhould not be an outward, a ſecret
judgement, therefore not an open. Doth not Saint <hi>Paul</hi>

Again, becauſe wicked men have here inward darkneſſe,

22. 23. and 25, 30, or if by judgement you mean regeneration,

that God ſhould take men out of the power of darkneſſe, and
tranſlate them into the kingdome of his dear Son.<note place="margin">Col. 1. 12, 13.</note> And this
judgement (as you call it) is not general but an eſpecial grace

               <p>You object <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. it is appointed for all men once to

               <p>Firſt for the place of Scripture: what can be more plain
and forcible againſt you. It is decreed; where? <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.
<hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:38405:30"/>
ſo it was; for, from that time, he and all his poſteritie were
ſubject unto death, and as death is decreed, ſo is alſo judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
God hath appointed a time, in which he will judge
the world, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31. and this is not before death, as you
would have it, but after death. The words are, after death
comes the judgement; but you ſay this is meant of a ſpiritual
death, a ſilly ſhift; did God appoint that any man ſhould
die the death of ſin? no, he appointed him to die a death for
ſin, and tranſgreſſions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, its manifeſt, the Apoſtle ſpake here of a corporal
death, he anſwers an objection: to wit, if Chriſt be the
<hi>Meſſias;</hi> how comes it to paſs that he died? His anſwer is,
it was appointed for all men to die, and therefore for him:
now I hope you will not be ſo graceleſs, as to ſay, that
Chriſt ever died the death of ſin; and therefore it muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
a death of the body, which he voluntarily ſuffered,
that he might deſtroy him that had power of death, which
was the Divel. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your ſecond objection is taken out of</hi> Iohn 5. 22. The father
judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement to the Son.</p>
               <p>That is, the father judgeth the world in and by the Son:
and he doth it not with partialitie, as do corrupt judges, but
with righteous judgement; for we are ſure that the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God is according to truth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 2. and verſe the
ſixth, who will render to every man according to his deeds,
to them who by patient continuance in well-doing ſeek for
glory, (&amp;c.) Eternal life; but to them that are contentious,
and do not obey the truth, indignation and wrath, &amp;c. and
when? at the day of the Revelation of the righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

and defend one another. Thou leadeſt thy people like Sheep

               <p>Both Magiſtrates and Miniſters are the Lords Shepherds,

               <p>I hope you will not ſay now theſe men were not Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preachers,

               <p>But let me ask you one queſtion, when Chriſt gave unto
his Diſciples the keys of the kingdome of Heaven, wherein
did the power of the keys conſiſt? Was it not in binding as

               <p>You falſely,<note place="margin">Page 61.</note> and impudently ſay, that [Chriſt never
preached damnation to any, but Salvation to all.]</p>
               <p>Certainly you have read Chriſts Sermon upon the Mount,
and it is moſt certain you underſtand it not; for it is plain,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 21 22, 23, 24. and in the 29. <hi>It is better that one of

               <p>That Chriſt was then a fulfilling the Law] which you

but if it were ſo, yet it doth not leſſen your fault,
who have falſely affirmed that Chriſt preached not damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

[Chriſt told the Phariſees, that the kingdome of God was
to be revealed in them,<note place="margin">Page 61.</note> and which ſhould ſuddenly come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, and that they hearing this, demanded of Chriſt
when the kingdome of Heaven ſhould come, alſo that Chriſt

               <p>Now let any one read that Chapter of Woe and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

neither is there any thing like it: and therefore you fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifie
the Scriptures to make a colourable anſwer to that
which is unanſwerable, and what you quote out of the 17.
of <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 21. is ſpoken upon another occaſion, and the
anſwer concerned not the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> but was directed to the

               </p>
               <p>I think there is no man ſo deluded, except your ſelf, as to

               <p>You ſay that [we have no commiſſion from Chriſt,<note place="margin">Page 63.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we preach damnation, which is no Goſpel-meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.]</p>
               <p>This, or to this effect is that you have ſaid at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this Chapter, (Page 61.) already anſwered, but
ſomething more may be ſaid concerning two places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
quoted there in the Margent, which you make the
ground of your objections.</p>
               <p>The firſt is <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 18. which the Evangeliſt takes out of
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1. but a place that makes not for you, but is full a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
you; for it is not general, but to the poor, to them

               <p>The whore of Babylon is the Malignant Church, the Corps

as Gold, Silver, and Pearl, to difference her from the <hi>Church

               <p>She hath in her fore-head the name of Myſtery: in her

as you have done, ſhe rages againſt the truth, and thoſe

               <p>I ſhould now wonder at your impudence, but that Saint <hi>Paul</hi>

Creatures, but a lover of man: now though he love al mankind
as appears by his Protecting, and ſuſteining them; yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied, but he loveth ſome of mankinde more then the
reſt, becauſe he hath ſhewed greater effects of his love to ſome

called, juſtified and glorified them; ſo that the love
he bears to others, whom he hath not elected, called, &amp;c.

much is given, of him much is required.</p>
               <p>Concerning univerſal Redemption. I know there be ſome
places of Scripture that do ſeemingly make for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19. God was in Chriſt reconciling the world
unto himſelf.</p>
               <p>1 Tim. 24. Who will have all men to be ſaved.

whole world.</p>
               <p>Now mark the Places that are againſt univerſal redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and then I will reconcile them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As Matth. 26. 28. &amp; Mark.</hi> 14. 24. This is my blood of
the new Teſtament, which is ſhed for many.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 28. He gave his life a ranſom for many.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. Chriſt was once offered to bear the ſinnes of
many.</p>
               <p>John 11. 52. (there it is ſaid that) <hi>Chriſt ſhould gather
in one the Children of God that were ſcattered abroad</hi>
(which are onely his elect for whom he is ſaid to lay
down his life)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 15. I lay down my life for the Sheep, <hi>(not for the

               <p>Is the Scripture therefore centrary to ſcripture? or the
Word againſt the Word? no ſuch matter: one ſhort diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

Chriſt was one of them? I wonder, I ſay, to what purpoſe:
<hi>you will ſay,</hi> to prove that all men ſhall be ſaved, for this is
the ſubject of the whole Chapter; then the ſumme of the
argument muſt be this, (ten Lepers were cured by Chriſt,
and but one of them returned to give thanks, therefore all
ſhall be ſaved) a goodly concluſion. But had you any inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
or love to truth, you would have argued (as any School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy
would have done) thus [ten Lepers were healed by
Chriſt, and but one of them returned to give thanks, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
but one of them ſhall be ſaved, is not this the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
of the two? Seeing Chriſt himſelf hath taught us;
<hi>that few are they that ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mat. 7. 14.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">Page 68.</note> you ſay [that this Doctrine of the love of God
to all men, is the only means to keep them from ſin.]</p>
               <p>This is a way, both diſagreeable to the word, and will of
God, and alſo to reaſon.</p>
               <p>That it is to the word of God, I have already ſufficiently
proved, yet I will adde more. <hi>Jude 22, 23. And of ſome
have compaſſion making a difference: and others ſave with
fear, pulling them out of the fire.</hi> Thoſe that ſin, either out
of weakneſs of judgement,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 1.</note> or want of ſtrength are to be
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:38405:40"/>
gently dealt with; but thoſe that ſin out of wilfulneſs are
ſharply to be reproved, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 13.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Peter</hi> did <hi>Simon Magus Acts</hi> 8. 20. 21, 22, 23. or as
<hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Elymas</hi> the ſorcerer, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 10, 11. when wounds
are corrupted and ſtink, they ought firſt to be cleanſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we pour in Balm, otherwiſe we ſhall heal them deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
like falſe Prophets (ſuch as your ſelf is) <hi>Jerem.</hi> 6. 14.
<hi>They have healed the hurt of the Daughter of my people ſlightly,
ſaying, peace, peace, when there is no peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is alſo diſagreeable to reaſon: ſuppoſe a man to have
two ſons, on which he hath a large Patrimony to beſtow:
and being committed to the care of a Tutor, one of them
proves a Prodigal (I mean not ſuch a Prodigal, as is return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from his evil wayes, but) an incorrigible one, that is, in
the full career of Vice; his Tutor intending (as in duty
bound) to reclaim him, tells him his father beareth a great
deal of love towards him, and (notwithſtanding his evil
courſes) cannot, will not diſinherit him, and much more
to this purpoſe: will any one think, that this is the beſt and
moſt rational courſe to reclaim him? Surely, no, but rather
a means to increaſe his licentiouſneſs: a good Tutor will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a ſevere and contracted brow command him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
telling him he underſtands his fathers Will is ſuch,
that if he lead ſuch an extravagant and exorbitant courſe of
life, he muſt expect to be diſinherited.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe a man hath a bad ſervant and a good; one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth
his Talent; the other, that is the bad ſervant, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
his in the ground, ſhall he notwithſtanding his unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableneſs
be ſoothed up, and aſſured, that at his Maſters
comming,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 21.</note> he ſhall be rewarded with a <hi>well done, good and
faithful ſervant, thou hast been faithful over a few things, I
will make thee Ruler over many things: enter thou into thy
Masters joy?</hi> the Scripture ſaith no, and reaſon too can
ſay no otherwiſe, I ſuppoſe your learning never amounted to
the underſtanding of the old Verſes.</p>

labour all they can to pull it down.</p>
               <p>For our calling, we have not taken it up of our ſelves, (as
did the ſons of <hi>Sceva, Acts</hi> 19.) but from Chriſt, though
not immediately, yet ſucceſſively, and thus I prove it.</p>
               <p>Chriſt the ſon of God, the promiſed <hi>Meſſias,</hi> was ſent
of his father to be the Miniſter of the Reconciliation; and
<hi>therefore he is called the Biſhop of our ſouls,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 25.</p>

               <p>Now as he was ſent by the father, ſo did he ſend others:
firſt he choſe his Diſciples, inſtructed them, and ſent them
out to preach unto the Jews: afterwards being to leave
them, he ſent them unto all the World, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. and
that they might be the better able to do it, he gave them po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
from above, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 1, 2. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now of theſe ſome are Miniſters of the Circumciſion, and
ſome of the uncircumciſion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe ordained</hi> Presbyters <hi>in every Church,</hi> Acts 14. 23.
<hi>and when they were to depart, they left</hi> Titus <hi>in</hi> Creet, Tit.

charge to provide for ſucceſſion,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 2. the things that
thou haſt heard of me among many witneſſes, the ſame commit
thou to faithful men, who ſhall be able to teach others alſo.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, what they did in <hi>Creet</hi> and <hi>Epheſus,</hi> they did
in others places, as appears by the Teſtimony of <hi>Clement,</hi>

the firſt fruits of prime beleevers, for Biſhops and
Deacons.</p>
               <p>Such a calling then there was, and not arbitrary, men are
not to run without ſending, as falſe Prophets uſe to do Jer. 23.
21. <hi>I have not ſent theſe Prophets, yet they ran: I have not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
unto them, yet they Propheſied,</hi> and yet a calling is pretended,
but it is ſuch a one as had the prieſt of <hi>Micah Jud.</hi> 17. or thoſe
Prieſts of <hi>Jeroboam. 1 Kin.</hi> 12. 31.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that are truely called, are firſt to be tried, and then
ordained, their trial is to approve their gifts, and their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to give them power, without which no man ought to
preach. Rom. 10. 15. Heb. 5. 4.</p>
               <p>You, and others (not much unlike you) pretend highly to
gifts, (it were well if thoſe you have were imployed to the beſt
advantage) the emptyeſt Ears of corn do ever carry themſelves
higheſt. <hi>Phaeton</hi> though he was able to drive the Chariot of
the Sun, as the ſtory goes; but by his unskilfulneſſe ſet the
world on fire, ſuch as you are, are very much concerned in
the <hi>Moral</hi> of it, being inſtruments onely fit to ſet on fire
<hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> as ſad experience tells us. If there were
any ſuch gifts really in you, as is pretended, why
is there not an application to thoſe that are impowred by
God in the Church, to try the gifts and manners of men,
ſo that if there were ſuch a qualification as is required in you,
ye might not want ordination. It cannot be denied, that ever
there were more Gifts, then were powred on the Chriſtians
in the primitive times; and yet thoſe that thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
fit for the function were content to ſubmit themſelves
to examination, and take ordination from them that had
power, as may be collected out of 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 10. Let them firſt
be proved &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if men like not of this, or be not liked and approved,

               </list>
               <p>And therefore your Allorizing is abſurd and erroneous
moſt repugnant to the meaning of the Prophet in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whoſe intention is to ſhew, that God will deſtroy the
wicked, who are but as briers and thorns, when they ſet
themſelves in battle againſt him: he will break through them
and conſume them, as fire doth wood.</p>
               <p>Here that place in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 6, 7. is alſo brought to garniſh
your errour, and in this manner. <hi>God cauſed a Seraphim with
a coal from the Alter to touch the mouth of the Prophet, to take
his iniquity away (whom he was about to ſend on his meſſage,
and fit for his calling)</hi> therefore God will purge lips, and take
away the iniquity of the reprobate and falſe Prophets. A
goodly concluſion, is it not? it ſeems plainly your lips have not
been touched with ſuch a coal; that you utter ſuch abominable
falſities, and ſo abuſe the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>You reach in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 3. to maintain the ſame errour; but
to what purpoſe, let the world judge. The Prophet there
ſhews, that when Chriſt ſhould come: he ſhould refine his
ſilver, that is, his Church the ſons of Levi the pureſt of his
Silver; for even they ſtood in need of purifying: now can
the reprobate be called the pureſt of his ſilver? your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
deſerves to be hiſt at rather then anſwered. Read the
5. verſe following, and there you ſhal finde that Chriſt takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
courſe with them, where it is ſaid I will come neer to
you to judgement, I will be a ſwift witneſſe againſt the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers,

you may ſee it is againſt the perſons, not againſt their ſins, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable

               <p>
                  <hi>Your laſt Proofe is</hi> Reve. 15. 8. And the Temple was

               <p>I will firſt ſhew the true meaning of the place, and then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the unfitneſſe of your Allegory.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of God in the 14. Chapter foretells the day
of judgement (verſe 19, 20.) but before the coming of the
great and terrible day of the Lord, he ſignifies ſeveral hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
judgements that ſhould fall upon the kingdom of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Chriſt
Chap. 16.</p>
               <p>Now that they might know theſe judgements came not
by chance, he ſhews from whence they came, and that was
from the Temple of God, from above, ver. 5. which Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was filled with ſmoke, which ſignifies the glory of God,
as in 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>1. He doth it to admoniſh us, that we pry not too narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into Gods judgements, for they are incomprehenſible; but
to wait untill the day when all ſecrets ſhall be made manifeſt

               <p>Let us See now what your Allegory can deduce from
this.</p>
               <p>Becauſe God, before the day of judgement, will ſend ſeven
fearful Plagues from above upon the earth, that is, upon the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers

               <p>In this Chapter you tax the Magiſtrates and miniſters for

ſuch companions as you, to be the firſt accuſers, that thereby

againſt you, but onely by the relation of them; yet
not ſo much to ſome of the perſons, but that I know them to
be men of that integrity, that they would not wrong you, as
the event will queſtionleſſe make manifeſt.</p>
               <p>And whereas you ſay you are charged for being a Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer,
it is evident you are ſo, and therefore cannot juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
complain of any injuſtice done you in that particular; for

For we know there is a ſpiritual witchcraft, and Satan doth

3. 1. making them beleeve they are, what they are not: hence
it came to paſſe, that many falſe Chriſts, falſe Prophets, and
falſe Apoſtles; when they were nothing elſe but devils in
<hi>Samuels</hi> mantle. I remember two notable examples I have
read of to this purpoſe, the one of old, the other of late, that
of old is in <hi>Euſebius lib. 5. Cap.</hi> 14. of <hi>Montanus</hi> the Heretick,
who being ſtrongly deluded by the Spirit of errour, uttered
ſtrange Doctrines contrary to the truth, and yet boaſted that
he had the ſpirit, and the gift of Propheſie, as alſo did his two
trulls calling themſelves Propheteſſes, when they were delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

for <hi>Judas</hi> like they became their own Executioners.</p>
               <p>The ſecond example ſhall be that of wicked <hi>Hacket, Copping</hi>
