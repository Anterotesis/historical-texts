            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BY yours of the <hi>12th</hi> of this Inſtant, writ to Sir
<hi>R. S.</hi> I perceive you never heard, that ſince
this happy Revolution, any proof was made
in Detection of the moſt Treacherous and
Barbarous Murther of that Great, but unhappy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot,
<hi>Arthur</hi> late Earl of <hi>Eſſex:</hi> Wherefore according
to the Commands laid upon me, I ſhall as briefly as
I well can, give you an Abſtract of the moſt materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Depoſitions which in that Matter have been made;
and upon what Information I firſt moved, and for
what Reaſons I did ingage in the Proſecution. In
this <hi>Compendium,</hi> I ſhall refer you to a large Diſcourſe,
Intituled, <hi>Eſſex's Innocency and Honour Vindicated</hi> (in a
Letter to a Friend) printed above two Years ſince;
and by your Nephew <hi>B<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> it will be ſhortly brought you.</p>
            <p>The late Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was committed to the
Tower, <hi>Tueſday</hi> the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>July 1683. Bomeny,</hi> his
own Servant, was immediately attending on his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
<hi>Monday,</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> were the two Warders, who
(by turns) ſtood, one at his Lordſhip's Chamber-Door,
the other at the Stairs-foot; and <hi>Floyd</hi> (a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier)
Centinel at the Houſe-Door, under the Earl's
Chamber-window, <hi>Vide</hi> Letter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 2. <hi>Friday</hi>
then next following, his Lordſhip was (falſely) ſaid
to cut his Throat. To prove which (pretended)
Self-Murther, <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> on the then next day,
depoſed before the Coroner in Subſtance, <hi>That the
Earl of</hi> Eſſex, <hi>in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſs than half an Hour before he was found
dead, had a Razor delivered him to pair his Nails: with
which Razor, his Lordſhip retired into a little Cloſet, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſoon after being opened. 
The Earl was there found with his Throat cut,</hi> (Both Jugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
being divided,) <hi>and the Razor lying by the Body.</hi> L. p. 2.</p>
            <p>This Evidence for the Self-Murther is detected in
every part; For it appears by the many Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
between <hi>Bomeny, Ruſſel,</hi> and <hi>Monday,</hi> and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of many Witneſſes; <hi>Firſt, That there was no
Razor delivered my Lord, nor found by him in the Cloſet,
but laid there after his Death, to colour the Self-Murther.
Secondly, That the Earl's Body was not lockt into the Cloſet.</hi>
For the firſt of theſe, <hi>Bomeny</hi> in his firſt Oath, depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
That he did not deliver the Razor till the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his Lordſhip died, <hi>L. p.</hi> 34. and in his his ſecond
Oath (taken within a few hours of the firſt) He
ſaith, he delivered the Razor the Day before his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's
Death; L. p. 3. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſwears the Razor was
delivered in leſs than half an Hour before my Lord
was found dead; L. p. 4. and often declared, that
he ſaw it delivered by <hi>Bomeny,</hi> after <hi>Monday</hi> had left
my Lord's Chamber; But <hi>Monday</hi> affirms, That his
Lordſhip had the Razor about 3 hours before he was
found dead; and above 2 hours before <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſtood at
his Lordſhip's Chamber-door, that Morning the Earl
died; L. p. 35. and 36. Theſe Contradictions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the credit of each other, and conſequently
prove the falſity of all. That there was no Razor
lockt in with the Body, is evident; for two Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
they ſaw a bloody Razor thrown out of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's
Chamber-window (which is 16 foot diſtant
from the Cloſet) before the Earl was known to be
dead, L. p. 40, 41, 42. and <hi>Floyd</hi> confeſſed he ſaw
the Razor ſo thrown out. <hi>Webſter,</hi> one of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<hi>Ruffians</hi> (whom <hi>Floyd</hi> declared he let into the
Earl's Lodging a little before his Lordſhip's Death,
L. p. 41.) owned, That he himſelf threw the Razor
out; and being asked the Reaſon, replied, he was then
under a conſternation, and knew not what he did,
L. p. 42. Several that were in the <hi>Tower</hi> that Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
my Lord died, depoſed, That it was commonly
diſcours'd in the <hi>Tower,</hi> juſt after my Lord's Death,
That there was a bloody Razor thrown out of the
Chamber-window, before ever it was known my
Lord was dead, L. p. 42. I perceive moſt are to
ſeek of the Reaſon wherefore this Razor was ſo thrown
out, which might be what follows. The <hi>Ruffians</hi>
having murthered the Earl, before they laid all things
in that poſture they deſigned they ſhould be found,
by ſuch as ſhould come to ſee the Earl's Body; A
Perſon coming up Stairs, theſe Varlets were ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with fear, having not finiſhed <hi>that Tragical Scene,</hi>
as they deſigned to have left it. Under this Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
one of the <hi>Ruffians</hi> threw the Razor out of the
Window. This was not politickly done, but it's to
be conſidered that what is the Effect of ſurprizing
fear and conſternation (as this action was) is not
cunningly and judicially executed; for this I have ſome
ground; and the Truth time may diſcover. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
That the Body was not lockt into the Cloſet;
<hi>Bomeny</hi> firſt ſwore that he knocking at my Lord's
Cloſet-door, and calling, <hi>My Lord;</hi> his Lordſhip
not anſwering, he (himſelf) puſhed the Door open,
and there ſaw the Body, L. p. 35. In his ſecond De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
taken the ſame Day, he depoſed, That when
he knockt at the Cloſet-door, and called, <hi>My Lord;</hi>
his Lordſhip not anſwering, he peep'd through a
Chink and ſaw blood, and part of the Razor, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
(without opening the Door) he called <hi>Ruſſel,</hi>
and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> puſhed the Door open, L<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 3. This puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuppoſes violence; but <hi>Ruſſel</hi> depoſed, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
opened the Cloſet door, the Key being
on the outſide, L. p. 4. and ſpeaks of no difficulty
in it; whereas <hi>Monday</hi> gives the Lie to both <hi>Bomeny</hi>
and <hi>Ruſſel;</hi> amd declared that my Lord's Body lay
ſo cloſe and ſtrong againſt the Cloſet-door, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Bomeny</hi> or <hi>Ruſſel</hi> could open the Door; but he
himſelf coming to the Door, and being much ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than either of the two former, put his ſhoulder
againſt the door, and thruſting with all his might,
broke it open, L. p. 35. This Relation ſtuft with
Contradictions, argues the whole is falſe, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
For whenſoever two or more Deponents pretend
to be Co-witneſſes of a Fact (as in this caſe <hi>Bomeny,
Monday</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> do) and they materially contradict
each other (as is herein moſt notorious) it's evident
all is forg'd. This rational concluſion was drawn by
<hi>Daniel,</hi> from the contradictory charge of the two
Elders againſt <hi>Suſannah.</hi> That the Cloſet was,
or could be lockt upon the Body, is falſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived,
as appears by the Oath of ſuch who coming
up to my Lord's Chamber juſt after his death was
firſt diſcoverd; they obſerved the Legs, part out of
of the Cloſet (ſo that the Cloſet-door could not
poſſibly be then faſt) and a bloody foot was ſeen
imprinted on my Lord's Stocking, L. p. 40. This
in contradiction of that Evidence, which would
prove his Lordſhip a Self-Murtherer. I ſhall now give
you ſome farther Teſtimony to prove the Earl Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly
murthered.</p>
            <p>D. S <hi>in ſubſtance depoſed, that in</hi> July 83, <hi>ſhe was Servant to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41940:2"/>
one</hi> Mr. <hi>Holmes</hi> (a notorious bigotted Papiſt) <hi>and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
9 Days before my Lord of</hi> Eſſex'<hi>s Death, She over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
ſeveral Papiſts declare at the Houſe of the ſaid</hi> Holmes,
<hi>That the Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>was ſo averſe to their Intereſt, that
he muſt be taken off; and that they had been with His
Highneſs (the late King) and His Highneſs was firſt for
poyſoning the ſaid Earl, but that manner of death was
objected againſt; it was then propoſed to His Highneſs, that
the Earl ſhould be ſtabbed; but that was not liked; at laſt
His Highneſs concluded, and ordered his Throat to be
cut; and His Highneſs had promiſed to be there when it was
done. About 6 Days before his death, ſome of the ſame
Conſult, at the ſame place declared, that it was reſolved
the Earl's Throat ſhould be cut; but it would be given out,
he had done it himſelf, and whoſoever ſhould deny that,
ſhould be taken up and puniſhed. The very Day this Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was committed, and after it was done, one of theſe
Villains leaped about</hi> Holmes'<hi>s Parlour for joy, and</hi> Holmes
<hi>coming into the Room, he ſtruck</hi> Holmes <hi>on the Back,
and cried, The Feat was done, and he could not but laugh
to think how like a Fool the Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>look'd when they
come to cut his Throat,</hi> L<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 23, 24. That this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was not invented upon this Revolution to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe
the late King, many Witneſſes have depoſed,
That this ſervant gave them the Subſtance of this
Account ſome years before the late King abdicated;
and that theſe Deponents cautioned her to ſecrecy,
L. p. 23, 24. To avoid this Charge of <hi>D. S.</hi> Mr.
<hi>Holmes</hi> procured 2 Witneſſes. Mrs. <hi>Hewet,</hi> a violent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,
and the other of a looſe Character, to depoſe that
in <hi>April</hi> before the Earl's Death, this <hi>D. S.</hi> was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away from <hi>Holmes</hi>'s Houſe upon Suſpicion of
Theft; and from <hi>April</hi> 1683, to 9 Months after, one
<hi>Elizabeth Cadman</hi> was ſervant with the ſaid <hi>Holmes;</hi>
and no other ſervant there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
L. p. 24. But it's depoſed by 6 Witneſſes, That <hi>D. S.</hi>
was ſervant with <hi>Holmes</hi> about the time of the Earl's
Death, L. p. 24, 25. and it's proved, continued there
a Servant ſometime after his Lordſhip's death, L. p.
25. <hi>Hewet</hi> further ſwore, That on the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>July</hi>
1683; She went out of Town with <hi>Holmes,</hi> and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
out with him till the <hi>23th</hi> of the ſame Month;
but in contradiction to this part, it's depoſed by a
Taylor, That the very Week my Lord died, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
a Duſt-Gown to Mrs. <hi>Hewet,</hi> then in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi>
this appears by the Taylor's Book, to which he
hath ſworn, L. p. 25. but Mrs. <hi>Hewet</hi> told this Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
to this effect; That if he did ſwear this, he would
prove her Brother <hi>Holmes</hi> in Town (when ſhe had
ſwore him above 60 miles off) and that her Brother
was then a dead Man, L. p. 26. Thus <hi>Holmes</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
appears falſe in every part. And where a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
is detected to be falſe, it's not uncharitable to
conclude that the Charge is true. As a farther Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to confirm the Conſult to murther my Lord;
and that His late Majeſty the then Duke of <hi>York,</hi> was
to be there when it was to be done, it's proved by 8
Witneſſes, that it was reported, at ſeveral remote places
in <hi>England,</hi> ſometime before the Earl was dead; That the
Earl had cut his Throat in the <hi>Tower,</hi> L. p. 26, 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
at one of theſe places, <hi>(viz.) Andover</hi> about 60 Miles
from <hi>London,</hi> the very next Day after the Earl was
committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and two days before the King
and Duke went to the <hi>Tower,</hi> it was declared; <hi>That
the Earl being Priſoner in the</hi> Tower, <hi>and underſtanding
the King and Duke were come into the</hi> Tower, <hi>his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
was afraid His then Majeſty would have come into his
Chamber, which the Earl could not bear the thoughts of;
and therefore cut his Throat, to avoid it,</hi> L. p. 27. None
but the moſt ſecret in that horrid Contrivance, who
knew the King and Duke were to be in the <hi>Tower,</hi>
when the Earl was to be murthered, or had it from
ſuch as were acquainted with the whole Contrivance,
could report two days before the Earl's Death, that his
Lordſhip cut his Throat when the King and Duke
were in the <hi>Tower;</hi> for the King and the Duke had
been together in the <hi>Tower</hi> but once in 25 Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and their going the day my Lord died, was a
ſurprize to the very Yeomen of the Guard; many of
which, about five in the Morning were called out of
their Beds to attend His Majeſty and Duke into the <hi>Tower.</hi>
All theſe reports of the Earl's Death before he was
indeed dead, agreed in the manner how [cutting his

urged by the Papiſts, after his death, as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
for the Self-Murther. All this ſtrongly
proves, that the manner, place, and pretended reaſon,
were ſome time before my Lord's Death (or indeed
commitment to the <hi>Tower)</hi> agreed upon; for it could

Witneſſes, That on the Day of my Lord's Death,
two Soldiers (ſince taken off to prevent their diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very)
declar'd they ſaw the then Duke ſend two
<hi>Ruffians</hi> into the Earl's Lodgings, and theſe two Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains
were obſerved to return to his then Highneſs,
before the Earl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Death was known; and as they
came near him, they ſmiled, and ſaid, <hi>The Buſineſs was
done;</hi> upon which the then Duke ſeemed well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
<hi>Floyd</hi> the Centinel confeſſed, that by ſpecial Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
he let in two or three Men, of which <hi>Webſter</hi> a
Bailiff was one, into my Lord's Lodgings juſt before
his death; that he heard them going into my Lord's
Chamber, upon which he ſoon obſerved a great noiſe
and trampling; a little after which, it was pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat. Whilſt this
Centinel was in <hi>Newgate,</hi> as ſuſpected privy to my
Lord's Murther, he deſired liberty to ſend for a
Neighbour, which being granted by the Lords of the
Committee; This Soldier after he had often enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Neighbour to be true to him, declared, <hi>That he
was much troubled that he had confeſſed the letting in theſe
men to my Lord; for tho' it was indeed true, it was what
he ſhould not have owned,</hi> L. p. 28. Whilſt theſe <hi>Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians</hi>
were thus ſtruggling with my Lord, one <hi>E. B.</hi>
ſaw three or four men buſtling together in my Lord's
Chamber; and ſhe heard one of them crying out ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
loud and dolefully, Murther, murther, murther;
and this ſhe ſoon diſcovered to one Mr. <hi>P.</hi> who did
immediately caution her to ſecrecy, becauſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
thereof would be her ruin, <hi>L. p.</hi> 29.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>P.</hi> hath in this reſpect confirmed the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <hi>E. B.</hi> So that this Evidence appears to be no
new-made Story, <hi>L. p.</hi> 29.</p>
            <p>That his Lordſhip by his ſtruggling, endeavoured
to prevent their cutting his Throat, appears by five
Cuts that were obſerved on his right Hand, <hi>L. p.</hi> 45.</p>
            <p>The many and groſs irregular Practices, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the Coroner's Inquiſition, are further Proofs
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41940:2"/>
of my Lords being Murther'd; and theſe Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
committed Contrary to the then King's Order;
for as ſoon as King <hi>Ch.</hi> heard of the Earls Death, he
did immediately ſend a Gentleman to order that all
things ſhould remain in thoſe Circumſtances the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
was firſt found dead, till the Coroners Jury had
ſat upon the Body; but notwithſtanding this poſitive
Order from the then King, the Body was ſoon ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of the Cloſet, and that very day the Body
was ſtript, the Cloathes carried away, and the Room
and Cloſet waſh'd; and the next day, when the Jury
ſat, one of the Jury inſiſted upon ſeeing my Lord's
Cloathes in which he dyed; whereupon the Coroner
was ſent for into the next room to the Jury, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his return told the Jury it was the Body, and not
the Cloaths they were to ſit upon; the Body
was there, and that was ſufficient, <hi>L. p.</hi> 44. Now,
had the Cloaths been produced, the print of the
bloody Foot before obſerved, would have appeared,
and that my Lord's Cravat in the Neck was cut in
three parts, beſides other Circumſtances in the Cloaths,
which might have prov'd the Reſiſtance made by the
Earl to prevent his being Murder'd, had they been
produced. Whilſt the Jury was ſitting, one of them
ſaid to this Effect, That he had heard the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> was a very Good, Sober, and Religious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and therefore this Action was very unlike that
Character. Whereupon Major <hi>Hawley</hi> (at whoſe
Houſe my Lord was Murder'd) in ſubſtance tells
the Jury, (and this Man who thus ſpake in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar)
That whoſoever thought that Self-murder was
not like the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Character, did not well
know <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
intimately acquainted with the Earl, knew that it
was his Lordſhips fix'd Principle, That any Man
might (and ought rather to) cut his own Throat
than be brought to an Infamous Death; wherefore
this Action was according to the Earl's avowed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
<hi>L. p.</hi> 46. But when Major <hi>Hawley</hi> was ask'd
before the Lords of the Cloſe Committee, how he
knew this to be my Lords avowed Principle, <hi>Hawley</hi>
proteſted he did never hear it ſaid to be my Lords
Principle, till their Lordſhips charged him with having
ſuggeſted it to the Jury, and that he could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
do for this further reaſon, becauſe he was not
near the Jury all that time they ſat upon this Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.
<hi>Hawley</hi>'s now denying the ſuggeſting to the
Jury this pretended Principle of my Lord, argues,
That this pretended Principle was a Forgery, and
contriv'd to corrupt the Jury with a belief of the
Self-Murder. The Jury were for adjourning their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition,
and giving notice to my Lord's Relations,
ſo that if any thing could be proved on my Lord's
behalf, it might be heard. But to prevent this,
<hi>Hawley</hi> tells the Jury, That the then King had ſent
for their Inquiſition, and declared he would not riſe
from the Council-Board till rheir Inquiſition was
brought him; wherefore they muſt diſpatch out of
hand, <hi>L. p.</hi> 46. This being creditted, they made
all imaginable haſt, and did not take that time they
would otherwiſe have done. <hi>Hawley</hi> being asked
who came from the King, thus to haſten the Jury,
proteſted he never heard that any Perſon was ſo
ſent; neither did he declare this to the Jury, nor
could he do it, for he was not near them all the time
they were upon the Inquiſition. But the Coroner,
and all the Jury very well knew <hi>Hawley;</hi> and it is
ſworn he was with them, and made uſe of thoſe
Suggeſtions beforementioned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hawley</hi>'s denial, That he was near the Jury, argues
his being conſcious that he was with them to a
very ill purpoſe. It being a general Obſervation,
That whenſoever a Perſon is charged with a Crime at
a certain place, and he poſitively denies his having
been at that place, when the Crime is ſaid to be
committed; if ſuch his denial prove falſe, and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by undoubted Evidence, that he was at the
place when the Fact was done, it is taken for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that he was there to do what he is charged to
have done. A falſe Defence ſtill argues a true
Charge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lloyd</hi> the Centinel, the day he was firſt ſeiz'd as
ſuſpected privy to this Murder, declared, That when
the Men came to my Lord's Lodgings juſt before
his Death, <hi>Monday,</hi> or Major <hi>Hawley</hi> ordered him to
ſuffer the three Men to come in, <hi>L. p.</hi> 27.</p>
            <p>To avoid this Suſpicion, Major <hi>Hawley</hi> declared
before the Lords of the Cloſe Committee, that he
went out of his own houſe about four or five of the
Clock that morning, and came not near his own
Houſe till after my Lord's Death, when <hi>Monday</hi> the
Warder, came and gave him notice of that Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
but it was poſitively ſworn by one (that
paſſed by Major <hi>Hawley</hi>'s Houſe about eight of the
Clock that Morning, which was a little before my
Lords death) that he ſaw the Major then go into his
own Houſe, <hi>L. p.</hi> 32.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Webſter</hi> (beforementioned) one day very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing
his Wife (or Whore), ſhe told him (to this
effect). <hi>That he was a Fool, as well as a Rogue, to treat
her ſo, conſidering he knew it was within her Power to hang
him, and one in the</hi> Tower, L. p. 44.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Webſter</hi> the <hi>very day</hi> my Lord was Murder'd,
<hi>produced a very fine Cambrick Pocket-Hankerchief, mark'd
with an</hi> E. <hi>and a</hi> Coronet. The Hankerchief was
very Bloody, and this Barbarous Wretch ſhak'd it,
and with a great rejoycing, cried out, <hi>Here is the
Blood of a Traytor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day after the Earls Murder, this Fellow
(before that time miſerably poor) produced a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Purſe which he ſhook before a Neigbour of his,
<hi>and out of the Purſe told Forty nine</hi> Guineas, <hi>and a</hi>
Piſtol.</p>
            <p>But it ſeems he had a far greater Sum than this;
for (ſometime after his Lordſhips Murder) his Wife,
being upbraided with her Husbands Poverty, reply'd,
<hi>My Husband not long ſince had five hundred Guinea's,</hi>
L. 44.</p>
            <p>This is probable enough, conſidering the great
Sums of Money this vile Fellow was obſerv'd to play
away ſhortly after the Earl's death, for (it's believed,
by thoſe that obſerv'd his then loſing, that) he
loſt above 400 <hi>l.</hi> within twelve Months next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Lordſhips Murder: <hi>Male parta, male diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buntur.</hi>
Ill got, ill ſpent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sometime after the Earls Death,</hi> Holmes <hi>(as before
accuſed of being privy thereunto) abuſing his Wife,
ſhe was over-heard to tell him,</hi> He was a Murderous
Rogue, and he well-knew ſhe could hang him when ſhe
pleas'd. <hi>To which</hi> Holmes <hi>anſwer'd,</hi> That he little
thought ſhe would have ſpoken of it, who of all the World
had the leaſt Reaſon. <hi>For ſaid this Scurrilous Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi>
You Bitch, you Whore, don't you remember I bought
you a good Sattin-Gown and Petticoat, and therefore you
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41940:3"/>
above all the World ought not to prate. <hi>But ſhe repli'd,</hi>
You are a Murderous Rogue for all that.</p>
            <p>The many ill Practices, violent Proſecutions, and
indeed barbarous Murders that have been committed
to avoid a diſcovery of my Lord's Murder, are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtrong preſumptions of that Barbarous Cruelty:
Of the firſt ſort we have a remarkable Inſtance in this
particular, <hi>(viz.)</hi> When the Coroners Inquiſition, and
the Depoſitions of <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> were carri'd in
all haſte to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> in order to their immediate
Publication; upon reading and comparing theſe
new Informations, it was found that they did (in
point of time) materially contradict each other;
wherefore to make their Relations in this reſpect, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to the World more conſonant to each other
into <hi>Bomeny</hi>'s Depoſition theſe words were foiſted,
<hi>(viz.) on</hi> Friday <hi>the Thirteenth Inſtant;</hi> wherefore
the then Authority might properly be ſaid to have
forg'd an Information. For upon the leaſt Alteration
of, or Addition to what was ſworn by <hi>Bomeny,</hi> it
ceaſed to be his Depoſition.</p>
            <p>Whomſoever the then Authority pitch'd upon to
peruſe and reconcile <hi>Ruſſels</hi> and <hi>Bomenys</hi> Depoſitions, ſo
that they might not appear to the World inconſiſtent
with each other, 'tis plain he was not qualified for that
Service; for the words (before obſerv'd, to be added
by this Reconciler) are foiſted into <hi>Bomeny</hi>'s Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
without the leaſt congruity to Senſe and Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar;
As at large appears in <hi>L. p.</hi> 48.</p>
            <p>It matter'd not how contradictory <hi>Bomeny</hi> and
<hi>Ruſſell</hi> were in their Oaths before the Coroner, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they appear to publick view in a credible
Dreſs For thoſe Originals being kept by the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
it could not appear to the World, that either
of theſe printed Depoſitions was different from what
was indeed ſworn; 'twas taken for granted that the
Coroner durſt not contradict what Authority had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to be printed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert Meake,</hi> a Soldier in the <hi>Tower</hi> when my
Lord was Murder'd, (and that very day diſcovered
to ſeveral Friends what he knew of the matter) the
next Morning after the Earl's Death, deſired thoſe
(to whom he had made that diſcovery) not to reveal
the leaſt of what he had told them with relation to
my Lord's Death: <hi>For</hi> (ſaid <hi>Meake) this very Morning
ſeveral Soldiers were called together, and by our Officer
enjoyned (under ſevere Threats, not to make known any
thing of what we ſaw or heard, with reference to my
Lord's Death.</hi> And therefore he was undone if they
ſhould declare what he had the day before told
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it ſeems it was ſoon known or ſuſpected by my
Lord's murtherers, that</hi> Meake <hi>had revealed his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in this Matter; and therefore they were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to take him off, to prevent his farther Relation; of
which this poor Soldier being very ſenſible; the
very Day he was murthered, he came to ſeveral of his
acquaintance, and told them,</hi> That he found he went in
danger of his life; and he was afraid he ſhould be murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for diſcovering what he knew as to my Lord's Murther;
wherefore he deſired thoſe his Friends to keep him company
that very Day, for he much fear'd he ſhould that very day
be taken off; but his friends dreading the danger themſelves
might be in whilſt in his Company, refuſed to go with him,
and that very Night this honeſt Soldier (who was common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known in the Tower and amongſt his acquaintance, by the
Name of honeſt <hi>Robin)</hi> was thrown into the <hi>Tower-ditch;</hi>
and the then next Morning there found dead, <hi>L. p.</hi> 49.</p>
            <p>There was one Mr. <hi>Hawley,</hi> a Warder in the <hi>Tower,</hi>
that Morning the Earl died, who the day Mr. <hi>Speak</hi>
and I were Tried, declared, That he <hi>knew Mr.</hi> Braddon
<hi>could know nothing of the matter; which a Gentleman ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving,
ſaid to</hi> Hawley, <hi>If you know Mr.</hi> Braddon <hi>knows
nothing, what muſt you know then?</hi> To which Mr. <hi>Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
made no reply.</p>
            <p>But this Warder's knowledge in the Matter, coſt
him dear; for about <hi>March</hi> next after the Earl's
Death, this Man was miſſing, upon which a <hi>Popiſh</hi>
Warder ſaid, <hi>That Hawley had been prating about the
Earl of</hi> Eſſex'<hi>s Death, and for what he ſaid, was forc'd
to ran away,</hi> tho' it afterwards appeared he was <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered;</hi>
for about 6 Weeks after he was firſt miſs'd,
he was found almoſt naked in <hi>Medway</hi> River, having
been villanouſly deſtroyed; and ſuch barbarous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
acted towards him, that none of his own Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(not his own Wife) could know him by his
Face, nor by any thing but what he had on his Legs;
for his Cloaths were ſtript off (without doubt) that
the Body might not be known, but his Stockins left on,
by which he was diſcovered; for he wore three Stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins
upon one Leg, and two Stockins and a Sere-Cloath
(which he wore for ſome hurt) upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
by which remarkable circumſtance the Body
was known to be Mr. <hi>Hawley</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>Had his Murtherers took off his Stockins, as they
did his Cloaths, none could have known it to be Mr.
<hi>Hawley</hi>'s Body. But the Avenger of Blood in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
ordered this otherwiſe; and hereafter may
detect thoſe barbarous Deſtroyers of Mankind, with
all their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

Cruelty.</p>
            <p>Many have been the Practiſes uſed, to prevent a
publick Diſcovery of what was known by particular
Perſons in this matter; For,</p>
            <p>About 6 Weeks after my Lord's Death, there was
a Letter (unſealed) left with one Mr. <hi>Cadman,</hi> then
living in <hi>Durham Exchange.</hi> The <hi>Letter</hi> was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Right Honourable the Counteſs Dowager of
<hi>Eſſex:</hi> The ſubſtance of this Letter was; <q>
                  <hi>That if her
Honour could prevail with the King for the Author's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
he would ingenuouſly make a full Diſcovery, how, by
whom, and whoſe Order my Lord was murthered; and this
Letter did aſſure her Honour, that the Duke of</hi> York <hi>and
—were authorizing this Murther.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This Letter was ſubſcribed, <hi>P. B.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Hand that writ it, and the Letters Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
it was <hi>Paul Bomeny, beforementioned (who did once
blaſphemouſly ſay, that he could as well tell how my Lord
came by his Death, as God Almighty himſelf.</hi> For the
Letter was fairly writ in a Hand, between a <hi>Roman</hi>
and <hi>Italian;</hi> and ſuch an Hand <hi>Bomeny,</hi> when he
<hi>writ</hi> fair, did <hi>write;</hi> Beſides, the <hi>two</hi> Letters ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
are the Letters of his Name.</p>
            <p>I do ſuppoſe it may be objected, That this Letter
cannot be thought to be <hi>writ,</hi> and ſubſcribed by <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meny;</hi>
for the Letter, had it been brought in Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
againſt him, and proved to be his, would have
coſt him his Life; ſeeing herein he confeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
guilty of the Fact.</p>
            <p>But with ſubmiſſion, I think <hi>Bomeny,</hi> by this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(could it have been proved, to be his own <hi>Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing)</hi>
was in no danger at all of being puniſhed;
for had they ſeized <hi>Bomeny,</hi> they would have catched
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41940:3"/>
a <hi>Tartar,</hi> ſhould they have proceeded againſt him, for
the Murther. Upon this Confeſſion, <hi>the World would
have believed the whole Contents of this Letter, to be true; and
conſequently, that the Duke of</hi> York, <hi>and—authorized
(or rather commanded) this moſt Treacherous Murther;</hi>
and then pray conſider, what that Government could
have got by ſuch Proſecution, Conviction, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
            <p>This Letter was carried by <hi>Cadman,</hi> to a Juſtice of
Peace, and by him to the <hi>Secretary of State.</hi> But this
Bookſeller, was never ſent for, nor any enquiry made
after the Author.</p>
            <p>This Murther was a <hi>Noli me tangere</hi> of thoſe times,
which was not therefore to be inquired into;
but ſuch as could make Diſcoveries, were to be
threatned or wheedled into ſilence. Of which (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
many others) we have theſe Inſtances fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
<hi>(viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Edwards</hi> (who ſaw the bloody Razor
thrown out of my Lord's Chamber-window before
his Death was diſcovered, and hath depoſed the ſame
before the Lords), further made Oath, That as he was
going into <hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> (that Morning Mr. <hi>Speak</hi>
and I were Tried) he met Major <hi>Hawley,</hi> who (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Edwards</hi> was to be an Evidence at that Trial) in
a very threatning manner told him, <hi>That if he might
have the management of him, the ſaid</hi> Edwards <hi>ſhould be
whipt</hi> once a Fortnight for 7 Years together. Which
menace of the ſaid <hi>Hawley</hi> did ſo terrify this Boy
(then about 13 Years of Age) that he was afraid to own
what he knew, leſt he ſhould have ſuffered for ſo doing.</p>
            <p>But gentler Methods were ſometimes thought 
more proper to be uſed towards ſuch as could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal

Lord's Death, at a <hi>Coffee-houſe,</hi> ſaid, <hi>he thought that
they of the</hi> Jury <hi>were all infatuated, to find the Earl</hi> Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo
de ſe; <hi>and he verily believed, that had they been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
convenient time, they ſhould have brought it in other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</hi>
This <hi>Jury-man</hi> for theſe words was taken up,
impriſoned, proſecuted, and fin'd. Such were the
violent Methods uſed in thoſe days, to avoid any Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
of my Lord's being murthered.</p>
            <p>The <hi>timing</hi> the Earl's Death, and the <hi>ſudden</hi> uſe
thereof made, is another Argument, not only of the
Murder, but of one <hi>main end</hi> thereby deſign'd. <hi>My
Lord was taken off, when that great Patriot, the Lord</hi>
Ruſſel <hi>was upon his Tryal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as King <hi>Ch.</hi> heard of the Earl's death, he
ſent Sir <hi>C</hi>—to go and view the Body, and take
the Examinations of ſuch as were attending on my
Lord, at the time of his death. Sir <hi>C</hi>—had no
ſooner began to examine thoſe Attendants, but a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
came (as he pretended) from the King, to
tell Sir <hi>C</hi>—, <hi>He muſt go to the</hi> Old Bayly, <hi>and give
notice to the then Court, that the Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>had cut
his Throat.</hi> Whereupon Sir <hi>C</hi>—, by the ſame
Gentleman deſir'd His Majeſty, that he might finiſh
the Examinations he was then taking, and he would
then go to the <hi>Old Bayly.</hi> But the ſame Gentleman
ſoon return'd, and declar'd to Sir <hi>C</hi>—, that His
Majeſty did expreſly command him to go forthwith
to the <hi>Old Bayly,</hi> and to give notice of my Lord's
Death. In obedience to which repeated Command,
Sir <hi>C</hi>—inſtantly went, and gave notice to the
Court of that deplorable Accident. But Sir <hi>C</hi>—hath
unhappily forgot who thus twice brought His
Majeſties expreſs Orders. L. p. 47, 48.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Court received this Account from
Sir <hi>C</hi>—, with what malicious Application was it
urg'd againſt the then unfortunate Gentleman at that
time there upon his Tryal? It was ſaid to be an
argument from Heaven, of the truth of the (then)
pretended Plot. The Kings Council ſaid, That <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitus
Dei</hi> (but indeed 'twas, <hi>Digitus Diaboli)</hi> appear'd
in that Evidence, and that it was more than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Witneſſes. <hi>Vide</hi> L. <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Tryal.</p>
            <p>This Murder thus vehemently urg'd, not a little
bias'd the Jury againſt the then Priſoner; ſome of
them having ingenuouſly confeſs'd, that it much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced
their Verdict againſt that unfortunate Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.
Thus by that fatal Cut, wherewith thoſe
bloody Wretches murder'd the Earl, they did (virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally)
deſtroy two of our greateſt Patriots, <hi>true State-Martyrs
for the Religion, Laws, and Liberties of their
Native Country.</hi>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Shall now give you a ſhort Account upon what
Grounds I did firſt ingage in this Proſecution,
and what hardſhips I have met with from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of the two laſt Reigns, for having endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to detect this complicated Murther.</p>
            <p>My Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was taken off the 13th of <hi>July;</hi>
the Coroner ſat on the Body the 14th, and on the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41940:4"/>
16th of the ſame Month, the Depoſitions (taken
before the Coroner) were printed, in which (amongſt
other things) it was ſworn, That the Razor was
lock'd in with the Body into the Cloſet, and there
found. Upon reading this particular, a Friend of mine
declared the Razor could not be lock'd into the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet;
for there was a bloody Razor thrown out of
my Lord's Chamber Window before it was known
that the Earl was dead, and that this Razor ſo ſeen
thrown out, one <hi>Edwards</hi> beforementioned, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to take up; but a Maid came out of my
Lord's Lodgings, and took it up, running with it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Lord's Lodgings, and then firſt diſcover'd his
Lordſhips death.</p>
            <p>Finding this Relation very inconſiſtent with what
was ſworn before the Coroner, I concluded thoſe
forſworn Attendants did not ſwear falſe for any
other end, but to avoid the diſcovery of <hi>that Truth,</hi>
which might detect this Villanous Murder.</p>
            <p>Hereupon I did adviſe with ſome Friends, to whom
I did communicate my Reſolution of making inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
into this matter; but with an unanimous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
they all diſſuaded me, telling me, that if the
Earl was Murder'd, that Intereſt and Power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
therein was too powerful for me to cope with.
To which I made anſwer to this effect, That of this
I was well ſatisfied, but I dreaded what might be
the conſequence of no Mans engaging in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection;
for if that bloody Party which deſtroy'd his
Lordſhip, perceived ſuch their Cruelty was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected,
and that it was generally believed to be
done by the Earl himſelf, in probability many more
might fall ſuch Sacrifices to their Malice: For if
thoſe cruel Men found any to oppoſe their Deſigns,
it was but to pretend a Crime, and thereupon Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon
them, placing over them perfidious Villains,
that would either Murder them, or ſuffer others to
do it, and then add Perjury to Murder. And they
might deſtroy many Noblemen and Gentlemen, that
were trueſt Friends to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt; but if
thoſe vile Men once perceived that this their firſt
Murder was ſuſpected, and in danger of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
they would not ſo readily ingage in a Second
Part of that horrid Tragedy, the prevention where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I did prefer to my own private Intereſt and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and tho to the certain Ruin of both, I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
(by the grace of God) to ingage therein.</p>
            <p>With this Reſolution, I made inquiry after this
<hi>Edwards</hi> (whom before I never ſaw) and finding
this Boy to give the Relation before-mentioned; and
that as ſoon as he came from the <hi>Tower</hi> (that Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Lord died) he declared the ſame to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Siſters (as they were ready to atteſt) I took
in ſubſtance what the Boy and his Relations could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and therewith went to ſome Magiſtrate; but
I found all ſhy to meddle in the Matter.</p>
            <p>Being thus diſappointed, the very <hi>Thurſday</hi> after the
Earl's Death, I went to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and carried with
me what the Boy and his Mother could declare, and
were ready to make Oath of.</p>
            <p>This I gave to my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> (the then Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
of State) The Secretary commanded me to
attend the then next day, about Ten in the Morning;
and ſo bring with me the Boy and his Mother, and
his Lordſhip ſaid, <hi>If it were proper he would take their
Depoſitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>21th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1683, I went down to
<hi>White-Hall,</hi> with the Boy and his Siſter (who could
teſtify the ſame, with the Mother, who was then ill)
and ſent word to the Secretary, then in Council, That
I did attend according to his Lordſhip's Order. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which a Meſſenger was ſent forth (and before
the Boy or his Siſter, or any perſon was examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt me) I was taken into Cuſtody; and after
ſome ſhort time, carried before the King and
Council.</p>
            <p>When I firſt came before His Majeſty, the King
asked me, what <hi>mov'd Me to engage in that Matter?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I told His Majeſty, that I was altogether a ſtranger
to that Honourable Family; ſo that I lay under
no greater perſonal Obligation than any man might,
who had met with the ſame Informations. It was
my love to Truth and Juſtice, that moved me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
therein; and through the grace of God, would
do my duty, though Death ſtar'd me in the Face eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſtep I made.</p>
            <p>After many foreign Queſtions from the matter in
hand, I pull'd out of my Pocket the Coroner's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
and obſerved to His Majeſty ſome of the Inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herences
and Contradictions ſworn before the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>The Duke then demanded to ſee thoſe Depoſitions,
which being delivered, his Highneſs look'd over them,
but made no anſwer to what was objected. His then
Majeſty received them from his Highneſs, and ſaid
as little in anſwer. The then Lord Keeper <hi>North,</hi>
endeavoured to reconcile thoſe inconſiſtences: But
I did object againſt ſuch his Lordſhip's Reconciliation
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
This made the Lord Keeper very angry.</p>
            <p>I do conceive that the Printing the Depoſitions
was an appeal to mankind, Whether what was
ſworn before the Coroner was not ſufficient to prove
the Earl <hi>Felo de ſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not ſo much wonder at the folly of thoſe
two inconſiſtent Deponents, as at the indiſcretion of
the then Miſ-Government, to print ſuch incongruous
Informations, as by their material, notorious Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
naturally rendred both ſuſpected, as falſe
and contrived.</p>
            <p>The Boy and his Siſter being examined, I was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
again before the Board, where the Lord Keeper
told me, That I muſt give Security to anſwer to an
Information, which in that <hi>Matter</hi> ſhould be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
againſt me; and that Afternoon I gave 2000 <hi>l.</hi>
Bail accordingly, and was diſcharged out of Cuſtody.</p>
            <p>Although thus treated, I was reſolved to proceed
in my Inquiry; and for ſome Weeks was daily in
ſearch after many particulars of which I had been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
amongſt the reſt I was told, that it was
reported above an Hundred miles from <hi>London,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Earl's Death, that he had cut his Throat in
the <hi>Tower,</hi> as is before obſerved.</p>
            <p>In Search after this Report, I rid into <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi>
where I and my Servant were taken up, and ſent to
the County Gaol, upon a very illegal Warrant; in
the concluſion whereof, <hi>The Keeper was commanded to
keep us both without Converſation with any Perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever;
and without Pen, Ink, or Paper, till the</hi> Gaoler
<hi>ſhould hear from the King and Council.</hi> A ſtrict obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to this Warrant might have confined me, and
my man to that Priſon all the time of our lives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:41940:4"/>
From this Gaol I and my Servant were remov'd
by <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> upon the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act, to be
bail'd; my man was diſcharged without bail, but
the Lord Keeper demanded 24000 <hi>l.</hi> Bail for my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
and Security for the Good Behaviour.</p>
            <p>Theſe were Terms I could not comply with, and
was therefore ſome conſiderable time continued
in the Cuſtody of a <hi>Meſſenger,</hi> at above Four pounds
a Week, directly Expences, beſides other collateral
Disburſements.</p>
            <p>To avoid this vaſt Charge, I Petitioned to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
over to the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> which after many
Petitions, I did at laſt obtain. But before my remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
I did agree with the <hi>Marſhal</hi> upon giving 2000 <hi>l.</hi>
Security, and Five Shillings <hi>per</hi> Week, to have
the Liberty of the Rules. When I was removed, the
<hi>Marſhal</hi> inſiſted upon 10000 <hi>l.</hi> Security, and Ten Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<hi>per</hi> Week, which when I had given, I was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
lock'd up at no leſs Expence than 2 <hi>l. 5 s.</hi>
3 <hi>d. per</hi> Week, for Priſon-Charges.</p>
            <p>Thus having lain ſome Weeks in this Place, I mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> to be bail'd, and at laſt obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it.</p>
            <p>Having once more got my Liberty, I renewed
my Proſecution; but as a deſigned prevention here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I was about <hi>November</hi> 1683, again taken up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as illegal a Warrant as the former. <hi>For herein no
Crime was ſpecified, but it was granted againſt me for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuſpected to be diſaffected to the then Miſ-Government.
By virtue of this Warrant,</hi> I was firſt carried before
Sir <hi>James Edwards,</hi> then before the Lord <hi>Mayor;</hi> and
after that to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> before the King and Council.</p>
            <p>The Deſign of this was to charge me with beſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
the Deſtruction of the (then miſ-call'd) Loyal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But upon full Examination, in this Accuſation,
there appeared ſuch falſhood and inconſiſtent malice,
that I was ordered forthwith to be diſcharged.</p>
            <p>Once more being at Liberty, I did renew my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,
in which, till the <hi>Hillary-Term</hi> then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I was in almoſt a conſtant Hurry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In</hi> Hillary-Term 83, Mr. Speak <hi>and my Self were
Tried upon an Information for a (pretended)</hi> Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour.
<hi>In this Charge was ſet forth (in ſubſtance)</hi>
That the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> being Priſoner in the <hi>Tower</hi> for
High-Treaſon, did feloniouſly deſtroy himſelf, and was ſo
found by the <hi>Coroner</hi>'s Inqueſt. Notwithſtanding this,
Mr. <hi>Speake,</hi> and my <hi>Self,</hi> did conſpire to procure falſe
Witneſſes, to prove that the ſaid Earl was murthered by
Perſons unknown, in whoſe cuſtody he was, <hi>L. p.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The then Attorney General tells the Court,</hi> That
they had a Cloud of Witneſſes to prove that the ſaid Earl
did indeed deſtroy himſelf, <hi>L. p.</hi> 16</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When this</hi> Cloud <hi>appeared,</hi> it conſiſted in Major <hi>Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
(at whoſe Houſe my Lord was murthered) <hi>Ruſſel</hi> the
<hi>Warder,</hi> who then kept the Chamber-door; <hi>Bomeny,</hi>
my Lord's Servant (then attending on his Lordſhip) and
<hi>Floyd</hi> the Gentinel (who kept the outward Door, whilſt
my Lord was murthered. Here are three <hi>(Monday</hi> being
the fourth) of the men in whoſe Cuſtody my Lord was, and
conſequently (according to the Information) the very men
Mr. <hi>Speake,</hi> and my Self, had conſpir'd to Charge with my
Lord's Murther; and theſe very men, in whoſe Cuſtody my
Lord was, were like a Cloud of Witneſſes brought to prove,
that thoſe men, in whoſe Cuſtody my Lord was, did not
murther his Lordſhip; but that the Earl himſelf feloniouſly,
and as a Felon, of himſelf, did kill and murther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How very Ridiculous would it have looked, ſhould
the then Court, or Kings Council, have thus ſpoke
to thoſe three Witneſſes,</hi> (viz.) Gentlemen, <hi>you</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
three of the Men in whoſe Cuſtody my Lord was at
the time of his Death, are deſigned to be charged by the
Defendants, <hi>Speak</hi> and <hi>Braddon,</hi> with the Murder of
my Lord; but we have thought it convenient and juſt
by <hi>you</hi> to prove, that <hi>your ſelves</hi> did <hi>not</hi> Murder this
Unfortunate Lord, but that this Lord himſelf Feloniouſly,
and as a Felon of himſelf, did Kill and Murther, as upon
<hi>only</hi> ſome of <hi>your</hi> Depoſitions, he hath been already found
by the Coroners Inquiſition; do you therefore upon Oath
but purge <hi>your ſelves,</hi> and lay the Murder to my Lords
<hi>own</hi> Door, and <hi>we</hi> will inflict Exemplary Puniſhment
upon theſe Defendants, whoſe Conſpiracy tended to
the charging <hi>you as</hi> Actors in it, or privy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>I do humbly conceive, that all this was virtually
included in the Examination of <hi>thoſe Witneſſes,</hi> whoſe
<hi>Oaths were not only admitted to purge themſelves, but to
render ſuch as Criminals as ſhould endeavour to charge
them.</hi> Should the like be practiced in Protection of
all accuſed, (I am well ſatisfied) no Man would turn
Accuſer.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall ſay, <hi>Theſe</hi> being the Men attending on
my Lord at the time of his Death, and his Lordſhip
then a cloſe Priſoner, are the Perſons to be preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
privy to what was done <hi>by</hi> his Lordſhip, juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Death, and therefore the Parties which as to
that could be ſworn.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, As they were the Men which were to
be preſumed privy to what was done <hi>by</hi> his Lordſhip
juſt before his Death, becauſe they were the Perſons
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </gap> Lordſhip; <hi>For this
very Reaſon, they were the Parties which were likewiſe
to be ſuppoſed privy</hi> to what was done To <hi>his Lordſhip
juſt before his Death;</hi> and therefore admitting that
his Lordſhip fell by Treachery and Violence, theſe
were the Men muſt be preſumed knowing thereof,
whereof theſe Mens Teſtimony being in effect a
<hi>Self-diſcharge,</hi> ought not be to have been admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>This Tryal was carry'd on with all the Fury ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
and our Offence repreſented as the worſt of
Crimes; tho I do hereby Challenge <hi>ſuch of the then
Bench as are now living; the then Attorny General, and
Kings Council, Jury, and all the Witneſſes againſt</hi> me, <hi>to

In this I refer my ſelf to the printed Tryal.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speak</hi> was find a 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and ordered to give Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for his Good Behaviour during his Life. And I was
Fin'd 2000 <hi>l.</hi> and to give likewiſe Sureties for my Good
Behaviour, during Life.</p>
            <p>Under this Fine Mr. <hi>Speak</hi> lay ſome years, and at
laſt upon payment of about 5000 <hi>l.</hi> his Father, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Brother, and himſelf, got a General Pardon; but
I continued about five years in Cuſtody, even till the
now King landed.</p>
            <p>I have great reaſon to believe the late King would
never have forgiven me; for about <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1687. I
ſaw a Liſt of the King's Priſoners in Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> or
Mr. <hi>Graham</hi>'s hand, and <hi>my Name</hi> was the <hi>only</hi> Name
mark'd, and that was <hi>twice croſt,</hi> which they told
me was done by <hi>the King himſelf.</hi> As ſoon as he had
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41940:5"/>
read the Liſt, many of the Priſoners were ſoon after
diſcharg'd; but I was deſign'd for <hi>Judgment,</hi> not
<hi>Mercy,</hi> and therefore kept Priſoner till <hi>November</hi> 1688.
when upon this King's Landing, I gave ten Guineas
for my Security-bonds, and ſo made my eſcape.</p>
            <p>About the 21ſt of <hi>January, 1688. Hawley,
Monday, Ruſſel, Webſter,</hi> and <hi>Lloyd,</hi> were ſeiz'd as
ſuſpected concern'd in, or privy to my Lord's Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
and the 23d of the ſame Month, being the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
day the Convention ſat, the Houſe of Lords
conſtituted a large Committee to inquire into this
matter; but afterwards the Lords appointed a Cloſe
Committee, conſiſting of theſe four Lords, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
The Right Honourable the <hi>Lord Steward,</hi> [the Earl
of <hi>Devon],</hi> the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi>
the Right Honourable the (now) Earl of <hi>Monmouth,</hi>
and the Right Honourable the (now) Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Cloſe Committee met (for the moſt part)
twice a Week from the beginning of <hi>February</hi> 1688.
till about the Middle of <hi>May</hi> then following. The
23d of which Month many Depoſitions and Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
taken by the ſaid Committee, were read in
the Houſe of Lords; but the <hi>Lord Steward,</hi> Earl of
<hi>Monmouth,</hi> and <hi>Warrington,</hi> being then gone into the
Country in His Majeſties Service, it was ordered that
theſe Depoſitions and Papers ſhould be ſeal'd up,and
kept by the Clerk of the Parliament in the mean
time.</p>
            <p>In the Clerks hands theſe Papers lay ſeal'd up till

thoſe numerous Informations and Examinations,
which they (and ſome Juſtices of Peace) had taken in
this Matter, into <hi>ſuch method,</hi> as 'twas thought proper

            <p>Every man that makes inquiry after Blood, is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to do the King Service, and proſecutes ſuch inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in the King's Name, to know how the King loſt
a Subject; whether by Self-violence (through which
would accrue a Forfeiture of perſonal Eſtate) or by
the hands of others; for which ſuch Murtherers ought
to be brought to puniſhment.</p>
            <p>But in this ſingle inſtance, inſtead of being <hi>incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged</hi>
by the then Government, I was furiouſly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
irregularly proſecuted, and (without the leaſt
colour of Juſtice) utterly ruined. For</p>
            <p>I have ſpent above 1200 <hi>l.</hi> ſince the laſt 9 Years
of my Trouble; for part of which I have been ſome
time a Priſoner, tho before Execution I have liberty
to go abroad.</p>
            <p>But I have ſome proſpect of Redemption out of
theſe unhappy Circumſtances by that general conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of my misfortune, which is now had of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Gentelemen, who think it hard, that I, who vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
appeared to my expected ruin, for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good (hitherto) without any compenſation,
ſhould continue Priſoner for thoſe Debts, ſuch my
misfortunes contracted. This Contribution was firſt
moved and promoted by that worthy Gentleman, Sir
<hi>W. A.</hi> whoſe (with many other Gentlemens) Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in this Matter, I ſhall ever in all humble Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
acknowledge.</p>
            <p>In all my Sufferings, I did never lament my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
engaged in this Proſecution; and I hope, <q>That
no diſcouragement ſhall ever make me repent the
ſerving of a good Cauſe, nor the greateſt Bribes
prevail with me to promote a bad.</q>

               <hi>Sir,</hi> I can't but be ſenſible I have already treſpaſſed

deavour to demonſtrate,</p>
            <p>1. That ſeveral Meaſures which the Papiſts took
to conceal this Murther, have (by Providence) been
inverted, and made ſtrong Arguments of the truth of
the Murther.</p>
            <p>2. I ſhall give further Anſwers to all the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which have been made againſt the proof of this
Murther, and ſhew the unreaſonableneſs of the belief
of the Self-murther. <hi>Such as believe the Self-murther</hi>
without <hi>Evidence,</hi> (for <hi>Bomeny</hi>'s and <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

disbelieve</hi> againſt <hi>Evidence,</hi> the <hi>Earl's Murther</hi> (which
I conceive by the many Informations before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd,
is plainly prov'd) their belief is wrought upon
by their Affections, <hi>and they believe as they would have
it to be,</hi> and not upon ſuch rational Grounds, as ought
