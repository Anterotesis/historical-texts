            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Secondly, <hi>That the ſeventh day Sabbath in Scripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, did alwayes commence and determine at Evening; and that the Jews did ever ſolemnize it from Evening to Evening.</hi>
            </p>

(all treating of the time when the <hi>Paſſeover was to begin) In the tenth day of this Moneth, they ſhall take to them every man a Lamb, a Lamb for an houſe, and ye ſhall keep it up, untill the fourteenth day of the ſame Moneth, and the whole Aſſembly of the Congregation of Iſrael ſhall kill it in the Evening: For I will paſſe through the Land of Egypt this night, and will ſmite all the firſt born of the Land of Egypt both of man and beaſt. In the fourteenth day of the firſt moneth at Even, is the Lords Paſſeover; the fourteenth day at Even ſhall they keep it. And the children of Iſrael went away, and did as the Lord had commanded And it came to paſſe that at midnight the Lord ſmote all the firſt born in the Land of Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It is a night to be much obſerved unto the Lord, for bringing the chilaren of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelout of the Land of Egypt, And it came to paſſe the ſelf ſame day that thé Lord did bring the children of Iſrael out of the Land of Egypt by their Armies.</hi> From which words it is apparant;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the fourteenth day of the Month <hi>Abib,</hi> on which the Paſſeover was kept, began in Scripture account, at <hi>Evening:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe they were to keep the Paſchal Lamb, untill the fourteenth day, and then to kill it in the <hi>Evening;</hi> therefore that day began at <hi>Evening.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe the feaſt of the Paſſeover, with the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, dreſſing and eating of the Paſchall Lamb did commence at <hi>Evening;</hi> thererefore the day too, which no doubt the Feaſt began: for if the day began not till the following morning, the Paſſeover had been kept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115451:6"/>
it, not upon it, upon the thirteenth not the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the month.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That that Evening and night on which the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was kept, was part of the following, not of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going day.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe this Feaſt of the Paſſeover was to be kept the whole fourteenth day, in remembrance of Gods paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing over the Iſraelites, ſlaying the Egyptians, and delivering his people out of Egypt: Since therefore they began not to kill and eat the Paſſeover in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but at Evening, the Evening muſt neceſſarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the day, and be a part onely of the following day, not of the day preceding it; elſe it would have been but an <hi>half-holy day,</hi> and no more, the whole preceding day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſolemnized, but the night alone; or at leaſt, a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly day made up of the Evening of the fourteenth, and the morning of the fifteenth day, not of the fourteenth day alone; both which are directly contrary to the Text.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe this celebrating of the Paſſeover the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day at Evening, was done in memory of Gods paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing over them, and ſlaying the Egyptians at midnight following; and bringing them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with their Armies the next morning: this Evening therefore muſt be part of that day to which <hi>Midnight</hi> and the <hi>Morning fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing</hi> did belong, which muſt neceſſarily appertain to the fifteenth, not the fourteenth day, if the fourteenth day began the midnight or morning before, and not that very evening; and ſo the fourteenth day ſhould be ſolemnized for a deliverance happening on the fifteenth day, not on it; which were abſurd to think. The deliverance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore happening the midnight and morning which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded this Evening, it muſt doubtleſſe be ſolemnized as part of the ſubſequent, not of the precedent day.</p>

Becauſe the Text ſaith expreſly, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 51. <hi>The ſame day the Lord brought the children of Iſrael out of Egypt by their Armies:</hi> therefore this Evening and Midnight were part of the enſuing day, becauſe the Iſraelites departed not out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with their Armies till the <note n="g" place="margin">

            <p>Thirdly, it is moſt clear by <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 18, 19. compared <note place="margin">

            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt abrogated or changed nothing, but what was neceſſary to be aboliſhed or altered upon war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable <note place="margin">

            <p>Fifthly, there is not one word or ſillable in all the Scripture, which either affirms or intimates, that Chriſts <note place="margin">

Theſe five Concluſions being thus premiſed, and I hope undeniably proved; I ſhall now deduce five unanſwerable Arguments from them to prove, that the Lords-day, doth and ought of right to begin and end at Evening; not at <note place="margin">Arguments to prove that the Lords day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> morning or midnight.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If all dayes in Scripture and divine account do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes begin and end at Evening (not at morning or midnight) then the Lords-day (being the firſt day of the <note place="margin">

If that very firſt day of the week whereon our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our roſe again, began and ended at Evening in divine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, even as it was his Reſurrection day: then the Lords day (kept in memory of his Reſurrection on that <note place="margin">

If therefore the Lords-day were inſtituted and conſecrated for a Sabbath, by Chriſt himſelf, as many or by his Apoſtles, as moſt; or by the Primitive Church Chriſtians onely, ſoon after the Apoſtles time, as others affirm; (one of which three opinions is and muſt be granted by them for undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truth) then it is moſt certain, that it muſt and did (at its very firſt inſtitution and obſervation) begin and end at Evening (not at morning or Midnight or b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

prove that the Lords-day ought to begin at Evening. All which being laid together, are an infallible proof; that admit the Lords-day inſtituted by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, yet it was ordained by them from the very firſt, to begin and end at Evening, and ſo to be ſolemnized, and that themſelves did thus begin it. If it were onely inſtituted by the primitive Chriſtians <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See Breutius in Levit.</hi> 23. 2. <hi>and</hi> 25 8.</note> ſucceeding them, no queſtion but they at firſt concluded, that it ſhould be ſanctified from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening to Evening, many of them being Jews, who kept all their Sabbaths and Feſtivals from Evening to Evening, to whom the other Chriſtians did readily conform in this particular, becauſe it was the Scripture computation, even from the Creation, and for other premiſed Reaſons. For the Apoſtles themſelves, and other Chriſtians condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them for a time, in the point of Circumciſion, Purification, and other ſuch Ceremonies, quite abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>by Chriſts death,</hi> Acts 21. 20 to 28. 1 Cor. 9. 20. Gal. 2. 14, 15. <hi>c.</hi> 6. 12. would certainly concurre with them in the beginning and ending of their Sabbaths, and ſacred feſtivities, which were no wayes ceremoniall, nor alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor abrogated by Chriſts death. From which premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes I conclude; that let the Lords-day be inſtituted, when or by whomſoever, yet it was ordained in its primary inſtitution to be ſolemnized from Evening to Evening, and that it was ſanctified in this manner by its originall Inſtitutors. To put this out of queſtion, I ſhall deſcend from the alledged reaſons, to direct Authorities, culling out ſome few of the chieſeſt in all ages, and pretermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the reſt for brevity ſake. I ſhall begin with the ancienteſt firſt, and ſo proceed in order to our preſent times.</p>
            <p>The firſt Authority I ſhall inſiſt on, is, that of <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 7, 8, 11. (which many object againſt me, though it be moſt pregnant for me) <hi>And upon the firſt day of the week, when</hi>

            <p n="2">2.

Becauſe Saint <hi>Luke</hi> records that it was upon the <hi>firſt day of the week,</hi> when this <hi>Meeting</hi> was, and this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of <hi>Pauls</hi> made; therefore it muſt needs be on the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday,</hi> not on our <hi>Sunday</hi> Evening, ſince the <hi>Sunday</hi> Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in S. <hi>Lukes,</hi> and Scripture account, was no part of the <hi>firſt,</hi> but of the ſecond day; the day ever beginning and ending at Evening, in their computation, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes evidence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All my oppoſites confeſſe, that the Diſciples met at this time, <hi>upon the firſt day of purpoſe to ſanctifie it for a-Sabbath;</hi> and can they then think that they would defer their meeting till our <hi>Sunday</hi> Evening, when all the day in their accompt (and the beſt, the chiefeſt part of it in their compute, who begin it at midnight or morning) was expired? Certainly, this had been to make the Lords-day no Feſtivall day at all, or at moſt not ſo much as an <hi>half-holy day;</hi> which we cannot preſume theſe Diſciples,

and S. <hi>Paul</hi> would dodid they obſerve it as their Sabbath: From all which reaſons I may more then probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it was the <hi>Saturday</hi> Evening (when the Lords-day began) not the <hi>Sunday</hi> night (when it ended) when this Divine Aſſembly was kept; the rather becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the Sacrament, nor <hi>brake this bread</hi> till <hi>after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,</hi> as the Text affirms; and ſo after the Lords-day ended even in the accompt of ſuch who affirm it ends at midnight: And becauſe this beginning of their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly when the day begins, makes moſt for the Apoſtolical divine Inſtitution and ſanctification of the Lords day; for the which this Text will little avail, if this Aſſembly on it, were on our <hi>Sunday</hi> night, when the day was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wholly or for the moſt part expired, and ſo this meeting no warrant for its totall ſanctification.</p>

Neither was the celebration of this night the practiſe onely of ſome few private Churches, but of all Chriſtian Churches in that centurie, ſince this Councell layes it down as a prevailing argument, why <hi>all Churches</hi> ſhould conſecrate their Candles and Tapers on it, as well as the <hi>Spaniſh Church,</hi> and <hi>Churches in France;</hi> which had been no motive at all, had not the ſolemniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this night in memory of Chriſts Reſurrection, been univerſall, though the ſuperſtitious Ceremonie of Hallowing Lights and Tapers on it was not ſo.

it to be the reſolved Doctrine and conſtant practiſe of all fotmer age. There is nothing now remaining but that I ſhould anſwer thoſe Pretences or Ojections, which are or may be made againſt it; and take off one Cavill which may be made againſt ſome of the premiſes: when this is diſpatched, the truth will be moſt perſpicuous, ſo that none can further doubt or queſtion it, (as I ſuppoſe) for the future.</p>
            <p>The Arguments produced for the proof of the adverſe opinions, (or rather onely for one of them, to wit, that the Lords-day begins and ends at morning) are ſix; which I ſhall anſwer in order.</p>
            <p>The firſt of them is this. That what the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſetled for a time, to wit, that the Sabbath and other <note place="margin">

               </gap>e cauſe in point of time, if the Lords-day ſhould begin at Evening, Chriſts Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beginning not till the morning. This reaſon and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is the main foundation whereon the Oppoſites build their errour; wherefore I ſhall be more copious in diſcovering the ſandineſſe, falſhood, and fallaciouſneſſe of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, I anſwer, that this whole Argument, is but a chain of ſeverall groſſe falſhoods and miſtakes, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1.</note> contrary to the Scriptures: I wonder therefore why ſo many grave, judicious men ſhould be enſnared by it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt of them (the ground work of all the reſt, and of this errour concerning the Lords-day begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at morning is this, <hi>That Chriſts Reſurrection did alter the beginning of that firſt day of the week, whereon be aroſe, from Evening to Morning:</hi> which I have manifeſted to be an apparent Errour contrary to the Scriptures; which teſtifie that that day began at Evening, and that Chriſts Reſurrection did nothing alter it; as the third and fifth preceding Concluſions prove at large. Wherefore I ſhall here demand of the Objectors, how it appears that Chriſts Reſurrection made ſuch a change as they pretend? If by Scripture, ſhew one Text, that neceſſarily proves it: this I am ſure they cannot do. If not by Scripture: then it is a meere groundleſſe conceit of their own forging. Yea, but though they want Scripture, yet they have this ſound reaſon to prove it: Chriſt roſe again upon the firſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115451:36"/>
therefore he tranſlated the beginning of it from Evenig to morning. To which I reply, that this main Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall reaſon is but a groſſe in conſequent, and a circular Argumentation; For if the Argument be denyed, as juſtly it may be; then they prove it by that very <hi>medium</hi> which was next before denied, and they ought to make good; that Chriſts Reſurrection did chan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e the day from morning to Evening (there being no other <hi>medium</hi> but this to confirm it) therefore if he roſe again upon it in the morning, he made ſuch a change as they pretend. So that this their reaſon is but <hi>Idem per Idem,</hi> a <hi>Petitio principii</hi> a Circular diſpute, a groſſe <hi>Non ſequitur,</hi> and ſo to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as falſe and idle. But yet a little more to lay open the falſhhood of this Propoſition; That Chiſts Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made ſuch an alteration of that firſt dayes begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (which hath neither Scripture nor Reaſon to back it.)</p>
            <p>I would firſt demand this Queſtion of them. Why Chriſts Reſurrection ſhould produce ſuch a Change, when as his Nativity, Paſſion and Aſcention, (parts of his Redemption too, as beneficiall to Chriſtians as his Reſurrection) had no ſuch effect?</p>
            <p n="2">2. How they come to know, that ſuch a Change was <hi>de Facto</hi> made, when no Scripture rev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

How was it poſſible for Chriſts Reſurrection to call back and adnul that beginning of the day, which was ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocably paſt, and gone before it happened? ſince by their own Rule, the effect cannot precede the cauſe; and ſo by the ſame Reaſon, Chriſts Reſurrection in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could not operate <hi>à parte ante,</hi> to change the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that day, which was actually paſt at Evening.</p>

            <p n="6">6. How that which hath no limits of its own, but that which it had from the day on which it happened, (the firſt dayes morning being that which limited the Reſurrection in point of time, and reduced it to a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) can poſſibly put bounds of time unto the day, which bounds outit?

            <p>The ſecond is this, That Chriſts Reſurrection was the cauſe of the Lords-day. This I ſay, is both a falſhood and a fallacy.

               </gap>erly as a day, it is clear, that Chriſts Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was no cauſe of the firſt day; for that was inſtituted by God at the Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. who then appointed the Sunne, Moon, and Starres, to rule, limit, govern both the day and night, and to be the ſole cauſes of them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 14. to 22. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 74. 16, 17. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 136. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 19. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 35, 36. <hi>c.</hi> 33. 20.

To il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate this by an example. The firſt day of the week, is like to water in Baptiſme, to Bread and Wine in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crament, to a Church that is conſecrated, or to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bou to enter into Orders: Now as we uſe to ſay, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t Baptiſme doth change the water, the Sacramentall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration the bread and wine, Conſecration Canonicall the Church, and ordination the man; if we mean they change their very nature, eſſence and ſubſtance, the ſpeech is meerly falſe; for they continue in nature, in ſubſtance, the ſame they were before; if we intend they onely alter their uſe, which is true; and yet apply this alteration to the ſubſtance (as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do in caſe of the Sacament, arguing thus; the Fathers ſay, that the Bread and Wine are changed after Conſecration, to wit, in their uſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>Ergo</hi> they are tranſubſtantiated and changed in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ir ſubſtance;) then it is but a fallacy or equivocation which being explained proves but a meere <hi>Non ſequitur,</hi> fince the change in the uſe or quality onely, infers no neceſſary alteration in the Subſtance. So when the Objectors ſay, that Chriſts Reſurrection did change the firſt day of the week; if they mean onely that it was the occaſion why the uſe of it was altered from a common day to an holy day: or when they affirm, that Chriſts Reſurrection was the cauſe of the Lords day, that is, the cauſe why the firſt day was and is ſolemnized as a Lords-day: their
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115451:39"/>
words are true in this ſenſe onely; but then they neither prove nor imply any change at all in the limits, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or end of the firſt day, or in the day it ſelf, but in its uſe alone; and ſo the day continues the ſame in all theſe reſpects, as it was before. But when they go thus far, as to prove that Chriſts Reſurrection on it did alter the very beginning and end, (and ſo the nature and limits) of the day, becauſe it was the occaſion of altering its uſe (which is the thing they intend in both theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions) then the Argumentation is ſophiſticall, and the Concluſion this groſſe inconſequent; Chriſts Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was the cauſe of turning the firſt day of the week into the Lords-day; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it tranſlated the beginning of that day from morning to Evening. An Argument ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, that the Objectors may now do well to bluſh at it. Again, if we conſider this day onely, as it is a Lords-day, (that is, as a time conſecrated to Gods publick worſhip) if the Objectors intend by this Propoſition (Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection in the morning was the cauſe of the Lords-day) that is, it did actually conſecrate that very firſt day, whereon he aroſe, and all others ſucceeding it, for a Lords-day, even that very morning on which he aroſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as in truth they do; then I ſay it ſeems to me an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent untruth. For though it be true that his Reſurrection on that day, was one generall originall occaſion of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnizing it for the Lords-day; yet it is untrue that his bare Reſurrection onely was the immediate efficient, conſtitutive cauſe of ſanctifying it for a Sabbath or Lords-day; or that it did ſanctifie that very day on which Chriſt aroſe for a Sabbath or Lords-day, even at that very time of the morning when he aroſe.</p>
            <p>For firſt, Gods reſting from his work of Creation on the ſeventh day, is paralell in reaſon with Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection on the firſt day, in point of conſtituting either of them for a Sabbath or Holy day, as all acknowledge. But Gods reſting on the ſeventh day, was onely the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall impulſive, not the immediate efficient, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive cauſe of the ſeventh day Sabbath; for it was not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115451:39"/>
a Sabbath as ſoon as God began to reſt, or only becauſe he reſted on it; but <hi>becauſe he bleſſed and conſecrated it for a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and commanded</hi> Adam <hi>and his poſterity to ſanctifie it for a Sabbath,</hi> as is clear by <hi>Gen</hi> 2. 2, 3. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 7. <hi>to</hi> 12. for he ſanctified it for a Sabbath <hi>becauſe he had reſted on it:</hi> ſo that his reſt was onely the occaſion why this d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Faſts, and memorable occaſions, are regulated by dayes, not dayes by them; the Feſtivalls and Feaſts ever beginning and ending with the dayes to which they are appropriated, not the dayes, or Feſtivalls, or Faſts, with the occaſions of their ſolemnization. So in all annual or weekly <hi>Holy-dayes,</hi> Feaſts, or Faſts inſtituted by men, let the occaſions of their inſtitution happen what houre or time of the day they will, at morning, noon, or afternoon, yet we ſtill begin the ſolemnizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, when the day begins. For Example, our <hi>Saviours Paſſion on the Croſſe, was not till about three of the clock in the afternoon,</hi> John 9. 14 <hi>Mark</hi> 15. 34.

               </gap>t together in the Lords-houſe; (though ſuſpected and in part diſcovered ten dayes before, and actually detected at Midnight;) yet we begin the ſolemnization of it, from the <hi>foregoing Evening,</hi> with <hi>ringing of Bells,</hi> and the like. The Birth of many of our Princes hath been about noon or after, and their Coronations about that time: yet we ſolemnize their <hi>Birth-dayes,</hi> and <hi>Coronation-dayes,</hi> from thoſe dayes beginnings. The Crown deſcended to our preſent Soveraign King <hi>Charls</hi> in the afternoon: yet we ſolemnize not that day from Noon to Noon, but from Evening to Evening, becauſe the day doth then commence and end, and ſo the ſolemnity confined onely to that day, that whole day, not to part of it, and part of the enſuing day. If then all Feſtivalls whatſoever begin
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115451:42"/>
and end with the dayes beginning and end on which they are kept, not at the very time of thoſe dayes, when the occaſions of their ſolemnization happened, as theſe and other infinite other examples teſtifie; Why ſhould not the Lords-day begin at Evening, though Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, (the chief cauſe of its ſanctification) was not till morning, becauſe that day, as a day, doth then begin and determine? Certainly whatever the Oppoſites conceipt, it muſt needs do ſo, and that for theſe unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe God himſelf, at the very Creation hath ſet inviolable bounds, for the beginning and end of daves and weeks; appointing them to be as ſo many <hi>Royall Standards</hi> for the limiting or meaſuring out of all Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall occaſions happening on them, and reducing them to a certainty; as I have manifeſted at large in the fourth Concluſion: wherefore no event or Feſtivalls, happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on thoſe dayes, can alter the limits or beginning of them, nor make them longer or ſhorter; no more than the Corn to be meaſured by the peck or buſhell, or the cloth to be meaſured by the yard, can alter, limit or meaſure out the quantity of the peck, buſhell, or length of the yard.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe every occaſion that may cauſe a ſubſequent conſecration of a day, for a <hi>Sabbath</hi> or <hi>Holy day,</hi> (and ſo Chriſts Reſurrection) doth only dedicate that day, yea all that day on which it falls, not part of that day, and part of the day enſuing, on which it did not happen; therefore conſecrating onely that very day, all that day, and no other day but that, it muſt needs begin and end, when that day doth. Now that very day on which our Saviour aroſe, began and ended at Evening, as I have proved: his Reſurrection therefore being the cauſe of conſecrating all that day, (not part of it, and part of the following day) for the Lords-day, this day as a Lords-day, muſt neceſſarily begin and conclude at Evening.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe no occaſion of conſecrating the day on which it falls, extends in point of Conſecration, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115451:42"/>
than that very day, which is ſet as the utmoſt limits of it. But ſhould the Lords-day begin and end at morning or Midnight, not at Evening, Chriſts Reſurrection (the cauſe of its conſecration) ſhould extend beyond the bounds of the day, to conſecrate half (or at leaſt a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) of the ſecond day, for a Lords-day on which he aroſe; and beſides, it ſhould not conſecrate all that day on which it happened, but that part onely which enſued, not that which preceded it, ſince that day began at Evening, as I have proved. Both which were abſurd to affirm. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs begin at Evening, The Lords day being onely the firſt day on which Chriſt aroſe, and all the firſt day, not part of it, and part of the ſecond day, as it is and muſt be, in the Oppoſites computation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that day on which Chriſt aroſe, both as a week day, and as a day, was precedent to his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both in time, nature, and in the ſanctification of it for a Lords-day: For there muſt be fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fore Chriſt could riſe upon it, or any conſecrate it for a Sabbath or Lords-day: therefore his Reſurrection on it, and the conſecration of it for a Lords-day, did not, could not alter the limits or nature of that day, but both of them muſt be regulated, ſquared by its former bounds.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Chriſts Reſurrection and the Lords-day ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnization, have no ſet limits of time of their own, being no parts of time, but onely meaſured out by time: therefore they can give, or proportion out, no limits of time to the firſt day, but the firſt day being a part of time, muſt ſet limits of time to them. And to make Feſtivalls or their occaſions meaſurers out of the length, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ginning or end of days (which the Objectors do) is as groſſe an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, as to meaſure the buſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Sixthly, every memorable accident happening upon
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115451:43"/>
any day (and ſo by conſequence our Saviours Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on the firſt day of the week) cannot poſſibly alter the beginning of that day: For if it falls out juſt at the dayes beginning, it is a reaſon that the day and Feſtivall ſolemnized in memoriall of it, ſhould then begin, becauſe both the day and the occaſion of its celebration com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence together; if it happen after the day begins (as Chriſts Reſurrection did) it cannot nullifie or change its beginning, becauſe it was irrevocably paſt, and gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Et<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quod factum, quod praeteritum eſt, infectum reddi non poteſt,</hi> no not by God himfelf, much leſſe by any acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall occaſion, which cannot poſſibly operate to nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie or alter that which was paſt and gone before it was in being. Since therefore no occaſion happening, either with or after the beginning of any day can poſſibly alter the time of its inception, the Feſtivity inſtituted in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of that occaſion, on that day, muſt inevitably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and end when the day doth in its naturall and uſuall courſe, and ſo the Lords-day too, which muſt begin and end at Evening, becauſe that day on which Chriſt roſe again did ſo.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Chriſts Reſurrection (and ſo any other memorable accident upon any dayes) was but a meere tranſient act, done, paſt, almoſt in a moment, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes ſpace: wherefore it could properly of it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate onely that ſpace of that day which it took up and no more: for the forepart of the day being paſt, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing part of it to come, and neither of them in being, but that ſpace thereof in which he roſe again, Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection could not properly operate to conſecrate ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the antecedent or ſubſequent part of that day, of it ſelf, much leſſe any dayes enſuing. If therefore the Lords-day, or firſt day ſhould be limited or bounded out by the time on which Chriſt roſe (which is the Oppoſites Doctrine) we muſt either obſerve no Lords-day at all, or elſe a Lords-day of a minutes length (and that minute uncertain when to begin or end, becauſe the hour, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of Chriſts riſing again is unknown:) Since therefore
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115451:43"/>
there is both an expediency and neceſſity that Chriſtians ſhould obſerve a day, a Feſtivall of a greater length, than the very moment in which Chriſt roſe, in memory of Chriſts Reſurrection; the inſtituters of the Lords day, conſidering that God himſelf did ever bound out all Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivalls, by dayes, not minutes, hours or half dayes, (ſtretching the limits of them farther than the bounds of their occaſions reached; which were commonly ſhort, and tranſitory;) partly in imitation of Gods own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer proceedings in ſuch caſes, and partl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> out of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, did extend the bounds of the Lords-day beyond the ſpace in which he was riſing, even to the intire day, whereon he aroſe, and ſo to that part of the day prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as well as to that ſucceeding it, the very act of Chriſts Reſurrection being but momentany and not ſo large as the whole dayes extent. Whence we may clearly ſee an abſolute neceſſity of limiting Feſtivalls by the days, limits, not by their occaſions; of beginning the Lords-day at Evening, though the Reſurrection, the cauſe of its future ſolemnization, was not till morning; and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch occaſions and the Reſurrection, to relate <hi>à parte ante,</hi> as well as <hi>à parte poſt;</hi> to conſecrate the precedent as well as the ſubſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quent part of the dayes on which they happen, without any violation of the objected Logick Rule. That <hi>the effect cannot precede the cauſe;</hi> (which is true onely in this ſenſe, that the Lords-day could not be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obſerved as a Lords-day in memory of Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection on it, bef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Eightly, if Feſtivalls or their occaſions (and ſo Chriſts Reſurrection and the Lords-day) ſhould alter the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and end of dayes, as the Objectors pretend, it would bring in an abſolute confuſion of all tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s and dayes: For then every laſt occaſion of ſolemnizing any day muſt change the beginning of all other dayes, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115451:44"/>
reduce them to the time that that occaſion happened; and ſo every punie Feſtivall ſhould alter the limits of all dayes and Feſtivalls formerly ſettled; which were inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, yea abſurd; and would cauſe ſo many alterations in day as would render all days, weeks, years, u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>certain; or elſe every day or Feſtival ſhould have ſeverall begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and ends, anſwerable to the hours of the ſeverall remarkable accidents happening on them, ſome begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at one hour, ſome at another, ſome being long, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhort, ſome beginning at one time in one Country, and at another time in another Countrey; which would bring ſuch a perplexity, intricacy into all computations of time, and all Chronologie, as neither God nor man could ſuffer; breed much confuſion, both in Contracts, Feſtivals, all divine and humane affairs; overturn Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Lawes, Dayes, Weeks, Moneths, years, and reduce all things to a meere incertainty, in regard of time, which hath continued the ſame in all ages and places from the Creation to this preſent, without any variation; the week conſiſting of <hi>ſeven dayes,</hi> and each of thoſe dayes of 24. <hi>hours onely,</hi> as they did at the Creation. Wherefore to prevent this generall confuſion, incertainty, diſorder in dayes, and other times, there is a neceſſity that dayes, (Gods Standard Royall, to meaſure all temporary things, occaſions, and ſolemn Feſtivals happening on them) ſhould limit both Feſtivals themſelves, and the cauſes of their inſtitution: and ſo that the Lords-day ſhould be ſquared by the firſt day of the week, to which it is confined, not the firſt day, or Lords-day, by the time of our Saviours Reſurrection on it. And why ſhould not the Lords-day be ſquared by the firſt day on which our Saviour aroſe? Is it not celebrated principally in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his Reſurrection on that day? Is not the Lords-day the firſt day, and the firſt day the Lords-day? Is not all the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſt day the Lords-day, and no part of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. day? would you not have it like that firſt day on which Chriſt aroſe, not different from it? If ſo, then that firſt day muſt be the only meaſure of it; and it muſt begin and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115451:44"/>
end at Evening, as that day did. If otherwiſe, you make the Lords-day different from that day whereon Chriſt roſe, you ſanctifie but part, not all the firſt day; you piece up a Lords-day of half the firſt day and half the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day; and make Chriſts Reſurrection the meaſure of the day, when as the day was the meaſure of it: all and and either of which is groſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r, or born together with him. So it follows
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115451:46"/>
not that becauſe the Lords day, as a Lords day, could not begin to be obſerved, hallowed as ſuch a day, before that Morning whereon Chriſt aroſe; <hi>Ergo</hi> it muſt begin at Morning, and could not be inſtituted to begin the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the next, or any other firſt day following it.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt of the latter Argument is falf, for although the originall cauſe or occaſion doth uſually precede the effect in point of time, (as Chriſts Reſurrection did the inſtitution of the Lords day) yet it follows not that the Lords day muſt begin at that very point of time when Chriſt aroſe. So that there is a fallacy in this Argument, in arguing from the effect to the Cauſe, that it cannot precede it: when as the Propoſition ought to be, that it is ever contemporary and muſt begin at the ſame time with it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is a <hi>Tranſitio à genere ad Genus;</hi> and that in two particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In making Chriſts Reſurrection the cauſe of the Lords-day, as it is a naiurall day, when as it was no cauſe of it as a day, but onely the reaſon why it was inſtituted for a Lords-day. So that the Argument ſhould be thus propounded. Chriſts Reſurrection was the cauſe, why the firſt day was inſtituted for a Lords-day: but that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at Morning. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Lords-day muſt then begin, becauſe the day muſt then begin, when the occaſion of its inſtitution for a Lords-day began: which I have proved to be falſe:</p>
            <p n="2">2. In applying that to the beginning of the day, which is applycable onely to the beginning of its inſtitution for a Lords-day, in this maxime; that <hi>the effect cannot precede the cauſe,</hi> that is, the Lords-day muſt not be inſtituted in memory of Chriſts Reſurrection, before Chriſt was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally riſen, (which yet may be falſe, ſince the <hi>Feaſt of the Paſſeover was inſtituted at Evening, and ſolemnized in part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God actually paſſed over the Iſraelites, and ſlew the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at Midnight following,</hi> which was the cauſe of its inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>to</hi> 40.) and ſo might the Lords-day too, be inſtituted in this manner before Chriſts Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)

Therefore after his Reſurrection paſt, it could not be inſtituted to begin the Evening of that firſt day of the week on which he aroſe. Which is a meere inconſequent: For what though Chriſt did not riſe till the Morning; yet that day on which he aroſe began at Evening; and therefore his Reſurrection relating to the whole day, as his Reſurrection day, this day of the week (if not before, yet after his Reſurrection paſt) might be well ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed for a Lords-day, even from Evening to Evening, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any violation of the true meaning of this Maxime; Since we ſolemnize not the day, as the preciſe minute or houre, but as the weekly day of his Reſurrection, every part whereof may be part of his Reſurrection day, though not part of that very hour of the day whereon he arofe. If then theſe <hi>Fallacies</hi> be abandoned, the whole ſumme and Force of the Objection, is but this in honeſt Termes.</p>
            <p>Chriſts Reſurrection in the morning was the originall occaſion why the firſt day of the week whereon he aroſe, was afterwards inſtituted for the Lords-day, and ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo</hi> the firſt day as the Lords-day, muſt begin and end at morning, at that moment when Chriſt aroſe, not at Evening, neither could it be inſtituted to begin at Even.</p>
            <p>Which as all the premiſes manifeſt, is a groſſe inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>
            <p>All that is or can be replied to help out this maimed reaſon, is this. That the firſt day whereon Chriſt aroſe, <note place="margin">Objection.</note> had two beginnings. One, as a Lords day, and that was at morning when he aroſe: the other as a meer naturall day, <hi>viz.</hi> at Evening: and that Chriſts Reſurrection, gave it a new beginning, as a Lords-day, not as a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall day.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, 1. That this diſtinction is but a meer Forgery, warranted by no Scripture, reaſon or convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Authority; and therefore it ought firſt to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <note place="margin">

            <p n="3">3. It is a meere falſhood:</p>
            <p>For 1. That very day whereon Chriſt aroſe was not conſecrated at his Reſurrection for a Lords-day, as I have proved: therefore it could not begin at morning as a Lords-day, ſeeing it was no Lords-day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Lords-day is nothing elſe, but the firſt day of the week, and the firſt day of the week is the Lords-day, they being <hi>terntini convertibiles:</hi> therefore they have but one and the ſelf-ſame beginning and end.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That firſt day, on which Chriſt aroſe, even as his Reſurrection day, began at Evening as I have proved; therefore it began then, as it was the Lords day, it being the Lords-day onely, as it is his Reſurrection day.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Had that firſt day, as a day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ut of 12 houres long; the Evening and night preceding it, being no patt of it; or elſe it muſt be a Lords-day patched up of a piece of the firſt day, and a part of the ſecond day, to wit, of the day light of the firſt, and the night of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; and not that intire firſt day whereon Chriſt aroſe. Either of which is an abſurdity to averre: therefore as a Lords-day it muſt begin at Evening, to avoid theſe abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. By all which it is now moſt clearly evident; that this Grand Objection is both falſe, abſur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and fallacious, proving nothing at all againſt me, and no ground to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon.</p>
            <p>The third main Argument, to prove, that the Lords-day <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3.</note> begins at morning, not at Evening, is that of <hi>John</hi> 20. 19. <hi>The ſame day at Evening, being the firſt day of the Week, when the doores were ſhut, where the Diſciples were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled for fear of the Jews, came Jeſus and ſtood in the middeſt, &amp;c.</hi> whence it may be objected. That the ſame firſt day whereon Chriſt roſe again, ended not at <hi>Evening;</hi> as the words <hi>(The ſame day at Evening, being the firſt day of the week)</hi> import; that Evening being part of the firſt day, not of the ſecond; therefore it began not at Evening in Saint <hi>Johns</hi> accompt, and our Saviours Reſurrection in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115451:47"/>
it tranſlated its beginning from Evening to Morning.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer firſt, that this Text makes nothing at all againſt me. For the Scripture makes mention of two <hi>Evenings;</hi> one of the artificiall day (which we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call day) beginning when the <hi>ſund clines,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſomewhat</hi>

            <p>Secondly, This Text mentions not at all this day as a Lords-day, but onely as the <hi>firſt day of the Week whereon Chriſt roſe;</hi> neither doth it or any other Scripture inform us, that Chriſt made any tranſlation of this dayes begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the morning. Nor doth it follow, that the day muſt begin at morning or midnight, becauſe it did not end at that time of the Evening when Chriſt appeared to his Diſciples, for it might determine ſoon after his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance (as the words, <hi>being the firſt day of the week</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to the premiſes ſeem to infinu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The fourth Objection (upon which ſome much rely) is that of <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. to 12. where <hi>Paul</hi> and the Diſciples <note place="margin">

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115451:49"/>
eight or nine hours long, and ſcarce ſo much as half holy dayes; and to abandon all private Sabbath and Lords-dayes duties, in allowing no time at all for them. If then the cuſtomary conſtant cauſe of our beginning and concluding publick Sermons, with other ſolemn exerciſes and Aſſemblies on the Sabbath or Lords-day, are no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Argument that the Sabbath or Lords-day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence or determine, when theſe publick Sermons, Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, and Aſſemblies do, much leſſe can this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſingular Sermon of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> continued untill <hi>Midnight,</hi> or the prorogation of this Aſſembly at <hi>Troas,</hi> till the morning, of themſelves alone inferre this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that the Lords-day begins or ends at Midnight, or morning.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, it appears not by the Text, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preached untill Midnight, and continued this Aſſembly till day breaking, for this very reaſon, becauſe the Lords-day ended not till then. There is no ſuch thing as this inſinuated by Saint <hi>Luke:</hi> but the reaſon of it is plainly expreſſed to be, <hi>Pauls departure from thence the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing morning, never to ſee their faces more:</hi> and Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> drift in recording this Story, is not to ſignifie, when the Lords-day properly begins and determines; but onely as an Hiſtorian truly to relate the Apoſtles Actions; and to record <hi>Pauls</hi> induſtry in preaching upon <hi>all occaſions;</hi> with his love to the diſciples at <hi>Troas,</hi> and their <hi>reſpects to</hi> him, and his miraculous <hi>reſtoring</hi> Eutychus <hi>to life,</hi> who <hi>fell down dead from the third L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ft, whiles he was preaching.</hi> Therefore it can be no inſallible Argument to prove, that the Lords-day begins or ends at Morning, much leſſe at Midnight; ſince they brake brend, and did eat and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate together till the morning.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, I would demand of the Objectors, when this Aſſemb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y at <hi>Troas</hi> began? If at Morning or Midnight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: that is improbable, ſince we cannot imagine, that <hi>Paul</hi> made a Sermon at that time of 18 <hi>or</hi> 20 <hi>hours long;</hi> half of which would have tyred both himſelf and his Auditors. If not before our Sunday at <hi>Evening,</hi> as they
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115451:50"/>
pretend; then it is a ſtronger Argument to prove that the Lordſday begins not till <hi>Sunday evening;</hi> becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Diſciples</hi> at <hi>Troas</hi> met not together to ſolemnize it till then; then that it ends (and ſo by conſequence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins) at morning or midnight, becauſe this Aſſembly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not till morning, and <hi>Paul</hi> continued his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing untill midnight.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, If this example conclude any thing poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the Objectors, it is onely this; That they ſhould continue their ordinary Lordſday Evening Sermons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Midnight, and their Aſſemblies till day breaking; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Diſciples did here.</hi> This inference follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directly from this example, without any ſtraining; far better then theirs from it doth; that <hi>the Lordſday be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins and ends at Midnight or Morning.</hi> But this inference I ſuppoſe they will all diſclaim in words, as they do in practice, as being a <hi>Nonſequitur;</hi> becauſe this example was but ſingular and extraordinary upon a ſpeciall occaſion. Therefore by the ſelf ſame reaſon, they muſt diſclaim their preſent Objections too, or elſe ſubſcribe to this my infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which they cannot avoid unleſſe they quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their own.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, its clear St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſed <hi>to preach both in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon:</hi> exhorting <hi>Timothy</hi> and other Miniſters to do the like, 2 Tim. 4. 2. that is, as moſt interpret it, to preach both upon <hi>Lordſdayes,</hi> and all other daies and nights too, as he ſaw occaſion. Why then might not his Sermon at <hi>Troas</hi> begin upon the <hi>Lordſday</hi> at Evening, about our Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sermon time, and yet continue till the Lordſday was paſt. Certainly, there is no impoſſibility, nor improbabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but it might ſo: Since therefore this text of St. <hi>Luke</hi> informs us onely, that this Meeting and Sermon began up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Firſt day of the week, when the diſciples came together to break bread;</hi> that the <hi>Sermon laſted till midnight, and the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly till day break following,</hi> without any expreſſion that the <hi>Firſtday</hi> was then continuing or ended; admitting this Aſſembly and Sermon to be on our <hi>Sunday</hi> night, (which I abſolutly deny) yet it follows not, that the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115451:50"/>
Firſt day ended not in St. <hi>Lukes</hi> accompt and theirs at <hi>Troas,</hi> before the Sermon or Aſſembly concluded. So that this example proves nothing at all for the Opponents Theſis, nor any thing againſt mine, for which it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding evidence, if rightly underſtood, as I have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſted.</p>
            <p>The 5. Objection, for the Lordſdayes beginning at morning, and againſt its Evening commencement, is this. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Objection</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> That the beginning of it at Evening, would open a wide gap to all licentiouſnes, Paſtimes, Diſorders, on Lordſday after-noons, and likewiſe to ſecular imployments unſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the day; which the beginning of it at morning would prevent.</p>
            <p>To this, I anſwer. Firſt, that this Objection is a meer Cavill: For we ſee by wofull experience, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <note place="margin">Anſwer</note> of the Lordſdays beginning in the Morning (which is and hath been generally received of late years in moſt places of the Kingdome) hath no wayes prevented, reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died any of the Abuſes, objected, on Lordſday Evenings, which diſſolute perſons, who make no conſci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying all the day, will alike prophane, and all godly people equally ſanctifie, let the day begin and end at Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, at Sunſet, or Starſhining: And there are none who out of Conſcience ſanctifie and forebear to prophane them now, but would equally ſanctifie thoſe Evenings too, did they believe the day to conclude at Evening, ſince they would be ſure to ſanctifie all the day. This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected miſchief therefore is but a pretence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is clear that God himſelf commanded his ſeventh day <hi>Sabbath, and other Solemn F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

God therefore (infinitely wiſe foreſeeing better than the beſt, wiſeſt, holieſt and moſt prudent Chriſtian Magiſtrates or Miniſters all inconveniences, abuſes that might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane his Sabbath, and what beginning, concluſion of it would beſt prevent all prophanations, and make moſt for its ſanctification) inſtituting hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Sabbath and other Feſtivals to begin and end at Evening, not at morning or
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115451:51"/>
mid-night; I may ſafely inferre (againſt this preſent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection) that this beginning, concluding the Lordſday at Evening, even in Gods accompt, and ſo in verity it ſelf, is leaſt inconvenient, leaſt miſchievous, and the beſt of all the three to prevent all prophanations, abuſes of the day: Therefore it ought to be imbraced, as that which God himſelf hath preſcribed for the beſt, the meeteſt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I have formerly proved, that this beginning of it at Evening, doth beſt prepare men for its ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that it prevents more prophanations, Abuſes of it committed on and occaſioned by diſorders of all ſorts on the Saturday night (as we falſly term it) then it could poſſibly produce on Lordſday Evenings: To which I ſhall adde, that it likewiſe excuſeth all Husbandmen, Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and others from being <hi>Sabbath-breakers;</hi> who in the Winter quarters, riſe early to their weekly labour on Munday morning, ſome three or four hours before <hi>day-break;</hi> who ſhould be <hi>Sabboath breakers</hi> in an high degree, if the ſabbath or Lordſday ended not til <hi>day breaking,</hi> as ſome Objectors pretend. Therefore I may conclude, that this beginning of the Lordſday at Evening, make more for the ſanctification of the day, and prevents more inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then that at morning, and ſo ought to be retained.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This beginning and concluding the Lordſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day at Evening, cannot any way produce ſuch effects of licentiouſneſſe, and prophaneneſſe on Lordſday Evenings as is ſuggeſted; ſince it puts no period to the Lordſday or its duties, till after Sunſet, when <hi>the Stars begin</hi> to ſhine; which is not till eight or nine of the clock in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, when all orderly people, families are more ready to betake themſelves to their family duties, private devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and reſt, then to Sports or Paſtimes: and about ſix a clock in the Winter quarter; after which all civill order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Parents, Maſters, (though not religious) permit not their Children or Servants to rove abroad; and ſuch who are truly pious, fall to repetition of the Sermons they heard the <hi>Lordſday</hi> before, ſinging of Pſalms, reading the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115451:51"/>
Scriptures and godly Books, Catechiſing their families, Prayer, Meditations, and ſuch like holy family duties, anſwerable to the piety they profeſſe, and the holineſſe of the preceding day. So that it gives no liberty at all to any diſhoneſt unchriſtian Sports or meetings, as is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which commonly break up and end ere the Lordſday concludes in this accompt, and which all good Chriſtians ever avoid at all times, eſpecially after Lordſday exerciſes of Piety and Religion, with which they have no anologie.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Admit the objection true, that this beginning of the Lordſday at Evening ſhould prove more inconvenient then that at morning; not ſimply in it ſelf, but in regard of mens abuſing it; which yet I deny; yet it follows not, that therefore the day ought then to begin; ſince the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of any <hi>Doctrine,</hi> through the corruption of men, makes not the <hi>Doctrine</hi> leſſe true; and ſince <hi>Inconvenien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es</hi> muſt not, cannot alter thoſe bounds, which God himſelf hath immutably preſcribed unto dayes. True it is, that <hi>inconveniencies</hi> backed with any precepts or ſcripture for the beginning of dayes are good Arguments, proofs of truths; but wanting Scripture authority to enforce them or being objected againſt apparent texts, they are no ways concluſive. Such are the inconveniences here pretended, which whether they will happen, yea or no, will not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, appear, till this Doctrine of the Lordſdayes commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing at Evening, and the uſe of publique Evening Prayers in all places Saturday Evenings, as a preparative to the Lordſday Sanctification formerly uſed, be generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as formerly: which men will not ſo much abuſe to Liberty and Licentiouſneſſe, as is pretended; or if they do, the fault is onely theirs, not the Doctrines. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Concluſion remains ſtill firm, notwithſtanding this Objection.</p>
            <p>The Sixt and laſt Objection is this: That many godly Learned Divines of late and preſent times, have in their <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Objection</hi> 6.</note> Writings, Sermons, delivered this Opinion for a truth; <hi>That the Lordſday begins and ends at morning, not at evening; becauſe Chriſt roſe not till the Morning:</hi> and it is now the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115451:52"/>
common received opinion, practice of all our Divines and moſt private Chriſtians. Therefore queſtionleſſe, it is the truth, and dangerous to alter it in Theſis or Practice.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer. Firſt, That it is true, many reverend holy learned late Divines (whoſe names for honours ſake <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1.</note> I ſhall forbear to mention) have in their publique Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and many more in their Sermons; delivered this opinion (yet many of them only dubiouſly with an <note n="*" place="margin">

John 20. 1.</note> IT SEEMETH or IT IS PROBABLE, or LIKELY, not reſolutely) and that their preſent practice is anſwerable thereunto: But yet all the learned Godly Chriſtians in all former ages have held, practiced the contrary, as I have proved; and ſome godly eminent Divines among us now, conclude in judgement with them. The judgment therefore and practiſe of all Ages, Churches, from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time till now, ſhould rather ſway the ballance of this controverſie, then theſe few late Divines, though lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and judicious.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Moſt of thoſe godly learned men have taken up this Opinion, and publiſhed it to others upon <hi>Wolphius</hi> his Authority and ground, without any full examination or ſerious ſtudy of the point, as appears by this, that they do but lightly touch it in the by and ſo away, not ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly or peremptorily reſolving it, grounding themſelves upon ſuch reaſons as no wayes prove their Concluſion; and in truth are meerly falſ, in that ſenſe they underſtand them, as I have largely manifeſted in the premiſes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Authorities are not ſo much to be regarded.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In all Diſputes we muſt not ſo much obſerve what and who the Authors produced are, as what their proofs and reaſons are. If theſe good learned mens Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, Reaſons be unſound, as I have manifeſted them; no matter what their Opinions, lives or practiſes are; fince the learnedeſt, the holieſt are and may be ſubject unto Errours, from which none are exempted. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have here propounded the beſt Reaſons alledged on all hands, for the Sabbath and Lordſdayes beginning, at E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, Morning, Midnight, let the beſt Proofs, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115451:52"/>
win the field; and then <hi>I</hi> hope the victory will fall on my ſide without any more Diſpute, who contend not for victory, but truth alone.</p>
            <p>Having thus (as I conceive) given full ſatisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to all materiall Objections, I ever yet read, heard, or conceive againſt the Lords-days beginning at Evening; I come now to reply to one grand Exception againſt that place of <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 32. <hi>From Evening to Evening y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To which ſome reply, that this Text ſpeaks onely of the <hi>Sabbath of attonement,</hi> which was but Ceremoniall; <note place="margin">Exception.</note> not of the <hi>ſeventh day Sabbath;</hi> therefore it is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Proof at all, that the <hi>ſeventh day Sabbath,</hi> or Lords-day ſucceeding it, ſhould begin and end at E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening.</p>
            <p>To which I reply, Firſt, that it is true; this Text is meant more particularly of the Sabbath of attonement, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reply</hi> 1.</note> to which it is here ſpecially applyed, but yet it extends withall to the <hi>ſeventh day Sabbath,</hi> (which all confeſſe did ever begin, and end at Evening) from whence it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved both its name of <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and its limitation too, both for the manner and time of its ſanctification, as is clear by verſe 27, 28, 29, 30. 31, 32. compared together.</p>
