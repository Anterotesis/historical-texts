            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>AFter my beſt love and reſpects unto you, I thought it not amiſſe to acquaint you with our happy and ſucceſſefull Proceedings in theſe parts, and of thoſe Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories which we have obtained, ſince our ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth from <hi>London, VIZ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon the ſixth of this month, wee came to a Town called <hi>Fenny-Stratford,</hi> in <hi>Norhampton<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:156048:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 25 -->
and intended to have billeted there that Night, but they were diſappointed: For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one of the clock in the morning there came a Meſſenger to the Town, and informed us, that Prince ROBERTS Troopes were marching with all ſpeed towards the Towne: Whereupon we immediatly aroſe, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out of the Town to meet the Cavaleers, where we ſuddenly eſpyed them comming, and ſuch was the courage of our men, that they ſet ſpurs to their horſes, and away they rid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, where having ſome parley toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not agreeing, we diſcharged againſt them, and they againſt us, inſomuch that a bloody battle did inſue, as followeth.</p>
            <p>Both Armies being ſet in battle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, they began to diſcharge with much courage on both ſides, and continued a long time therein, it being very doubtfull on which ſide the Victory would fall.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Blake, a Dutchman,</hi> behaved himſelf very valiantly in the fight, for he brought up a Troop of men very valiantly againſt us with much poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, aſſaulting of us both in the Front and left wing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:156048:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 25 -->Then we diſcharged againſt him both in the left wing and Front, and at the laſt cauſed him to retreat back, ſlaying four or five of his men that came againſt us on the left wing, and he himſelf eſcaped a bullet very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly.</p>
            <p>Wherupon he withdrew himſelfe and his men to the Reer of their own Army, the reſt of their Troops ſtill diſcharging againſt us, being far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Number then we were, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them very able ſouldiers that came from Holland with Prince Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert.</p>
            <p>Yet although their Company was greater then ours we feard them not for had they bin twice as many more as they were, we was reſolved to fight it out to the laſt man.</p>
            <p>And ſuch is the courage of our men, that although they be but few in Number, yet will they fight with any that they meet with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:156048:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 26 -->Yet nevertheleſſe, although they did exceed farre greater in number, yet they did not exceed beyond us in courage; for at our firſt meeting, wee cut off a great many of them, and took fifty priſoners, they being now ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to Norhampton Goal, where they now remain priſoners.</p>
            <p>And after we had skirmiſhed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the ſpace of 9. hours, we put them all to flight, making them runne before us like a flock of ſheepe before their ſhepheard, they not daring to withſtand us.</p>
            <p>There was alſo a Gentleman came from the Lord <hi>Brookes</hi> and Collonell <hi>Hambdens Regiments</hi> neer <hi>Coventre,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying and intimating unto us the Proceedings of their Forces againſt the Cavaleers.</p>
            <p>And likewiſe ſignified, that they had had a great skirmiſh with divers Cavaleers that came out of <hi>KENT,</hi> being reſolved to go to the Standard at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> to aid and aſſiſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty

               <!-- PDF PAGE 26 -->
againſt all thoſe that ſhhuld op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him.</p>
            <p>Where having for the ſpace of two hours ſhot very furiouſly one againſt another, the Battle began to ceaſe, and the Kentiſh Cavaleers began to retreat, retiring back again with all ſpeed, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving behind them ſlain and wounded, neer upon threeſcore, which came out of <hi>Kent</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>There was alſo taken in this battle Sir <hi>William Butler,</hi> Sir <hi>Anthony Liger,</hi> Captain <hi>Jacob Jackſon,</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant Gilbert,</hi> a very able and approved of Souldier.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Forces that are under the Command of the right Honourable the Lord <hi>Brooks,</hi> hath defeated many more Troops thereabouts.</p>
            <p>We are now marching with all ſpeed towards <hi>Liecesterſhire,</hi> to cleere that County of the Blood-ſucking Cavaleers, that doth now ſo much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the diſtreſſed Proteſtants of that County.</p>
