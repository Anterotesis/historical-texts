         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HOly men of God both acted and ſpake as they were
moved of the holy Ghoſt in all ages, whoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
ſtand as an outward Witneſs of the inward
and ſpiritual Life of righteouſneſſe that was in
them, which in all ages was oppoſed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
ſpirit of the World, which the children of diſobedience
are led by; and this is the ground of difference, they being led
by a Spirit oppoſite to God and his children of obedience; and
as the ſpirit of the World in them that are led by it, acts them
differently from the Children of God; ſo doth the Spirit of
Truth act its children contrary to the children of the World,
and their practice ſtood in all ages as living Witneſſes againſt
them, and that Spirit they were led by, and is written for our
learning and edification, on whom the ends of the World are
come, which is to know an end of that ſpirit's leadings in us,
which leads from God into the World that lieth in wickedneſs,
and its faſhions and cuſtoms which are heatheniſh, ſenſual
and devilliſh; and thus being taught by the Spirit of God, our
actions ſtand Witneſſes againſt the vain converſation and tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the World, and condemns and judges that Spirit now
as ever it did in the days of old, whereby they became ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in that day; as for the ſame Teſtimony we are become ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers
in this day.</p>
            <p>But bleſſed are they that ſuffer for righteouſneſſe ſake, who
keep the Word of God's patience in this his day; they are, and
ſhall be kept by the power of the Word of Life, til all that
which riſeth up againſt them, be brought down under them,
that God alone may be exalted over all, and they in him, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon the high places of the Earth, and all its vain ſhews
of holineſſe, which are but the inventions and traditions of
thoſe who are erred from the Spirit of Truth, and from the
practiſe of the holy men of God, who were ſeparated from
the World by the Life of righteouſneſſe which they lived, and
ſo dyed the death of the righteous, which was a death to all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31804:2"/>
that which ſeparated from the Lord; and ſo being dead to ſin,
were alive to righteouſneſſe; which Life immortal ſtands a
Witneſſe in all ages againſt the idolatry and ſuperſtition of the
preſent times they lived in, bearing a true teſtimony againſt
them in life and death; and the mortal body or tabernacle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſſolved or laid down, the living Spirit in their Brethren
leads them to inter or bury their bodies apart in their own bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying-places
(as was the practice of the holy-men of God in
former ages) bearing a teſtimony againſt the idolatry and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
of hallowed ground, and Popiſh Conſecrations, and
vain traditions, which the living Spirit of the party deceaſed,
whilſt in the body, ſtood a Witneſſe (for God) againſt; and now
being out of the body, yet in the union with his brethren in
the body, cannot fulfil and ſatisfie the wil of the contrary ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and therefore it is diſturbed and tormented about the
dead body, and exceedingly rageth in many places; and as the
Devil did ſtrive with <hi>Michael</hi> about the body of <hi>Moſes</hi> (who
was a faithful ſervant of God in his life, and the God of his
life would not ſuffer the wicked ſpirit to ſatisfie his wil with his
body being dead) and the Angel brought not a railing accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt him, but ſaid, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee.</hi> So you may
ſee what Spirit it is that is to be rebuked by the Lord, that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that ſtrives againſt his Servants, and beats, rages and ſtrikes
them, and ſometimes takes away the dead body from them for
a time, til the Lord rebukes them, and then they have let it go
to be laid in its own place of burial, which when it was alive,
might purchaſe or contribute to for that end, to be laid in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dead.</p>
            <p>You may ſee the children of <hi>Heath</hi> were not ſo unreaſonable
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as to hinder him to bury his dead after he had
bought their Land for that purpoſe; and is it not a ſhame to be
called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and to be in practiſe more unreaſonable then
Heathen? Is it not high time to ſeparate from ſuch a generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
both in life and death; and finding ſuch unreaſonable deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
while we are in the body, it muſt needs be a grief to us if
we were neceſſitated for want of a place, to leave our dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to their courteſie; and if there were nothing elſe, it were

            <head>This is written for the ſatisfaction of ſuch as are unſatisfied touching
the burying of the people in ſcorn called QUAKERS, in their own
burying-places; the which read with moderation, as followeth.</head>
            <p>FIrſt, you may read that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> did buy two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
of ground, that it might be their own poſſeſſions for
the burying of their dead, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. 16, 17. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 32, 33. Now
that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the reſt of the holy men of God,
were led and directed by the Spirit of God, I hope none dare
deny; therefore why ſhould it be a ſtrange thing to any that
the <hi>Quakers</hi> (ſo called) have purchaſed parcels of ground for
the burying of their dead, ſeeing it is proved that the holy men
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31804:4"/>
of God did ſo above 1600. yeers ago, and the Spirit of God is
the ſame, and changeth not; ſo the <hi>Quakers</hi> (ſo called) are not
out of the way, but in that good old way as <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
and <hi>Moſes</hi> walked in; therefore let it be no ſtrange thing.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> You may read that <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Wife, <hi>Jacob</hi> and
<hi>Iſaac</hi> and his Wife, and <hi>Leah,</hi> with many more, were buried in
their burying-places after they had bought them, as you may
read <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 30, 32. Now <hi>Abraham, Moſes</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> with the
reſt of the holy men of God, were no new Upſtarts, but old,
grave, godly men, of a great Age, as you may read <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.
16, 17. <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. 28, 30. Therefore why ſhould any account the
<hi>Quakers</hi> (ſo called) young upſtart people for burying their
dead in their own burying-places? And if any do account
them ſo, they may as wel account <hi>Abraham</hi> the faithful, <hi>Iſaac,
Jacob</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo, with the reſt of the holy men of God;
therefore far be it from any ſo to do.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> You may read that <hi>Moſes</hi> the great Prophet of the Lord
was buryed in a Valley in the Land of <hi>Moab,</hi> and he did quake
and tremble at the Word, or the voice of God, therefore why
ſhould it be a ſtrange thing if any of the people (called <hi>Quakers)</hi>
are buryed in a valley, and quake and tremble at the Word or
Voice of God. Now whether any did call <hi>Moſes</hi> a <hi>Quaker,</hi> I
know not; but this I know, many are in ſcorn called <hi>Quakers</hi>
only for doing that which <hi>Moſes</hi> did; and I believe if <hi>Moſes</hi>
were now living, he would be called a <hi>Quaker</hi> by this generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The proof of <hi>Moſes</hi> being buryed in a Valley, and that he
did quake and tremble, read <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. 6, 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 21. <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 32</p>
            <p>4<hi>thly.</hi> You may read that <hi>Samuel</hi> the ſervant of the Lord was
buryed in his own houſe at <hi>Ramath,</hi> and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
(not to hinder him to be buried there) but to bury him
there, as you may read <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 1. and mourned for him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
why ſhould any endeavour to hinder the people called
<hi>Quakers</hi> to bury their dead in their houſes, or near their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
ſeeing the Servant of the Lord was buryed in his houſe, as
is proved? Therefore why ſhould any endeavour to hinder
them to bury their dead, as the true Prophets and dear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God did, in their own poſſeſſions?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:31804:5"/>
5<hi>thly,</hi> You may read that <hi>Joſhua</hi> the ſervant of the Lord was
buryed in the border of his inheritance, on the North-ſide of the
Hil; and the ſon of <hi>Aaron</hi> was buryed in the Hil of <hi>Phineas</hi> which
was given him; therefore why may not the people called <hi>Quakers</hi>
bury their dead without offence in their own inheritances where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
it is, either on a Hill, or in a valley, or in or near a houſe,
or in a Garden, ſeeing <hi>Moſes, Joſhua, Aaron</hi>'s ſon, <hi>Samuel,</hi> and
Chriſt Jeſus, with many more, were buryed in ſuch places, as you
may read <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 28, 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 33. <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 41. Therefore you have no
juſt cauſe to be offended with the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> for ſo bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying.</p>
            <p>6<hi>thly,</hi> You may read that <hi>Uzziah</hi> the King (who did uprightly
in the ſight of God) was buryed with his Fathers in the field of the
burial, (mark) not in any place called Church or Churchyard, but
in the field of the burial: Therefore let it not be a ſtrange thing
that the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> do deny to bury their dead in the
places called Churches or Churchyards; for <hi>Abraham</hi> refuſed to
bury his Wife in any of their Sepulchres, though earneſtly deſired
ſo to do, but buryed her in his own burying place; and King <hi>Uz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi>
with many more, were buryed in their own burying-places,
and not in places called Churches or Church-yards, as you may
read <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. at large, <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 33. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 25, 33. Now <hi>I</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it was far from the heart of King <hi>Uzziah</hi> to hearken, or in
the leaſt to condeſcend to any <hi>is</hi> hinder the burying of their dead
in their burying-places, which was their own poſſeſſions, but <hi>I</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
believe did juſtifie their ſo burying, and was buryed himſelf
in the Field of the Burial, which is before proved. Therefore far
be it from the hearts of any to deſire a Law to be made to hinder
the <hi>Quakers</hi> (ſo called) to bury their dead in their inheritances,
which ought to be preſerved by the Laws of the Land; and far be
it from the hearts of any to make any ſuch Law, becauſe their
practice in ſo burying; was the practice of the holy men of God,
agreeable to the Word of God which was in the beginning, as it
is recorded in the Scriptures of truth, which holy men of God
ſpake forth as they were inſpired by the holy Ghoſt, to be read,
believed and practiſed, and to wait to have them fulfilled, and not
to make a Trade of them, as they are made of, for diſhoneſt
gain.</p>

7<hi>thly,</hi> You may read that <hi>Jacob</hi> (being 147. years old when he
dyed) did deſire his ſons to carry him out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to be buryed
in the burying-place, and did engage them ſo to do, being a far
way, which they did accordingly, as you may read <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. 28, 30.
<hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 12, 13. Now <hi>Jacob</hi> was not unſenſible, but very ſenſible
in ſo doing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> none I hope dare ſay otherwiſe: Therefore if any of
the <hi>Quakers</hi> (ſo called) before they dye, do deſire their Friends to
bury them in their burying-place whereſoever it is, which was
the deſire of the party deceaſed, (being called a <hi>Quaker)</hi> why
ſhould it be a ſtrange thing, ſeeing <hi>Iacob</hi> did deſire ſuch a thing!</p>
            <p>Now leſt any ſay, I judge all to be heatheniſh people that bury
in your places called Churches and Church-yards, or that <hi>I</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
all from burying there: My anſwer unto ſuch is this, I am
very cautions in ſo judging all, but ſhall leave all judgement un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, who will judge every
one according unto the doings of every one; and as every one is
perſwaded in the particular, in the heart of every particular, by
God's Witneſſe, which is God's Light ſhining in the heart, ſo let
every one do in the thing; &amp; if any of you make choice of your pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
called Churches or Churchyards for the burying of your dead,
or for any other uſe, it is fit you ſhould keep them up, and repair
them upon your own coſt and charges, &amp; take heed of taking any
goods from ſuch who make no uſe of them, for in ſo doing you
wil do ſuch great wrong, and ſuch that ſtealeth, cannot enter the
Kingdom of Heaven, who breaketh the Commandment of God.
Therefore it is dangerous, take heed of ſo doing, and this I truly
know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having perfect knowledge of them, the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called,
are taught by the Principle of God, which is a noble Principle, not
to require, beg or deſire any thing of you to keep up, or repair
their burying-places, which are their own inheritances, very wel
walled, or very wel paled, except ſuch as are yet unready, which
in time are intended ſo to be made up on their own coſt &amp; char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and ſo are not your places called Churches or Church-yards
your own inheritances, neither walled nor paled in many places
in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> for Swine have been ſeen in ſome of your
yards in this County; and ſome ſay the people called Papiſts claim
them to be their places, and that they built them, and that they
will keep them up upon their coſt, if they ſhal have them, as ſome

ſay: But <hi>I</hi> ſhall not contend for them, they are of age, let them
ſpeak for themſelves; only this J may ſay, and in ſo ſaying none
will have juſt cauſe to be offended. There is a Croſs of Wood or
Stone, or in painting, in the inſide or outſide of the moſt of them,
or in the yards belonging unto them, if not all, and you that are
called <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that caſually go there, take notice whether it be
not ſo; then is not that the mark of <hi>Popery?</hi> J leave it to you to
judge, and ſay as the wiſe man ſaith, <hi>A word to the wiſe is enough.</hi>
So if you look upon your places convenient for the burying of
your dead, be contented with them, and let the people called
<hi>Quakers</hi> have their liberty to bury their dead in their burying-places,
which are their own poſſeſſions, which they are very well
contented with, which is proved to be according to the Word of
God as it is recorded in the Scriptures of truth, acted above 1600
years ago. Therefore let this ſatisfie all ſuch as are unſatisfied
touching it; much more might be written, but this may ſatisfie in
ſhort, being written by one who deſireth the good and welfare,
and proſperity of all that deſire to know God and his Way; well
known unto thoſe that are in perfect knowledge with God, but
