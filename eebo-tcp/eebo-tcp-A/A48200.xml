            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER to a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Convention</hi> of <hi>States</hi> In SCOTLAND</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Had fully Determined not to encrease the number of these <hi>Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> who now a dayes fill the Press, with every little Product of their Empty Brain: And lov'd better to please my self with Reading other Mens Opinions; than hazard my own to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the World. But when I consider the great Heats and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities, among all sorts of People, and the Vast Pains that some Violent Men are at, to throw us back into a Thousand worse miseries, than these from which GOD has most Graciously delivered us: The Duty I owe to my Religion, to my Country, and the particular Freindship I bear to you, will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me any more to be silent.</p>
            <p>You are now called together, Sir, by his Highness the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> to Consult and Deliberate, what Methods will be most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to secure Our <hi>Religion, Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi>; in order to which, the first thing that will fall under your consideration, is the setling the <hi>Soveraign power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I take for granted, that you are fully convinced, that K: <hi>Iames</hi> the 7th: by his many Violations of the Fundamental Laws, by his endeavouring to establish a <hi>Despotick</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary povver,</hi> and introduce <hi>Popery,</hi> (tho he himself had confirmed all the Laws that were enacted in Favours of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi>) has thereby sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the <hi>Constitution,</hi> and that our Miseries might have no Redress from him, has left us in a time when we needed his Protection most. The Eyes of all <hi>Europe</hi> are upon you, and it is in your Power to make your <hi>Selves</hi> and your <hi>Posterity</hi> either <hi>Happy</hi> or <hi>Miserable</hi>; by making a choise either to call back the same <hi>King Iames,</hi> and hazard once more all that <hi>Men account Dear,</hi> To his Mercy, or to settle the <hi>Government</hi> on some other, under whom you may live
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48651:3"/>
Quiet and Peaceable Lives, without the perpetual Terror of being swallowed up by <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> which all good men hoped were now quite banished, and yet behold a <hi>new Off spring</hi> is sprung up, which plead Eagerly for both, tho' under the mistaken Names of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi>; It's strange that any Man can so far <hi>Degenerate,</hi> as to prefer <hi>Slavery</hi> to <hi>Liberty,</hi> and that they should be so much in Love with <hi>Chains,</hi> that when they were Fairly shaken off, they should run Furiously to be <hi>Fettered</hi> again; as if the <hi>Ottoman</hi> and <hi>French Government</hi> were so charming in our <hi>Countrey</hi> that we cannot not live without it, tho' we have so lately groaned under the Dismal Burden of it: And it might have been supposed that even these who had been <hi>Instrumental</hi> in <hi>Enslaving</hi> their <hi>Fellow-Brethren,</hi> and were grown Fat with sucking in the <hi>Nations Blood</hi>; would have taken another Method to Reconcile themselves, than by perswading us to purchase their Safety, at so vast an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence as the Ruine of more than three parts of the Nation will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarly Amount to.</p>
            <p>Do but a little Reflect <hi>Sir,</hi> on the <hi>Motives</hi> which these Men (blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by self Interest) make use of, to Delude the Nation into a security, that wanted very little of proving Fatal to it, and compare them with the Strong Reasons, we have to disswade us from being so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on, and they will be found so <hi>Weak,</hi> and <hi>Impertinent,</hi> that you must Judge it next to <hi>Impossibility,</hi> to suffer our Selves to be <hi>Twice De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi> But if the Experience of our former Miseries, so lately hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over our Heads, (the very thoughts of renewing which make all good Men to tremble) has not made us Wiser, and be not of <hi>Efficacy</hi> enough, to deterr us from venturing another <hi>Shipwrack,</hi> and exposing all again to the <hi>Discretion</hi> of a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi>; It's more than probable that GOD has abandoned us, <hi>and given us up to believe strong Delusions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, Sir,</hi> they will endeavour to perswade You, that <hi>Kings</hi> are Eximed from <hi>Punishments</hi> here on <hi>Earth,</hi> and nothing they do can be Quarrelled by their Subjects; which indeed might with some Reason be urged among the <hi>Turks,</hi> who reserve nothing from the Power of their <hi>Sultans</hi> and where its Death to Dispute his <hi>Commands,</hi> tho' never so <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Tyrranical</hi>: But with what Impudence
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48651:3"/>
can such Stuff be imposed on us, who never admit our <hi>Kings</hi> to the <hi>Government,</hi> till they swear to Rule us according to <hi>Lavv</hi> and no otherways? The <hi>Lavvs</hi> are the only Security we have for our Lives and Properties, which if our <hi>Soveraign</hi> subvert, <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> cannot be blamed, for making use of the Ordinary Means to preserve them, and since that cannot be done without withdrawing Obedience from such a <hi>Magistrate</hi> as goes about to destroy them, such an Act cannot properly be said to punish him, (because we take nothing from him to which he has a just Claim) but do only shun the occasion of making our selves Miserable. The <hi>Speculative Doctrine</hi> of <hi>passive Obedience,</hi> has done too much Mischief among us, and what has befallen the <hi>King</hi> may be justly imputed to it, for the believing that without Opposition he might do what he pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, encouraged him to take such Measures as have drawn all these Misfortunes on him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Others are so Fond as to believe, that we may be secure in calling the King back, providing they so Limit him, that it will not be in his Power to hurt us: These Men do not Consider, how small a Complement this is to a Man of the <hi>Kings Temper,</hi> from an <hi>Absolute Prince</hi> as he was pleased to Fancy himself, to Content himself with the bare Title of a <hi>King,</hi> and how insupportable the Change must be, if from being <hi>Master of all,</hi> he must force himself to comply with a Thousand <hi>Masters</hi> and see his <hi>Throne</hi> become his <hi>prison.</hi> But how Airy is it to fancy, that any Restrictions of our Contrivance can bind the King. For 1<hi>st.</hi> It's most certain they can never be Voluntary, and what is constrained and done by Force, is by <hi>Lavv</hi> declared to be Void and Null; to whose Assistance the <hi>popes Dispensing Power</hi> being joined, would quickly blow off these <hi>Samson-Cords,</hi> and the <hi>Royal Power</hi> would again revive with all its Vigour and Lustre.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>King</hi> is of a Religion that has in a Famous <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> decreed, that no Faith is to be kept with <hi>Hereticks,</hi> much less with Subjects whom he looks upon as so many <hi>Rebels,</hi> and will not miss to treat them as such, when ever they give him the Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of doing it, for his greatest Admirers do not runn to that height
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48651:4"/>
of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> to imagine him so much <hi>Angel,</hi> as not to take all Methods to Revenge so great an Affront, and secure himself at our Cost from such a Treatment for the future, the Apprehension of which Resentment, will strike such Terror in Mens minds, that nothing will be capable to divert them, from offering up all for an Atonement, and <hi>popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi> will be thought a good Bargain, if they can but save their Lives: Then We may Lament Our Miseries, But it will not be in our power to help them, for a <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> is not alwayes ready to rescue us, with such vast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and so great hazard to his person, and if our madness hurry us so far, we deserve rather his pity than his resentment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What Argument has the King given since he left us, to perswade us he will be more faithful in observing his Words and Oaths, than hitherto he has been? Does he not in a Letter lately Printed here, expresly say he has ruled so, as to give no occasion of Complaint to any of his Subjects? Is not the same Letter signed by one, who Sacrificed both <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> to <hi>Interest,</hi> whose <hi>Pernicious</hi> and <hi>Head-strong Councils</hi> has Posted him to his ruine, tho all that has been done cannot make <hi>Him</hi> sensible of it? Sure the reducing <hi>Hereticks</hi> to the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not less Meretorious than before, nor King <hi>Iames</hi> the 7<hi>th.</hi> by breathing the <hi>French Air</hi> a little become less <hi>Bigot,</hi> It were a Dream to fancy it; For so long as the <hi>Vatican Thunders Excommunications,</hi> against all such as do not use their outmost Endeavour to Extirpate <hi>Heresie</hi>; a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> must have no Religion at all if they be not Terrible to him.</p>
            <p>The Third Argument they make use of to perswade such as are, and shall be chosen Members of the <hi>Convention,</hi> that it's their Interest to call back the <hi>King,</hi> Is that the Peace and Happiness of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> cannot be otherways secured, nor Factions or Divisions extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished; But what Factions <hi>Sir</hi> do you Observe, but such as they themselves do Foment on Purpose, to disturb our Harmony? All which would Immediately die, If the <hi>Government</hi> were once setled on these who deserved it best, for then if these fopps continued still fond of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny,</hi> they would be Chastised, as Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Publick Peace. The Argument may very justly be retorted, for if the <hi>King</hi> return wee will burst out into a Flame,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48651:4"/>
and <hi>England</hi> which has already declared, will quickly be on our Top, an Enemy too Potent and too Numerous for us, tho we were all united, besides the Danger to which such a Procedure will expose us, we cut off all Hopes of an Union with that <hi>Nation,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Deprive our selves of an unspeakable Advantage, which would redound to all sorts of People, and would be the only means to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port an Impoverish'd and sinking Nation. Neither is this the only Inconveniencie, tho it be a very Great one, for if we state our selves in Opposition to <hi>England,</hi> by Restoring the <hi>King</hi> whom they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, it is not to be doubted but he will use his outmost endeavour to Recover that Kingdom the loss of which is so considerable. Now seeing it were vain to suppose that the <hi>Scots</hi> alone were able to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond his Desires, he must needs have recourse to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Irish,</hi> whose Religion will procure a more entire Confidence, than his <hi>Majesty</hi> can repose in any Others. These therefore must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into our Bosome, and because <hi>Scotland</hi> is the most proper place, for Invading <hi>England,</hi> it must be the <hi>Scene</hi> of all the Blood and Confusion that this Melancholly thought gives us a Prospect of.</p>
            <p>The happy Success the PRINCE his Enterprise has met with, has made a considerable Alteration in the Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> for that great Enemy of the <hi>protestants</hi> and even of <hi>Christianity</hi> it self, who had propos'd nothing less to himself than an <hi>Vniversal Monarchy,</hi> whom the Strictest <hi>Leagues</hi> and <hi>Contracts</hi> cannot bind, but without regard to GOD or Man, threatens all his <hi>Neighbours</hi> with utter Desolation; By the <hi>Scen's</hi> being changed among us, is so far humbled that from a <hi>Proud</hi> and <hi>Insulting Enemy,</hi> he is become a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant for Peace, well fore-seeing that if <hi>Britain</hi> Join with those other <hi>Princes,</hi> whom his Insolence, Cruelty, and Avarice, has so justly Armed against him, his Ruine is <hi>Inevitable</hi>; So that if we have not <hi>Soul</hi> enough to enjoy this great <hi>Blessing,</hi> and can easily part with the <hi>Glory</hi> of being once more the <hi>Arbiters</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> let us at least have so much <hi>Christian Love</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> for the Neighbouring <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of our own Perswasion, as not to expose them to a necessary <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation</hi> of these <hi>Plagues,</hi> which our <hi>Common Enemies</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praing for us, and which will certainly <hi>Terminat</hi> in all our Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Lastly, Sir,</hi> I beseech you to consider what <hi>Persons</hi> they are who would <hi>Instill</hi> this <hi>Poyson</hi> in You, and you will find them of three kinds, First those who <hi>Postponeing the Common Good</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> are wholly Acted by <hi>Self Interest,</hi> considering that in a <hi>Government</hi> where <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> equally Flourish, <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>merit,</hi> not <hi>Villany</hi> will be rewarded. 2<hi>dly.</hi> They who are Ignorant of the Nature of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and were never at the pains to Inform themselves what measures the <hi>Lavv of Nature, and Nations,</hi> have set to Mens Obedience, but are <hi>Angry</hi> at every thing that thwarts their wild No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and will admit of nothing tho' never so reasonable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, if their dull <hi>Capacities</hi> cannot reach it. The 3<hi>d.</hi> Sort are such as have been <hi>Instrumental</hi> in <hi>Enslaving</hi> their <hi>Countrey,</hi> and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid if they be called to an Account, they may be brought to suffer <hi>Condign Punishment,</hi> if such cannot Succeed in their Design they at least hope to be overlookt in a <hi>General Confusion,</hi> so they leave nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essayed that may tend to their own safety; and if <hi>Heaven</hi> fail them, they Summond <hi>Hell</hi> to their Aid, not that <hi>Love</hi> to their <hi>Prince</hi> but meer <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Interest,</hi> drives these <hi>Criminals</hi> to such Attempts, neither are they much to blame, if they are at such pains to sow Divisions among us: But no Person of your <hi>Witt</hi> and <hi>Iudgement</hi> nor any Good Man that is truly <hi>Protestant</hi> and Minds the good of his <hi>Country,</hi> Will suffer himself to be so grosly Imposed on by such <hi>Fire-brands,</hi> who would Build their Future <hi>Imaginary Greatness,</hi> on the Ruine of <hi>Our Religion, Laws</hi> and <hi>Countrey.</hi>
