         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>This ſincere Doctrine apoſtolicall,</l>
            <l>Of precious ſtones, moſt gloriouſly did ſhine</l>

            <l>As bright within, as it is light without.</l>
            <l>But in this wall, this one thing is moſt rare,</l>
            <l>Is moſt regardable, beyond compare:</l>
            <l>That though thoſe twelve foundations firm &amp; ſtrong,</l>

            <l>Which is indeed to ſhew and ſignifye.</l>

            <l>He only is the Churches bulwark ſtrong,</l>

            <l>Diverſitie of gifts of heav'nly grace:</l>
            <l>Yet each of them in his peculiar place</l>

            <l>And not themſelves did preach, but Chriſt their King.</l>
            <l>The cities model was of perfect Gold,</l>
            <l>Moſt delectable, glorious to behold.</l>
            <l>Which mettle, for its ex'lent properties,</l>
            <l>This cities glory rarely amplifies.</l>
            <l>It being of all other chiefe and beſt,</l>
            <l>For theſe five reaſons in pure gold expreſt.</l>
            <l>Firſt, that the burning fire conſumes it not:</l>
            <l>Next, that it takes no Canker, ſtain or ſpot.</l>
            <l>Again, for uſe it longeſt doth endure,</l>
            <l>As alſo that the fire makes it more pure.</l>

            <l>The fair corruſcant beauty of the ſame,</l>
            <l>And therefore from the reſt it bares the fame.</l>
            <l>O! muſt not then this City needs be ſtable?</l>

            <l>Being ſo free from ſtains of all corruption,</l>

               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:119677:57"/>Whereby is thus much to us intimated:</l>

            <l>Twelve Gates moſt rich and precious did belong</l>
            <l>To the wall apoſtolike, moſt firm, moſt ſtrong,</l>
            <l>Which Gates were all of pearls moſt orient.</l>
            <l>Yet all were but one Pearl moſt excellent,</l>
            <l>Even Jeſus Chriſt, who is the only Port,</l>
            <l>Through whom th' Elect muſt into bliſs reſort.</l>
            <l>Through whom alone by ſaith we here are fed.</l>
            <l>Through whom at laſt we all ſhal taſt that bread,</l>
            <l>That bread of Life never to hunger more,</l>
            <l>Which for his Saints Chriſt hath laid up in ſtore.</l>
            <l>He only is the Dore, by which (I ſay)</l>
            <l>We shal go in and out, feed, Live for ay.</l>
            <l>And as on twelve foundations did ariſe</l>

               <hi>A VVall,</hi> as we did formerly premiſe;</l>
            <l>But <hi>One</hi> in Matter and in Luſtre bright,</l>
            <l>Even God the Father, Father of all Light:</l>
            <l>So theſe twelve Ports, are all one Pearl moſt rare,</l>
            <l>Even God the Son whence they derived are.</l>
            <l>But here this one objection may accrew,</l>
            <l>How it may come to paſs, a pearl should shew</l>
            <l>And repreſent this Man-God Chriſt our King?</l>
            <l>To which Objection, I this anſwer bring:</l>
            <l>That as the Shel wherein the Pearl doth grow,</l>
            <l>(Which <hi>Pliny</hi> plainly in his work doth snow)</l>
            <l>Doth at a certain ſeaſon gape and yawn,</l>

            <l>Draws into it a dew, from forth the ayre;</l>
            <l>Which, by the Sea, i' th' ſhel grows Orient fair,</l>
            <l>And of this dew doth more coagulate,</l>
            <l>Than tis of earthly ſtuff coaugmentate:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:119677:60"/>Even ſo, the Holy Ghoſt from heav'ns high frame,</l>
            <l>Upon the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> came;</l>
            <l>And Gods eternall power, whoſe breath all made,</l>
            <l>Did ſo Chriſts Virgin-Mother over-ſhade:</l>
            <l>That without any humane copulation,</l>
            <l>Chriſt in her womb took on him incarnation.</l>
            <l>Yet ſo, as that his powerfull Divinity</l>
