            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader of the following LETTERS.</head>
            <p>THat which principally engag'd the Author in a Discourse of this Nature, is taken notice of in the first of the ensuing Letters; and to excuse its Publication is beyond his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unless by intimating that neither Secular Advantage nor the vain hopes to become Popular, by such an Enterprise, had any share in it: If the World will not give him credit for the first, they must allow the last, since his desire to be conceal'd will plead the same in his behalf; but indeed he stands so much indebted to other Men for the confirmation of his own Opinions, that he freely owns himself in justice to be entituled to no more than the least valuable part thereof.</p>
            <p>There may seem, 'tis true, the less occasion for printing any thing of this kind, since there have been already so many excellent and learned Treatises deliver'd to the World: but whoever considers the Genius of the times, the Profanity and Libertinism of the present Age, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the prevaling Contagion of our Modern Deisus, that lately revived shelter for Atheistic Principles, will be more easily perswaded that all that can be said for the proof of these important Truths is not to be judged needless, and that there has not been so much said, or the Subjects so fully handled, as to exclude the use of any thing hereafter to be added.</p>
            <p>The methods of Mens writing must be acknowledg'd to be exceeding different, and 'tis no more than necessary they shou'd be so, there being so great a difference in the tempers and dispositions of their Readers, who reject at one time the same Truth they embrace at another, when more suitably adopted to the mode of their Understandings. But beyond all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Pulpit Discourse, how prudently or sincerely soever manag'd, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours with disadvantage, in that by many People 'tis lookt on but as a useless Cant, and the very name <hi>Priestcraft</hi> has made so great a noise in the World, that 'tis sufficient a Discourse be hist at by the unthinking Multitude, or the conceited Debauchee, if the same hapned to be deliver'd in the manner of a formal Sermon.</p>
            <p>There has been of late abundance of pains taken to stagger Men in
<pb facs="tcp:51616:3"/>
their Faith, to shake the very foundation of all true Piety, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Religion no more than a meer Scare-crow, set up by a sort of Men, <hi>viz.</hi> the Clergy, that they may frighten us into a slavish Vassalage, or condescens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on to their own sinister Designs. Some late Pamphlets of the <hi>Socinians</hi> have had a visible tendency this way, but much more the Writings of those insolent and barefac'd Oppugners of Christianity, whose Designs (at least many of them) we have reason to believe no other than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tation of their Authors Parts: and in judging thus, we are as charitable as they themselves can expect we shou'd: for tho' the Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries of the Powers of Darkness must have made use of such like Tools, for the undermining true Religion, and expelling all undissembled Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty out of the World, yet 'tis possible the Intentions of these high Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to Reason were not altogether so villainous, whatever Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may attend their Writings.</p>

            <p>I shall not think my self oblig'd to take any particular Survey of the Writings of these Men, nor to examine the Stories of their Authors Lives; some of which are so well known to the World, that they cannot injure any considerate Man, with their hetorodox Opinions. I need not instance in Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> (one of their Epistolary Correspondents) a Man however admir'd and celebrated for his Writings, yet died in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency, and had his Religion to choose even at the hour of his death. As for the right honourable my Lord—I think they had much better have left him out of their Oracles, since however fondly he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y embraced both Them and their Opinions, it made a great part of
<pb facs="tcp:51616:3"/>
his Contrition before he finisht his Life, that he had ever countenanc'd such extravagant Thoughts, or shew'd himself a Favourite to such wretched Associates.</p>
            <p>Whoever considers the manner of Mr <hi>B—t</hi>'s Life, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances attending his Death, may pitty him as an unhappy Gentleman, but will find it a hard matter to perswade himself that he was more than a meer Sceptick, or in good earnest in any thing but his fatal Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. His Father Sir <hi>Henry</hi>'s Discourse <hi>de Anima,</hi> where he begins, <hi>Spiritus in nobis non manet in Identitate: sed recens ingeritur per renovationem continuam, sicut Flamma, sed velociore tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situ, quia Res est spiritualior. Nos quotidie facti sumus ex iis quae transeunt in Nos: Morimur &amp; renascimur quotidie, neque lidem hodie &amp; heri sumus: Et Personam quam transeuntem non sentimus, tandem pertransisse agnoscimus,</hi> &amp;c. This, I say, which was thought a noble Present, for the most ingenious <hi>Strephon,</hi> so far as it has a relation to the Material or Sensitive Soul in Man and Brutes, or in general to the Animal Life, is for the most part true, and what Philosophers have in general agreed to: but as intended to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterise the Rational Soul of Man, it is by no means to be allowed. Whether the Master of its Composition retain'd the same Sentiments at his Death, concerning the Reasoning Principle within him, I have not inform'd my self: but it is easie enough to conceive the Thought more readily indulged, that the looser Scheme of Religion might serve turn; and that the Sensitive Appetite might not admit of any Restraint, by the fears of a <hi>Post Mortem aliquid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How the Learned <hi>S—m</hi> came in among this Gang, is somewhat strange: That he was acquainted with them, we are given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by a Letter of Mr. <hi>B—ts,</hi> in which was enclosed an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitome of Deism: I must confess I have been inform'd that excellent Physician was tainted with these Principles, but yet I could never understand but that he dy'd far from an irreconcileable Enemy, to Christianity, and firmly perswaded of a future Retribution.</p>
            <p>I shall not mention such of them as are now living, although they seem to pride themselves in having been the Parents of those Monstrous Births, which they have boldly set their Names to, and deliver'd to the giddy World for the Standards of Truth and Reason: it may please Almighty God to enlighten their Understandings, and to bring about so happy a Reformation, that they may be satisfy'd in the certainty of those Divine Truths, which will shine still with the greater Lustre, the more powerfully they are assaulted, and flourish under the Scandal and Contempt of their malicious Adversaries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51616:4"/>I must confess I had a great desire to see the Arguments of these Men, and when I had procur'd them, I look'd them over without any such anticipated Prejudice as could sway me to a Partiality <hi>Pro</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra:</hi> I rather premise this, as believing it no easie matter for any Man, who would be thought to have a Respect or Veneration, either for God or true Religion, to peruse such Treatises without so great an Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Detestation of the Authors, as will hinder him from giving either a due attention to what they write, or to consider throughly the proper weight of their Expressions. Now upon a mature and deliberate consideration of what I find they have deliver'd, I have ventur'd to pass this Censure, that the Authors have plainly discover'd themselves to be Men very far short of sound or right Reasoning, of very little Piety, and Men of no certain or steddy Principles. And this Sentence I have adventur'd to pass upon them, on these Accounts; that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in one place I find them highly pleading for a Natural Religion, ridiculing Revelation, and mustering up all the Arguments that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Friends the Libertines can furnish out, in another they change their Aspect, and submissively condescend that the Scriptures should have some little Authority: they speak modestly of the two Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staments, calling them <hi>Sacred Records,</hi> and ingeniously confess, that since Humane Reason is like a Pitcher with two Ears, which may be taken on either side: in our Travels to the other World, we should choose the Common Road as the safest; for tho' Deism may serve to manure our Consciences, yet certainly if sowed with Christianity, it will produce the most plentiful Crop.</p>
            <p>There is nothing, says the same Person (in another place where he had been just before using Arguments to the discredit of our Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) more unaccountable and contradictory, than to suppose a hum drum Deity, chewing his own Nature, a Droaning God sit hugging of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and hoarding up his Providence from his Creatures: This is an Atheism no less irrational, than to deny the very Essence of a Divine Being. It is the same also to believe the Soul to be Mortal, as to believe an Immortality without Rewards and Punishments.</p>
            <p>Thus it is very common with this sort of Men, to dogmatize even in the most important Points of Religion; strenuously affirming for Truth what their Reason dictates, and presently after, when they have said all they can, they are forced to grant that what they have said, is only such twilight Conjecture as Humane Reason (of which we yet so vainly boast) can furnish them withal, 'tis now an <hi>Aliquid Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> which does all things, and our Capacities being unable to discern the same, make us fasten either upon the Elementary Qualities of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:51616:4"/>
or <hi>Galen,</hi> or the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Rule of Geometrical Proportions: The Conclusion of all is this, that since we are not qualify'd to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the real Essence or intime Nature of things, we can know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing certainly; all our Philosophy, excepting Scepticism, is little more than Dotage. These are their own words, which I think may give us a very justifiable occasion to look upon these Men, very improper Standards for our Reason or Religion to be directed by, and as unfit O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles for us to consult. As for their Divinity, if a parcel of fine words will satisfie, we may think very devoutly of them: but indeed, I cannot for my own part perswade my self, when I consider the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of their common Discourse, and their Converse in the World, but that their Religion may be fairly resolv'd into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>I am inform'd one of their late Treatises, which contains the Heads of their Opinions, will be e're long taken to pieces, and judiciously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined: however difficult the Task may appear, I see nothing in them to discourage any ingenious Man in the Undertaking: for if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their Varnish, and set them in a clear Light, we shall find but little in them more than empty Sound and insignificant Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue: They have been either feignedly or really ignorant of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is clear from their gross mis-representation of some Passages, and their falsifying downright in others: They have rack't their Brains for their beloved Cause of Natural Religion, but have not offer'd (which they ought first of all to have done) one Syllable to disprove the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Christian Religion, or the Apostles the Dispensers of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.

            <p>When Men have as it were blinded their Intellects, poluted their Minds, vitiated and perverted their Cognoscent Faculties: when their Understanding is transform'd into a bruitish Appetite, and their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son throughly tinctur'd with some long contracted and habitual Vice, the only Remedy they have then left to palliate their Misery, is to cry out They cannot help it, to do better is out of the compass of their Knowledge: and therefore they can't believe that they ought; and if they can't believe, 'tis a sign, you know, that the Evidence was not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to convince them.</p>
            <p>But waving at this time any farther Reflection upon the Men of this Perswasion, it is convenient I promise somewhat that may justifie the freedom I have taken with the Writings of other Men, which I did not out of Expectation of being entituled to the honour of their Labours, but to spare my self the pains of putting into any other form those Arguments which were ready at hand, and which I found so very nearly corresponding with my own Thoughts. Neither can it be, as I conceive, the least Injury to an Author, that by the transferring of his Arguments a Proselyte is made, though in another manner than was intended by him. The greater part of those I am in this Nature oblig'd to, are such whose Names will be found sufficient to recommend them to the World. They are such who have had too much Honesty as well as Honour to impose, and too much Sense to be imposed on. In a word, They are Men whose Learning and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation secure them from being lightly esteem'd, even by their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, who have been unable to withstand the force of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and shun their Acquaintance upon no other Account than the Fears of a Conviction.</p>

               <p>THERE will be less need of an Apology for my troubling you with the following Lines, when you consider that in some of our late Conferences, you have occasionally dropt one Expression or other, which has tended to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince not only your distrust of the Soul's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, but also of the Existence of the Divine Being.</p>
               <p>I must confess I am less startled, to find a Man of your Capacity turn Sceptic, in an Age where Satyr supplys the place of solid Argument, Ridicule passes for Demonstration, and to be Wise is only to suspend the Judgment: But indeed the preceding Truths (if such they can be proved) are of so general and vast Importance, that we may very well admire that any Person should think himself unconcern'd in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagation, or to find (amongst reasonable Men) one so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely

               <p>I was never too forward in Disputes of this Nature, for tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 'tis but seldom that I have observ'd the most prevalent or cogent Arguments to take place; which I ascribe for the most part to prejudicial Prepossessions, to an over-fond Opinion of our own Abilities, to an entire dependance upon the Powers of our own Souls, and a Contempt of Divine Assistance. But at your Desire that I would enter upon this Subject, the last time we met, I have taken this Opportunity, wherein I shall endeavour to prove to you the necessity of rectifying your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken Judgment: and that the securing an after Happiness, or (in your own Phrase) the saving of your Soul, is a Task which will sufficiently recompence you, for all the trouble you may meet with in the Undertaking.</p>
               <p>I shall only mention the Conditions requisite to each of us, which I conceive to be more peculiarly the divesting our selves of Prejudice, so far as it is possible, and not to suffer the Bias of Education, by any means to interfere: by this we shall make way for that steddy and uniform Light of Impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to take place, which however misapply'd, mistaken or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I know not whether I might not properly begin with some short Account of the Nature of the Humane Mind, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of its Powers, <hi>viz.</hi> those of Thinking, Apprehending, Reflecting, Judging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which we should both gain this one considerable Point, That Reason, how excellently advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious soever it be to us, yet in its greatest Latitude, as it is applicable to the Mind of Man, surrounded with Corporeal Organs, is not a full commensurate Rule of Truth, at least not so adequate, as that we should exclude every Truth from being such on the account of its surmounting our Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; but to descend into this Enquiry will take up too much time, you may if you please concede this <hi>Postulate,</hi> if not, you will find your self however obliged to confess, that you do as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unto the verity of some things, which you are so far from conceiving or apprehending fully, that you have scarce any knowledge at all of them. To begin then,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:51616:6"/>Amongst the several sorts of Atheists, who have deny'd the necessity of admitting one first independent Being, or Cause of all Things, which we call GOD, and have endeavour'd to solve the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the Universe, without recourse to Him; they may all (if I mistake not) be reduced to those, who have first of all not scrupled to affirm an Eternity of Successions in the Generation of Mankind, as well <hi>à parte ante</hi> as <hi>à parte post,</hi> or in the same (as much incomprehensible) sence that the Universal Systeme with its constituent parts, Bodies ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and inanimate, has been from all Eternity as we find it now, and shall for ever so continue. Or, <hi>Secondly,</hi> To those who perceiving the Absurdities of such a multiply'd Eternity, have thought fit to acknowledge a Beginning of all Things; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ascribe this mighty Work of Creation to a Divine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergy, will have every portion of the Mundane Matter, under whatever form, shape or texture, nay even the Body of Man himself however curiously contriv'd, to be the result of nothing more, than an unguided shuffling of sensless Atoms, after number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less occursions and conflicts with each other, at length happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into that beautiful Order and Harmony of the World. There are others who ascribe our Origine to the Effect either of an Astral or Solar Influence upon Matter duly modify'd: but these are such gross Figments, that I shall take no notice of their repugnancy, or spend time in setting upon their Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>Which of these Hypotheses may best please you I know not, nor indeed when I consider, can I perswade my self, that you heartily espouse either; since I impute your Incredulity ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to an unbecoming Negligence or careless Supinity, than to any reasonable Objection you can make against the <hi>Mosaic</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Creation. I shall endeavour as briefly as I know how, to display some of those gross Absurdities and palpable Contradictions, which attend this Notion, that Mankind has thus eternally subsisted in infinite Generations already past; which being proved a downright falshood, you will perceive that they had their rise from one primitive Couple: from hence I will proceed in such other Methods, as may be most likely to lay open the Falsity of all other Opinions, unless that which grounds the World's <hi>Genesis,</hi> upon the Power of Almighty God.</p>
               <p>The Thoughts of a very great Philosopher, as well as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, upon this Argument run parallel with my own, and

                  <hi>Infinite Generations of Men (you say) are already past and gone. But whatsoever is now past was once actually present. So that each of these infinite Generations was once in its turn actually present; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all except one Generation were once future, and not in Being, which destroys the very Supposition: for either that one Generation must it s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Again, Infinite past Generations of Men have been once actually present, therefore there may be some one Man of them given, that was at infinite distance from us now; therefore that Man's Son likewise (suppose forty years younger than his Father) was either at infinite distance from us, or at finite: if that Son too was at infinite distance from us, then one Infinite is longer by forty years than another, which is absurd, if at finite, then forty years added to finite makes it infinite, which is absurd as the other.</hi>

                  <hi>The number of Men that are already dead and gone is infinite, as you say, but the number of the several parts of the Bodies of those Men, must necessarily be much greater than the number of the Men themselves; and at this rate we shall have one infinite number twice, ten times, and thousands of times as great as another: which is a notorious Contradiction. And thus we see that 'tis impossible in it self, that any successive Duration should be actually and positively infinite, or have infinite Successions already gone and past.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Sixth Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note>
                  <hi>But farther, That the present or a like frame of the World hath not subsisted from everlasting: We will readily concede that a Thing may be truly Eternal, tho' its duration be terminated at one end: for so we affirm human Souls to be immortal, tho' there was a time when they were nothing: and therefore their infinite duration will always be bounded at one extreme by that first beginning of Existence: So that for ought appears as yet, you may say the Revolutions of the Earth, and other Planets about the Sun, tho' they be limited at one end by the present Revolution, may nevertheless have been infinite and eternal, without any beginning; but then we must consider, that this duration of human Souls is only potentially infinite, for their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity consists only in an endless capacity of Continuance without ever ceasing to be, in a boundless Futurity that can never be exhausted; or all of it be past and present: but their duration can never be positively or actually Eternal, because it is most manifest that no Moment can
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51616:7"/>
ever be assigned, wherein it shall be true that such a Soul hath then actually sustained an infinite duration: for that supposed infinite dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will by the very Supposition be limited at two Extremes, tho' ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so remote asunder, and consequently must needs be finite. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the true Nature and Notion of a Soul's eternity is this, That the future Moments of its Duration can never be all past and present, but still there will be a futurity and potentiality of More for ever and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. So that we evidently perceive from this Instance of a Soul, that whatever successive duration shall be bounded at one end, and be all past and present, must come infinitely short of Infinity; which neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily evinceth that this or a like World can never have been Eternal, or that there cannot have been infinite past Revolutions of a Planet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Sun: for this supposed Infinity is terminated at one Extreme, by the present Revolution, and all the other Revolutions are confessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly past, so that the whole Duration is bounded at one end, and all past and present, and therefore cannot have been infinite. This will also shew us the vast difference betwixt the false successive Eternity backwards, and the real one to come: for consider the present Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Earth, as the Bound and Confine of them both, God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, if he so pleaseth, may continue this Motion to perpetuity, in infinite Revolutions to come, because Futurity is inexhaustible, and can never be all spent, and run out by past and present Moments: but then if we look backwards from this present Revolution, we do apprehend the impossibility of infinite Revolutions on that side, because all are already past, and so were once actually present; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are finite by the Argument before. For surely we cannot conceive a pretariteness (if I may so speak) still backwards</hi> in infinitum, <hi>that never was present, as we can an endless Futurity that never will be present: so that tho' one is potentially infinite, yet nevertheless the other is positively finite. And tho' this reasoning doth necessarily conclude against the past infinite duration of all successive Motion and mutable Beings, yet doth it not affect the Eternal Existence of the Adorable Divinity, in whose invariable Nature there is no past nor future, who is Omnipresent not only as to space, but as to duration: and with respect to such Omnipresence it is certain and manifest, that Succession and Motion are more Impossibilities, and repugnant in the very terms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus doth the Atheists Hypothesis, touching the Eternity of the World, absolutely destroy and confute it self. For let us suppose some infinite Revolution of the Earth about the Sun, to be already gone and expired, I take it to be self-evident, that if none of those past Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions have been infinite Ages ago, all the Revolutions put together
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51616:8"/>
cannot make up the Duration of infinite Ages; it follows therefore from this Supposition, that there may be some One assignable Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among them, that is at an infinite distance from the present; but it is self-evident likewise, that no one past Revolution can be infinitely distant from the present; for then an infinite or unbounded duration, may be bounded at two Extremes, by two annual Revolutions, which is absurd, and a Contradiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And again, upon the same Supposition of an Eternal past Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World, and of infinite annual Revolutions of the Earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Sun; I would ask concerning the Monthly Revolutions of the Moon about the Earth, or the Diurnal ones of the Earth upon its Axis, both which by the very Hypothesis are coaeval with the former, Whether these also have been finite or infinite? Not finite to be sure, because th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n a finite number would be greater then an infinite, as</hi> 12 <hi>or</hi> 365 <hi>are greater than a Unite. Nor infinite neither, for then two or three Infinites would exceed one another, as a year exceeds a Month, or both exceed a Day: So that both ways the Supposition is repugnant and impossible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These Difficulties, as I have already intimated, cannot be reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably apply'd to the Eternal Duration of the Supreme Power; for tho' we cannot comprehend Eternity and Infinity, yet we understand what They are not, and something we are sure must have existed from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, because all things could not emerge from nothing: So that if this Prae-existent Eternity is not compatible with a successive Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as we clearly and distinctly perceive that it is not, then some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (tho' infinitely above our finite Comprehensions) must have had an Identical, invariable continuance from all Eternity: which Being is what we call God; for as his Nature is perfect and immutable, without the least shadow of Change, so his Eternal Duration is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent and invisible, not measurable by Time and Motion, nor to be computed by number of successive Moments.</hi>

to evince the falshood of infinite Generations already expir'd: for tho' the Atheist should contend that there were Ten thousand million Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Mankind now in being (that we may allow him multitude e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) 'tis but going back so many Ages, and we descend to one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Original Pair: and 'tis all one in respect of Eternal Duration yet behind, whether we begin the World so many millions of Ages ago, or date it from the late</hi> Aera <hi>of about Six thousand years: which recent Beginning is, I think, sufficiently establisht, from the known Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Empires and Kingdoms, and from the late Invention of Arts and Sciences: whereas, if infinite Ages of Mankind had already preceded, there could nothing have been left to be invented or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the successful Industry and Curiosity of our own. The Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood, and the Weight and Spring of the Air (which is as it were the Vital Pulse, and the great Circulation of Nature, and of more importance in all Physiology than any one Invention since the beginning of Science) had never lain hidden so many Myriads of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, and been reserv'd for a late happy discovery by two great Luminaries of this Island.</hi>

               <p>The Atomical Hypothesis of a fortuitous Jumble, without any Intelligent Being to direct the Portions of the Mundane Matter, into their several Forms, is a Fancy no less extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant; a Whimsy so unaccountable, that (in the words of a great Man) there is nothing more wonderful to imagine, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less this, <hi>That it should ever enter into the heart of Man.</hi> The better to confute this, together with those other Opinions of the Astral and Solar Influence, I have here borrowed a Scheme of fair and reasonable Argumentation, from the Judicious Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> such an one I hope as will extort a Confession from you, that there must unavoidably be admitted a first Cause of all things, and that the same can be no other than a most Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent as well as Powerful Being.</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>I think it is beyond question, that Man has a clear Perception of his own Being; he knows certainly that he Exists, and that he is something: He that can doubt whether he be any thing, or no, I speak no more to, than I would argue with pure Nothing, or endeavour to convince Non-Entity that it were something. If any one pretend to be so sceptical, as to deny his own Existence (for really to doubt of it is manifestly impossible) let him (for me) enjoy his beloved Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of being Nothing, until Hunger or some other Pain, convince him of the contrary. This I think I may take for a Truth, of which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ones certain Knowledge assures him, beyond the liberty of doubting,</hi> viz. <hi>That he is something that actually Exists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In the next place, Man knows by an Intuitive knowledge the Certainty that bare Nothing can no more produce any real Being, than it can be equal to two right Angles. If a Man knows not that Non-Entity, or the Absence of all Being, cannot be equal to two right Angles, it is impossible that he should know any Demonstration in</hi> Euclid. <hi>If therefore we know there is some real Being, and that Non-Entity cannot produce any real Being, it is an evident Demonstration that from Eternity there has been something; since what was from Eternity had a Beginning, and what had a Beginning must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from something else.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Next, It is evident that what had its Being and Beginning from another, must also have all that which is in, and belongs to its Being to another too: all the Power it has must be owing to, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the same Source. This Eternal Source then of all Being,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51616:9"/>
Being must also be the Source and Original of all Power, and so this Eternal Being must be also the most powerful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Again, A Man finds in himself Perception and Knowledge, we have then got one step farther, and we are certain now that there is not only some Being, but some knowing Intelligent Being in the World. There was a time then when there was no knowing Being, and when Knowledge began to be, or else there has been also a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Being from Eternity. If it be said there was a time when no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had any Knowledge, when that Eternal Being was void of all Understanding; I reply, That then it was impossible there should ever have been any Knowledge; it being as impossible that things wholly void of Knowledge, and operating blindly without any Perception, should produce a knowing Being, as it is impossible that a Triangle should make it self three Angles bigger than two right ones: for it is as repugnant to the Idea of sensless Matter, that it should put into it self Sense, Perception and Knowledge, as it is repugnant to the Idea of a Triangle, that it should put into it self greater Angles than two right ones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Thus from the Consideration of our Selves, and what we infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly find in our own Constitutions, our Reason leads us to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this certain and evident Truth, That there is an eternal, most powerful, and most knowing Being, which whether any one will please to call God, it matters not, the thing is evident, and from this Idea duly considered, will easily be deduced all those other Attributes we ought to ascribe to this Eternal Being. If nevertheless any one should be found so senslesly arrogant, as to suppose Man alone knowing and wise, but yet the Product of meer Ignorance and Chance, and that all the rest of the Universe is acted only by that blind Hap-hazard, I shall leave with him that very rational and emphatical Rebuke of</hi> Tully, Lib. 2. de Leg. <hi>to be consider'd leisurely:</hi> Quid est enim verius, quam neminem esse oportere tam stulte arrogantem, ut in se Mentem &amp; Rationem putet inesse, in Coelo Mundó<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que non putet? aut ea quae vix summâ Ingenij ratione com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendat, nulla ratione moveri putet? <hi>Or that of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> Egregie mentiuntur qui dicunt non esse Deum, etiamsi enim interdiu negant Noctu tamen &amp; sibi dubitant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From what has been said, it is plain to me, we have a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge of the Existence of a God, than of any thing our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses have not immediately discovered to us: Nay, I presume I may say that we more certainly know that there is a God, than that there is any thing else without us. When I say we know, I mean that there
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51616:10"/>
is such a Knowledge within our reach, which we cannot miss, if we will but apply our Minds to that, as we do to several other Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>How far the Idea of a most perfect Being, which a Man may frame in his Mind, does or does not prove the Existence of a God, I will not here examine; for in the different make of Mens Tempers and application of their Thoughts, some Arguments prevail more on one, and some on another, for the confirmation of the same Truth. But yet I think this I may say, that it is an ill way of establishing this Truth, and silencing Atheists, to lay the whole stress of so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a Point as this, upon that sole foundation, and take some Mens having that Idea of God in their Minds (for 'tis evident some Men have none, and some worse than none, and the most very indifferent) for the only proof of a Deity, and out of an over-fondness of that darling Invention, cashier, or at least endeavour to invalidate all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arguments, and forbid us to hearken to those proofs, as being weak or fallacious, which our own Existence, and the sensible parts of the Universe offer so clearly and cogently to our Thoughts, that I deem it impossible for a considering Man to withstand them: for I judge it as certain and clear a Truth as can any where be delivered, that the invisible things of God are clearly seen from the Creation of the World, being understood by the things that are made even his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Power and Godhead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tho' our own Being furnishes us, as I have shewn, with an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and incontestible Proof of a Deity, and I believe no Body can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Cogency of it, who will but as carefully attend to it, as to any other Demonstration of so many parts; yet this being so funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental a Truth, and of that consequence, that all Religion and genuine Morality depend thereon, I doubt not but I shall be forgiven, if I go over some parts of this Argument again, and inlarge a little more thereon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>There is no Truth more evident than that something must be from Eternity: I never yet heard of any one so unreasonable that could suppose so manifest a Contradiction, as a time wherein there was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly nothing, this Being of all Absurdities the greatest to imagine that pure Nothing, the perfect Negation and Absence of all Being, should ever produce any real Existence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It being then unavoidable for all rational Creatures to conclude that something has existed from Eternity, let us next see what kind of thing that must be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>There are but two sorts of Beings in the World, that Man knows
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51616:10"/>
or conceives; First, Such as are purely material, without Sense, Perception, or Thought. Secondly, Sensible thinking and perceiving Beings, which, if you please, we will hereafter call cogitative and incogitative Beings, being more to our present purpose, and perhaps better terms than Material and Immaterial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>If then there must be something Eternal, let us see what sort of Being it must be: And to that it is very obvious to Reason, that it must necessarily be a cogitative Being; for it is as impossible to conceive that ever bare incogitative Matter should produce a thinking Intelligent Being, as that nothing should of it self produce Matter. Let us suppose any Parcel of Matter Eternal, great or small, we shall find it in it self able to produce nothing: for example; Let us sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Matter of the next Pebble we meet with Eternal, closely uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the parts firmly at rest together: If there were no other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the World, must it not eternally remain so, a dead unactive Lump; is it possible to conceive it can add motion to it self, being purely Matter, or produce any thing? Matter then, by its own strength, cannot produce in it self so much as Motion, the Motion it has must also be from Eternity, or else be produced and added to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by some other Being more powerful than Matter. Matter, as is evident, having not power to produce Motion in it self. But let us suppose Motion eternal too, yet Matter, incogitative Matter and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whatever Changes it might produce of figure and bulk, could never produce Thought. Knowledge will still be as far beyond the power of Motion and Matter to produce, as matter is beyond the power of nothing to produce: And I appeal to every ones one Thoughts, whether he cannot as easily conceive Matter produced by nothing, as Thought to be produced by pure Matter, when before there was no such thing as Thought or an Intelligent Being existing. Divide Matter into as minute parts as you will (which we are apt to imagine a sort of spiritualising or making a thinking thing of it) vary the figure and motion of it as much as you please, a Globe, Cube, Cone, Prism, Cylinder, and you may as rationally expect to produce Sense, Thought and Knowledge, by putting together in a certain figure and motion the grossest portions of Matter, as by those that are the very smallest that any where exist. They knock, impel and resist one another, just as the greater do, and that is all they can do: so that if we will suppose nothing first or eternal, Matter can never begin to be: if we suppose bare Matter without Motion eternal, Motion can never begin to be: if we suppose only Matter and Motion first or eternal, Thought can never begin to be; for it is impossible to conceive that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51616:11"/>
Matter, either with or without motion, could have originally in and from it self, Sense, Perception and Knowledge, as is evident from hence that then Sense, Perception and Knowledge, must be a property eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally inseparable from Matter, and every particle of it. Not to add, that tho' our general or specifick conception of Matter, makes us speak of it as one thing, yet really all Matter is not one individual thing, neither is there any such thing existing as one material Being, or one single Body that we know, or can conceive; and therefore if matter were the Eternal first cogitative Being, there would not be one Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal infinite cogitative Being, but an infinite number of Eternal finite cogitative Beings, independent one with another, of limited Force and distinct Thoughts, which could never produce that Order, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Beauty, which is to be found in Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Since therefore whatsoever is the first Eternal Being, must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be cogitative; and whatsoever is first of all things must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily contain in it, and actually have at least all the Perfections that can ever after exist, nor can it ever give to another any Perfection that it hath not, either actually in it self, or at least in a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, it necessarily follows that the first Eternal Being cannot be Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>If therefore it be evident that something necessarily must exist from Eternity, 'tis also as evident that that something must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be a cogitative Being: for 'tis as impossible that incogitative Matter should produce a cogitative Being, as that Nothing, or the Negation of all Being should produce a positive Being or Matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Tho' this Discourse of the necessary Existence of an Eternal Mind, does sufficiently lead us to the knowledge of a God since it will hence follow, that all other knowing Beings that have a beginning, must depend on Him, and have no other ways of Knowledge, or extent of Power, than what He gives them; and therefore if He made those, He made also the less excellent Pieces of this Universe, all inanimate Beings, whereby his Omniscience, Power, and Providence will be establisht, and all his other Attributes necessarily follow; yet to clear up this a little further, we will see what Doubts can be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>First, Perhaps it will be said, that tho' it be as clear as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration can make it, that there must be an Eternal Being, and that Being must also be knowing, yet it does not follow but that thinking Being may also be material. Let it be so; it still equally follows that there is a God: for if there be an Eternal, Omniscient, Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Being, it is certain that there is a God, whether you imagine
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51616:11"/>
that Being to be material or no. But herein I suppose lyes the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and deceit of that Supposition: There being no way to avoid the Demonstration that there is an Eternal knowing Being, Men devoted to Matter would willingly have it granted, that this knowing Being is material, and then letting slide out of their Minds, or their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, the Demonstration whereby an Eternal knowing Being was proved necessarily to exist, would argue all to be Matter, and so deny a God that is an Eternal cogitative Being, whereby they are so far from establishing, that they destroy their own Hypothesis: for if there can be, in their opinion, Eternal Matter without any Eternal cogitative Being, they manifestly separate Matter and Thinking, and so suppose no necessary connexion of one with the other; and from hence establish the necessity of an Eternal Spirit, but not of Matter, since it has been proved already, that an Eternal cogitative being is unavoidably to be granted. Now if thinking and Matter may be separated, the Eternal Existence of Matter will not follow from the Eternal Existence of a cogitative Being, and they suppose it to no purpose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>But now let us see how they can satisfie themselves, or others, that this Eternal thinking Being is material. First, I would ask them, whether they imagine that all Matter, every Particle of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thinks? This I suppose they will scarce say; since then there would be as many Eternal thinking Beings, as there are Particles of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and so an infinity of Gods: And yet if they will not allow Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as Matter, that is, every Particle of Matter, to be as well cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative as extended, they will have as hard a task to make out to their own Reasons a cogitative Being, out of incogitative Particles, as an extended Being out of unextended parts, if I may so speak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>Secondly, If all Matter do not think, I next ask, Whether it be only one Atom that does so? This has as many Absurdities as the other; for then this Atom of Matter must be alone Eternal, or not: if this alone be Eternal, then this alone by its powerful Thought or Will, made all the rest of Matter; and so we have the Creation of Matter by a powerful Thought, which is that the Materialists stick at: for if they suppose one single thinking Atom to have produced all the rest of Matter, they cannot ascribe that prae-eminency to it upon any other account than that of its Thinking, the only supposed Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: But allow it to be by some other way which is above our conception, it must be still Creation, and these Men must give up their great Maxim,</hi> Ex nihilo nil fit. <hi>If it be said that all the rest of Matter is equally Eternal as that thinking Atom, it will be to say any thing at pleasure, though never so absurd: for to suppose all Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51616:12"/>
Eternal, and yet one small Particle in Knowledge and Power infinitely above the rest, is without any the least appearance of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to frame any Hypothesis: every Particle of Matter, as Matter, is capable of all the same Figures and Motions of any other; and I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any one in his Thoughts to add any thing else to one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>Thirdly, If then neither one peculiar Atom alone, can be this Eternal thinking Being, nor all Matter, as Matter,</hi> i. e. <hi>every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Matter can be it, it only remains that it is some certain Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem of Matter duly put together, that is this thinking Eternal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: This is that which I imagine is that Notion which Men are aptest to have of God, who would have Him a Material Being, as most readily suggested to them by the ordinary Conceipt they have of themselves, and of other Men, whom they take to be Material think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beings. But this Imagination however more natural, is no less absurd than the other; for to suppose the Eternal thinking Being to be nothing else but a Composition of the Particles of Matter, each whereof is incogitative, is to ascribe all the Wisdom and Knowledge of that Eternal Being, only to the Juxtaposition of parts, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more absurd: for unthinking Particles of Matter, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever put together, can have nothing thereby added to them but a new relation of Position, which 'tis impossible should give Thought and Knowledge to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>But farther; This Corporeal System either has all its parts at rest, or it is a certain motion of the parts, wherein its thinking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists; if it be perfectly at rest, it is but one Lump, and so can have no Priviledges above one Atom. If it be the Motion of its parts on which its thinking depends, all the Thoughts there must be unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably accidental and limited, since all the Particles that by Motion cause Thought, being each of them in it self without any Thought, cannot regulate its own Motions, much less be regulated by the Thought of the whole, since that Thought is not the Cause of Motion (for then it must be antecedent to it, and so without it) but the Consequence of it, whereby Freedom, Power, Choice, and all rational and wise Thinking and Acting will be taken away. So that such a Thinking Being will be no better nor wiser than pure blind Matter, since to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve all into the accidental unguided Motions of blind Matter, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Thought depending on the unguided Motions of blind Matter, is the same thing: not to mention the narrowness of such Thoughts and Knowledge, that must depend on the Motions of such parts: but there needs no more enumeration of any more Absurdities and Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51616:12"/>
in this Hypothesis (however full of them it be) than that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned; since, let this thinking Systeme be all or a part of the Matter of the Universe, it is impossible that any one Particle should either know its own, or the Motion of any other Particle, or the whole know the Motion of every Particular, and so regulate its own Thoughts or Motions, or indeed have any Thought resulting from such Motion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>Others would have Matter to be Eternal, notwithstanding they all owe an Eternal Cogitative immaterial Being. This, tho' it take not away the Being of a God, yet since it denies one and the first great Piece of his Workmanship, the Creation, let us consider it a little. Matter must be allowed Eternal: Why? Because you can't perceive how it can be made out of Nothing: Why do you not also think your self Eternal? You will answer perhaps, Because about twenty or forty years since you began to be. But if I ask you what that You is, which began then to be, you can scarcely tell me: The Matter whereof you are made began not then to be; for if it did, then it is not Eternal: but it began to be put together into such a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion or frame as makes up your Body; but yet that frame of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles is not you, it makes not that thinking thing you are (for I have now to do with One who allows an Eternal immaterial thinking Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but would have unthinking Matter eternal too) therefore when did that thinking Thing begin to be? If it did never begin to be, then you have always been a thinking Thing from Eternity; the absurdity whereof I need not confute, till I meet with one so void of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing as to own it. If therefore you can allow a thinking Thing to be made out of Nothing (as all Things that are not Eternal must be) why also can you not allow it possible for a Material Being to be made out of Nothing by an equal Power, but that you have the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the one in view, and not of the other: tho' when well consider'd, Creation of a Spirit will be found to require no less power than the Creation of Matter; nay, possibly if we would emancipate our selves from vulgar Notions, and raise our Thoughts as far as they would reach to a closer Contemplation of Things, we might be able to aim at some dim and seeming Conception how Matter might at first be made and begin to exist, by the power of that Eternal first Being: but to give Beginning and Being to a Spirit, would be found a more inconceivable Effect of Omnipotent Power. But this Being what would perhaps lead us too far from the Notions on which the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy now in the World is built, it would not be pardonable to deviate so far as Grammar it self would authorize, if the common settled O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51616:13"/>
opposes it; especially in this place, where the received Doctrine serves well enough to our present purpose, and leaves this past doubt, That the Creation or Beginning of any one Substance out of Nothing, being once admitted, the Creation of all other but the Creator him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, may with the same ease be supposed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>But you will say, I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it not impossible to admit of the making any Thing out of Nothing, since we cannot possibly conceive it? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer no:</hi> 1. <hi>Because it is not reasonable to deny the Power of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Being, upon the account that we cannot comprehend its Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: We do not deny other Effects upon this Ground, because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly conceive the manner of their production. We cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how Thought (or any thing but Motion in Body) can move a Body, and yet that is not a Reason sufficient to make us deny it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible against the constant Experience we have of it in our selves, in all voluntary Motions which are produced in us only by the free Thoughts of our own Minds, and are not, nor can be the Effects of the impulse or determination of the Motion of blind Matter in or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Bodies, for then it could not be in our power or choice to alter it. For example, My right hand writes, whilst my left hand is still, what causes Rest in one, and Motion in the other? nothing but my Will, a Thought of my Mind: my Thought only changing, the right hand rests, and the left hand moves; this is matter of fact which cannot be deny'd: Explain this, and make it intelligible, and then the next step will be to understand Creation. For the giving a new determination to the Motion of the Animal Spirits (which some make use of to explain voluntary Motion) clears not the difficulty one jot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>: to alter the determination of Motion, being in this Case no easier nor less than to give Motion it self; since the new determination given to the Animal Spirits, must be either immediately by Thought, or by some other Body put in their way by Thought, which was not in their way before, and so must own its Motion to Thought, either of which leaves voluntary Motion as unintelligible as it was before. In the mean time it is an over-valuing our selves, to reduce all to the narrow mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of our Capacities, and to conclude all things impossible to be done whose manner of doing exceeds our Comprehension: this is to make our Comprehension infinite, or God finite, when what He can do is limited to what we conceive of it. If you do not understand the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of your own finite Mind, that thinking Thing within you, do not deem it strange that you cannot comprehend the operations of that Eternal infinite Mind who made and governs all things, and whom the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain.</hi>

                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:51616:13"/>I hope (my Friend) you will more readily excuse the foregoing Prolixity, on the account that first Principles (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those of so great moment as these before us) ought to be as clearly and satisfactorily prov'd as it is possible: which if upon your most serious Reflection you find establisht beyond opposition, I expect that from this moment you date the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal of your Atheism, and that you presently commence Deist in order to turn Christian.</p>
               <p>I know of no better way of arguing with the meer natural Man, or with such who value themselves so highly upon the strength of their own Judgment or Humane Reason, than to endeavour their Conviction by the most rational Deductions from as rational Propositions: whether or no these are such which I have transferr'd hither from the Writings of these two famous Men, I must leave you to consider. I confess there is little hopes of reclaiming such fool-hardy Libertines, who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue for their Infidelity by the same powers in their Souls, which, to the more considerate, are convincing proofs, That the Soul, which is invested with such mighty Power, must undoubtedly be a Substance independant of Corporiety, and consequently incapable of suffering an extinction with the Lamp of Life; but of the Nature of the Rational Soul of Man, and its different Existence from the Soul of Brutes, I shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course elsewhere, having here confin'd my self more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enquire after the Author of our own Being, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which surround us.</p>

               <p>Whosoever will take the trouble to inform himself, after what manner most People account for the Productions they see daily brought to pass, may easily understand that where one Man speaks either reasonably or becomingly of the great Author of the Universe, and acknowledges any such Being as superintends the agency of second Causes; there are abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more who look no farther than the empty Sounds of Fate, Fortune, Chance, Destiny, and in their Enquiries into the Structure of Humane Bodies, or the Discords of the Animal Oeconomy, you rarely find any thing more particularly taken notice of than the <hi>Archaeus,</hi> by some, by others the Plastick Power, and indeed by all most commonly a certain Nature, which tho' continually in their Expressions, they know not what to make of.</p>
               <p>Excuse me (Sir) if I think it worth my while to examine which of these can supply the place of an Almighty, or of any real efficient Cause; or with what reason we can ascribe unto either of these nominal Agents, the Operations imputed to them.</p>

                  <hi>Fate or Destiny</hi> (saith <hi>SENECA</hi>) <hi>is an immutable and invincible Law, imposed upon Things and Actions. You will say perhaps that this thing shall happen, or not happen: if it must come to pass, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' you vow and make your request, yet shall it take effect: If it shall not come to pass, vow and pray as much as you list, yet it shall not fall out. Now the Consequence,</hi> saith he, <hi>of this Argument is false, because you have forgot the Exception that I have put between them both; that is to say, This shall happen provided a Man makes Vows and Prayers, it must necessarily happen, that to vow, or not to vow, are comprehended in, and are parts of the same Destiny. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, It is destinated, or it is such a Man's fate to be an eloquent Man; but under this Condition, it is likewise destinated that he be instructed in good Letters. It is destinated for another Man to he rich, but here 'tis included in the same Destiny, that be make use of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51616:14"/>
the means for their procurement. So likewise may it be said it was such a Man's destiny to be hang'd; but here that he render himself guilty of some capital Offence, for which he is convicted by the Law, is part of the same Destiny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the sence wherein these words are used by this Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, I see no mighty prejudice; there is indeed this mistake very oft attending, That whereas by Fate or Destiny are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the unalterable Laws of God, which are founded upon his Prescience, Men are apt to overlook the Lawgiver himself, and to represent this Law by him establisht, as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain powerful Agent or irresistible Deity, which they say does blindly and accountably govern the World.</p>
               <p>Give me leave to take notice, That I look upon this Fate and Destiny of the Heathens (in its vulgarly received Phrase) very nearly to correspond with the Predestination of some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Christians; they do both of them partake of the same tyrannical, despotic power; and both tend to the same end, <hi>viz.</hi> the robbing Man of his Freedom, and exposing him, Brute-like, to act by an irresistible Impulse.</p>
               <p>The Eternal Decrees of the Divine Being, which are made as it were conditional, and founded on a fore-knowledge of the Good and Evil that Man shall act, carry nothing along with them contradictory to his Truth and Justice: but the Absolute Predestination which is suppos'd exclusive of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>The true Notion of Fortune</hi> (in the words of a Learned Man) <hi>denoteth nothing more than the ignorance of an Event in some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Agent, concern'd about it; so that it owes its very Being to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Understanding, and without relation to that would be a</hi> Non Ens, <hi>or really Nothing. 'Twas Man that first made Fortune, and not Fortune Man; so likewise the adequate meaning of Chance (as it is discinguisht from Fortune, in that the latter is understood to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal only Rational Agents, but Chance to be amongst inanimate Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) is really a bare Negation that signifies no more than this, That any Effect amongst such Bodies ascribed to Chance, is verily produced by Physical Agents, according to the establisht Laws of Motion, but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51616:15"/>
without their consciousness of concurring to the Production, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Intention of such an Effect. So that in this genuine accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chance, here is nothing supposed that can supersede the known Laws of natural Motion; and thus to attribute the formation of Mankind to Chance, is equally as absurd as to ascribe the same to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Mechanism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having given you these few hints, touching the unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of our ascribing any Effect to that which is in truth no more than a Chimaera or Fiction of the Brain, and our looking on them as Agents, which are meer Non-Entities, I shall take notice of those other Expressions which are so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently made use of, not only by the Ignorant, but even by Physicians themselves and other Learned Men, such I mean as the Archaeus, the Plastic Power, the formative Faculty, and that petty kind of Deity called Nature. For the better comprehending the significancy of these several Terms, let us put our selves upon reflecting, and a very little attention will discover the fallacy. Suppose then, for instance, that any Man should tell me that such or such a Thing will exhilirate the Archaeus, or enliven decay'd Nature; that such a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster owes its rise to a Defect or Error committed by the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stic Power, or formative Faculty; is it not very reasonable that we desire to know what either of these are, whether or no they are real Agents, or intellectual Beings, imploying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the care of our Conservation; or in a word, what they do truly import in their genuine and proper meaning. If we make, I say, this Enquity, we may satisfie our selves, that every one of these words, with many of the like signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, particularly such as go by the name of Faculties and Qualities, were first of all taken up, either as an Umbrage for Mens Ignorance of real Causes, or invented in order to a more compendious way of speaking, whereby the several Means made use of towards a particular Production, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised under some single Appellation.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Boyle</hi>'s En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> And thus it happens (as Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> speaks) that a fit and actuating Power of the Teeth, Tongue, Spittle, Fibres and Membranes of the Gullet and Stomach, together with the Natural Heat, the Ferment and <hi>Menstruum,</hi> and some other Agents, which co-operate to the Transmutation of our Aliment into Chile, are all included in that frequent Expression of Concoctive Faculty; a word as commonly made use of by those who know not what they mean when they speak it, as by those that do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:51616:15"/>But amongst all the pretended Causes of those Effects we see daily produc'd, there is none more frequently made use of than the word <hi>Nature,</hi> upon which consideration the most Judicious <hi>Boyle,</hi> foreseeing the abuse of that unhappy word, was (as he expresses himself) so paradoxical, as to make a very serious doubt, whether this same Nature so much discourst of, was a Thing or a Name; or whether it was any real existent Being, or a Being purely notional. For when any Man tells me, saith he, that Nature does this or that; that 'tis natural for one thing to do this, and another that; he does in no wise help me to understand, or to explicate the manner of these Productions: for 'tis manifest enough, that whatsoever is done in this World (where the Rational Soul intervenes not) is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally effected by corporeal Agents, acting in a World so fram'd as ours is, according to the Laws of Motion, settled by its om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscient Author.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, that many acknowledge this Nature to be a Thing established by the Almighty, and subordinate to Him: but tho' many confess it when they are askt, whether they do or not: yet besides that they seldom or never lift up their Eyes to any higher Cause; he that takes notice of their way of ascribing Things to Nature, may easily discern, that whatever their words sometimes be, the Agency of the God of Nature, is very little taken notice of in their Thoughts.</p>
               <p>Indeed, if I thought my Opinion might sway with you so far, as to put you upon reflecting in good earnest, I should give you to understand that 'tis my real belief, That the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper use of this very word has been vastly injurious to the Glory of our Maker, and (in the words of the foresaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) I doubt not but the looking upon meerly Corporeal, and oftentimes Inanimate Things, as if they were endow'd with Life, Sence and Understanding, and the ascribing to Nature, and some other Beings, whether Real or Imaginary, Things that belong only to God, have been some, if not the chief of the grand Causes of Atheism amongst Nominal Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and of Polytheism and Idolatry amongst the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</p>
               <p>The wretched Subterfuges of Atheism, being thus mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly discover'd insufficient Causes of any manner of Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the greatest part of them being purely Imaginary, and (like aery Phantoms) disappearing at the Light of Truth, I
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51616:16"/>
hope that you'l endeavour to remove that Veil of Ignorance which has so long darken'd your Understanding, and that you will find your self necessitated to acknowledge the Eternal Cause, in whom you Live, Move, and have your Being.</p>
               <p>If at length you are perswaded of this Supreme Intelligence, and satisfy'd that the Universal Systems is a Product of his Power, that the several Species of Animals, under whatsoever <hi>Genus,</hi> must necessarily take their Rise from some Prolific Seeds or Seminal Principles created by the same Power (spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Productions, and the whole Business of aequivocal Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being detected a plain Fallacy) if this, I say, appears ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest (as I see not how any thing can be more evident) altho' the <hi>Mosaic</hi> History of <hi>Genesis</hi> is seemingly unintelligible and contradictory to many later Observations and Experiments, I shall expect that you heartily subscribe the prime Article of our Creed, <hi>viz</hi> the Belief of God.</p>
               <p>As there is no Man indispensably ty'd to the Letter of the <hi>Mosaic</hi> History, so its being to our Conjectures unphilosophitick, or its not exactly quadrating with the latter Discoveries of our <hi>Vertuoso</hi>'s, neither is, nor ought to be reputed either as an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in the Historian, or a Flaw in the History, by those who consider the Condition of the Infant World, and the Genius of the People to whose Capacities this Narration was more especially adapted. To instance in one Particular; Tho' we are to suppose that <hi>Joshua</hi> was too great a Philosopher to be unacquainted with the <hi>Copernican</hi> Hypothesis of the Earths Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet considering the Apprehension of his Auditory, if in the Hearing of the Multitude, he had commanded the Earth, as he did the Sun to stand still, he would not unlikely have been deemed a Man distracted by such who would have thought it a very extravagant Absurdity, to bid the Earth, which they conceived a dead, unactive Lump, to stand still, or to command rest to that which they imagin'd was incapable of Motion.</p>
               <p>Be this however as it will, 'tis not a Fundamental of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Faith; besides, we have no such certainty as to exclude all doubting, that the Sun is a fixt Planet, or that the Earth turns round upon an Axis.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Mosaic</hi> History, you find, has employ'd the Wits, and perplexed the Understandings of many Learned Men, who, tho' they have taken upon them to find faults in this Account,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51616:16"/>
yet in their Endeavours to erect a new Theory, or to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the old to their own Reason, they have generally come short of the satisfaction they had at first proposed to themselves.</p>
               <p>Disquisitions of this Nature are for the most part fruitless; and indeed it is but just that we meet with Disappointments in such Enquiries, where we limit the Power of the Divine Being to our finite Apprehensions; and seemingly infer that even Omnipotence it self cannot act any thing unfathomable by our weak Capacities.</p>
               <p>Let it suffice that we enjoy a plenary Knowledge that the World was created by the Power of God, without enquiring for the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or <hi>quo pacto:</hi> and if the Revealed History of <hi>Genesis</hi> is not full enough to surprise us into admiration of its mighty Author, let us survey but any Portion of the curious Fabrick, and we may find as it were stamp'd thereon, such indelible Characters of his Power and Wisdom, as must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly astonish us, and these discoverable by the common mode of Humane Understanding.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, if the Exposition or Explanation of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may be in any manner satisfactory, I shall here give you the Sentiments of one (and him alone I prefer to a whole Sect of Philosophers) I mean the Judicious Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> who in his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries into the vulgarly received Notion of Nature, expresses himself as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I think it probable (for I would not dogmatise on so weighty and so difficult a Subject) that the great and wise Author of Things, did when he first form'd the universal and undistinguisht Matter into the World, put its parts into various Motions, whereby they were neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily divided into numberless Portions of different Bulks, Figures and Scituations in respect to each other; and by His infinite Wisdom and Power, He did so guide and over-rule the Motion of those parts at the Beginning of Things (whither in a shorter or a longer time, Reason cannot well determine) that they were finally disposed into that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and orderly Frame we call the World, among whose parts some were so curiously contriv'd as to be fit to become the Seeds or Seminal Principles of Plants and Animals. And I farther conceive, that He settled such Laws or Rules of Local Motion amongst the parts of the Universal Matter, that by his ordinary and preserving Concourse, the several parts of the Universe, thus once compleated, should be able to maintain the great Construction or Systeme and Oeconomy of the Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane Bodies, and propagate the Species of Living Creatures.</hi>

               <p>

                  <hi>Again</hi> (saith he) <hi>I consider the Frame of the World already made, as a great and (if I may so speak) pregnant Automaton, or as a Ship furnisht with Pumps, Ordnance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and is such an Engine as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises and consists of several less, and this compounded Machine in Conjunction with the Laws of Motion, freely establisht, and still maintained by Almighty God in all its parts, I look upon as a complex Principle, from whence results the settled Order or Course of Things corporeal; and that which happens according to this Course, may ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally speaking be said to come to pass according to Nature, or to be done by Nature; and that which thwarts this Order, may be said to be preternatural, or contrary thereto. And indeed, tho' Men talk of Nature as they please, yet whatever is done amongst Things inanimate (which make up incomparably the greatest part of the Universe) is really done, but by particular Bodies acting on one another by local Motion, modefy'd by the other Mechanical Affections of the Agent of the Patient, and of those other Bodies that necessarily concur to the Eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

did (as I apprehend) consist in this, That some of their Organs were so framed, that supposing the Fabric of the geater Bodies of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse, and the Laws he had establisht, some juicy and spirituous parts of these living Creatures must be fit to be turned into prolific Seeds, whereby they may have a power by generating their like, to propagate their Species. So that, according to my apprehension, it was at the beginning necessary that an intelligent and wise Agent should contrive the Universal Matter into the World (and especially some Portions of it into Seminal Organs and Principles) and settle the Laws, according to which the Motions and Actions of its Parts upon one another, should be regulated: without which Interposition of the Worlds Architect, however moving Matter, with some probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity (for I see not in the Notion any Certainty) be conceiv'd to be able, after numberless occursions of its insensible Parts, to cast it self into such grand Conventions and Convolutions as the</hi> Cartesians <hi>call</hi> Vortices, <hi>and as I remember</hi> Epicurus <hi>speaks of under the Name of</hi>

But the World being once fram'd, and the Course of Nature establisht, the Naturalist (excepting those Cases where God and Incorporeal Agents interpose) has recourse to the first Cause, but for its general and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Support and Influence; whereby it preserves Matter and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from annihilation or desition; and in explicating particular Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena, considers only the Size, Shape, Motion, (or want of it) Texture and the resulting Qualities and Attributes of the small Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Matter, and thus in this great Automaton the World (as in a Watch or Clock) the Materials it consists of being left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, cou'd never at the first convene into so curious an Engine: yet when the skilful Artist has once made and set it a going, the Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena it exhibits are to be accounted for by the Number, Bigness, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, Shape, Motion (or endeavour) Rest, Coaptation, and other Mechanical Affections of the Spring, Wheels, Pillars, and other Parts it is made up of: and those Effects of such an Engine that cannot this way be explicated, must, for ought I yet know, he confest not to be sufficiently understood.</hi>

The Notion of God is no otherways inbred, than that the Soul is furnisht with such a natural Sagacity, that upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of her Rational Powers, she is infallibly led to the Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Deity: and thus by looking inwardly upon our selves, we perceive that the Faculty resident in us, is not furnish'd with all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and therefore not Self-existent, nor indebted to it self for those it hath: otherwise it wou'd have cloathed it self with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Perfections it can imagine, and by consequence finding its own Exility and Imperfection, it naturally and with case arrives at a Perswasion of deriving its Original from some first Supreme and free
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51616:18"/>
Agent, who hath made it what it is, and this can be nothing but God.</hi> 2. <hi>We perceive that we have such a Faculty as apprehendeth, judgeth, reasoneth: but what it is, whence it is, and how it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth these things, we know not; and therefore there must be some Supreme Being, who hath given us this Faculty, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands both the Nature of it, and how it knoweth which we our selves do not.</hi> 3. <hi>Our Natures are such, that as soon as we come to have the use of our Intellectual Faculties, we are forced to acknowledge some things good, and others evil. There is an unalterable Congruity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt some Acts and our reasonable Souls, and an unchangeable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity betwixt them and others. Now this plainly sways to the Belief of a God, for all distinctions of Good and Evil relate to a Law under the Sanction of which we are, and all Law supposeth a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior who hath right to command us: and there can be no Universal ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pendent Supreme but God.</hi> 4. <hi>We find our selves possest of a Faculty necessarily reflecting on its own Acts, and passing a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it self in all it does: which is a farther Conviction of the Existence of a God; for it implys a Supreme Judge to whom we are accountable.</hi> 5. <hi>We find that we are furnisht with Faculties of vast Appetites and Desires, and that there is nothing in the World that can satisfie our Cravings, and by Consequence there must be some Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Good, adequate and proportionate to the longings of our Souls; which can be nothing but God.</hi> 6. <hi>We find the frame of our Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Powers to be such that we cannot form a Notion of God, tho' it were in denying Him, but we include his Actual Existence in it.</hi> Optimus maximus, <hi>or a perfect Being is the Idea we have of God, whensoever we think of Him; now this includes actual Existence, it being a greater perfection for a thing to be essentially, independently and necessarily; then to be contingently, and by imagination from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, on whose pleasure its Existence depends. All Propositions, whose Praedicate is included in the Essence of the Subject, are stiled Self-evident, or</hi> per se nota: <hi>because if we do but once understand the import of the Term stiled the Subject, we necessarily assent to its Identity with the Praedicate.</hi> 7. <hi>By consulting still our Faculties, we do not find any thing included in our Idea, by virtue of which we must either ever have been, or through existing this moment must necessarily exist the next; which naturally conducts us to a perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a God, from whom we derived our Being at first, and to whom we owe our continued Subsistence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, If we look around us, there is nothing discoverable but what bears the most clear and perspicuous Characters of Wisdom, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51616:19"/>
or Design. Now if we consider the naked Existence of Things, how they come to be in the posture they are, we can by no means grant that they could cause themselves: Existence as always presuppos'd to acting; Nothing can be both before and after it self. Nor</hi> 2<hi>dly, were they Eternal: For</hi> 1. <hi>it is an Hypothesis pregnant with Contradictions, that any thing finite or dependent, as all things in the World are, shou'd be Eternal.</hi> 2. <hi>We see every thing subsist by a succession of Generation and Corruption, which is plainly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Self and Eternal Existence: Production from Eternity is a palpable Contradiction; whatever is produc'd, passeth from a state of Non-Entity into a state of Being; and therefore we must conceive a time when it was not, e're we can conceive the time when it was. But the recency of the Existence of things, is plain from the Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency either of History or Tradition anteced<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For</hi> 1. <hi>the Eternity of Atoms is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the same Contradictions as the Eternity of the World.</hi> 2. <hi>Motion is hereby supposed intrins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>cal to Matter, which is not only false, but impossible. It is the greatest Absurdity that can be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon Reason, to ascribe Motion to such a stupid and unactive Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple as Matter, without the acknowledgment of a first and Divine Motor.</hi> 3. <hi>If all things be the Result of Matter, how comes a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Reason to be convey'd into us, by that which had it not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in it self.</hi> 4. <hi>This Hypothesis supposeth that to have been the Effect of Chance, which openly shows a Divine Contrivance.</hi> 5. <hi>If the Fabric of the World be no more than the result of the casual Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Concatenation of Atoms, how comes it to pass that by their daily striking against each other, they do not dance themselves into more Worlds, at least into some one Animal or other.</hi> 6. Epicurus<hi>'s Infinity of Atoms carries a repugnancy in it to his inane space, and yet without this his whole Hypothesis falls to the ground; nor is it possible to solve the permanency of the World, and the continuity of Bodies, by the fortuitous concatenation of Atoms, through their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent configurations and jagg'd Angles, without the superintendency of an Omnipotent Goodness, who sustains both the whole Creation and every part. Especially it is not conceivable how such Bodies as are made up, either of globular Particles, or of those minute Corpuscles
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51616:19"/>
which</hi> Des Chartes <hi>stiles his first and second Elements, should hold together without the influence of a higher Principle to keep them in their consistency. And thus from these manifold Considerations of things both without us and within us, are we led to a Perswasion and Conviction of the Being of a God.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Nor can the Atheist who denies his Existence, give any rational Account of the Universal Consent of Mankind, that there is one; whereas he that maintains one, can easily resolve it by shewing how such a Perswasion flows naturally from the Exercise of every Man's Understanding: and forasmuch as it is alledg'd that there have been some who have dissented, and consequently that the Perswasion is not Universal, it amounts to no more, but that there have been some who did</hi>

So that if the Contradiction of a single Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual or two, were enough to invalidate a Universal Perswasion, or to impeach a Natural Truth, there would be neither one nor t'other in the World; for not only</hi> Cicero <hi>tells us there is nothing so absurd which some of the Philosophers have not maintained: But</hi> Aristotle <hi>informs us that there have been some who have held that the same Thing might at the same time be, and not be. So that, that thing is universally known, not which every one acknowledgeth, but that which every one who hath not debauch'd his Faculties, doth discern.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis a very sad Truth, when Men are sunk into the greatest Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualities, their Reason becomes</hi>

Besides, such Men living as if there were no God, can make no Apology to the World for it, but by espousing such Notions as may justifie them in their Courses.

               <p>From what has been said upon this Argument, I see not what Evasions can be found out to avoid this Concession that there is a God: And truly, considering the slender supports of Atheism, <hi>viz.</hi> Chance and the World's Eternity, are so easily overthrown, and prove insufficient to satisfie even the think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Libertine himself, I admire not that the more reputable Name of Deist has been taken up by our Modern Vitioso's:

the initial Letter of your Character must be now expanged, and unless you acknowledge Theism, the Men of Letters, (however debaucht) will laugh at and contemn you.</p>
               <p>I have often wondred what those Men think of the Divine Being, or what God is, who are so very familiar with his Name, that they scarce repeat a Sentence without it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' it be by way of imprecating his Judgments, or wishing him to damn them.</p>
               <p>That the Name is more than a useless Sound most of them will acknowledge; and those who boldly plead for the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of Swearing, do grant that tho' God is, yet doth He not take notice of what they say; neither are they capable (if not punisht here) of suffering hereafter.

               <p>If profane Sweating be at all allowable, it must be to such as these; but for any Man to pray that G—d wou'd D—m his Soul, and at the same time to believe its Immortality, or at least to fear any such thing, is a Matter unaccountable, and no ways to be resolved but by the Degeneracy of our Reason, the Abolition of our Sense, and a total Depravation of our Understandings: and yet this is the Practise (I do not say of your self) of many who tell us they are perswaded of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a God, and that they are far from any Certainty that their Souls may not survive their Bodies.</p>

               <p>'Tis very common, as I have before taken notice of, for Men to live as if there were no God; and we may meet with some so extravagantly audacious, as to tell us they are both certain of the truth of their Opinions, and certain that (come what will) they shall never alter them. But yet I very much question, whether one Instance can be given of a clearly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning Atheist, unconcern'd in his last Minutes.

'Twas several days before this Person was able to go abroad; and upon his first visit to one of his Fellows, he was upbraided with Cowardise for betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cause of Irreligion, and falsifying his Promise to dye an Infidel. The Sense of his late Disorder had made too great an Impression to be so soon obliterated, and calling to Mind his Deportment when he thought himself a dead Man, he fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51616:21"/>
confest that he cou'd not help what he did; tho' at the same time, if his Soul prov'd independent, he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self plunging into Eternal Misery: At this time (saith he) my fears are pretty well worn off, I find my self as much a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine as ever; though I must tell you, that you shall never catch me making Resolutions what to do when I am dying.</p>
               <p>Thus do these miserable Wretches, at one time or other (in spight of their most firm Resolves to the contrary) betray the Weakness of their Cause, and by their apparent fears that they are in the wrong, together with their many private and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Recantations, they by some means or other satisfie us, that there is no secure Dependance upon the strongest of their Arguments, or weightiest of their Notions.</p>

                  <hi>It would be too tedious to consider all the little Cavils and Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Atheists against a Deity: The most material are reducible to those that have been proposed, and may be refuted by the Answers we now have given, for they proceed either from wrong Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Nature and Attributes of God, or from Ignorance of the Nature and Relation of other things, or from an obstinate Resistance of what is</hi> de facto <hi>evident; and all of them demonstrate their Unreasonableness and Absurdity, which doth further appear by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable Consequences of not acknowledging a Deity, which is a second way of proving it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>For if there be no God, then it necessarily follos that either every Thing made it self, or that all things came from nothing, and that there are Effects which have no Cause: for there is Life, Sense, and Reason without any Being capable to produce them: and there are artificial Contrivances, regular Proceedings, and wise Adaptations of Things to ends and purposes, far above the Power and Capacity of any Thing which is Existent. These, and many such Things as these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Denial of a God, which are not only great Difficulties, but such gross and sensless Absurdities, as no thinking Person can swallow or digest.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>As therefore Deformity sheweth Shape and Proportion beautiful, so the Belief of a Deity appears more reasonable by the Absurdity and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51616:21"/>
Unreasonableness of Atheism, which contradicts common Sense, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns the agreed Principles of Knowledge and Reason, confounds Chance and Contrivance, Accident and Design, and which has its recourse to wild Romantic and most precarious Hypotheses; for they cannot shun the owning an Infinity, and the Existence of something from Eternity; and they are forced to acknowledge that things are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med according to the Rules of Art and Proportion. Now as it not more reasonable to ascribe the constant observance of these Rules, to an Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Being, than to Chance or no Cause? for there is no middle Thing betwixt them to be fixed on: either the one or the other must take place. Nature, which they talk so much of, is an obscure word for concealing their Thoughts and Sentimens; if by this they mean something distinct from Matter, which moves and directs it, their Nature is God in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise; and if they must flee to this for a rational account of the Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Things, why do they quarrel at the word (GOD) which carries a clear Idea, and in the sence of which all the World is agreed. Tho' this Nature of theirs be equivalent, yet it is more mysterious, and therefore it smells of some designed Perversness, as if by the use of this word, and the disuse of the other, they would turn Peoples thoughts from God, and God from the Honour of being the Creator of all things. But if by Nature they only understand certain Laws, and I know not what Ordinances, by which things must move, is this sufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the first Productions of Things? For though it should be true that Matter cannot move but according to those Laws, and that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by them in process of time, the Work could have been produced as it is at present, after that Romantic manner of</hi> Cartesius: <hi>yet there was no cecessity that Matter should move at all, nor could it move of it self; wherefore, whether they will or not, they must own the Existence of something prior to Matter it self; or the Motion of it, which</hi> Cartes <hi>was sensible of, and therefore he could not build his aiery and fanciful System without supposing the Existence of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So that in a word, as God is the first Cause and Author of all things, this Belief is the foundation of all solid Reason; what is not built on this is Nonsence and Absurdity.</hi>

there not only such, but Oppressors and most unjust. Yet Atheism is a more extravagant and pernicious Madness, which it is the highest Interest of Mankind to keep from spreading. But alas, it has been suffer'd to take root, it is cherisht and encourag'd: Men walk the Streets, and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly act this Madness: in every Corner they throw their Scoffs, and Droll against the Almighty Author of their Being.

Tho' there be no reason why the Atheist should be a Zealot, there being no obligation on him to propagate his opinions, and because the less they are entertain'd by others, he himself is the more secure: Yet no Sect is become more zealous of late than Atheists and their Fraternity, who maintain their Cause by an affro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Should a Jest or a foolish Witticism be of more weight than the Dictates of common Sense and sound Reason? If these Men were capable of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, I would ask them whether they are absolutely sure that they are in the right? Are they able to demonstrate that there is no God? This is more than any ever yet pretended to: and if they cannot pretend to this, ought they not to walk very cautiously; if there be a God (as there may for any assurance they have to the contrary) what then have they to expect for their bold Insults and Oppositions to Him?

In this I shall communicate my own Sentiments (amongst those of some more prudent Persons) concerning Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: a Matter by almost all Men frequently debated, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' by very few of them very rationally explicated.</p>
               <p>This is indeed a Theme so difficult, so intricate and obscure, so amasingly stupendious, and withal a Subject that requires so very much Caution in its Explanation, on the account of its general Moment and Concern, that I profess to you, I scarce know where or in what manner to begin, or how to deliver my Conceptions freely on this weighty Argument: I will how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever venture some few of my own Thoughts, rude and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested as they have occur'd upon a short Reflection; if the Philosopher shou'd happen to get the Ascendant of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, I hope it will be excus'd by those who consider the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son unto whom I write: You have given me, I must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, a liberty to open the Pandects of Nature, and to furnish my self from thence with any thing that seems useful, but will have nothing to be thought valid which is transferr'd from the more Sacred Records of Revelation.</p>
               <p>A God, <hi>ergo</hi> a Providence, has been by almost all, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Christian Philosophers, thought a necessary Conclusion: but since we are to concede nothing by way of an implicite Faith, or as founded upon the bare Testimony of other Men, I shall not spend my time in considering the Analogy, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting whether or no these terms are Synonimous: but will endeavour impartially to take notice, not only of some few particulars, which may countenance, but of some others which
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51616:23"/>
seem to thwart and to be repugnant to this Notion, as it seems generally establisht.</p>
               <p>In order to my proceeding, I expect you should take notice that with some others, who have written upon this Subject, I distinguish Providence as bipartite, or under a double significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (<hi>viz.</hi>) General and Particular; the former, which by Philosophers is term'd the general Concourse or Co-operating Influence, I conceive to be so reasonable and intelligible a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I presume, when once you have consented to the acknowledgment of a first Cause of all Things, you will find your self as it were necessitated to own, that the same Power who created the Universal Matter out of Nothing, and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed its several Parts into so many curious and elaborate Engines, must unavoidably be concern'd, at least in the preservation of the same from Annihilation, or extend a Power of Conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to its continuance and support; for however possible it may be to conceive that God Almighty in directing the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Matter into their several Shapes, Forms, or Configura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, did establish certain Catholick Laws of Motion, yet sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if hereupon we suppose the Deity to retire within himself, no farther to be concern'd with his Divine Workmanship, nor so much as ever after to think of or regard it; it is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable that Matter and Motion, and the several Textures arising from their Combination, can be kept on foot, or secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from their Primitive Non-existence.</p>
               <p>In this Doctrine of God's ordinary Concurrence, I must confess I can find nothing but what is easie and as it were self-evident; but when we survey some very unaccountable <hi>Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena,</hi> and those various <hi>Anomali</hi>'s which run retrograde to our Sense and Opinions of the Divine Attributes; when we reflect upon what some call the Prosperity of wicked Men, and the Adversity of the good; when we see Justice and Innocence trampled under foot, and all thats good and vertuous, degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and contemned, whilst Vice in the mean while reigns as it were triumphant; when we see that neither the Profession nor Practise of the Sacred Rites of Religion, can secure us from Rapine, Cruelty and Oppression; lastly, when we consider, as the Atheist says, That Time and Chance hapneth to all; these, I say, notwithstanding they may be fairly solv'd by those Primitive Laws of Motion bestow'd on Matter, and still main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by the Divine Being; yet when we view them as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51616:23"/>
his immediate Concern and Government, or resulting from his especial Providence, they then appear with a somewhat differing Aspect, and leave our Reason in a thick Darkness and Obscurity.</p>
               <p>To this purpose, you may object that however great and wise that Power may be, who made the World, you can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover not much of either in its Government. You can own indeed, that all Effects must have sufficient Causes, but then (of which you make so mighty an advantage) you daily find these Causes take place in the production of all Effects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously, and that they are seldom or never prevented by a Divine Suspension, even when they seem to impeach the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Wisdom of an especial Providence. That I may give an Instance suitable to your own Thoughts; You see that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind (from whatsoever Cause they had their Origine) are now continued by the mutual Embrace or Carnal Knowledge of the Two Sexes; and therefore you don't admire, that when they come together in the state of Wedlock, or under the Nuptial Institution, with the Generative Organs rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spos'd, that they should propagate their <hi>Species:</hi> but when on the other hand, you consider many incestuous Embraces, and that a Conception is the Result of a Venereal Act in Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Adultery, provided the <hi>faeminine Ova</hi> are prolific, or capable of Impregnation by the Seminal <hi>Aura</hi> of the Male: Here you see abundant Reason to cry out of Providence, and expect the Supreme Power should either immediately pursue the Transgressors with Divine Vengeance, or suspend his Laws of Motion in the Act, in order to prevent a spurious Illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Issue.</p>
               <p>Again, by the same Catholic Law of Motion, or rather by a Specific Gravity or Principle of Gravitation (which is the Property of every Particle of Matter) you come to understand that if a ponderous Body be suspended by too slender a Line, or a weighty Structure raised upon an infirm Basis, insufficient for its Support or <hi>Fulcrum:</hi> Here, I say, by a very little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Mechanicks, you easily foresee, that if the suspended Body preponderate the force intended to hold it up, the Line must necessarily break, and the weight as necessarily fall: so likewise the Building in time grown ruinous, or decay'd by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accidents (the Foundation failing) most certainly tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; but if a sober or reputed pious Man passing by should
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51616:24"/>
chance to make a Perpendicular to the suspended Body at the time of the Lines breaking, and by the fall of the said weight receive some extraordinary hurt: or if by the sinking of an infirm Building, a supposedly righteous Family should be crusht to Death; here the Atheist thinks he has a strong and powerful Reason to inveigh against, or triumph over the Providence of God, and will hardly be perswaded, but that if the Divine Being did inspect or concern himself with the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Mankind, he would upon all such Emergencies mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously interpose, and either by a Revelation, or some other Supernatural Illumination, discover to us the impending dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or (for our Security) stop the Laws of Motion, which he at first establisht, or deprive those Bodies of their Specific Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation which would otherwise injure us.</p>
               <p>Farther, According to this general and prime establisht Law, 'tis easie to conceive that <note n="*" place="margin">Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. <hi>Boyle.</hi>
                  </note> the minute Particles of Matter, each of them having their own proper size, shape or texture, as it happens that they are posited in reference to the Horizon, as erected, inclining or level, when they come to convene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Body, from their primary Affections, Disposition and Contrivance, as to Posture and Order, there must necessarily result that which by one comprehensive Name, we call the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, Shape, or Texture of that Body: and what we call a Monster after this manner produced, is so far from being an Error or Trespass upon the Laws of Motion, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less than a Miracle could prevent it; and indeed suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Particles of Matter (from whatever Cause) posited in the manner we are now speaking, it would be much more monstrous, if they should convene into any other Shape, which we account more regular, handsom, or compleat. But then, when we survey this unusual Figure as the Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Deity, especially where we suppose the same was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd a Mansion for the Rational Soul, we expect that the Supreme Architect should have interpos'd, and either alterd the Laws of Motion, or have given a new Modification to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Matter, whereby they might be disposed to have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter answer'd his Design, and to be rendred more pliable to what Philosophers pronounce the Plastic Power.</p>
               <p>Our Reflections of this Nature, upon the particular Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or God's Government of the World, do put us very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon the most impious Conclusions, and almost perswade
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51616:24"/>
us to question (if we are not very cautious and sensible that it is impossible for us to fathom his Designs) whether there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Divine Intelligence at all, or other Superintendent Being, who sits at the Helm, and takes notice of us Mortals; all this being in our Opinions more easily resolvable into Time and Chance, Matter and Motion.</p>
               <p>These (if I mistak not) are the unhappy Doubts of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate, and altho' they appear not so bare fac'd in the modester sort of Infidels, yet are they (so far as we are able to apprehend) the genuine Thoughts of every irreligious or profane Person.</p>
               <p>We are too apt to set up our own perverted, shallow, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Reason for the Universal Standard, to which Test must be brought not only each others Actions, but those of God himself, and (which is somewhat strange) notwithstanding scarce any one of our Lives is regulated by this Exemplar; yet if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not immediately reconcile the unsearchable and inscrutable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of the Supreme Power, to our own finite Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; if we discover not the most secret Mysteries or <hi>Arcana Deitatis,</hi> and are unable to account for each several Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we blaspemously cry out with <hi>Epicurus, Aut De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Believe me (Sir) I have been often apt to think, that we need not seek much farther for the Causes of Irreligion, than our mistaken Notions concerning Providence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor indeed can I perswade my self of a greater stumbling Block, or more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Difficulty, to be encountred in the Christian War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.

                  <hi>who in his vast and boundless Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comprehended at once the whole Systeme of his Works, and every part, did not mainly intend the welfare of such or such particular Creatures, but subordinated his Care of their Preservation and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, to his Care of maintaining the Universal Systeme and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Scheme and Contrivance of his Works; and especially those Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Rules of Motion and other grand Laws, which he at first e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablisht amongst the portions of the Mundane Matter: so that when there happens such a Concourse of Circumstances, that particular Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, fewer or more must suffer, or else the setled Frame, or the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Course of things must be alter'd, or general Law of Motion hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from taking place; in such Cases, I say, the Welfare and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of Man himself, as an Animal, and much more that of inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Animals, and of other particular Creatures, must give way to the Care that Providence takes of Things of a more general and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Nature and Condition.

                     </gap> Mis-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, I shall take notice that there are several Instances of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who have been choak't with a Hair, which they were unable either to cough up, or to swallow down. The reason of this fatal Accident is probably said to be the irritation that is made by the stay of so unusual a thing as a Hair in the Throat, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions every violent and disorderly or convulsive Motions, to expel it in the Organs of Respiration; by which means the continued Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51616:27"/>
of the Blood, necessary to the Life of Man, is hindred, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence whereof is speedy Death: but this agrees very ill with the Vulgar Supposition of such a kind and provident Being as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present Nature, which is always at hand to preserve the Life of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and succour them in their Physical Dangers and Distresses, as occasion requires; for since a Hair is so slender a Body that it cannot stop the Throat, so as to hinder either the free passage of Meat and Drink into the Stomach, or that of the Air to and from the Lungs (as may he argued from divers no way mortal Excrescencies and Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the Throat) were it not a great deal better for Nature to let the Hair alone, and to stay till the Juices of the Body have resolv'd or consum'd it, or some other favourable Accident have remov'd it, than like a passionate and transported thing, oppose it like a Fury, with such a blind violence, as instead of ejecting the Hair, expels the Life of him who was troubled with it. How the care and wisdom of Nature will be reconciled to so improper and disorderly a proceeding, I leave her Admirers to consider: but it will appear very reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Providence, if we reflect upon the lately given Advertisement; for in regard of the use and necessity of deglutition, and in many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of coughing and vomiting, 'twas in the general most convenient that the part ministring to those Motions, shou'd be irritated by the sudden sense of things that are unusual, tho' perhaps they wou'd not be otherwise dangerous or offensive; because, as we formerly noted, 'twas fit that the Providence of God shou'd, in making provision for the welfare of Animals, have more regard to that which usually and regularly befalls them, then to extraordinary Cases or unfrequent Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Now the difficulty we find to conceive, how so great a Fabrick as the World can be preserved in order, and kept from running again to a Chaos, seems to arise from hence, That Men do not sufficiently consider the unsearchable Wisdom of the Divine Architect, or</hi>

                  <hi>(as the Scripture stiles Him) of the World; whose piercing Eyes were able to look at once quite through the Universe, and to take into his prospect both the beginning and the end of time: so that perfectly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing what wou'd be the consequence of all the possible Conjectures of Circumstances, into which Matter divided and moved according to such Laws, cou'd in an</hi> Automaton, <hi>so constituted as the present World is, happen to be put, there can nothing fall out, unless when a Miracle is wrought, that shall be able to alter the course of things, or prejudice the Constitution of them any farther than He did from the Beginning foresee and think fit to allow. And truly, it more sets off
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51616:27"/>
the Wisdom of God, in the Fabric of the Universe, that He can make so vast a Machine as the</hi> Macrocosm, <hi>perform all those many things which he design'd it shou'd, by the meer contrivance of brute Matter, manag'd by certain Laws of local Motion, and upheld by his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and general concourse, than if He imploy'd from time to time an intelligent Overseer, such as Nature is fancy'd to be, to regulate, assist and controul the Motion of its parts. For as</hi> Aristotle, <hi>by introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Opinion of the Worlds Eternity, did at least in almost all Mens Opinions, openly deny God the Production of the World; so by ascribing those admirable Works of God to what he calls Nature, he tacitly denys him the Government of the World.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Now those things</hi> (continues he) <hi>which the School Philosophers ascribe to the Agency of Nature, interposing according to Emergencies, I ascribe to the Wisdom of God in the Fabric of the Universe; which He so admirably contriv'd, that if He but continue his ordinary and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Concourse, there will be no necessity of extraordinary Ineterposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; which may reduce Him to seem as it were to play after-games: all those Exegencies upon whose account Philosophers and Physicians have devised what they call</hi> Nature, <hi>being foreseen and provided for in the first Fabric of the World: So that meer Matter, thus order'd, shall in such and such Conjunctures of Circumstances, do all that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers ascribe on such occasions to their almost Omniscient Nature, without any knowledge what it does, or acting otherwise than accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Catholick Laws of Motion. For when it pleaseth God to over-rule or controul the establisht Course of Things in the World, by his own Omnipotent Hand, what is thus perform'd may be much easier discern'd and acknowledg'd to be miraculous, by them that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in the ordinary Course of Corporeal things, nothing but Matter and Motion, whose powers Men may well judge of, than by those who think there is besides a certain Semi-Deity which they call Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whose skill and power they acknowledge to be exceeding great, and yet have no sure way of estimating how great they are, and how far they may extend. And give me leave to to take notice to you, on this occasion, that I observe the Miracles of our Saviour and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, pleaded by Christians on behalf of their Religion, to have been very differently look't upon by</hi> Epicurean <hi>and other Corpuscularian Infidels: and by those other Unbelievers, who admit of a Soul, of the World, or Spirits in the Stars; or in a word, think the Universe to be govern'd by Intellectual Beings distinct from the Supreme Being we call GOD: For this latter sort of Infidels have often admitted those Matters of Fact, which we Christians call Miracles, and yet have
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51616:28"/>
endeavour'd to solve them by Astral Operations and other ways; whereas the</hi> Epicurean <hi>Enemies of Christianity have thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves obliged resolutely to deny the Matters of Fact themselves, as well discerning that the Things said to be perform'd, exceeded the Mechanical Powers of Matter and Motion (as they were managed by those who wrought the Miracles) and consequently must either be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd to have been done, or be confest to have been truly miraculous.</hi> Thus far Mr. <hi>Boyle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I must confess my self extreamly taken with the Thoughts of this great Man, which are every where so weighty, and withal so modest, that I know of no Author I have as yet consulted, who hath so pertinently handled in a few words this noble Theme, or afforded me so much Content and Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>I have been formerly, like your self, very familiar with Fate and Fortune, Time and Chance, with Destiny and other emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Notions; and which was the farthest of my Flight, when I knew how to talk of Real Qualities and Substantial Forms, when I conceiv'd the Archaeus or Plastic Power as a kind of Agent or Intelligent Being, disposing and ordering the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Principles; choosing or selecting fit Materials; designing and drawing out as it were the first Rudiments of Life, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering to each Part a Capacity to discarge its Office or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Function. Lastly, When I could resolve all with much ease into the ambiguous term of Nature, I thought my self ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at a <hi>Ne plus ultra,</hi> till the Result of a more serious Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which I was put upon by a Converse with the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of this Divine Philosopher, obliged me to conclude thus, and to take for granted, That however all the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> or each several Event we have, or ever shall see come to pass, may be accounted the immediate Off-spring of Matter, as variously modify'd by local Motion: Yet notwithstanding this Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, we must mediately recur to the Divine Providence, not only for some Author of this Motion, who did in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning establish its Laws, or prescribe those general Rules 'tis govern'd by; but also for a Power by whose Co-operating In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the same are still maintain'd, and without which these second Causes (by too many only taken notice of) wou'd be depriv'd of their Energy.</p>
               <p>There is nothing, Sir, will hely you to evade this, unless it be the sorry Refuge of the Worlds Eternity; which in my former Letter was proved to be taken up with any shadow of

Reason or Probability: a most precarious Assertion, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deny'd can never be prov'd: A Contradiction to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Tradition of Mankind, which hath always attested that the World had a Beginning. It is an Assertion against the current Testimony of all History, which traceth the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Nations and People, the Invention of Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and which sheweth that all have hapned within the space of less than Six thousand years, according to the most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (if not certain) Calculation, which cou'd not be if the World or Man had been Eternal: 'Tis therefore with much reason that your beloved <hi>Lucretius</hi> thus wittingly argues upon this Topic,

Deity, so they afford us a very solid Argument for the Reality of his Nature. If we consider the</hi> Phaenomena <hi>of the Material World, with a due and serious attention, we shall plainly perceive that its present Frame and Constitution, with its establisht Laws, are consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and preserved by gravitation alone; that is the powerful Cement which holds together this magnificent Structure of the World; without that the whole Universe, if we suppose an undetermin'd Power of Motion infus'd into Matter, wou'd have been a confused Chaos; without Beauty or Order, and never stable or permanent in any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: Nevertheless this Gravity, the great Basis of all Mechanism, is not it self Mechanical, but the immediate</hi> Fiat <hi>or Finger of God, and the Execution of the Divine Law: for there is no body that has this Power of tending towards a Center, either from it self or from other Bodies: so that tho' we do believe and allow that every Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Matter is endow'd with a Principle of Gravity, whereby it wou'd descend to the Center, if it were not repell'd upwards by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier Bodies; yet are we fully perswaded, and certainly convinc'd, that this Gravity must be deriv'd to it by nothing less than the Power of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If we consider the Heart which is supposed to be the first Principle of Motion and Life, and mentally divide it into its constituent Parts, its Arteries and Veins, and Nerves and Tendons, and Membranes and the innumerable little Fibres that these secondary Parts do consist of; we shall find nothing here singular, but what is in any other Muscle of the Body: 'tis only the Site and Posture of these several Parts, and the Configuration of the whole, that give it the Form and Functions of a Heart: now why should the first single Fibres in the formation of the Heart, be peculiarly drawn in spiral Lines, when the Fibres of all other Muscles are made by a transverse Rectilinear Motion, or what cou'd determine the fluid Matter into that odd and singular Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, when as yet no other Member is supposed to be formed, that might design the</hi> Orbit <hi>of its Course? Let Mechanism here make an Experiment of its Power, and produce a spiral and turbinated Motion of the whole moved Body without an External Director? 'Tis true, when the Organs are once framed by a Supernatural and Divine Principle, we can willingly enough admit of Mechanism in many Functions of the Body, but that the Organs themselves shou'd be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanically form'd, is as impossible as inexplicable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall now flatter my self with hopes, that what I have here alledg'd will be lookt upon by you to be but little short of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, not only that there is a God (which was the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51616:29"/>
of my first) but that He governs the World at least by keeping up his establisht Laws of Motion, or by the general Concourse of his Providence, which is manifestly conspicuous in his maintaining this mighty System of the World, and in the Efficacy deriv'd from Him unto Secondary Agents, or those which are more frequently term'd Natural Causes.</p>
               <p>What remains of this Argument, which is by much the more intricate and difficult part, relates to the special Providence, upon which is founded, as I conceive, our Belief of these two Propositions: 1. That God Almighty, or the First and Supream Being, in his Government of the World, has not so indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably confin'd Himself to those general Laws of Motion He at first setled in the World, but that He has reserved to Himself a power of Dispensing with the same, and does deviate from these Rules by Suspending the Laws of Motion, or by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Intervention and Interposition of his Power, so often as it pleaseth Him to act miraculously, or to bring to pass a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Effect. 2. That all the several Changes, Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or whatever else befals us from the Womb even to our Graves, are by the special Providence of God allotted for us.</p>
               <p>As to what respects the first of these, <hi>viz.</hi> God Almighty's deflecting or at some times deviating from his usual and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Laws, it is impossible we shou'd ever Convince any obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Infidel of any such Matter of Fact, unless he were an Eye-witness when the Business was transacted, and so as it were compell'd to acknowledge the Effect to be Supernatural, or surmounting the Power of Secondary Agents.</p>
               <p>We have indeed a sort of Men in the World, so wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceited of their own Acquirements, and so strangely opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion'd of the Extension of their own Minds, as to imagine there can be no such thing as an inexplicable Event; but that all may be fairly and intelligibly resolved without that pusillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and servile Refuge (as they express themselves) of recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to a Miracle, the Founders (say they) of which, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been some subtil Impostors, who to promote an Interest or to serve their own turn, have found it no very difficult Matter to impose upon the Mole-ey'd Multitude. And at this rate not only the Supernatural Actions of the Apostles, but the Surprising and Stupendious ones of their Master Jesus Christ, must either by these Men be utterly deny'd, or resolv'd (if it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51616:30"/>
were possible) by the generally establisht Laws, or (in their own words) by the Powers of Nature: so that we must either believe the History of our Saviour to be pure Forgery, a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic Legend fob'd upon us by designing Men, or else we must have recourse to the Men of this piercing Apprehension, and consult them as our Oracles for an Explanation of those Accounts, which we, poor silly Creatures, believe to have been miraculous.</p>
               <p>It is in vain, I know, to send you to that Sacred History, where so many of these Stupendious and Divine Operations are faithfully recorded, whilst you continue so Sceptical as to doubt concerning the Credit of the Historian, or so much an Infidel as to deny the History to be an Authentic Record.

We may easily believe that those who lookt upon the Gospel
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51616:30"/>
Promulgation, as an insupportable Burthen and Incroachment, and accounted it no other than a kind of Heretical Innovation upon their more anciently establisht Law, would make it their Business to pry into and enquire with their utmost Caution in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the truth of those Facts, which finding themselves obliged to acknowledge Supernatural or Surmounting the Laws of Nature, or the force of Second Causes, yet rather than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess any such Matter as a Divine Energy, they would have them to be transacted by a Diabolical Assistance.</p>
               <p>I might make, I think a farther very rational Query, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you can believe the Accounts we have given us in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick History of the Martyrdoms or painful Sufferings of some of these Apostles: If you do believe any of these Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, as I think you may those at least which are recorded by some Friends even of the Tyrants themselves, who were concern'd in the Patriarchal Tragedies, it will be worth while to enquire into the Motives which induced them to hazard their Lives, by taking on them their several Embassses: If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Honour, you find they had Disgrace; instead of Riches and Grandeur, Poverty and Contempt: if instead of Courtesie, Civility and Respect, they met with nothing but Reproach and Railery: Lastly, if for all their hardship, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Temporal Promotion and Preferment, they willingly submitted to an accursed, ignominious and painful Death, you then must either think there never were any such Men (and thus by the same liberty you may disbelieve any such Places as the Countries where 'tis reported they suffer'd Death) or if you think there were, you must believe them either distracted, or finally, that in following the Direction of their great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, they acted like Men truly reasonable and discreet, and in that they preferr'd a Life of Misery, Anguish, Disquiet and Tribulation, it is plain they had an Assurance, as well as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, of their Reward elsewhere; and that they question'd not to find a sufficient Recompence bestow'd upon them for all their Sufferings, in those Sacred Mansions not made with hands, Eternal in the Heavens.

Specters, Apparitions, Stupendious Recoveries of the Sick and Lame, together with the Satanical Powers of Fascination and Diabolical Possessions: if these, I say, however sufficiently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested, will not be sufficient to induce you to believe, that there ever was such a Thing as a Supernatural Production, but that all Things are burried on by an establisht Law, or (in your own more pleasing words) by an irresistible Fate or Destiny, and that all Effects are the pure Result of Matter under its se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Modifications, whose Powers were never superseded by any higher Principle; and farther, that there are no such extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Prints of a Divinity, or Marks of Wisdom conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the Creation; I would then desire you with as much attention as you can, considerately to examine the Structure of your own Body: And if you begin with a Survey, even of an inconsiderable part thereof, such as your Fingers, in each of these (as is well remarkt by Mr. <hi>B</hi>—) you will find Bones and Cartilages, Ligaments and Membranes, Muscles and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, Nerves and Arteries, Veins and Skin, and Cuticle and Nail, together with the <hi>Medulla,</hi> the Fat and Blood, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nutritious Juices, and all these solid parts of a determinate size and figure, texture and scituation; and each of them made up of myriads of little Fibres and Filaments, not discoverable to the naked Eye; I say, when you consider how innumerable Parts must constitute so small a Member, surely you cannot look upon it, or the whole Body, wherein appear so much fitness, use and subserviency to infinite Functions, any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than as the Effect of Skill and Contrivance: If this will not extort a Confession from you, that you are fearfully and wonderfully made, you must at least allow your self to be the Workmanship of some Intelligent Being; and altho' the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monness of the Object takes off your Admiration, and you now find the Propagation of Mankind in a Method setled by the Divine Providence, yet if you transgress not the Bounds of Reason, you must affirm their first Production to be by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Power of the Almighty Author of all Things, and that every succeeding Generation of them are the Off-spring of one primitive Couple.</p>
               <p>Having survey'd some of the Extremities of this mighty Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, and diligently passed over its outward Covering or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; my next advice to you is, that you retire within, and carefully examine not only the Parts wherein those Offices

are perform'd, but the Processes themselves; such as that of Mastication, Deglutition, Chylification, Sanguification, the Inkindling of the Blood for the Lamp of Life, its great Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in some respects with Culinary Fire, <hi>viz.</hi> its constant ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessity of Ventilation through the <hi>vesiculae</hi> of the Lungs, and a perpetual supply of a fit <hi>Pabulum</hi> or Fuel out of the received Aliment for the continuance of its Flame: when you have done here, and discover'd all the Secretions or Separations of the several Juices, which are put off from the Sanguineous Mass in its wonderful Circulation, and deposited in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Receptacles, till called for to their proper Employments; you may lastly, with that profound Humility and Veneration which becomes the Enquiry, ascend into the <hi>Sanctum Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> that Divine <hi>Emporium</hi> of the Soul, the Brain; where not only our Sensations, but all our Cogitations, our Perception, Reflexion, Intuition, and all those noble Faculties of Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Phantasy or Imagination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are surprisingly transacted. Here if you diligently and Philosopically take to pieces the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of the Soul, I mean the Sensitive, you may readily comprehend, with an excellent and most judicious <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Willi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When you have thus finish'd your Physiological Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, an Application of this Consequence will, I think, be not only pertinent, but natural and genuine: That since first, in relation to the Vital or Flamy Part, there are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prae-requisites in order to Digestion or Transmuting the gross and solid Matter of our Food, into that soft and pappy Substance we call Chyle; if any one of which be wanting, some certain detriment will ensue, whether this be in the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle it self, a deficiency of its native Heat, a weakness in the Tone of any or all its Fibres, a want or perversion of the secreted Juices which compose its <hi>Menstruum</hi> or Dissolvent: Or if all things are orderly performed here, and safely delivered hence, yet since there are also many requisites to a fit passage of the said Chylous Juice into the Blood, such as the admistion of the Bile and the Pancreatic Juice, either of which being pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51616:32"/>
in quantity or quality, many Mischiefs will ensue: but if in these secondary Passages all things have gone on well, yet if the Passages to the common Store-house or <hi>Receptaculum</hi> happen to be obstructed, and thereby rendred impervious to the liquor they should receive; or if others of those curiously slender Tubes, the Lacteal Vessels, by the forcible protrusion of the contained Matter should break, or suffer a Solution of their Continuity, the Chyle must be extravasated, and a fatal Inundation thereof in some little time comes on. But if hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto Matters have succeeded as they ought, and this noble Liquor is at length safely arriv'd through its many Meanders and inconspicuous Ways, and as safely deliver'd up to the Heart; yet if here it be not rightly sanguify'd or turn'd into Blood; or if when it is so made and continued in its Circuit, the containing Blood Vessels, either from a Deficiency of the <hi>Vis Motoria,</hi> or Disorder of the Spirits in the Orbicular nervous Fibrils implanted in the Tunics of the said Vessels, labour with an Obstruction, or suffer such a Distension by the impelling Blood, as produces a Diruption, there presently follows Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasation and Stagnation of the Vital Liquor. Farther, If the Blood it self (as from many Causes it may) contract too great an Acidity or Viscosity, or by Adustion grow perfectly Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosive; if its <hi>Crasis</hi> be considerably vitiated or disorder'd, the Nutritious Juices must partake of the Infection, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Assimulation or Apposition of their Particles for the growth and encrease of all the Parts of the Body, cannot at all, or not regularly be performed, neither will the subtil parts of such a Blood, tho' never so well elaborated in the Brain, afford either a sufficient Plenty, or an exactly homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous Spirit for the influencing the Nerves, those Causes <hi>sine qua</hi> of every particular Function and Operation: In a word (that I may not ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Before I finish my Discourse of Supernatural Productions, or those Effects which do surmount what we call the Powers of Nature, and frequently hare witness to God's especial Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I will take the liberty to make a short Digression, and give you my Opinion how it comes to pass that these unusual and extraordinary Events, have gained so little Credit, not only with the Profane and Sensual, but even amongst very many Sober and Learned Men. That I may do this to your greater Satisfaction, I must give you to understand that many of those surprising Symptoms, which are produced by the Disorders of the Nervous System, are by the generality of all Men, unless Physicians, very frequently lookt on as unaccountable Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies: Thus many Hysteric Persons have been esteem'd Planet-struck, especially if by a Resolution of some particular Nerves, one Muscle has been relaxed; and its Antagonist contracted, by which the Parts have been distorted, and thereby rendred deformed: or if the Celestial Bodies have been acquitted, it must be imputed to Fascination or Witchcraft. Epileptics in like manner are taken for Daemoniacs, and the surprising <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> they exhibit, such as Dancing, Singing, Crying, Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are presently supposed to be wrought by a Praestigious or Diabolical Possession: and if, as it often happens, the Priest be sent for instead of the Physician, to eject the Evil Spirit, the mistake is then so far from being rectify'd, or the Fallacy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, that whole Cities have been impos'd on by such like Reports, and the supposed Authentic Testimony of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Parish has serv'd for an irrefutable Confirmation.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51616:33"/>
By these means, when Atheistical Men have understood that such like Accidents, have proceeded from no other Causes than the Convulsive Disorders which do frequently disturb the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Oeconomy, and that by Mechanic Principles they are to be explain'd, 'tis natural for them presently to conclude, that all Relations of the like tendency, proceed either from the same Origine, and exceed not the force of second Causes, or that they are downright Cheats, which for the countenancing some Design, are promoted and carry'd on by a Knavish Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy or Combination: and indeed, tho' I am far from denying all accounts of Daemoniacs, or the Satanical Power of Fascination, yet I cou'd heartily wish that none of them were publisht, without the proper Examen of Expert Physicians; for to speak freely, I am well satisfy'd that those Subjects which have furnisht so many Histories, Discourses and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports upon this Matter, have been for the greatest part no other than Maniacal, Hypochondriacal, Hysterical or Epileptical Persons, and that the usual Appearances they exhibit, belong properly to Spasmology, or the Doctrine of Convulsions.</p>
               <p>'Tis not long since my Curiosity lead me to take a view of a young Woman, the Report of whose Circumstances had brought a Multitude of Spectators from all parts of the Town, who generally return'd amaz'd at so surprising a Spectacle, and gave out that she was Daemonical, or possest with an evil Spirit, who did sometimes utter very unusual Sounds, some of them not unlike the howling of a Dog, without any perceptible Motion of her own Organs of Speech.</p>
               <p>When I came into the Room with a particular Friend, we found her accompanied by two or three other Women, and discoursing rationally, which they said at some intervals she used to do. During the time I stay'd, there was a continual Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Vertebrae of her Neck, and sometimes those of her Loins; the former occasion'd a violent throwing backwards and forwards of her Head: and that which they lookt on as unaccountable was this, That if any one offer'd to stop this motion of her Neck and Loins, the same was then quicker, and continued with a redoubled force. Upon this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement just then receiv'd from her self and the good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, my Friend on one side, and I on the other (as she was sitting on the Feet of the Bed) laid our hands on each side on the top of her Shoulders, and first gently pressing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51616:33"/>
of them down to retard the Motion, I perceiv'd a very sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Opposition or Resistance, even beyond my Conjectures of her own strength, insomuch that at length endeavouring with all our Power to suppress this uncommon Motion of the Head and Body, the Resistance made against us was so very forcible, as almost to throw us from her, and the Agitation of both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to grow so vehement, as to occasion very irregular Distor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Eyes, a Foaming at the Mouth, together with a very considerable Influx of Blood upon the Surface of her Face; which frighting her Acquaintance, and rendring her uneasie, we were desired to desist, and after some few Minutes the Disturbance went off, she returning to her accustomed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of gently moving her Head backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>During this time of her Agony, she spake nothing; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pretty well recover'd, I found her very willing to believe it a Supernatural Power that thus impetuously mov'd her; and the rather, she said she was induced to think so, because it was involuntary and much against her Inclination: for when at any time (being all the while sensible) she wilfully endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to stop the Motion, and to keep her self in <hi>Aequilibrio,</hi> she was so violently tormented in some other parts of her Body, that if she did not submit her self to the Evil Spirit, he wou'd certainly kill her.</p>
               <p>Before I attempt an Explication of these several <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> it will be requisite that I acquaint you with the Method I took in the Exploring thereof. There was at that time in the room an ancient Midwife, who, as I understood, had put this young Woman under a Course of Physic, tho' altogether unsuccess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Upon which Information I enquir'd on what account the Physic had been given, or what expectation she design'd it should answer: which understanding who I was, she very free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told me, That what she had order'd, was for a Suppression of— under which Obstructions the Patient had labour'd for a considerable time. I enquired no farther, but having given my Opinion, came away with this Satisfaction, that if the whole was not Imposture, and she a Counterfeit, as it was not impossible but she might, there was nothing in all this but a Spasmodic or Convulsive Disorder of the Nerves, frequently attending Hysterical and Epileptic Persons. I had before-hand asked her whether there was Truth in those Reports she had suffer'd to be printed, concerning the Devil's speaking in her,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51616:34"/>
and barking like a Dog. She utterly deny'd this; and reply'd she knew nothing of that Matter: and that it was both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to her, and against her will that such Discourses shou'd be disperst. The Maid, I must needs say, seem'd very modest and soberly dispos'd, and was extraordinarily lamented by some of those who knew that her Education and Converse in the World had been unblamable and pious. I never certainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood how her Distemper terminated, and being willing to judge Charitably of her so far as I was concern'd, shall only intimate by the way, that it was publickly reported, not long after, that she was proved a Cheat, and had got much Money by it. But as to this I am not certain, being rather inclinable to believe the contrary, and that she labour'd with the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of an Hysterical Affection.</p>
               <p>I shall not think my self concern'd to give you here a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Account of the Progress of these Distempers, or to tell you by what means the Morbi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ic Matter is contracted which insinuates it self into the Muscular Fibres, and there excites these direful Effects; 'tis sufficient, at your leisure, that you consult any Physical Author who hath handled this Subject. In the Writings of the acute and very sagacious <hi>Willis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Willis</hi>'s Discourse of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions.</note> you may find Relations of this Nature sufficient to Evince those almost incredible and surprising <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> which take their Rise from an heterogeneous <hi>Copula</hi> admitted into the Nerves, or a dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy of the Spirits themselves from their natural <hi>Crasis,</hi> exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting very strange unusual Explosions, and producing often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times most astonishing Effects in the Humane Body; which yet nevertheless we have no more reason to look upon as trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by an Infernal or Supernatural Power, than the prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous strength of some Lunatics, their long protracted Abstinence from Alimentary Provision, and the like; which altho' more frequent, and consequently less regarded, are every whit as worthy of our Enquiry or Indagation.</p>
               <p>I remember some few years since, amongst others, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the <hi>R— S—</hi> with one very remarkable Case that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd to my observation, relating to a Youth bitten by a Dog, who after the Wound was cured, was seized with a <hi>Deliriam,</hi> snapt at every thing that approacht him, and so nearly imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Barking of a Dog in the height of his Paroxysms, that any Person unacquainted might have been so impos'd on, as to imagine there had been a Dog barking in the Chamber: and I
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51616:34"/>
make it no question, had the Infection been communicated by some indiscernible Passage, or had the Parents been ignorant that the wound was made after this manner, they with many others wou'd have thought their Child possest, and nothing less than the Devil must have been the reputed Author of his surprising Actions.</p>
               <p>But it is now time for me to resume the thread of my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, concerning God's particular Providence, which that I might the better illustrate, I thought my self oblig'd to make mention of those really Supernatural Acts of the Divine Power, or the Miracles which have been wrought for the Conviction of Infidels: and this I thought cou'd not effectually be done without a Specimen of the Powers of Matter, and the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of second Causes in the Production of Events by Mechanic Principles. By these Instances you may the more readily col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect how far these Powers may reach, and distinguish the Truth of a-Supernatural Act, from a supposititious Miracle, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of which having been enquir'd into, and by inconsiderate Men discover'd either Forgeries, or the Effects of Convulsive Indispositions, has been the occasion of a vast Increase to the number of our Modern Sadducees and nominal Deists, who if they condescend to grant that God Almighty may be a Spirit, yet must it be accounted Dissonant to Reason, an Imposition upon our senses, and the Effect of a servile abject Mind, to think there should be any other.</p>
               <p>Thus having toucht upon those two Extreams, of such who on the one side will allow nothing to surmount Mechan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51616:35"/>
and <hi>G</hi>— who with some others have been so fondly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of their own Performances, as to deliver them out for the Oracles of Reason, and so profanely irreligious, as to set up the Light of Nature in opposition to the Divine Revelation, or their own Phantastic Whimseys to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. But before I leave my Discourse of Miracles, it may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary in respect to their Description and Definition to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you, that not only those Events which do result from a Supernatural Concourse, but those also which are immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produc'd by Secondary Agents, may in the timing of those Agents, and continuing their Action after an unusual manner, manifest unto us the Power of their great Author, and ought to be reputed by us for unquestionable Miracles.</p>
               <p>There is a Learned Foreigner, and a very great Critick, in whose Writings I find a concurring Testimony to this Opinion. This Person, in some of his Dissertations upon the Book of <hi>Genesis,</hi> has presented the Men of Letters with some curious Thoughts: whether his Design be what it ought, I shall not go about to determine; but will only acquaint you, that when he comes to discourse of the <hi>Israelites</hi> Deliverance, from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Servitude, by their wonderful Passage over the <hi>Red-Sea</hi>; he conceives (contrary to most other Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) that the Miracle did not consist in that the Waters were divided, as generally supposed, without a manifest Cause; but in this,<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>le Clerk</hi>'s Dissertati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon <hi>Genesis.</hi>

                  <hi>That upon the motion of the Rod, God raised a mighty and impetuous Wind the Night before this great Design was to be put in practice, which with the advantage of the Sea's ebbing, drove the Waters so far from the farther end of the Gulph, towards its Mouth, that there appeared a large Ford over against the</hi> Israelites, <hi>through which they went to the opposite Shoar: and that the Wonder was still more conspicuous in this, that so soon as the</hi> Israelites <hi>were safely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived on the other side, and their Pursuers plunged in, the Wind, which kept back the Waters, on a sudden ceased, and the same Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as suddenly returning, their Enemies were overwhelmed by the Inundation.</hi> The same Person, in his Comments on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Sodom,</hi> does not think it necessary to believe any such thing as a Showre of lighted Sulphur falling down upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

the Lightning, and the Flame was not only to be seen upon the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the Earth, but so pierced into the Subterranean Veins of Sulphur and Bitumen, that that Matter being destroy'd, the whole Earth sunk down, and afforded a Receptacle to the Waters flowing thither.

               <p>I have instanc'd in these few, amongst other Cases of the like Import, not so much to justifie or countenance these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viations from the Letter of the History; or in favour of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry phanciful Interpretation of them; as to demonstrate that we are not absolutely ty'd to think that every Miracle is an unaccountable Production, or effected by Powers every way Supernatural; but that it is very possible a true and real Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle may be brought to pass by natural Agents, and that many of the Divine Judgments have been executed by their being put into Action, tho' perhaps after an uncommon manner, at particular times.</p>
               <p>As to what relates to Specters or Apparitions, together with inorganic Sounds and Voices, I shall reserve my Thoughts for another Letter; where it is possible I may entertain you with some things diverting: I shall in this place just mention that there are a multitude of Histories of real Demoniacs, of Places and particular Families disturb'd by Facination; of others mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably tormented with Diabolical Delusions and odd Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions; with which, notwithstanding I was never otherwise acquainted then at second hand, yet I take some of them to be so well attested by curious and inquisitive Men, who have made it their business to detect any supposed Fallacy, that it were very great Injustice to our selves, as well as an Affront to their

               <p>Indeed, it seems to me very evident, as well as reasonable, that the special Providence of God is a Notion so unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that without its Establishment in the Heart of Man, the Foundation and Support of all Religion wou'd be unhing'd. For instance; cou'd we once perswade our selves that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being was inexorable, our Prayers and Supplications for the Supply of what we want, and for the Removal of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils must be all invalid. Cou'd we assure our selves, that either God cou'd not, or wou'd not be our Refuge when we call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, but that he hath left us wholly, having set before us Good and Evil, to the determination of our own Wills, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least regard or notice of our Election, or without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Himself in any manner to help us, to direct or assist us when we are wander'd and have ran astray: In a word, if we can once perswade our selves there is no God that heareth Prayer, that hath neither the Power of Life nor Death, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquitteth nor condemneth, to what purpose are all our Petitions, our Prayers, Penetential Tears, or fervent Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations? or on what account do we frequent any Places, either of Publick or Private Worship? Omnipotence, Justice and Goodness are ascrib'd in vain, if God neither made the World, nor regard it being made: Nor will it be easie to perswade Men to worship Him, if we are neither beholding to Him for our Being, nor under His Laws, and if He no more respect our Adorations, than if we did reproach and blaspheme Him: If it were thus, we shou'd undoubtedly have cause to think our selves, by much the most miserable part of the Creation. But on the other hand, That there is a natural Belief in us, both of God and of his Providence, the greatest of our Adversaries, the most irreligious and profane, the learned and profound A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist, as well as the illiterate, nay, all Mankind have been as it were forc'd to grant and acknowledge. I am sure it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiously rare Case, to find any so unconcern'd an Infidel, let his Life have been never so remarkable for Immorality, or one continued Act of Impiety and Irreligion, notwithstanding the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51616:38"/>
force of contracted evil habits may have throughly immerst him in all kinds of Sensuality, yet when some grievous Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity hath befall'n him, or the disorder of his Body put him upon a Retirement, he begins to think first that there may be such a Thing as Divine Providence, as well as that there may not: and when a farther Reflection convinces him that it is more probable there is, than that there is not, if Death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him, in the midst of his Meditations, there is scarce an Atheistical Desparado, can forbear giving his Testimony to this great Truth, but either silently or loudly breaths out his Soul with an <hi>O God be merciful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if these Men, the mighty Sticklers against the Divine Providence all their Lives, had that assurance in their last Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, that God Almighty is neither wise enough to know their Circumstances, nor powerful enough to punish them, I wou'd gladly know from whence proceeds these lamentable Expirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? You will say perhaps from those bugbare Fears of invisible Powers, with which Tales they are so perpetually plagued from Pulpit Harangues, and promiscuous Converse with Men devoted to a Religious Superstition, that it is hardly possible for any Man so throughly to shake off these Childish Fears and Apprehensions, but that at some time or other they will intrude upon him, and in spight of all his Opposition imbitter his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and Natural Satisfactions. The World, you say, is so pester'd with the Levitical Tribe, that there is scarce a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Earth to be found, where a Man might live secure from this disturbing Noise of a Being who sees all our Actions, and will retribute to every Man after he is dead and buried, you know not how nor where, according to his Deserts, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Reward or Punishment. Thus the Prejudice and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possession of Education in some, of Conversation in others, are the great Bias that sways the whole Bulk of Mankind, and keeps them under those servile Fears which necessarily arise from a Supposition of a God, and of other Separate Beings.</p>
               <p>That I may make a short, tho' I hope sufficient Reply to this Objection, I must confess that the Allegation of an early im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bib'd or preconceiv'd Prejudice, may be prevalent enough to startle those, who either through a careless Negligence or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity, have never dived into the bottom of this weighty Affair; but that it shou'd have force enough to master and over-power the great and potent Masters of Humane Reason,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51616:39"/>
and subjugate their seemingly impregnable and strenuous For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses, or strong Holds of Atheistical Argumentation, is in my Opinion, plainly giving up their Cause, and a silent Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment that the Proleptic Evidence or Light of their own Consciences, notwithstanding their vain Endeavours to suppress and extinguish it, will, however it may be sometimes smother'd and kept under, break out at length to their sorrowful assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, That those Noble Faculties of their Souls are more than a meer Sound or Echo from the clashing of sensless Atoms, and must indubitably proceed from a Spiritual Substance of a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and Divine Extraction: and that those admirable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brics of their Bodies ought no longer to be ascrib'd to the fatal Motions of blind unthinking Matter, but to the Wisdom and Contrivance of a Power Omnipotent.</p>
               <p>The Recollections of this Nature, and Recantations of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Principles, together with the strange Horror and Conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation those we are speaking of lye under at particular times, is decypher'd by <hi>Juvenal</hi> in these Lines;

               <p>There is no occasion to search Antiquity for these Examples, Modern Story will abundantly furnish us; we have lately had a <hi>R—r</hi> that may serve for all: A Man who, as perhaps his Profanity wants a Parallel, so likewise his incredible Acuteness of Judgment and Apprehension, together with his great Learning, had qualify'd him for diving as far into the Mystery of Atheism, as any of those that went before, or may happen to follow after him. I suppose you are no Stranger to the last Conferences which he held with the present B— of <hi>S</hi>— nor of those Rational and Penetential Expressions that usher'd in his last Minutes; upon which account I shall ease my self of the Trouble of their Transcription. But since that happy, tho' unexpected Alteration in the opinion of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, is by his once beloved Libertines imputed to a Decay of his Rational Faculties, and a want of his former Strength and Vivacity of Judgment, induced by a long and painful Sickness, together with his frequent Commerce with the infectious Priests; tho' this, I say, be all too weak to blacken and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure the Testimony of that late, yet unfeigned noble Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,

or to render his Religious Deportment but an inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Reflection upon the strength and goodness of their Cause: yet if I thought it might contribute to your farther Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, I could give you a signal Instance of some Affinity with the former, relating to a short Intercourse between my self and a deceased Friend: the former will indeed have this Advantage, that it wants not your knowledge of the Person, at least his Character, together with the Circumstances of Time and Place, as also the very forcible Attestation of several wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentlemen: whereas this with which I am about to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you, must for its credibility depend wholly upon your good Opinion of its Relator, since not only the Name and Place of Residence, but whatever else may tend to his Discovery, are to be buried in oblivion. Be the Event as it will with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to your Conjectures.</p>
               <p>It is no long time ago that I paid a sorrowful Farewel to a dying Friend, a Man whom I never adventur'd to think more than a Deist, and that but nominal: I knew him to be both a Gentleman and a Scholar, that his Studies had been mostly Mathematical, and indeed he had made as good proficiency in Physicks or Natural Philosophy, as perhaps almost any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his years.</p>
               <p>Having the good fortune to find him without Company, the freedom I had formerly taken with him, excus'd a farther Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony; and I immediately desir'd to know (having but little time to tarry) if he would grant me the liberty of asking him two or three short Questions, which, after his Concession, I put to him in these words: 1. Whether he conceived his Mind to be now as clear, as active, and as vigorous as it had been some few days before his Ilness? 2. Whether he found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any Perswasives to Repentance, or did believe any Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by such kind of Atonement, to endeavour an Expiation of his past Failings and Offences? 3. If he had, or had not a full Conviction of the Soul's Immortality? 4. What he thought of the Christian Religion? To all which, when he had sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully sighed out a <hi>Heu! Quam Mutatus,</hi> He made answer to this Effect:</p>
               <p>1. That his Reason had as yet suffer'd nothing of an Eclipse, and that he found his Understanding (bating the Effect of his present Consternation) as firm as ever. 2. As for sorrowing for past Errors and Irregularities, he thought it was no more
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51616:40"/>
than natural, and to cry to Heaven for Mercy at the last Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either in Sighs or Words, what the wildest Pagan put in practise: but that the Contrition of so great a Libertine as himself had been, however fervent or sincere, yet considering the same proceeded from one unable to sin longer, to think this available to reconcile such a throughly poluted Soul to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Favour, he lookt upon absurd. 3. As to the Substance and Condition of the Rational Soul, that great Principle and Source of all his Intellectual Faculties, when he formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd the Ignorance and more than brutish Stupidity of his Infancy, his gradual increase of Knowledge, and the manner of his collecting Idea's, with their being plac'd, tho' he knew not how, in his Memory, together with his first Attempts to speak by an imitation of those about him, these put him upon think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the whole Progress had so entire a Dependance upon the Conformation or Mechanick Structure of the Brain, as to make him doubtful, whether there was any thing more in his Composition than Matter under various Modifications; and to believe that which hath obtain'd the Denomination of Mind or Soul, was only the Result or Completion of the Animal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, or did consist in some subtil Particles of the Blood, after divers unaccountable ways exerting their several Functions. But since he had more warily consider'd the strength of his own Mind, under a violent and very sensible Alteration and Decay of the Parts of his Body, that it grew more clear still as his end approached, and wou'd not let him rest without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing to its independency on the Body; since he reflected farther upon its Essence, and that it was certain its Faults or Imperfections might not be such in it self, but seem so as it stands related to the Body, in which whilst it is an Inhabitant and ty'd to Corporeal Organs, it must act accordingly: since he had weighed that pertinent and well adapted Simile, That the Soul is no more blameable for acting disagreeably in a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd or distemper'd Brain, than the Artist who has mist his end only on the account of faulty or improper Instruments: Lastly and above all, when he consider'd the Nature of Good and Evil, the Justice of the Divine Being, in rewarding good Men, and punishing the wicked; these Rewards not being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed here; he was perswaded must undoubtedly ensue hereafter: and that his Soul was truly and really a Substantial Form infus'd by a Divine Power, and no Accident of Matter,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51616:40"/>
neither capable of perishing by the destruction of the Body. Farther, That whatever Vehicle it might assume in its state of separate Existence, he saw nothing in the Notion incongruous or absurd, but that without its forsaken Companion it might very well be capable of an Intuitive Knowledge, and of exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing those reflex Acts which have no dependance upon gross Material Images, or Coporeal Idea's. 4. The business of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Religion, he said, had very often startled him; he gave the less regard to it, because it had never reach'd to all Parts of the World: and he did think it too smart a Reflection upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, to be consistent with the Divine Attributes, that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind should not have equal Advantages, or the same Laws or Rules to govern themselves by. But as for his own Judgment, he thought it the less valuable; for notwithstanding he did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways believe there was such a Thing as Natural Religion, or a Light set up in the Soul by which every Man might steer his Course, and that Morality was more then an empty Sound, yet he had govern'd himself very little or nothing by the same. To the Credit of Christianity he offer'd this, That by how much the less Reason he had to believe it false, the more he thought himself oblig'd to think it true: and indeed, when at sometimes he consider'd what mighty Gain its first Founders might make of its Promulgation, or what should be the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to induce any Man to carry on such a Design, these Doubts, he said, he was never able to resolve; for when (as it was but seldom) he search'd the Sacred Writings, and found, they contain'd nothing but such Laws and Precepts, as wou'd if carefully observ'd, make us truly and compleatly happy: since they had had the Suffrage of the most Learned, and all the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and consequently more Considerate part of the World, he was willing to think, for his part, they were manumitted to us by a more than Humane Power, and that their Divinity was as well conspicuous in their Subject as their Stile.</p>
               <p>He lamented his short Acquaintance with them, and the small Progress he had made in the Writings of the Ancient Fathers, and all other Ecclesiastic History: were he to live the latter years of his Life over again, he said they should be devoted to an Enquiry after the great Founder of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; for he did believe it a Concern of the highest moment, and that every Man ought to satisfie himself, so far as he is able, of the Authority of those Writings, which being once establisht
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51616:41"/>
on a well-grounded Faith, they are and will be certainly the surest Guide we have to an happy Eternity. As for himself, he told me, he had many perplexing Thoughts attending him; so that he must put all upon a mighty Risque; but that he hop'd to continue to his last Breath an unfeign'd humble Supplicant for Mercy to the Majesty of Heaven: and that if he had no right to any Claim by the Death of Christ, the Saviour of the World, which (tho' on slight Assurance) he earnestly hop'd that he had, he must then take what was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted for him by the Divine Justice.</p>
               <p>Thus I took a vary dismal <hi>Vale,</hi> after he had closed all with some short and pithy Expressions relating to my self. I have purposely in this place omitted the several Interruptions hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening in Discourse, since the Contents of the Replies I made in conference with this my deceased Friend, are some of them already intersperst in this and my former Letter, and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains may very probably be incerted in my next.</p>
               <p>I shall give you no more Instances of this Nature, but will only add a word or two concerning the unequal Distribution of the Goods of Fortune, together with the Prosperity of the Wicked, and the Afflictions of Good Men: which if they do not Convince you of the Divine Justice and Goodness, may at least serve to palliate and to render these General Reflections upon Providence the less weighty.</p>
               <p>But before we speak of Happiness or Infelicity, Prosperity and Adversity, it behoves us to fix upon some just Method of Discrimination, and that we agree upon some proper Terms that may significantly express the Nature of Good and Evil, not as they appear, but as they really and experimentally are found in themselves: for if you go by the commonly receiv'd Opinion, or the Customary Judgment Men too frequently make, and reckon that Man more happy than your self, who has more Money, more Attendants, more Admirers, fares more daintily or deliciously, lives easier, and takes less care. You will quickly find the Fallacy, and a very little Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness will give you to understand, that notwithstanding these, there is no Man can have more of solid Happiness, Content and Satisfaction, then he has of Honesty, Justice, Temperance and Sobriety; for if instead of laying out his Wealth, to the Honour of that Being by whose Permission he enjoys it, he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther locks it up in his Coffers, or makes no other use of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51616:41"/>
same, than by furnishing himself with the means of Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Excess: If he lays it out upon sumptuous Furniture, numerous Attendants, in Gaming, Drunkenness, Sensuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Satisfaction of every other brutish Passion, you will find the Possessor of this kind of Happiness, a greater and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Object for your Pitty than your Emulation.</p>
               <p>However the Notion might be carried too far by the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks, in their Supposition of a perfect Apathy, yet undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were right in their founding True Felicity upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, or for that they placed the same in the Peace and Satisfaction of a calm and serene Mind, neither capable of an exalted Pride in the Enjoyment of Abundance, nor of Anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Perturbation in what the World calls Poverty.</p>
               <p>If this be the Criterion or adequate Measure of true Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, we shall find those who have been generally accounted happy, to be of all others the most miserable. You may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily conceive the wealthy Miser can have but little of this solid Peace and Tranquility; for what with his Pain and Care to encrease his Treasure, his denying himself the convenient and even necessary Supports of Life, together with the perpetual Disquiet and Anxiety that attends his Fear of losing what he has got; there is scarce an hour in the whole compass of his miserable Life that is truly happy; even his Rest is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing, like that of other Mens, but his Soul is like a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Sea, and his last Moments in his unwillingness to surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and leave his Muck behind him (setting aside his Thoughts of Futurity) openly declare his Misery.</p>
               <p>From him we may take a prospect of the Prodigal Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, the other President of mistaken Happiness, and here the genuine Consequences are both a disorder'd or infirm Body, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a perplex'd and disturb'd Mind: for however the make or temperament of some Mens Bodies gives them the opportunity of continuing a longer Course: yet their Souls are still perpetually clouded, and the tottering Carcass must at length fall a Victim to their adored <hi>Bacchus</hi> or admired <hi>Venus:</hi> and indeed, supposing the best of them that we can, we shall find nothing like a solid Satisfaction, even in the height of what they call Enjoyments. If we view them diverting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in Gaming; here we find (not to mention the impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Estates, the beggering themselves and Families) eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cross or adverse hit of Fortune transforms them into so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51616:42"/>
Furies, and raises such impetuous Storms and Tempests in their Breasts, as can be vented no other ways than in the most horrid Oaths, Execrations and Imprecations of the Divine Judgments upon themselves and others. If we inspect their dishonest Embraces, their Whoredoms and Adulteries, tho ne're so secure and secret, yet the loss of Reputation by disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very in some, the fear of Infection in others, or perhaps of a Conception: but above all, that Fear (which will very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly crowd in even upon the Infidel himself) that 'tis possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble there may be an after-reckoning; these, I say, do general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly combine to imbitter the Delights of their Lascivious Acts; but if the brutish Appetite be allay'd, if the Guilt be stiffled by an habitual Repetition, if neither Body nor Reputation suffer, which is a very great hazard, yet may we find many of the more thinking sort of these Persons declare their Dissatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and candidly acknowledge it one of the greatest Follies of which a wise Man can be guilty.</p>
               <p>If we follow them to a Debauch of Drinking, here we shall find even the Sensitive Appetite presently satiated, its Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction no longer lasting than the fleeting Gust; their Minds soon obnubilated, and themselves not Masters of their Actions, nor yet their Passions, their Conversation grows burthensome, and truly they have little left but Shape to difference them from Brutes: these, with the result of such a <hi>Crapula, viz.</hi> vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ensuing Hemicran's, loss of Appetite and general Lassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, will, I'm certain in the estimate of every judicious Man, make <hi>Bedlam</hi> preferrable to their <hi>Bacchanalia,</hi> and the Lunatick for the time a happier Man than the Drunkard.</p>
               <p>'Tis plain from hence, that we are mightily out in our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of Happiness, or the supposed Prosperity of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Adversity of Good Men:<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To all which may be superadded this, That the brightest and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Days of Fortune have ever clos'd in the blackest and most tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Nights of Sorrow: that the Plays of Libertines have always prov'd Comae Tragedies; and their pompous Masks finish'd in dismal Catastrophy's; nor can the Records of the whole World produce one Example of sinful greatness, that hath not either before, or at his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Adieu, by woful Experiment manifested the Truth of this Maxim,</hi> In Vertute Sola, Salus: <hi>or that none can ever arrive at the</hi> Elizium <hi>of true Felicity, who constantly pursue it through the Gardens of Sensuality, that the Rose of Happiness grows on the prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Stem of Vertue, and that the just Discharge of our Duties to God and Man, to the utmost of our Abilities, is the only means of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a durable Content and Satisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall conclude with this necessary Caution, That we take not too bold a Freedom in our Reflections upon Providence, or Repining at some particular Dispensations towards us: It is the greatest Imprudence we can be guilty of, to expect ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Vertue should be immediately rewarded, or Vice im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately punisht: for this would not only destroy a Life of future Retribution, but if Punishments were immediately to be inflicted upon Delinquents, our Obedience would cease to be a Vertue, as proceeding from our Fear more than our Choice.</p>
               <p>Besides, we are by no means to pass Sentence upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of God, without a Prospect of them from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the End: Providence is one entire System, nor can we judge of the parts, but in relation to the whole; for what at first we cou'd give no account of, we are very often brought to approve by a subsequent Course of Dispensations: and we do as frequently understand, that had our Desires been gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or our Expectations answer'd in some particular Cases, the same wou'd have prov'd troublesome, if we had not been quite ruin'd or undone by them.</p>

                  <salute>My very good Friend,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WHatever Success my last met with, I am embolden'd to believe my time not altogether mispent, 'tis not out of a Presumption that I am able to deliver any thing extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, or more than many others might say upon these weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Subjects: but out of I know not what kind of Belief and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, that you will more considerately peruse, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively examine them, as the Performances of a Friend (who you may easily assure your self writes neither for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Interest, nor Popular Applause, but truly and unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly with a pure Design of discovering the Truth) than if the same were deliver'd by those whose Interest we might judge it is to keep us under a slavish Subjection, and who make it the proper and sole business of their Lives, to furnish out such Maxims, Arguments and Precepts, as they themselves (too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them) are unmindful to observe; so that, what is much to be bewail'd, when Men look upon the Priests as of a quite different make from the rest of Mankind, neither subject to the same Desires, natural Inclinations and Passions of other Men: when they view them living as it were separate from the World, perpetually conversant in Prayer, Fasting, Religious Contemplation and Divine Meditations, they, by a kind of implicite Faith (especially the common People) rely upon the Certainty of the Things deliver'd to them, without ever seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously enquiring or searching into the Nature of the Truths themselves: Hence it is that the generality of them are no longer Religious, than that they find their Pastor to square his Life by his Doctrine, and every Immorality discover'd in their Teacher, they make the sufficient occasion of Absolving them, not only from their Regard or Respect to him, but even God himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:51616:43"/>Thus amongst some sensual inconsiderate Men, I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently met with such pitiful Argumentation as this. They knew a Dr. of Divinity that was Drunk: They heard another Swear: A third they found in Secret with a Prostitute: A fourth they saw Gaming: A fifth they heard was Covetous, and a miserable Oppressor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And presently follows this <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> All Religion in gross, is no more than Priest craft, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Divinity a well contriv'd Romance, the great and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Props of it are all presently shook to pieces, and our Belief of a God, his Providence and the Souls separate Existence or Independency, are now ridicul'd for meer Fables. The Sum of all is this, The Parsons Preach for Money, get many Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and grow Rich, whilst they in the mean time, till they discover'd the Cheat, were hindred from the Pursuit of their natural Desires, and kept under Apprehension of Invisible Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, a Life to come, and they know not what frightful Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears, Heaven and Hell, Devils and damned Spirits, which they now find to be a Dream: for since the slip of the Clergy-man has open'd their Eyes, they find nothing but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Time and Chance, say they, attends us all. And here the words of <hi>Solomon</hi> come pat to their purpose, which he gives us, as the natural Arguments of wicked Men for the overthrow of Religion:<note place="margin">Eccl. 3.18.</note> 
                  <hi>I said in my heart concerning the estate of the Sons of of Men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are Beasts: for that which befalleth the Sons of Men befalleth Beasts, even one thing befalleth them; as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea they have all one breath, so that a Man hath no preheminence above a Beast; for all is vanity. All go unto one place, all are of the dust: and all turn to dust again. Who knoweth the Spirit of Man that goeth upward, and the Spirit of the Beast that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth downward to the Earth? Wherefore I perceive that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better then that a Man should rejoyce in his own works, for that is his Portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is now become the common Language of the Libertine, and if the intestine Dictator Conscience, takes the advantage of some lucid Interval, and whispers them in the Ear with what's to come: their Hearts-ease is still ready, and a <hi>Post Mortem ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil est,</hi> or their Sempiternal Hush lulls all asleep.</p>
               <p>I wou'd by no means have you to take this, as a Reflection in general upon the Pastoral Function; for, God be thanked,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51616:44"/>
there are many of them as remarkable for their Learning, as conspicuous for their unfeigned Piety: and did their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries come up with some of the meanest of them in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Conduct of their Lives, they wou'd think it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable Grievance to their Natures, to be abridg'd their Liberty, or ty'd to the Exercise of almost any single Act of Mortification and Self-denial; whilst at the same time every little Immorality in these Men is lookt on through a Magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glass; and the same which they account a Venial Fault or <hi>Peccadillo</hi> in themselves, must be deemed in the other a Crime of the first magnitude, an unpardonable Transgression.</p>
               <p>Being oblig'd in prosecution of the following Discourse to remove what Difficulties I cou'd out of the way, and to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at least some of the mighty Obstacles of our Faith: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others I have been necessitated to touch upon the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, whom we are too prone to follow blindly, and when once our great Opinion of their Learning and Piety has placed them in the Chair of Infallibility; the first false step they make, at once subverts our Faith, and taking all before for granted which they deliver'd to us, we now dispute the Verity of those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines we had inbib'd from them.</p>
               <p>Bad Presidents are always very prevalent Contagions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst our Equals; but when we find our Pastors or our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, our Masters, our Governours, or our Princes infected with any manner of Vice, we quickly become their Apes, and readily excuse our selves, because we do but imitate those, whom we imagine to know better than our selves.</p>
               <p>Thus many Men have had their Faith stagger'd by a View of the Profaneness and Impiety of Learned and Great Men; by the dissolute Lives of the Gentry and Nobility in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where they live: as if these by their vitious Practices cou'd alter the Nature even of Good and Evil; or if it was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that Men immerst in Matter, tho' never so profoundly skill'd in Science, cou'd regulate their Lives by the Laws of God, whilst they contemn the Divine Aid, and regard not his Assistance. Instead of this, 'tis become the Fashion of the Town to ridicule Vertue, and render Vice as amiable as they can; and if they find it possible to prevail upon some simple Clergy-man (who is naturally as loose as themselves) to be Drunk, to Whore, to Game, to Curse and Swear profanely, there are many Men so extravagantly proud of such a Conquest
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51616:44"/>
over an hypocritical Sinner, as to think they give hereby a fatal stroke to all true Piety, as if the very Essence of God, the Condition of the Soul, and every other Sacred Truth, were by such trivial and childish Instances to be obliterated or wiped out.</p>
               <p>I have premis'd this by way of Anticipation, or to Caution you how requisite it is before you set up for a Libertine, to go upon sure grounds: for undoubtedly 'tis unbecoming any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender to Reason, to run a hazard, especially one of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, or to declare himself either openly or privately for the Cause of Atheism, till he hath positively assur'd himself, beyond contradiction, that there is no Superintendent Power takes notice of his Actions; or if there shou'd, that he is above the reach of his Justice, and that his last Breath will carry all into perpetual Oblivion; for if he goes not farther than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability that Matters may be so, yet if there remain the least doubt that they may not, he forfeits at once both his Reason and Security, and 'twill be a pitiful Satisfaction, that the greater part of the World have involv'd themselves with him in the same Misery.</p>
               <p>It is the less admirable that Men shou'd so very easily give up the Cause of Religion, who never examin'd their first Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; whose Faith is no otherwise founded than on the Custom of their Country, the Credit of their Ancestors, or the Example of those under whose Guardianship and Tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage they have been brought up: And truly, in one sense, what the Poet remarks is a certain Truth,

               <p>This is what I have thought necessary by way of Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to my Discourse of the Immortality, which I intend the subject of this present Letter: for having in the two former,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51616:45"/>
endeavour'd to establish those two great Truths of the Divine Being and his Providence, Order requires that I take notice how far we are concern'd, if we concede or admit the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Propositions. For if we lye under no Obligation to, or have no future Dependance upon God or his Providence, it is a Matter purely indifferent, whether we believe them or not; what Advantage can I have by my belief in God, if I am se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that he has left me to my own disposal, and inspects not any of my Actions? or why should I deny my self the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of my Desires, how exorbitant soever they may be, since I know the worst, and that if Death will at length come and put an end to my Delights, it will likewise finish all my Trouble and Disquiet?</p>
               <p>However I may resign up my own Reason, or betray the Weakness of my Judgment, I must confess to you, that when I have very often seriously reflected upon this Subject, and once admitted a Supream Intelligent and Powerful Cause of all Things, I presently found my self under a kind of irresistible Necessity, to believe our Souls must be Immortal: and the Supposition of a down right Necessity that it should be so, without any respect to Arguments, either Sacred or Profane, that it is so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> does at this time overcome me: for however short of Demonstration they may prove, we must take up with the most notorious Absurdity imaginable, if we perswade our selves that there can be an All-wise, Just, and Omnipotent God, and yet notwithstanding that Thefts, Rapines, Murthers, and all other the most egregious Vices shou'd go unpunish'd, both here and hereafter. However this be, the Result of my own Thinking, and a Consequence which it's possible you may not allow, I speak it not by any means to prepossess your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; neither do I desire you shou'd look upon the same, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Matter of Fact, or so much as Rational Evidence.</p>

               <p>Whoever makes a scrutinous Enquiry into their Sentiments, will find this the beloved Opinion, not only of our Modern profest Atheists, but of those also who have skreen'd themselves under the less harsh and more acceptable Name of Deists.</p>
               <p>If you think fit to pay any Deference to Men, not only on the account of their Sobriety, but for their profound Learning and Metaphisical Acquirements, the two following, I doubt not, are unquestionable for both I mean Dr. <hi>Moor</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Boyle:</hi> The first of them defines the Soul of Man (<hi>i.e.</hi> the Rational) to be an immaterial Substance, endow'd with Life and the Faculty of Motion, vertually containing in it Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Indiscerpibility. The judicious Esquire <note n="*" place="margin">History of Qualities and Forms</note> 
                  <hi>Boyle</hi> has been pleas'd to own, That he knew of nothing (naturally speaking) that was compos'd of Matter and a Substance di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stinct from Matter, except Man, who is made up of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material Form and a Humane Body.</p>
               <p>It were endless to cite the Opinions of all Learned Men, who have deliver'd their Sentiments about this Subject. I find in the general, with very little variation, they have concluded thus, That the Superior or Rational Soul in Man, is a most pure Substance, Immaterial, Penetrable and Indivisible, Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially Vital, Perceptive and Appetitive, animating an Humane organized Body.</p>

                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:51616:46"/>Before I set about the justifying this Definition, I conceive it requisite that we have a right understanding, not only that there is an essential Difference between ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Neither is it to be thought strange, That <hi>Cartes,</hi> who had deny'd the possibility of sensible Atoms, shou'd start this Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning Brutes for the support of his Hypothesis: for when he had allow'd but one Principle, both of Sense and Reason to Man, and endeavour'd to prove this Principle supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to any Power in Matter, when after this the whole stress of our Immortality was laid upon the Immateriality of the Soul, he did well enough foresee, that by granting Sense to Brutes, he must also grant them actuated by a Principle above Matter, and Immateriality being his grand Proof of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, they must necessarily come in with Man for a share in this Prerogative: To avoid which Absurdity, being at the same time unable to understand that meer Matter, however modify'd, shou'd be capable of Sensation, he fixes upon one as great, and tells us there is none but Man amongst the Creatures, that is both capable of Sense and Reason, and that Brutes are only some of the more curiously contriv'd Machins, devoid of Sense, Feeling or Perception.</p>
               <p>Thus much may indeed be said in the behalf of this great Man, That it is really unaccountable to Humane Reason that Matter shou'd be sensible: but yet it was too bold an Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, utterly to deny its possibility, when at the same instant we have a full Assurance that it is so.</p>
               <p>It is altogether as unintelligible, that Matter and Spirit shou'd influence, and have such mutual Commerce with each other as we experience in our selves. However inconsistent
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51616:46"/>
both may seem to our finite Understandings, they are by no means to be thought so with a Divine and Infinite Capacity or Power: upon which account, and the certain assurance that Brutes are capable of Sensation, those who allow'd hereof, but yet wou'd have Sense and Reason to arise from the same Source, were reduc'd to that miserable Subterfuge, That it was possible the Souls of Brutes were but so many particular Eradiations or Effluxes from the Spring of Life above, when and whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is any fitly prepar'd Matter capable to receive them, and to be actuated by them, to have a sence and fruition of themselves in it so long as it continues such, but so soon as ever those organized Bodies of theirs, by reason of their Indisposition, become incapable of being farther actuated by them, then to be resum'd again, and retracted back to their Original Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>In supposing thus we must believe, both a <hi>prae</hi> and <hi>post</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Existence of brutal Souls; but if this won't do, there are others who wou'd perswade us of the probability that the Souls of Brutes, as they are created out of nothing, may be annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the same Power, and so with as much likelyhood may the Soul of Man.</p>
               <p>These are some of the dangerous Consequences and Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies attending that monstrous Opinion, That Reason and Sensation are Affections of one and the same Soul. To remove which Difficulties, and in order to our arrival at a clearer Knowledge of our whole <hi>Compositum,</hi> I shall as briefly as I can, attempt a Proof that the Soul of Brutes, altho' sensible, is Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal.</p>
               <p>That Brutes are sensible (says a late <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>M. S.</hi>
                  </note> Author) we have the same certainty as one Man can have that another Man is sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, supposing that other Man were Dumb. I cannot feel the Impressions made upon another Man of Pain, Hunger and Thirst, but must judge of them by outward Indications: and I have all the same outward Indications that Brutes feel all these, as I have that any Man feels them; and therefore it wou'd be ridiculous to go about to prove this by particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
               <p>That the Brutish Soul is Material,<note place="margin">See <hi>Gibson's Epit. Anat.</hi>
                  </note> I come to understand because it is extended and divisible, being made up of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirits and the Arterial Blood their Vehicle, and by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets of the Nerves they are communicated from the Brain to

all the Sentient parts of the Body, which therefore are endow'd with the power of performing Animal Actions.</p>
               <p>If you object, That this will prove no more than that the Immaterial Substance is so closely united to the Material, that it perceives every impression made upon the Body. I reply, That we cou'd not then feel distinct Pains in several parts, but the Pain must be equally felt over the whole Body; for the Soul b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Recruit; but when warmth awakens them, whereby their Pores are opened, they can fast no longer than other Creatures: therefore if the Animal Life flies off by parts, which are again renew'd by Corporeal Nourishment, it is a clear Evidence that the Soul of Brutes, or Animal Life, is Corporeal; and by this we come to a plain and true Notion of Death, that it is not (as usually defin'd) a Separation of the Soul and Body, which is but a Consequence of Death but an absolute Extinguishment of the Animal Life or Vital Flame. For to suppose that meer Animals are a Compound of Matter and Spirit, and that Death is only a Separation of them, is to ridicule all the Natural Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for Man's Immortality, by making them hold as strong for the Immortality of Brutes; which is both against Divinity and Common Sense. And indeed, the reason why some Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians (who of all Men should admire most the wonderful Works of Creating Wisdom) have been Atheistically inclin'd, is, because they are able to demonstrate that Sense is made by Matter and Motion, and therefore have carelesly concluded Reason to spring from the same Principle, and all our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be accounted for by Mechanism: and those Men help much to the Confirmation of this Opinion, who assign the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Sensation to the Rational Soul, and allow Reason to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Animals; there is no Adversary to Religion, but will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily grant the Animal Life and Rational Soul to be the same thing; and that all Animals are Rational; but then he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns that the Animal Life is Corporeal: and therefore concludes that Rationality is no Argument either of Immateriality or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</p>

One wou'd think a little, very little Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son wou'd instruct Creatures that they cou'd not eat when their Mouths are sewed up, at least a trial might learn them that knowledge; yet stitch up the Mouth of a Ferret day after day, and for all that he'l as warmly pursue the Rabbits for his food, as if his Jaws were at liberty. Farthermore, Meer Animals must act according to their kind, when so acting is visibly their certain ruin. Take a Bull-dog and muzzle him, throw him Bones that he may find he cannot open his Mouth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Again, It is certain that young Birds bred in Trees, will starve with Meat before them if it be not put into their Mouths, whereas those whose Kind breed on the Ground, can never be taught to gape for their Food, but so soon as batch't betake themselves to seek out and pick up their food. These I say, with a thousand Instances of the like nature, are evident Marks of a Providential Wisdom, because they are Rational Actions, many of them at least perform'd not acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, but constantly, by Irrational Agents.</hi>

                  <hi>Understanding being got by a Series of Experiments, Observations or Information, therefore it is some old Arts are improv'd, some quite lost, some new ones found out, but all meer Animals act the same yesterday and to day; thus far they always went, and no farther: which fully proves they were originally compell d and limitted to act according to their Kind, and had nothing to do with Will or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It may be objected, That several sorts of Animals are very d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>cible Creatures, and learn several things, by the Discipline of Mankind, which wou'd make one ready to think that those Creatures have some degrees of Reason. To which, I say, thus far is prov'd that those Creatures do act artificially, and for ends, without Deliberation and Knowledge; and those being the chief ends for which they were made, we cannot reasonably suppose that they shou'd blindly act that part, and yet have the use of Reason in things of lesser moment. It must therefore be concluded, that the utmost extent of their Ability is to do, and not to know; and therefore tho' by the Impressions made upon the Senses, they may be forced to do what their Nature is capable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet this is all from the Senses, and Reason but begins where the Senses end. To do and to know why we do, proceed from different Principles: 'tis true, the most docible Creatures may mimick several things they see Men do, yet can they give us no Indication that they know why or to what end they do them: for that their Souls being Corporeal, it follows necessarily, that all their Motions must be made either by an External or Internal Force or Impulse; whereas Will and Reason can be no other than the Powers of a self-moving Principle, which is a spiritual immaterial Essence. Sense and Imagination can conceive nothing but what is Corporeal; and the highest Conceptions which depend on Sense, amount no higher than Imagination, which likewise is unable to receive any other than Corporeal Idea's: Nor can it reflect or make any Conclusions about what it perceives. So that Brutes may very well be thus far endow'd without any such thing as a Rational Exertion.</hi> For a farther Explanation hereof, I shall

For indeed from the beginning almost every Motion of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated Body, is stirred up by the Contact of the outward Object,</hi> viz. <hi>the Animal Spirits residing within the Organ are driven inward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stricken by the Object, and so (as we have said) constitute Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or Feeling, then like as a stood sliding along the banks of the shoar, is at last beaten back: so because this waving or inward turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of the Animal Spirits, being partly reflected from the common Sensory, is at last directed outwards, and is partly stretched forth even into the inmost part of the Brain, presently local Motion
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51616:49"/>
succeeds the Sension, and at the same time a Character being affixed on the Brain, by the sense of the thing perceiv'd, it impresses there Marks or</hi> Vestigia <hi>of the same for the Phantasie and the Memory then affected, and afterwards to be affected; but when as the Prints or Marks of very many Acts of this kind of Sensation and Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as so many Tracts or Ways are ingraven in the Brain, the Animal Spirits oftentimes of their own accord, without any other forewarning, and without the presence of an Exterior Object, being stirr'd up into Motion, forasmuch as the fall into the footsteps before made, represent the Image of the former thing, with which, when the Appetite is affected, it desiring the thing objected to the Imagination, causes spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous Actions, and as it were, drawn forth from an inward Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. As for Example sake; The Stomack of an Horse feeding in a barren Ground or Fallow-land, being incited by Hunger, stirs up and variously Agitates the Animal Spirits flowing within the Brain; the Spirits being thus moved by accident, because they run into the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps formerly made, they call to mind the former more plentiful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture fed on by the Horse, and the Meadows at a great distance: then the imagination of this desirable thing (which at that time is cast before it by no outward Sense, but only by the Memory) stops at the Appetite: that is, the Spirits implanted in the streaked Bodies are affected by that Motion of the Spirits flowing within the middle part or marrow of the Brain, who from thence presently after their formerly accustom'd manner, enter the Origines of the Nerves, and actuating the nervous System after their wonted manner, by the same Series produce local Motions, by which the hungry Horse is carry'd from place to place, till he has found out the imagin'd Pasture, and indeed enjoys that good the Image whereof was painted in his Brain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After this manner the sensible Species, being intromitted by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Exterior Organs in the more perfect Brutes, for that they affix their Characters on the Brain, and there leave them, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute the Faculties of Phancy and Memory, as it were Store-houses full of Notions; farther stirring up the Appetite into local Motions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Sensions, frequently they produce an habit of acting, so that some Beasts being taught or instructed for a long time, by the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous Incursions of the Objects, are able to know and remember many things, and learn manifold Works,</hi> i. e. <hi>to perform them by a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and continued Series and Succession of very many Actions.

Habits introduced by the Acts of the Senses, are sometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by other means to a greater degree of Perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Living Brutes are taught by Example, by the Imitation and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of others of the same, or of a divers kind, to perform certain more excellent Actions. Hence it is that the Ape so plainly imitates Man, that by some it is thought a more imperfect Species of him: for this Animal being extreamly mimical, as it is endow'd with a most caepactous and hot Brain, it imitates to an hair almost all the Gestures that it happens to see presently, with a ready and expeditious composing of its Members, and is furnisht with a notable Memory, and retains all its Tricks which it hath once acted, very firmly after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, being wont to repeat them at its pleasure. Yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tis very clear and apparent, that Brutes are directed to all things which belong to the Defence and Conservation of the</hi> Individuum, <hi>and that are to be done for the Propagation of their Kinds by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Instinct, as it were a Law or Rule fixed in their Hearts, when as therefore we behold for these ends, ordained by Divine Providence, Brutes to order their Matters wisely, and as it were by Counsel, no Man esteems this the Work of Reason, or any Liberal Faculty; for they are led into these Enterprises by a certain Predestination, rather than by any proper Vertue or Intention.</hi>

               <p>Having given you this Account of the Soul of Brutes, prov'd the same a Corporeal, Divisible Substance, whose peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence is in the Blood and Spirits, and evinced their knowledge not to exceed the powers of Sensation and Imagination, it is time that we return to discourse of the Rational Soul of Man; and if it can be discover'd that there is a Principle of Action in him which proceeds from a different way of Operation than Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation doth, and that there are such Operations of this Soul which are not Imaginations, it will be then as clear that there is a Principle in Man higher than Matter and Motion, and impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, without a spiritual immaterial Being, to solve those Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in him which thus transcend the Power of Imagination.</p>

               <p>Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his Notes upon <hi>Thessalonians, v.</hi> 23. says Man consists of three Parts: First the Body, which denotes the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51616:50"/>
Flesh and Members. Secondly the Vital Soul, which Animal and Sensitive Soul is common to Man and Brute. Thirdly Spirit, which is the Rational Soul. This Division he confirms by the Testimony of Heathen Authors and ancient Fathers. So that those who disregard the Scriptures, may in these admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Authors be furnisht with other Authorities; but those who do, may consider what the Apostle saith in the foremention'd Text, <hi>viz. I pray God your whole Body, Soul and Spirit be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</hi> to which we may add what he says in another place,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.12.</note> 
                  <hi>The Word is sharper then a two edged Sword, piercing even to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding asunder of Soul and Spirit, and of the Joynts and Marrow.</hi> The meaning whereof is, Let things be never so closely united, God can separate them; but then they must be in their nature separable, or else it implys a Contradiction. So that if the Soul and Spirit are separable, we have gain'd our Point; if they are not, the Apostle has told us that can be, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be. But further; This Truth that there is two distinct Souls in Man, is by the Apostle demonstrated from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Internal Sense: <hi>I find</hi> (saith he) <hi>a Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7.21, 22, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>that when I would do good evil is present with me, for I delight in the Law of God after the inward Man. But I see another Law in my Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, warring against the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into captivity to the Law of Sin, which is in my Members. So then with my Mind I my self serve the Law of God, but with the Flesh the Law of Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what can be more expressive of two several percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Souls in Man,<note place="margin">See the Discourse of Ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational Souls.</note> whose Natures and whose Laws are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to each other? But perhaps you'l say, These contrary Laws do indeed arise because Man is a Compound of contrary Natures, yet there is but one perceptive Nature in him: but that Nature having the several Faculties of Reason and Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and being united to Flesh, whereby the Sensitive Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may be gratify'd, hence arises the War between Sense and Reason. To which I answer, Thus far then we are agreed, that Sense is the Source of all Carnal Delights, Pains and Aversions, therefore Sense is no Faculty of the Spirit, or all Carnal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, Lusts and Passions spring from the Spirit: and what excellent sence would this make the Apostle speak, <hi>I find a Law in my Mind warring against the Law of my Mind; so then with the Mind I my self serve the Law of God, but with the Mind the Law of Sin:</hi> for if Sense be a Faculty of the Mind, the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51616:51"/>
Laws of Sense are are as much the Laws of the Mind as the Laws of Reason.</p>
               <p>The Soul and Spirit, by reason of their close unaccountable Union, have also unaccountable mutual Influences upon each other; but for all that, their contrary Natures are very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable: and to make Sense and Reason Faculties of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is to make the Spirit as the Man, a Compound of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Natures; for that Sense and Reason are of contrary Natures, is discernable from the natural and constant strugglings and contentions between them. Secondly, From the natural Fruit they bring forth, which is certainly contrary if Good and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil are so: wherefore we may with all imaginable certainty, affirm the Souls of all meer Animals, and the Sensitive Soul of Man, to be Corporeal, but the Rational Soul of Man to be truly a Spiritual Immaterial Substance, if there were not such a Substance in him distinct from the Sensitive Soul of Brutes, and a Power Superiour to Sensation, we might reasonably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogate with the Judicious <hi>Willis,</hi>

               <p>Those who hold no difference between the Soul of Man and Brutes, with respect to Essence, and at the same time will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Sacred Authority, wou'd do well to consider whether it be reasonable to think the latter were endow'd with that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Spiraculum,</hi> which the former was honour'd with in his Creation: if they think it reasonable, they strike at the <hi>Mosaic</hi> Relation; if they do not, let them tell me what that <hi>Spiracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> was, if not the Rational Spirit. And indeed, if this alone were well consider'd, we shou'd hear no more of the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality of Brutes, from those who acknowledge the Truth of Revelation.</p>
               <p>But farther; That this Reasonable Soul is a Spiritual Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Substance, we have this to alledge, for that it is Rational
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51616:51"/>
and has a freedom of Choice, neither of which can possibly belong to Matter, for all the Motions of Matter are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily made, no Choice but Force must make its Motion, and that Force must be immediate, for Matter moves no longer than the Impulse lasts: but to deliberate and judge of a Train of Consequences, is no immediate impulsion of Matter, for those Consequences are not yet in Being, but only such as will be upon our acting thus or thus; nay, perhaps only such things as may, but never will be; but to choose to act (as such power we have, and every Man feels it within himself) purely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to those Consequences, is many times to act in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all the immediate and strong Impresses of Matter; and hence it is apparent, that neither Will nor Reason do belong to Matter, but to something vastly different.</p>
               <p>Again, The Animal Spirits make no other Impression on the Brain, than as things appear not always as they are, which Error is corrected; yes, you'l say, but 'tis corrected by the Senses themselves. But what puts the Senses in the way and method to correct themselves? If the Senses are their own directing Power, then all Creatures that are alike sensible wou'd be alike knowing; and meer Animals wou'd be daily finding out new Arts and Inventions as well as Man. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to give the least shadow of a Reason why it should be otherwise, unless we allow a Principle in Man which Brutes have not: we see, except Man, all Creatures of the same kind run in one constant and setled Method, whilst he is not only learning from every thing he sees, but invents how to learn and try the Truth or Falshood of this or that Invention by Experiments; and sometimes he finds himself in the right, sometimes in the wrong: Now, tho' in these Cases the Truth or Falshood of this or that Invention is proved by the Senses, yet the Invention preceded the Proof, and therefore could not be from the Information of the Senses. Besides, 'tis yet more evident those Inventions are not from the Senses, but from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Principle, because the same are sometime, false, and will not hold; but when we come to prove them, our Senses will bring in no such Appearances: For altho' we know nothing but a <hi>posteriori</hi> from the Operations and Effects of Things, yet from visible Operations and Effects, we can consider and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son about the Nature of the Invisible Operator, as from the Beauty and Order of the Universe, we reason that there must
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51616:52"/>
be a mighty Wise and Invisible Power that framed and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues the same. Now the Impressions of Matter upon Sense go no farther than so these Appearances are, and here of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we should ever rest, had we no other Principle but Matter, and cou'd never enquire how or why things come to be so; but when we advance to the Notion of an Invisible Operator, then certainly we outfly our Senses, unless our Eyes are so good as to see an Invisible Object: But suppose there is no such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Object, but that all our Notions concerning such a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are but meer <hi>Chimaera's,</hi> let us for Argument sake suppose all that, however whether the Notion of an invisible Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Operator be true or false, so much is true, that there is such a Notion amongst Men, and that it is a full Evidence that there is an incorporeal Principle in Man, because Matter cannot possibly impress or be imprest with any other but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Idea's; therefore were Man's whole <hi>Compositum</hi> pure Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he cou'd not possibly stir beyond material Idea's, and the World had never heard of Immaterial Substance. To confirm this, I shall here add the Opinion of one whose Sentiments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other Matters I have elsewhere made bold with.</p>

                  <hi>The Considerations</hi> (saith he) <hi>which may be alledg'd in favour of the Soul's Immortality, are either Physical or Moral: The former are such as arise from the Nature of the Soul her self, and do all of them seem to refer to this one Capital Argument, The Reasonable Soul of Man is Immaterial, and therefore Immortal: The reason whereof is, what wants Matter wants likewise Parts into which it might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted or dissolved; and what is incapable of being dissolved, must of necessity always continue to be what it is: for whatever is of a Nature free from the Conditions of Matter or Body, doth neither carry the Principles of Dissolution in it self, nor fear them from External Agents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are but two ways comprehensible by the Understanding, how any thing that hath Existence in Nature can perish; the one is by the Exolution and Dissipation of the Parts of which it was composed; the other by an absolute Adnibilation of its Entity, as the Schoolmen phrase it. The former way of destruction is peculiar to Corporeals, and the latter may be competent to Incorporeals: But to argue</hi> à pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si, ad esse, <hi>that God doth, or will adnihilate any thing, because it as in his power, is much below any good Logician to infer: nor are we to suppose any Innovation in the general state of things; but that the Course of the Universe doth constantly and invariably proceed in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51616:52"/>
the same manner or tumour of method, which was at first instituted by the Wisdom of the Creator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to prove that there is a power in us above the sensitive Soul or independent of Matter, notwithstanding this great Man was in some things tainted with the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Principles, he thus rightly argues, <hi>That if all our Cognition doth proceed originally from our Senses, as is affirm'd by</hi> Aristotle <hi>in his Maxim of</hi> Nihil in intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectu, &amp;c. <hi>and that Intellection is made by Analogy, by Composition, Division, Ampliation, Extenuation, and the like ways of managing the Species or Images of things immitted into the common Sensory by the External Senses; then certainly we can have no knowledge of any thing whereof we have no Image, and consequently without Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is no Intellection; so that in fine, to imagine and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand a Thing will be all one; whereas to answer this we may affirm, that no Corporeal Image or Species is ever receiv'd into the Mind, and that pure Intellection as well of a Corporeal as Incorporeal thing is made without any material Image or Species at all. As for Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, to that indeed is requir'd the presence of some Corporeal I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to which the Mind might apply it self, because there can be no Imagination but of Corporeal things, and yet nevertheless that Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Image doth not enter into the Mind. The truth is, the Intellect also makes use of Images conceiv'd by the Phancy (and therefore called Phantasms) yet only as certain means or degrees, that progressing through them, it may at length attain the knowledge of some things which it afterwards perceives as sequester'd, and in a manner subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from those Phantasms: but this is that which doth sufficiently argue its being Immaterial, because it carrieth it self beyond all Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges material, and comes to the Science of some things of which it hath no Phantasms.</hi>

                  <hi>All the particular Knowledges that Man hath, or can have, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning finite and compleat Entities (except only the Notion of Being) are only certain comparisons or respects between particular things; but of respect there can be no Image or Representation at all in the Phancy, and therefore our Knowledge is without Images. All the particular Notions we have (except of Being) do belong to some one of the ten Praedicaments, all which are so manifestly respective, that no Man doubteth them to be so: In particular, Substance hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to Being: Quantity doth consist in a respect unto Parts: Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath a respect unto that Subject which is denominated from it: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Passion result from the Union of Quality and Substance: Relation denoteth the respect betwixt the</hi> Relatum <hi>and</hi> Correlatum:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51616:53"/>
Ubi <hi>and</hi> Quando <hi>arise from Substance consider'd with the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Place and Time: Situation is from the respect of parts to the whole: Habit is a respect to the Substance wherein it is, as being the Propriety by which it is well or ill, conveniently or inconveniently affected, in regard of its own Nature. If you question the verity of the foregoing Assertion, exercise your Mind in seriously reviewing all these things that have been derived from the Senses, and see if you can find among them any such thing as we call a respect; it hath neither Figure nor Colour, nor Sound, nor Odor, nor Taste, and so cannot possibly be represented to the Sense or Imagination: hence, I think, there is no need to doubt that the Notions of things in the Intellect or pure Understanding, are extreamly different from whatsoever is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Mind by the mediation of the Senses, and so that the Intellect hath a knowledge of some things independent of Corporeal I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages or Idea's. For in simple Imagination the Mind doth always apply it self to the thing speculated, or the Image rather of that thing; but in pure Intellection in quitteth the Image, and converteth it self upon it self; the former Act being still accompany'd with some labour and contention of Mind, the latter free, easie and instantaneous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now in the Phancy of Beasts, there is always a Conjunction of the Image of that particular good or harm they have formerly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from such or such things with the Images of the things themselves, which is all that can be said to render the subtilest of them Conscious, and is indeed the Cause of all those so much admir'd Effects called Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathys and Antipathys amongst Animals of different kinds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another sort of Actions evincing the Soul's Immateriality, are those whereby we do not only form to our selves Universals or Universal Notions, but also understand the reason of Universality it self; for it being evidently impossible that any Corporeal thing should be exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all material Conditions and Differences of Singularity, as Magnitude, Figure, Colour, Time, Place,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and undeniably cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Understanding hath a power to divest them of all and every one of those Conditions and Circumstances, and to speculate them in that abstracted state devoy'd of all Particularities, it follows necessarily, that the Soul which hath this power so to abstract them, must it self be exempt from all Matter, and of a Condition more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent than to be confin'd to material Conditions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To these few Reasons of the Immateriality of the Humane Soul, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed from the Excellency of her Operations, I might here add a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of others of the same Extraction and equivalent Force, as in particular that of the Existence of Corporeal Natures in the Soul by
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51616:53"/>
the power of Apprehension: that of her drawing from Multitude to Unity: her apprehension of Negations and Privations: her contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Contraries without Opposition: her Capacity to move without being moved her self: the Incompossibility of opposite Propositions in the Understanding, and sundry others, the least whereof is of Evidence and Vigour sufficient to carry the Cause against all those Enemies to her Immortality who wou'd degrade her from the Divine Dignity of her Nature, to an equality with the Souls of Brutes, that are but certain Dispositions of Matter, and obnoxious to Dissolution upon change of the same by contrary Agents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But farther, There is no Corporeal Faculty but what is confin'd to the Perception of only some one certain</hi> Genus <hi>of things, as in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar the Sight to Visibles, the Hearing to Sounds,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and tho' the Imagination seems to be extended to very many kinds, yet all those are contain'd under the Classis of Sensibles, and thence it comes that all Animals, endow'd only with Phantasie, are addicted only to Sensibles, no one affecting the knowledge of any thing which falleth not under the Sense: but the Intellect alone is that which hath for its Object,</hi> Omne verum, <hi>and as the Schoolmen speak,</hi> Ens ut Ens, <hi>every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Universe, and therefore hath no mixture of Matter, but is wholly free from it and Incorporeal, a Truth so clearly revealed by the Light of Nature, that</hi> Anaxogoras <hi>and</hi> Aristotle <hi>both subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,</hi> Esse intellectum necessario <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>That Incorporeals are within the Orb of the Intellects Activity, and do not escape the apprehension of this unbounded and universal Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, needs no other proof besides that of our own sublime Speculations concerning the Nature of God, of Intelligencies, of Angels, of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soul, and whatever else belongs to the Science of Metaphysics, which teacheth us to abstract from all Matter and Quantity. Nay, I presume it will not be accounted Paradoxical in me to affirm, that Immaterial Objects are most genuine and natural to the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, especially since</hi> Cartes <hi>hath irrefutably demonstrated that the knowledge we have of the Existence of the Supream Being, and of our own Souls, is more certain, clear, and distinct than the knowledge of any Corporeal Nature whatever, according to that Canon of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas, Nulla res qualiscunque est, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Moral Considerations, usually brought in defence of the Soul's Incorruptibility, are principally three:</hi> 1. <hi>The Universal Consent of Mankind.</hi> 2. <hi>Man's inseparable Appetite of Immortality.</hi> 3. <hi>The Justice of God in rewarding good Men, and punishing evil Men,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51616:54"/>
after Death. Now as</hi> Cicero <hi>judiciously observes,</hi> Omni in re, consentio omnium Gentium, Lex naturae putanda est; <hi>and thus the Notion of the Soul's Immortality is so implanted in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Mind of Man, that whoso denies it doth impugn his own Natural Principles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for that common Objection the Alteration observable in Infancy and old Age, we may answer with the great Master of Nature</hi> (<hi>at least one so esteem'd by some</hi>) Innasci, autem Intellectus videtur, &amp; substantia quaedam esse, nec corrumpi, nam si corrumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur quidem id maxime fieret ab habitatione illa, quae in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nectute contingit: nunc autem res perinde fit ac in ipsismet sensuum instrumentis; si enim Senex, Occulum Juvenilem reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peret, non secus ac ipse Juvenis videret, unde &amp; Senectus non ex eo est, quod quidquam passa Anima sit; fed quod simile ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid ac in Ebrietate morbisque eveniat, ipsaque intelligendi &amp; contemplandi functio, propter aliquid aliud interius corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum marcescit, cum ipsum interim cujus est passionis expers ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neat. <hi>Which words consider'd, we have good reason to affirm, that all that Change which the</hi> Epicurean <hi>would have to be in the Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Soul or Mind, during the growth of the Body in Youth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of it in old Age, doth not proceed from any Mutation in the Soul it self, but some other Interiour thing distinct from it, as the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or Organ of the common Sense, the Brain, which being well or ill affected, the Soul it self suffereth not at all, but only the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of it flourish or decay accordingly; for as the Philosopher re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, if it were possible to give an old Man a young Eye, and a young Imagination, his Soul would soon declare by exquisite vision and quick reasoning, that it was not she that had grown old, but her Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans; and that she is capable of no more Change from the impairment of the Body, than is usually observed to arise</hi> (pro tempore) <hi>from a fit of Drunkenness, or some Disease of the Brain: so that it is evident from hence, that whatever Change Men have thought to be in the Soul by reason of that great decay, generally attending old Age, to not really in the Soul, but only in the Imagination and the Organs thereof, which are not so well dispos'd as in the Vigour of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In like manner are we to understand that the Soul, when the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers grow cold and mortify'd, doth then indeed instantly cease to be in them, yet is not cut off by piece-meal, or diminisht and gradually dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but the whole of it remains in so much of the Body as yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues warm and perfused by the Vital Heat, until ceasing longer to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate the principle Seat of its Residence, whether the Brain or Heart,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51616:54"/>
it at length bids adieu to the whole, and withdraweth it self entire and perfect: so that Death is an Extinction of the Vital Flame, and not of the Soul, which, as</hi> Solomon <hi>calls it, is the brightness of the Everlasting Light, the unspotted Mirror of the Power of God, and the Image of his Goodness, and being but one, she can do all things, and remaining in her self, she maketh all things new.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The like may be said with relation to those failings observable in swooning fits, which fall not upon the Soul, but on the Vital Organs, at those times render'd unfit for the uses and actions to which they were framed and accommodated: and if the Causes of such failings shou'd happen to be so violent as to bring on a sudden Death, then the Soul must indeed depart; yet not by reason of any dissolution in its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, or imbecility in it self, but for want of those dispositions in the Organs of Life, by which she was enabled to enliven the Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if (saith this Author) in such a Thesis or Proposition, which is not capable of being evinced by Geometrical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, there can yet be expected such substantial and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Reasons, Physical or Moral, as may suffice to the full e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment of its Truth in the Mind of a reasonable Man: If this be granted, I thence argue that the Soul is an Immortal Substance, and that its Immortality is not only credible by Faith or upon Authority Divine, but also demonstrable by Reason, or the Light of Nature.</p>
               <p>To be convinc'd of our Immortality, and satisfactorily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded whether or no there is any thing in us, which shall not perish with the Life we are shortly to lay down, is of so great and so important Consequence, that I can readily expect your forgiveness, if I trespass upon your Patience, and inlarge a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle farther upon this weighty Argument.</p>
               <p>That there is somewhat in us, essentially differing from, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and superior to other Animals, or that the Rational Soul of Man bears no Analogy with the Souls of other Creatures, is farther elegantly toucht upon in these words of Dr. <hi>Willis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Eminency of the Rational Soul above the Brutal or Corporeal,</hi>

                  <hi>shines clearly by comparing either both as to the Objects, and to the chief Acts or Modes of Knowing. As to the former, when<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>mary, material or immaterial, true or fictitious, real or intentional. The Acts or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Knowledge common to either Soul, are vulgarly accounted these three; to wit, Simple Apprehension, Enunciation, and Discourse:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51616:55"/>
How much the power of the Rational excels the other which is Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, we shall consider,</hi> 1. <hi>The knowing Faculty of the Corporeal Soul is Phantasie or Imagination, which being planted in the middle part of the Brain, receives the sensible Species first only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed on the Organs of Sense, and from thence by a most quick irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of the Spirits deliver'd inwards, and so apprehends all the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Corporeal Things according to their Exterior Appearances, which notwithstanding, as they are perceived only by the Sense (which is often deceived) they are admitted under an appearing, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways under a true Image or Species: for so we imagine the Sun no bigger than a Bushel, the Horizon of the Heaven and the Sea to meet: the Stars not to be far distant from us in the Horizon, that in respect of us there are no Antipodes. Farther, we may think the Image in the Glass, or in a Fountain delineates it self, that the Echo it self is a Voice coming from some other place; that the Shoar moves when we are upon the Water; yea, and many other things being receiv'd by the Sensories, whilst Phansie is the only guide, seem far otherwise than indeed they are. But the Intellect presiding o're the Imagination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds all the Species deposited in it self, discerns or corrects their Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities or Hypocrisies, sublimes the Phansie there drawn forth, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vesting it from Matter, forms Universal Things from Singulars. Moreover, it frames out of these some other more sublime Thoughts, not competent to the Corporeal Soul, so it speculates and considers both the Nature of every Substance, and abstracted from the Individuals of Accident,</hi> viz. <hi>Humanity, Rationality, Temperance, Fortitude, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poriety, Spirituality,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>being carried higher it contemplates God, Angels, it Self, Infinity, Eternity, and many other Notions far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from Sense and Imagination. And thus as our Intellect in these kind of Metaphisical Conceptions, makes things almost wholly naked of Matter, or carrying it self beyond every sensible Species, considers or beholds them immaterial and immortal, because if this aptness or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position were Corporeal, as it cou'd conceive nothing Incorporeal by Sense, so wou'd it suspect and deny that there were any such thing in the World.</hi> 2. <hi>It appears clearly that Phansie, or the knowing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Corporeal Soul, doth not only apprehend simple things, but also compose and divide many things at once, and from thence makes Enuntiations because living Brutes in various Objects together, which are for food, discern things convenient from others inconvenient or unfit; moreover, they choose out of these, things grateful, before others less grateful, and get them sometimes by force, sometimes by cunning, and as it were by stealth. A Dog knows a Man at a great distance,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51616:55"/>
if he be a Friend he runs to him and fawns on him; if an Enemy and fearful, he barks at him, or flies at him; but if armed, or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him, he flies away from him. These kind of Propositions the Brutes easily conceive, forasmuch as some Species of the sensible Thing being newly admitted, meets with Species of one thing or other before laid up in the Memory, or being suggested by a natural Instinct, asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates with them, or repulses them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But indeed, how little is this in respect to the Humane Intellect, which not only beholds all Enuntiations conceived by the Phansie, but judges them whether they be true or false, congruous or incongruous, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and disposes them into Series of Notions accommodated to Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or Practice. Moreover, it restrains the Phansie it self, being too unstable, and apt to wander through various Phantasies, it calls it away from these or those Conceptions, and directs it to others; yea, it keeps it within certain limits at its pleasure, least it should expatiate and divert too much from the thing propos'd, which without perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture clearly indicates a Superiour Soul in Man, that moderates and governs all the Faculties and Acts of the Corporeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again; The Humane Intellect not only eminently contains every Vertue of the Phansie, but from the Species perceived in it, deduces many other Thoughts altogether unknown to the Sense, and which the Phansie of it self cou'd no way imagine: For besides that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the formal Notions of Corporeal Things, and abstracted from all Matter, and attributes to them Praedicates meerly intentional, yea and understands Axioms or first Principles alone, and as it were by a proper Instinct, without recourse to Corporeal Species, the same Mind also beholds it self by a reflected Action, it supposes it self to think, and thence knowing a proper Existency not to be perceiv'd, neither by Sense nor Phantasie, when in the mean time neither Sense nor Imagination (of which no Images are extant) do perceive themselves to know or imagine. The Rational Soul comprehends moreover, as it were by its own proper Light, God to be Infinite and Eternal, that he ought to be worshipped, that Angels and Spirits do inhabit the World, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Places beneath the Earth, that there are Places of Beatitude and Punishment, and many other Notions meerly Spiritual, by no means to be learnt from Sense or Phantasie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Prerogatives of the Rational Soul, and the differences from the other Sensitive and Corporeal, may be yet farther noted, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Acts of Judgment and Discourse or Ratiocination, which it puts forth more perfectly, and oftentimes demonstratively; when these kind of Acts from this power in the Brutes are drawn forth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly, and only analogically. We have already declar'd the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51616:56"/>
that Brutes can do, and how far they can go towards the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Reasoning and Deliberation, through innate Faculties and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Habits: which truly, if the whole be compar'd with the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Humane Intellect and its Scientific Habits, it will hardly seem greater than the Drop of a Bucket to the Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For to say nothing of that Natural Logick, by which any one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd with a free and perspicatious Mind probably, and sometimes most certainly concludes concerning Doubtful Things, or Things sought after, if we mind how much the Humane Mind, being adorned by Learning, and having learnt the Sciences and Liberal Arts, is able to work, understand, and search out, it wou'd be thought, tho' in a Humane Body, to be rather living with Gods or Angels; for indeed here may be consider'd the whole Encyclopaedia, or Circle of Arts and Sciences, which (excepting Divinity) have been the Product or Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Humane Mind, and plainly argues the Workman, if not Divine, to be at least a Particle of Divine Breath, to wit, a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Substance, wonderfully Intelligent, Immaterial, and which therefore for the future must be Immortal. It would be tedious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse the subtil Wiles of Logick, and the extreamly curious Web of Notions, or of the Reason of Essences or Beings, where the things of Natural Philosophy being unfolded by their Causes, are dissected as it were to the Life, the most pleasant Speculations, the profound Theorems, or rather Caelestial, of the Metaphysics or Supernatural Things; yea, and the grand Mysteries of other Learning, first found out by Humane Industry: But above the rest, is it not truly amasing to see the most certain Demonstrations of the Mathematicks, and therefore akin and greatly alluding to the Humane Mind, its Problems and Riddles, how difficult soever, to be extricated with no Labour, yea, and many things of it attain'd, and most glorious Inventions? What is it below a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy, that Algaebra, from one Number or Dimension, which at first was uncertain and unknown, being placed, shou'd find out the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of another altogether unknown? What shall I say concerning the Proportions of a Circle, a Triangle, a Quadrangle, and other Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and of their Sides and Angles variously measurable amongst themselves, being most exactly computed? What besides that the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Intellect having learnt the Precepts of Geometry and Astronomy, takes the Spaces of inaccessible Places and their Heights, the Floor or Breadth of any Superficies, and the Contents of Solids, yea, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions of the whole Earthly Globe: measures exactly the Spaces of Hours and Days, the Times of the Year, the Tropicks by the Progress only of a Shadow; yea, it measures the Orbs, Magnitudes, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51616:56"/>
of the Sun and Stars, for a long time to come calculates and exactly foretels their Risings and Settings, Motions and Declinations, and Aspects one to another. We shou'd want time, shou'd we set about to enumerate the several portentous Things, either of the Practise or Speculation in the Mathematicks: Then, if passing over to Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks, we consider the several Works and Inventions of Men, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made, there will be no place for doubting but that the Humane Soul, which can so curiously understand, invent, find out, and effect, I had almost said create, Things so stupendious, must needs be far different from the Brutal, and, as before is said, Immortal: especially for that living Brutes obtain only a few and more simple Notions and Intentions of Acting, yea, and those always of the same kind, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined but to one thing altogether ignorant of the Causes of Things; they know not Rights or Laws of Political Society; they are ignorant of every the most intelligent Mechanic Art; neither can they, unless taught by Imitation, till how to number Three. Since therefore, in few words, we have plainly detected in Man, besides the Corporeal Soul, such as is common with Brutes, the prints of another meerly Spiritual, we have abundant reason to conclude the same Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, have I endeavour'd to prove the Reasonable Soul a Substance independent of Corporiety, and that it is not only possible, but certain, that unless it shall please the Power who at first infus'd it, to annihilate its Being, it must outshine the Extinction of the Vital Flame, and can receive no Injury in its Substance, by the Destruction of that Body in which it had its Residence.</p>
               <p>The Arguments I have brought, are such, whose Solidity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man may judge of, who is capable of a very little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection or serious Application of Mind: Tho' they are not all my own, yet are they such as naturally arise from a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical or Physical Enquiry, such as have been approved by the far greater number of Learned Men, and such whose Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it is impossible to withstand, without some secret relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy in our own Minds, and without ever being able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate that they are not true. The Sum of all that has been said upon this Matter will rest here, That since there is nothing more certain than this, that there is a Power in Man superiour to that of all meer Animals, and superiour also to that Power which Man himself hath as related to those Creatures, in their Capacity to be Sensible and to Imagine: It is necessary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51616:57"/>
seriously, what that Power can be, and in what Subject the same is plac'd. If you say you apprehend it to be no more than a meer Temperament, a Harmony, or you know not what kind of Disposition resulting from the Matter of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, I wou'd then beg you to remove my Doubts, and to satisfie me how it comes to pass that Brutes are not thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd with the same? For if this high Prerogative of Reason had its dependence, as Sense and Imagination have, upon a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation or Mechanic Structure of the Animal Organs, most certainly other Creatures must be alike dignify'd whose Brains bear so exact Affinity, and in the Parts of which there is so great Analogy, Resemblance, or Similitude: For here your Anatomical Disquisition will inform you, that if you consider its outward Coverings and Vessels, they have (at least some of them) the like Membranes, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Dura</hi> and <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> the like Veins, Arteries and Nerves: If you consider its Division, there are the like Hemispheres or Lobes, the like Gyrations or Convolutions in its Surface, the same double Substance, <hi>viz.</hi> Cortical or Marrowy, the same common Basis, the <hi>Medulla Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longata:</hi> If you consider its inward Substance, the like Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles, Glandules, <hi>Pinealis</hi> or <hi>Pituitaria, Nates</hi> and <hi>Testes,</hi> the <hi>Fornix,</hi> the <hi>Infundibulum,</hi> the <hi>Corpora Striata, &amp;c.</hi> the like make also of the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> where Sense and Motion, as also the Passions and Instincts meerly Natural,<note place="margin">According to <hi>Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The Brain then of Brutes thus exactly corresponding with the Humane, and the Sensations being alike Mechanically per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in both, since the former show us not the least foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of any Capacity to Will or Reason, which are so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently conspicuous in the latter; the Power which exerts the same, must be more than Temperament, or any Priviledge of Conformation, which is so near alike in both, and which in its greatest Latitude can reach no higher than Sense, Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Memory and Appetite: for it seems, saith the Learned Doctor, that the Imagination is a certain Undulation or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of the Animal Spirits, begun more inwardly in the middle of the Brain, and expanded or stretched out from thence on every side, towards its Circumference. On the contrary, the Act of the Memory consists in the Regurgita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Flowing back of the Spirits from the Exterior compass
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51616:57"/>
of the Brain towards its middle. The Appetite is stirred up for that the Animal Spirits being some how moved about the middle of the Brain, tend from thence outwardly towards the Nervous System.</p>
               <p>Now till you can make it out, how or in what Mechanic Structure or Disposition of the Brain and Animal Organs the Rational Faculty lyes conceal'd, and prove to us by Dissecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that there is any such part in the Humane Brain, whereof the more perfect Brutes are destitute, and wherein 'tis likely the Acts of Reason shou'd be perform'd. Till this, I say, be done, it becomes you as a Man, as well as a Religionist, to believe with more than three parts of the Learned, as well as the unlearned World, That the Principle of Reason is placed in a Spiritual Indivisible Substance, or in something which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther depends on, nor can be the Result of any Material Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
               <p>Let me beg you (Dear Sir) to consider throughly the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Paragraph. If it contains a Truth, I am sure 'tis one of the highest Importance, and I must solemnly protest to you, that it seems to me almost a perfect Demonstration. It is no ways improbable but I may be deceived; which if you sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, or believe, let me request you, or some of your more Learned Friends the A—ts, to furnish me with some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge, That Mankind have been for some Thousand years impos'd on, deluded and abus'd, and that the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Will and Reason are at length intelligibly solv'd, without the Supposition either of Spirituality or Immortality.</p>
               <p>I must confess 'tis some Mens Interest that the Rational, as well as Sensitive Soul, should be Material, and that both shou'd have their entire dependance on the Organization of the Brain. But it is no Man's desire, nor yet his belief, that it is so, can make it so, if it be otherwise. You your self must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it a very pitiful and weak Argument, that because you have reason to fear your Soul should be Immortal, or for that you wou'd by no means have it so, therefore it is not so. And truly (however vain and triffling it appear) this with a Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mace, a profane Witticism, or an impious Scoff, serve the far greater number of our Modern Infidels, instead of solid Proof and Demonstration; but I expect a better Treatment from my Friend.</p>

                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:51616:58"/>There remains one thing to be taken notice of before I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, relating to the Power that a Man hath over his own Thoughts, or the freedom he has to act without an Impulse upon his Will; and this, I think, seems the more necessary to be discust, because, if as some contend, Man has not an Internal Principle of Freedom, but is confin'd, restrain'd, or forcibly determin'd to act by an Impulse out of his own Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I see not what great Advantage can redound to him from his being a Reasonable Creature, how he is to be accounted deserving Commendation or Dispraise, Rewards or Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or indeed in what he differs from the Brutes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>

For tho it be most true, that he hath endow'd us with an absolute freedom of our Wills (an Evidence of his exceeding Grace and Benignity) and that indeed which supports the necessity of our Rationality; for if our Wills were subject to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion, undoubtedly we shou'd have little or no use at all of our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (since then our Objects wou'd be then both judged of and elected to our hands) and so permitted us the enjoyment of our own entire Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; yet hath he out of a compassionate Praenotion of the Deceptibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our Judgment, prescrib'd us Rules whereby our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings may be directed in the Selection of Good, and Devitation of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; or to speak more expresly.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51616:59"/>
Happiness, or be consistent or inconsistent with it, the result of our Judgment upon that Examination, is what ultimately determines the Man, who cou'd not be free if his Will were determin'd by any thing but his own Desire guided by his own Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But farther; In our enquiries about Liberty, I think the Question is not so proper, whether the Will be free, but whether the Man be free: Thus, I think, that so far as any one can by the Direction or Choice of his Mind, preferring the Existence of any Action, to the Non-existence of that Action, and</hi> vice versa, <hi>make it to Exist or not to Exist, so far he is free: For if I can by a thought of my Mind, preferring one to the other, produce either Words or Silence, I am at liberty to speak or hold my peace; and as far as this power reaches, of acting or not acting, by the determination of his own Thought prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring either, so far a Man is free; for how can we think any one freer than to have a power to do what he will; so that in respect of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons within the reach of such a power in him, a Man seems as free as it is possible for freedom to make him. Yet the inquisitive Mind of Man, willing to shift off from himself, as far as he can, all thought of Guilt, tho' it be by putting himself into a worse state than that of fatal Necessity, is not content with this, will have this to be no free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, unless it reaches farther; but is ready to say, a Man is not free at all, if he be not as free to will, as he is to act what he wills. Concerning a Man's Liberty therefore, there yet is rais'd this farther Question, whether a Man be free to will; which, I think, is what is meant, when it is disputed whether the Will be free. As to that, I imagine, That willing or choosing being an Action, and Freedom consisting in a power of acting or not acting, a Man in respect of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling any Action in his power, once proposed to his Thoughts, cannot be free. The Reason whereof is very manifest; for it being unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable that the Action depending on his Will, shou'd Exist or not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist; and its Existence or not Existence following perfectly the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination and preference of his will, he cannot avoid the willing the Existence or not Existence of that Action, it is absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that he will the one or the other,</hi> i. e. <hi>prefer the one to the other, since one of them must necessarily follow; and that which does fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, follows by the determination and choice of his Mind, that is, by his willing it; for if he did not will, it would not be: so that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the act of willing, a Man is not free; Liberty consisting in a power to act, or not to act, which, in regard of volition, a Man has not, it being necessary and unavoidable (any Action in his power being once thought on) to prefer either its doing or forbearance, upon
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51616:59"/>
which preference the Action or its Forbearance certainly follows, and is truly voluntary. So that to make a Man free in this sence, there must be another antecedent Will to determine the Acts of this Will, and another to determine that, and so in</hi> Infinitum; <hi>for wherever one stops, the Actions of the last Will cannot be free: nor is any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so far as I can comprehend Beings above me, capable of such a freedom of will, that it can forbear to will,</hi> i. e. <hi>to prefer the Being or not Being of any thing in its power, which it has once consider'd as such.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This then is evident, A Man is not at liberty to will or not to will any thing in his power that he once considers of; Liberty consisting in a power to act or not to act. Since then it is plain, a Man is not at Liberty whether he will will or no (for when an Action in his power is proposed to his Thoughts, he cannot forbear volition he must determine one way or the other) the next thing to be determin'd is, whether he be at liberty to will which of the two he pleases, Motion or Rest. This Question carries the Absurdity of it so manifestly in it self, that one might thereby be sufficiently convinc'd that Liberty concerns not the Will in any case; for to ask whether a Man be at liberty to will either Motion or Rest, Speaking or Silence, which he pleases, is to ask whether a Man can will what he wills, or be pleased with what he is pleased with. A question which, I think, needs no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: and whoever can make one of it, must suppose one Will to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Acts of another; and another to determine that, and so forwards. To avoid these and the like Absurdities, nothing can be of greater use than to establish in our Minds clear and steady Notions of the Things under consideration: If the Idea's of Liberty and Voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were well fixed in our Understandings, and carried along with us in our Minds, as they ought, through all the Questions are raised about them, I suppose a great part of the Difficulties that perplex Mens Thoughts, and entangle their Understandings, wou'd be much easier resolv'd, and we should perceive where the confused signification of Terms, or where the Nature of the Thing caused Obscurity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First then, It is carefully to be remembred, that freedom consists in the dependance of the Existence or not Existence of any Action, upon our Volition of it: and not in the dependance of any Action, or its contrary, on our preference: Or our freedom consists in our being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to act, or not to act, according as we shall choose or will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, We must remember that volition or willing is an act of the Mind, directing its Thoughts to the Production of any Action, and thereby exerting its power to produce it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:51616:60"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly, The Will being nothing but a power in the Mind, to direct the operative Faculties of a Man to Motion or Rest, as far as they depend on such Direction. To the Question, what is it determines the Will? the true and proper Answer is the Mind: for that which determines the general power of directing to this or that particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, is nothing but the Agent it self exercising the power it has that particular way. If this Answer satisfies not, 'tis plain the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Question, what determines the Will? is this, what moves the Mind in every particular Instance to determine its general power of directing to this or that particular Motion or Rest. And to this I answer, The motive for continuing in the same state or action is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the present satisfaction in it: The motive to change is always some uneasiness; nothing setting us upon the change of state, or upon any new action, but some uneasiness. This is the true Motive that works on the Mind to put it upon action, which for shortness sake we call determining the Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall not descend farther into the Particulars of this Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Discourse; if you look it over, you will find many curious Thoughts, particularly in his Enquiry, Why the greatest posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Good determines not the Will, unless that our Desire be raised proportionably, and makes us uneasie in the want of it: for we must by no means confound our Will with our Desire. Desire it self being an uneasiness.</p>
               <p>Before I finish this Argument of the Power and Freedom which we experience in our selves, and that manifest liberty we have to assent, to deny, to choose or refuse what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to our Phantasies, I shall endeavour to solve some of those many Doubts, which seem to relate to the Moral conduct of our Lives, by which the wretched Subterfuge of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Coaction or Compulsion will be plainly refuted, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in all respects chargeable with his own Commissions, Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, or the Impiety of his Actions.</p>
               <p>That this may appear evident, I must desire you to keep in mind the following Proposition, That tho' the first Motions of our Minds are but little in our Power, and that we have not a perfect liberty to suppress every sudden Thought, Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Passion or Desire which are excited in our Minds, by unexpected Objects presented to our Imagination. If we are not able to stop them from appearing to us; or cannot hinder them from coming into our Minds, yet is it in our power to deny our consent, or to assent unto the same: and in this very
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51616:60"/>
Assent or Denial are laid the Foundations of Vice and Vertue, and accordingly hereunto we must expect our Thoughts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Character of Good or Evil.</p>
               <p>As for instance; When I behold a beautiful Woman, altho' at the presentment of such an Object unforeseen and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I am perhaps unable to prevent some libidinous Idea in my Mind, yet is it wholly in any power to choose whether or no I will indulge the Thought, or take all Opportunities to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the lewd Phansie; or whether I should make it my busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to satisfie my Concupiscible Appetite by a Carnal Embrace or Contact.</p>
               <p>Again, Supposing it impossible I shou'd keep my Thoughts from Wine, which at one time or other may be presented to me, yet have I full liberty to refuse Drinking, to consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Prejudice may arise from it, or whether it be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I should impair my Health, or brutifie my Nature, by its extravagant use. I have the rather taken notice of these two Particulars, because I find Men so apt to cry out upon the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their Nature, the Frailty of their Composition. The Lascivious Man pleads the prevalency of the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was too powerful for his Resistance, he cou'd not withstand it. So likewise says the Drunkard, he cannot help it, it is a natural Infirmity out of his power to overcome.</p>
               <p>In handling this Subject, the Learned <note n="*" place="margin">In his Sermon upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of of the Thoughts.</note> Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> has thus excellently deliver'd his Thoughts: <hi>When Temptations are presented unto us, tho' we cannot perhaps avoid the feeling some irregular Passion, Motion or Inclination within our selves, upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion thereof: yet is it ever at that time absolutely in our power, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will comply with those Passions or Inclinations, or not; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will consent to them or not; whether we will pursue them farther or not: Now if we do not consent, but endeavour to stop, to stifle and resist so soon as we are aware of them, there is yet no harm done, our Thoughts, how indecent or irregular soever, are but Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: But if on the other side, we consent to any wicked Motion or Inclination that arises in us, let it come how it will, never so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, never so unexpectedly, if we close with any Thought that prompts us to evil, so as to be pleased with it, to delight in it, to think of pursuing it till it be brought into action; in that case 'tis a folly to plead our Original Corruption, for in that very instant we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Actual Sinners, and Transgressors of the Law of God, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of which reaches to our very Hearts and Thoughts, as well as
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51616:61"/>
Actions, tho' yet we are not so great Transgressors, so long as our Sin is only in Thought or Desire or Purpose, as if it had proceeded to outward Action. All this is taught us for true Divinity by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle</hi> James, <hi>in the first Chapter of his Epistle,</hi> v. 13, 14, 15. Let no Man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God, for God tempteth no Man; but every Man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own Lust and enticed. Then when Lust hath conceived it bringeth forth Sin; and Sin when it is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, bringeth forth Death. <hi>Which passage contains these three Propositions:</hi> 1. <hi>That no Man is drawn to commit Sin, by any state or condition that God hath put him into; no nor by any Temptation either outward or inward that is presented to him. It is not a Sin to be tempted, nor yet to feel that we are tempted by some disorderly Inclination that arises in our Minds thereupon. But secondly, then our Sin begins, when we yield to the Temptation, when we are drawn away by our own Lusts, when they get the Victory over us, and we do consent to them, then Lust hath conceived, and bringeth forth Sin. But thirdly, Tho' the very consent of our Wills to a Temptation, be a Sin in us, yet is not that Sin so great as it will be afterwards when it is brought into Action: Sin in the desire or purpose is but an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo, or the first Rudiments of Sin, but when it comes to be acted it is then a Sin in its full Dimensions, and the Consequence of it will be fatal without Repentance; for Sin when it is finished bringeth forth Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having thus hinted to you the power we have not, or in what our liberty does not consist, I will just mention to you the power we have over our own Thoughts, and take notice to you wherein that power or liberty consists: For if, say you, we be such Slaves to our Thoughts, and as it were necessarily subject to them, and passive under them, where is our freedom? To this I answer, That we have not only a liberty of thinking, and can choose our own Thoughts; but that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and freedom which we have in thinking, does consist in that, if we so please we may apply our Minds more vigorously to one sort of things than to another, and according to this application so will the most of our Thoughts be. It is in our power, amongst the multitude of Objects that present themselves to our Minds (as for Instance, God, Vertue, Holiness, Heaven, Wealth, Power, Greatness, Preferment, fine Clothes, splendid Equipage, Sensual Pleasures, Recreations, Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements, Knowledge, Learning, Arts, and the like: I say, amongst all this Multitude of Objects that present themselves to our Minds) it is in our power to determine our selves which of them we will dwell
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51616:61"/>
upon and make a business of, and accordingly, when at any time we have pitch'd upon any of them as a business, it is in our power to mind that business either more or less diligently: and if it be such, as that we mean in good earnest to concern our selves about it, it will then so fill our Minds, as that by its attendance we shall either prevent in a great measure other Thoughts from coming into our Heads, or if they do come in, they will not long stay there, but speedily give place to that which we make our more important business at that time: and the reason of this is plain, because our Natures are of that make, that two things at once cannot well possess our Minds; and therefore, if we be intent about one thing, we cannot have much room or leisure for Thoughts of another Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have spoke the more upon this Principle of Freedom, the mighty Priviledge of Man above his Fellow-Creatures, because I conceive it a Matter of the highest Consequence; for if Man be not a free Agent, free to assent and free to deny, free to love, to fear, to hate, to admire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we at once unhinge the Foundation of all true Religion, and put the most contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Brute in competition with him: we destroy the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Rewards and Punishments founded upon his Actions, and take every thing from him commendable or praise-worthy. But, saith the Atheist, we would have had him pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in such a Condition, that he should only have had a power or freedom to do everything he ought, but never to have had the liberty of forfeiting his Future Happiness.</p>
               <p>The Absurdity of this Desire or Expectation is so palpably conspicuous, that there is no Man can consider it without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it: For if Mankind had been compell'd to the Duties of Religion, whether they wou'd or no; or had there been a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Impossibility that any Man shou'd fall into Infidelity, in what I pray had layn the Advantage of a Religious Faith; if Men, tho' never so desirous, could not be vicious, where had been the Benefit or the just Reward of Vertue; if they had never the power of degrading their Natures, and falling into Luxury, Epicurism and Sensuality, who had ever heard of Temperance and Sobriety. Where wou'd be our Christian Fortitude and Magnanimity, if there were no Difficulties to be encountred, or Dangers to be overcome; or in a word, what reason have we to value our selves for our Honesty, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Charity, Patience, Resignation, if all these stood but for so many Cyphers or empty insignificant Sounds, as they must

be, did we suppose our selves in such a state as this where we are hurried on by some unseen Impulse or Coaction, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on the Powers or Faculties of our own Minds.</p>
               <p>I must confess there are some Places or Texts in the Sacred Writings, which seem at first sight to countenance this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That Man is not a free Agent, or invested with this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which we contend for: But whoever will take the trouble of collecting the several Expositions, not only of Divines, but Philosophers, will find them all satisfactorily explain'd, their Scruples fairly remov'd, and the more natural and genuine Sense of them demonstratively asserted.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">See a Treatise of Liberty and Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity by Mr. <hi>Hobbs.</hi>
                  </note>There is no Person, that I know of, hath made so much Noise in the World about Liberty and Necessity, or about our acting necessarily, as Mr. <hi>Hobbs.</hi> That Man, saith he, is free to do a thing, that may do it if he have the will to do it, and may forbear if he have the will to forbear; and yet if there be a necessity that he shall have the will to do it, the Action is necessarily to follow: and if there be a necessity that he shall have the will to forbear, the forbearing also will be necessary. The Question therefore is not, Whether a Man be not a free Agent? that is to say, whether he can write or forbear, speak or be silent, according to his will? But whether the will to write, or the will to forbear, come upon him according to his will, or according to any thing else in his own power? I acknowledge this Liberty, that I can do if I will; but to say I can will if I will, I take to be an absurd Speech.</p>
               <p>Again saith Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> Every Effect must have a Cause to produce it; that Cause must be sufficient to produce it, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it had never been produced: if that Cause be sufficient, it must likewise be necessary to produce it; for if any thing were wanting that was necessary to the Production of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it could not be effected, and thus the Effect comes to be produced necessarily, or of pure necessity. The Comparison stands thus; The Will of Man must have some Cause, that Cause must be sufficient, if sufficient, likewise necessary, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Man's Will is necessitated. Whoever will trouble himself with a little Reflection, may easily unriddle this Mystery, and prove the Argument to be a meer Sophism, however strenuous it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at the first view. The judicious Mr. <hi>E—d</hi> hath done it already to my Hand, and therefore I shall refer you to his Dialogues for a Solution. In the interim I shall be plain with
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51616:62"/>
you in this particular, That whatever Applause this Author may have gain'd in the World, and how much soever extoll'd for a Man of profound Thought, or a deep Judgment, I see nothing in him more taking than his manner of Expression; in which he was indeed so peculiar and singularly fortunate, that many Men have been hereby so sooth'd and tickled into an Opinion of his Judgment, as to take all he says for granted, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every thing new, till a farther Consideration discovers to them, that there is nothing more so than his stile and the or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der of his Thoughts.</p>
               <p>I have some reason to believe you tainted with this Man's Principles, on which account, as an Antidote against the Rest of his Heretical Opinions, I wou'd recommend you to the Writings of Bishop <hi>Lucy,</hi> my Lord <hi>C—n,</hi> Mr. <hi>W</hi>— and particularly to the lately mention'd <hi>E—d.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Men have degraded themselves into Beasts by practice, they wou'd have it thought by any means that 'tis unavoidable for them to act otherwise than they do: From hence they take the Measures of their Opinions, and will allow of no Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt themselves and the pittiful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>st Brute, but that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in them is fall'n into a more lucky Texture and Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And indeed, the Brutish Soul will very well serve all the ends of some Men, who to justifie their Sensuality, earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contend that they have nothing more to indulge, or gratifie besides their Animal Inclinations.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding, whatever these Men think, this is a most undoubted Verity, That next to the Belief of the Being of God, the Perswasion of the Soul's being Immortal is the great Basis of all true Happiness, the Hinge upon which all Religion turns: 'Tis this that leads us both to contemn the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications of the Flesh, and to be solicitous about a Happiness hereafter, tho' it be with undergoing some present Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; nor is there any Truth whatever that hath a more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Influence upon the whole Course of our present Lives.</p>
               <p>Men may study to palliate and ease the Disquiet of their troubled Souls after what manner they please, yet still there will be some lucid Intervals, which will discover to them the possibility of a Life to come, and put them upon questioning the Certainty of their Souls perpetual Sleep, which, shou'd it happen to be a mistake, will prove one of the most dangerous and pernicious Consequence.</p>

                  <p>THat the preceding Discourse may be the more entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I have here taken an opportunity of presenting you with an Epitomy of the Sentiments of two famous Men. The Hypotheses are both new, or at least were never, as I have heard, deliver'd to us before in such Regular Systems: the First is that of Monsieur <hi>Malebranch,</hi> where discoursing of our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, he endeavours to establish the following Notion, That they are neither such as we have all along accounted them, nor do they at all reside in those Parts we have supposed; or to speak more intelligibly, That our Sense, whether of Heat, Colours, Tasts, Sounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is nothing real in the Object, nor yet in the Part which is believ'd the Sentient. To instance in one of these, that upon the approach of your Hand to the Fire, the Heat you apprehend, is neither in the Fire nor in your Hand, but a pure Modification of your Soul it self, which is thus variously modefy'd by the Supream Being at the present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the several Objects.</p>
                  <p>In his Explaining this, he takes notice to us that in this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Hand to the Fire, there is nothing but an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Motion in the Fire or Hand: in the former, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Expulsion of igneous Particles against the Fibres of the Hand; and in the Hand a Motion or Division of the same Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, by the intrusion of the fiery Particles. And thus, <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>vid. Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>br. de veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend.</hi>
                     </note> saith he, that we may not neglect the Care and Preservation of the several Parts of our Bodies, it hath pleased the Almighty Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of them to new modifie our Souls, after so wonderful a manner, that when any Danger approaches, which wou'd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice their make or structure, we shou'd apprehend our Pains and Disorders, and feel them as it were in those places where the Danger lyes, without conceiving at the same time the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of our Souls; and this will hold in every of our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, which are nothing real any where, unless in the Soul it self.</p>
                  <p>This may now inform us that we should be very cautious in giving Credit to the Testimony of our Senses, which do for the most part involve us in most of our Mistakes; for these are not
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51616:64"/>
given us to inform us of the Truth of Things, but only as they stand related to the Preservation of our Bodies. That this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument may be enforced with a farther Perspicuity, here is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother signal Instance of the general Errors into which (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the other Senses) our Sight betrays us, in reference to Light and Colours.</p>
                  <p>When we have lookt upon the Sun, for some time, this is what passes in our Eyes and in our Souls, and these are the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors we fall into.</p>
                  <p>Those who know the first Elements of Dioptricks, and any thing of the admirable Structure of our Eyes, are not ignorant that the Rays of the Sun are refracted in the Crystaline and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Humours, and that they meet afterwards upon the <hi>Ret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> or Expansion of the Optic Nerve, which, as it were, furnishes with Hangings all the bottom of the Eyes, even as the Rays of the Sun, which pass through a Convex Glass, meet together in the <hi>Focus</hi> at two, three, or four Fingers breadth distant, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to its convexity. Now Experience shows, that if one put at the <hi>Focus</hi> of the Convex Glass a little piece of Stuff, or brown Paper, the Rays of the Sun make so great an impression upon this Stuff or Paper, and agitate the small Particles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with so great a violence, that they break and separate them from one another: in a word, they burn them, or reduce them into Smoak and Ashes. Thus we must conclude from this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that if the Pupil through which the Light passes, were so dilated that it wou'd admit an easie passage for the Rays of the Sun, or on the contrary, were so contracted as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct them, our <hi>Retina</hi> wou'd suffer the same thing as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or piece of Stuff, and the Fibres wou'd be so very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated that they wou'd soon be broken and burnt.</p>
                  <p>It is for this Reason that most Men are sensible of a Pain, if they look upon the Sun but for one moment, because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so well close up the Orifice of the Pupil, but that there will enter sufficient Rays to agitate the Strings of the Optic Nerve, with much violence, and not without danger of breaking them. The Soul has no knowledge of what we have spoke, and when it looks upon the Sun it neither perceives its Optic Nerve, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> any Motion in it. But that's not the Error, 'tis only a simple Ignorance. The first Error it falls into is, that it judges the Pain it feels, is in its Eyes.</p>

                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:51616:66"/>If immediately after looking upon the Sun, we go into a dark place with our Eyes open, the Motion of the Fibres of the Optic Nerve, caused by the Rays of the Sun, diminishes and changes by little and little: this is all the Change that can be perceived in the Eyes; however, 'tis not what the Soul perceives there, but only a white and yellow Light. Its second Error is, it judges that the Light it sees is in the Eyes, or upon the next Wall. In fine, the Agitation of the Fibres of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi> always diminishes and ceases by little and little; for when a Body has been shaken, nothing can be perceived in it, but a diminution of its Motion: but 'tis not that which the Soul per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives in its Eyes; it sees the White become an Orange colour, afterwards Red, and then Blue; and the reason of this Error is, that we judge there are Changes in our Eyes, or upon the next Wall, that differ much as to the more or less, because the Blue, Orange, and Red colours which we see, differ much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise amongst themselves, besides in the more or less. These are some Errors which we are subject to in reference to Light and Colours; and these Errors beget many others.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Learned and Devout Father proceeds in this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and Curious Speculation, and whatever Consequences may be drawn by designing Men from the Modification of our Souls by the Supream Being, as might be instanc't in some few Particulars, yet most certainly there are many weighty Truths, depending on this noble Theory: and whoever dives into the bottom of the Notion, may not unlikely find (that however some Superficial Wits may calumniate and despise it) his Divine Faith may be exalted, and a more profound Esteem and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration raised for that Power, from whom is derived all the Benefits we can enjoy.</p>
                  <p>By a serious Enquiry of this Nature, we might undoubtedly arrive at a more certain Account of the Nature and Useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that infinite number of little Beings, which we call Species and Idea's, which are as nothing, and which represent all things that we create and destroy when we please, and that our Ignorance hath made us imagine to render a Reason for Things that we understand not: we should likewise be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to show the solidity of their Opinion, who believe God is the true Father of Light, who only instructs all Men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom the most simple Truths cou'd not be intelligible, nor wou'd the Sun, how bright soever, be so much as visible to us.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51616:66"/>
And of theirs who acknowledge no other Nature than the Will of God, and who upon such like Reflections have confessed, that the Idea's which represent the Creatures to us, are only the Perfections of the Divine Being, which answer to those same Creatures, and represent them to us.</p>
                  <p>The second of these new Hypotheses, tho' I conceive its first rise from the same Fountain with the former, yet I find the same very strenuously pleaded for and judiciously vindicated by our Country-man Mr. <hi>Norris:</hi> and this is the Doctrine of the Divine Light, as it relates to the Humane Intellect: of which that I may give you a short Specimen, or briefly hint to you, I must take notice that in one part of his Treatise he cites Monsieur <hi>Malebranch,</hi> who considering with himself all the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible ways of Humane Understanding, or whereby we come to have the Idea's of things without us, makes this Division or Enumeration of them. 1. It is necessary that these Idea's should either proceed from the Objects: Or, 2. that our Mind has a power of producing them: Or, 3. That God should produce them either with the Mind when he creates it, or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally as often as we think of any Object. 4 Or that the Mind should possess in it self all the Perfections which it sees in things. Or 5thly and lastly, that it be united to some ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely perfect Being that includes in himself all the Perfections of Created Beings. After this Enumeration, I find that both the Father, and after him Mr. <hi>Norris,</hi> have pitched upon the last of these, as the only Expedient to help us in the manner of our Knowledge or Understanding, and it is on the same Basis that the latter hath erected the following Scheme.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Norris</hi> of the Divine Light.</note>I. Whereas, saith he, the <hi>Qu—rs</hi> talk of this Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as of some Divine Communication or Manifestation only, I make it to be the very Essence and Substance of the Deity, which I suppose virtually to contain all things in it, and to be intimately united to our Minds.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. They represent this Light within as a sort of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Inspiration (whence they have the name of Enthusiasts) whereas according to my Notion, it is a Man's natural and ordinary way of Understanding.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Farther (if I mistake not) They confine their Light within to some certain Objects, namely Moral and Spiritual Truths, in order only to the Direction of Practise, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51616:67"/>
make it a Suppliment to Scripture, which they say is not sufficient without it, nor indeed any more than a meer dead Letter. On the other hand I appropriate not this Divine Light to Moral or Spiritual Truths or Things, but extend it as far as all Truth, yea as far as all that is intelligible, which I believe to be perceived and understood in this Divine Light as I explain it.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. They (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Q—rs</hi>) make their Light within, a special Priviledge of a certain Order of Men, their own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not indeed as to the possibility, because they suppose all Men to be indifferently capable of this Divine Illumination, as may appear from their contending against Predestination, and for Universal Grace; but tho' they do not make it a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Priviledge as to the possibility, yet they do as to the act; making none but those of their own way to be actually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd by it: whereas, according to my Principles, this is no special Priviledge, but the common and universal Benefit of all Men, yea of all the Intelligent Creation, who all see and understand in this Light of God, without which there would be neither Truth nor Understanding.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Again, By their Light within they understand some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate form'd Dictate or Proposition, expresly and positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directing and instructing them to do so or so. Now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Notion, this Divine Light is only the Essential Truth of God, which indeed is always present to my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, as being intimately united with it, but does not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally enlighten or instruct me, unless when I attend to it, and read what is written in those Divine Ideal Characters.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. And lastly, they offer not any Rational or Intelligible account of the Light within, neither as to the thing, nor as to the mode of it, but cant only in some loose general Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the Light, which they confirm with the Authority of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Gospel, tho' they understand neither one nor t'other: Whereas I have offer'd a Natural, Distinct, and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical way of Explaining both, namely by the Omnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Ideal World, or the Divine <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, who has in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Essences and Ideas of all things, and in whom the same are perceived by us and by all Creatures.</p>
                  <p>I shall not detain you, with my own Comments hereupon, any otherwise than by informing you, that so far as I am able
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51616:67"/>
to apprehend the same may be a solid Truth, I mean Mr. <hi>Norris</hi>'s Explanation of the Divine Light. Futurity will make us all wiser, and open a Door to those recluse <hi>Arcana</hi> or hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Mysteries which in this Life are likely to be veiled from our Eyes.</p>

               <p>IT is with no small concern, that I have left my former Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Soul, and yet methinks I am not perfectly without hopes that you will find something therein to evidence its Immortality; for altho' the one half of what may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd in its Vindication, cannot be reduc'd to the narrow li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of an Epistle; yet if I mistake not, there are some few of the Physical Arguments do manifestly evince, that without supposing it to be a Spiritual Incorporeal Substance (whatever Jargon this may seem to the absolute Corporealist) there are many of its <hi>Phaenomena</hi> will be eternally incapable of any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable or allowable Explanation. I shall therefore earnestly request you that you live not in a contempt of it; for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Powers of Sense and Imagination may so obscure and darken the pure Acts of the Mind, as to perswade you that Will and Reason arise from the same Principle; assure
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51616:68"/>
your self that an immediate prospect of another Life, will change the Scene: the intercepting Curtain will open and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Anti-chamber of Death, where you will find your self in the midst of such Confusion, Horrour, Consternation and Perplexity, as nothing will be able to mitigate but a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Penitence or fervent Contrition, a devout and humble Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation of your Soul to the Power offended: and if the dread of this being insufficient still highten your disturbance, you may tast perhaps that Hell you so very lately had ridicul'd by way of Anticipation, before your fatal Leap from the dismal and horrid Praecipice of Life.</p>

               </lg>
               <p>Thus has the ingenious Mr. <hi>Norris</hi> most livelily represented the frightful <hi>Exit</hi> of the departing Soul: but to avoid any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Interruption, I shall hasten to my intended Discourse, with this Expectation, if not Assurance, that on whatsoever side you find right Reason, you will make no Opposition: or where the Light of your Understanding shines clearly forth, that you by no means stifle, or study to obscure the same.</p>
               <p>Whoever then has once admitted, and does unfeignedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Truth of these Three Propositions, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That there is a most powerful and wise Being, the first Cause of all things. That the same Being does inspect or take notice of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Mankind, and will retribute to every one according to those Actions, in a Life to come: whoso, I say, has granted these, will find himself at no great loss, to conceive that it highly behoves him to have a regard both to his Thoughts and Actions: to do nought indeliberately, but to regulate the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his whole Life, by some such certain, just, and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Rule, as he foresees is most likely to tend to his Security and Well-being.</p>
               <p>Now it having pleased this All-wise Being, to endow his darling Favourite Man above the other Creatures, with a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Reason, and to be himself a Light unto his Soul, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he may Contemplate those other. Beings which surround him; we need not dispute but that by a devout consulting this Intestine Director or Dictator, we may come to understand what Measures are to be taken for our Information. If by the alone assistance of this Natural Light in the Understanding, we find it neither practicable nor possible, to invent any such Laws or Rules as would be agreed unto by the Body of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, or such as wou'd never need any Alteration, but be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with and understood, and all this while contain every thing necessary to the discharging of our Duty to our God and to each other: If Humane Reason, or the Light of Nature,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51616:69"/>
is insufficient to direct us to such a uniform and steddy Rule, or System of Laws; or if it cou'd, since the greater part of Men wou'd think themselves unconcern'd, or under no necessity to observe them, on the account of a Deficiency in Authority, or a want of a Divine Sanction or Manumission: it is reasonable, as well as natural, for us to wish and expect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these accounts, that our Maker wou'd in some manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal Himself unto us, that He wou'd prescribe our Laws, and stamp the same with some Divine Impression, whereby we might be enabled to discover their Authority, and read in them the Characters of a more than Humane Contrivance or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>S—ts</hi> Letter to a Deist.</note>Whether or no this Almighty Being has made any such Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his Will to the World, or revealed to them such Laws or Rules of Worship, as will be most acceptable to Him, is the Business of our present Enquiry: for let me tell you, whatever Noise our Deists have made in the World about the Sufficiency of Natural Religion, we have very little reason to think them in good earnest.</p>
               <p>If their Natural Religion does oblige them to believe in God, and to confess the Truth of the Souls Immortality, how comes it to pass that the Result of such a Faith is so little conspicuous in their Lives and Conversations, and why I pray is it that the Precepts of Christianity, which aim at nothing more than the Happiness of Mankind, and contain the compleatest System both of Moral and Divine Laws to direct us in our Duty, shou'd be no more regarded? 'Tis plain enough to every sober and judicious Man, that there is nothing in reveal'd Religion, that can seem harsh even to a real Deist: He that is a Deist in good earnest, will find it his highest Interest and Concern, to do every thing which Christianity has enjoyn'd: upon which score since we find it otherwise, we have abundant cause to think with a <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bently</hi>
                  </note> Learned Man, That Revelation in it self is not the stumbling Block; it is not the Fundamentals of the Christian Doctrine, nor yet the Articles of her Creed; it is the Duty to God and our Neighbour that is such an inconsistent incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Legend.</p>
               <p>He who is more than a Nominal Deist, must heartily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe this following Confession, which that you may be the better opinion'd of, I shall give you in their own words. <note n="†" place="margin">Letter to the Deists, <hi>p.</hi> 125.</note> 
                  <hi>We do believe that there is an infinitely powerful, wise, and good God,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51616:69"/>
who superintends the Actions of Mankind, in order to retribute to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one according to their Deserts: Neither are we to boggle at this Creed; for if we do not stick to it, we ruine the Foundation of all Humane Happiness, and are in effect no better than meer Atheists.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That 'tis our Duty to worship and obey Him as our Creator and Governour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That our worship consists in Prayer to Him, and Praise of Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>That our Obedience consists in the Rules of Right Reason, the Practice whereof is Moral Vertue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>That we are to expect Rewards and Punishments hereafter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Actions in this Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>And lastly, When we err from the Rules of our Duty, that we repent us, and trust in God's Mercy for our Pardon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now show me the Man, who acts according to this Faith, and let him be never so well opinion'd of Natural Religion, I make it no question but he will readily acknowledge (as the most considerate and judicious of them have always done) that Christianity, however mysterious, is indisputably the best me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of cultivating Mens Minds, and manuring their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
               <p>I must confess with <note n="*" place="margin">Miscel. <hi>p.</hi> 212.</note> Mr. <hi>Norris,</hi> were we to consult the perverse Glosses and Comments of some Christian Rabbins, and to take our Measures of this Religion, from those ill-favour'd Draughts of it, we may sometimes meet with; we shou'd be induc'd to think, that as some Christians are the worst of Men, so will their Religion appear to be the worst of Religions; an Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unworthy the Contrivance even of a wise Politician, much less of Him who is the Father of Wisdom. And indeed, whatever Declamations are made against Judaism and Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, the worst Enemies of the Christian Religion are some of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51616:70"/>
those who profess and teach it: for if it be in reality, as some of those who call themselves Orthodox describe it, we may boldly say that it is neither for the Reputation of God to be the Author of such a Religion, nor for the Interest of Men to be guided by it.</p>
               <p>Those of whom this Author more particularly takes notice, as the Misrepresenters of Christianity, are first of all the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians,</hi> who are impudent and ignorant enough, in express terms, to assert that the Sacrifice and Satisfaction of Christ does wholly excuse us from all manner of Duty and Obedience. Secondly the <hi>Solifidians,</hi> who under pretence of Advancing the Merits of the Cross, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Freeness of the Divine Grace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire nothing of a Christian in order to his Justification and Acceptance before God, but firmly to rely on the Merits and Satisfaction of Christ; and without any more to do to apply all to himself. And thirdly, Those who have a share in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Charge, are such who make Christianity a Matter of bare Speculation, rending and dividing themselves from one another, by those unhappy and dangerous Disputations which instead of making Proselytes to the Truth of Christianity, have drawn Men first of all to Deism, afterwards to Scepticism, and thence by a very easie step to Infidelity and Atheism. These are they who think all Religion absolved in Orthodoxy of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that care not how men live, but only how they teach; and are so over-intent upon the Creed, that they neglect the Commandments, little considering that Opinion is purely in order to Practise, and that Orthodoxy of Judgment is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry only in such Matters where a Mistake wou'd be of danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous influence to our Actions, that is in Fundamentals: so that the necessity of thinking rightly, is derived from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of doing rightly, and consequently the latter is the most necessary of the two.</p>
               <p>Having touched on some few of those particular Opinions which have brought a Scandal upon Revealed Religion, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much obscur'd its glorious Lustre, it behoves me to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Revelation it self,<note place="margin">See the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of Reason in Religion; A Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course by Mr. <hi>F.</hi>
                  </note> which I shall do in the words of a late Author.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As all Mankind have agreed in this, that besides the Light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, there ought to be some Supernatural Revelation of the Will of God; so being imbued with the Perswasion that there is a God, and that He ought to be worshipped, they are convinced also that all the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51616:70"/>
Religion of Men at present towards God, is the Religion of Sinners: in all the Addresses of the Sons of Men to God, they constantly apply to Him under a sense of Defilement and Guilt: in all their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions from time to time with the Deity, They have been studying how to purge and cleanse themselves, to attone and appease Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Sinners can perform nothing duly in Religion towards God, without a knowledge of the Subordination we were created in at first to Him: his Right and Authority to prescribe Laws to us, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity we were in both of knowing and keeping them: the way and means by which Sin enter'd: that God will not desert the work of his hands, to that Ruine which it hath incurr'd by its own folly, but that He is yet appeasable towards us, and will accept a Worship and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice at our hands, with the ways, means and terms: that He will receive us again into favour, and rescue us from the defilement we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under. Without some information in every one of these, there is no solid foundation for Sinners to apply in way of Religion to God at all; and shou'd they attempt it, they will do nothing but preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seeing then the Experience of some Thousands of years, have evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denc'd the ineffectualness of Natural Light to instruct the World in any one of these things; we may from hence infer the necessity that there seems to be of Supernatural Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Writings of the Heathen, whether Poets or Philosophers, are certainly void of all pretence of admission for Supernatural and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Records: and our Reason is able to give us the like demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Evidence, that this Claim is also most unduly ascrib'd to the</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran. <hi>'Tis true that</hi> Mahomet <hi>pretended to have receiv'd it by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration: most think that he counterfeited in his pretence; and it is certain, that as to receiving it by inspiration from God, he did so: but that there was not an immediate interposure of the Devil in the case, so that he was deceived himself, e're he went about to deceive others, is not so certain. The Epileptical Distemper to which he was subject, hath in others been attended with Diabolical Insinuation. The Age in which he liv'd was Enthusiastically inclin'd, and the gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the</hi> Arabian <hi>Wits, together with the subserviency of Ethnick Idolatry, which remain'd up and down among them, might encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Satan to make an Attempt that way among that People. But whether it was indeed so, or whether the whole be singly to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to himself, and one or two Impostors more that assisted him, is not material, nor makes to the business it self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:51616:71"/>Mahometism <hi>began not till the Sixth Century, about which time and for a considerable Season before, the whole East was sorely infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by Heresies, and rent by Schisms: which, together with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Lives of the Professors of the Gospel, both there and in the West, might justly provoke God to permit this Deceiver to accost the World; but obtruding a new Religion, and such a one too as neither Reason nor any former Revelation of God befriended: it concern'd him to have justify'd his Mission, by some Miracle or other, as to what he went about: and these himself plainly disclaims; for tho' some of his Followers ascribe such to him, yet there is so little brought in proof of them, and withal they are so silly and ridiculous in themselves, that they serve for nothing but to disparage both the Person and the Cause in whose behalf they are brought.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I know that all Persons, who have spoken immediately from God, have not had the Attestation of Miracles: nor was it always need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, especially when they only called Men to obedience to that which had been sufficiently so attested before: In such a Case it became the Wisdom of God to be sparing of Miracles, and indeed be thereby bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter provided for the Credit of those Doctrines, as were either really or only in appearance new, and also more served the interest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, than if he shou'd have wrought Wonders in attestation of every ordinary Messenger or Familiar Truth. And this may be a reason why none of all the Penmen of the Scripture are reported to have wrought Miracles, save</hi> Moses <hi>the Giver of the Law, and the Apostles the Promulgers of the Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But tho' every Herald of Heaven had not the Attestation of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, yet no one came inspired by God, who had not some Testimony or other born to him, to distinguish him from an Impostor: either the Doctrines they deliver'd were of that Sublimeness, that no finite Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding cou'd have invented them, and yet when discover'd were so correspondent to our Rational Desires, and so perfective of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Light, that being duly weighed, the Reason of Man acquiesceth in them, and says this is what I lookt for, but cou'd not find: or else they made known some present Matter, which lay out of the reach of all Humane Knowledge, such as the Secrets of the Heart, or declared some Fact done either at a distance, or with that secrecy, that no Man cou'd know it: or else they foretold some future Contingent soon after to come to pass, which accordingly fell out in every Circumstance. Nor is it unlikely, but that most, if not all the Old Testament Prophets, had their Missions confirm'd by the Prediction of something future, which Humane Prudence cou'd not foresee: or else they were born wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51616:71"/>
to by the prevalency and immediate success of their Prayers, or the preventing some impendent Judgment, or in the procuring some need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Mercy; for thereby was declared either their foresight of what God was ready to do, or the interest favour, and power they had with him: nor is it without probability that most of the Prophets under the</hi> Mosaic <hi>Dispensation, justify'd their Missions by some such thing. But as for</hi> Mahomet, <hi>tho' he not only pretended to speak immediately from God, but withal introduced a Doctrine really new, yet he came au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorised by no Miracle, Sign or Badge by which he might be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd from an Impostor. Yea, whereas he owns that both</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Christ <hi>were sent from God, it is an infallible Argument that he was not, their Doctrine and his being altogether inconsistent. Besides, it hath been generally acknowledg'd, not only by Jews and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but by Heathens, and that agreeably to the Light of Reason, that prophetick Illapses never befel impure and unclean Souls, and that God never made an unhallowed Person his Oracle, at least that never any such were employ'd for the Divine Amannenses. Now if we examine the</hi> Alcoran <hi>by this Prophetic Text, we find the Author of it to have been a Person lustful and tyrannical; made up of nothing but Blood and Dirt, grosly Sensual and prodigiously Cruel, which plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates how unfit he was to lay claim to the Prophetic Priviledge and Dignity. If we consult the Doctrine of the</hi> Alcoran, <hi>we have all the Evidence that the Reason of Man can desire, that it neither did nor cou'd proceed from God. It is true, there are some things in it stolen from the Scripture, but even those are so perversly related, and so wretchedly corrupted with Fables, that they lose the very similitude of Truth, through the villainous management of them. Persons are so misnam'd, Times are so mistaken, the whole so interlarded with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, and disguised with Absurdities, that we must needs say the Contriver had a bad Memory, and a worse Understanding. In a word, the whole</hi> Alcoran <hi>is nothing but a Cento of Heathenism, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism and Christianity all miserably corrupted, and as wildly blended together. The Doctrines of it are for the most part, either impossible, blasphemous or absurd. The Rewards promised to the Embracers of it, are impure and foolish. The whole was at first invented out of Pride and Ambition, propagated by Violence and Rapine, and is still maintain'd in the ways it was establisht. Profound Ignorance, Sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Baits, and force of Arms gave it its first Promotion, and do still maintain its Credit in the World. Thus the meanest Reason, if duly exercised, is able manifestly to disprove the Divinity of the</hi> Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran.</p>

I grant the Scriptures may be brought, not only to such as own their Truth, but even to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, as a proof of a Deity; but then it must not be upon the score of their naked Testimony, but on the account of their being of such a Frame, Nature and Quality, that they can proceed from no other Author: and thus may we arrive by the Scripture at an assurance of God's Existence, as we do at the Knowledge of a Cause by its Effect. But so far as we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to any thing upon the credit of the Scriptures meer testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, we are necessitated to presuppose the Existence of a God, it bring only on the account of his Veracity in himself, and that the Bible is a Divine Revelation that we do, without the least guilt of vain Credulity, because upon the highest Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, implicitly believe it.</p>
               <p>Again, Those who owe their Belief of the Bible's being the Word of God, to meer Report, to Principles of Education, the Felicity of their Birth, or the Clime where they were born, receive the Scripture upon no better Motives, than the <hi>Turks</hi> do their <hi>Alcoran.</hi> If pretended Inspiration may pass for the Demonstration of the Truth of what every bold Pretender will obtrude upon us, we must expose our selves, not only to the belief of every groundless Imagination, but of innumerable

Contradictions: for not only the grossest Follies, but Doctrines palpably repugnant both to Reason, and one another, have been deliver'd by Enthusiasts and pretended Inspirato's. I grant that the Testimony of the Holy Ghost in the Souls and Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Men to the Truth of the Scriptures, is the most convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Evidence that such Persons can have of its Divinity. But 1. the Holy Ghost convinceth no Man as to the belief of the Scripture, without enlightning him in the Ground, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons upon which its proceeding from God, is evidenc'd and establish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. There is no Conviction begot by the Holy Ghost in the hearts of Men, otherways than by Rational Evidence, satisfying our Understandings, through a Discovery of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Inducements that ascertain the Truth of what he wou'd convince us of. 2. No Man's particular assurance obtain'd thus in way of Illumination by the Holy Ghost, is to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise urged as an Argument of Conviction to another, than by proposing the Reasons on which our Faith is erected. The way of such Mens Evidence is communicable to none, unless they cou'd kindle the same Rays in the Breasts of others, which have irradiated their own: and therefore they must deal with others by producing the Grounds of their Conviction, not pleading the Manner of it; for that another is convinced and perswaded by them, depends wholly on the weight and momentousness of the Reasons themselves, not on the manner that such a Person came to discover them: for shou'd he have arrived at the discerning them by any other means, they had been of the same significancy to the Conviction of an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. 3. The Holy Ghost, as a distinct Person in the Deity, is not a Principle demonstrable by Reason, seeing then it is by the Scripture alone that we are assured of the Existence of the Divine Spirit, as a distinct Person in the Godhead, therefore his testimony in the Hearts and Consciences of Men to the Scripture, cannot be allow'd as a previous Evidence of its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. To prove the Divine Authority of the Scripture, by the Testimony of the Holy Ghost, when we cannot otherwise prove that there is a Holy Ghost but by the Testimony of the Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ipture, is to argue circularly and absurdly. So that in short, when we have to do with such, as either question or deny the Authority of the Scripture, we are to prove it by Ratiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from common Principles receiv'd amongst Mankind, and by Topicks that lye even and proportionate to Intellectual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51616:73"/>
Our Reason is here justly to be magnify'd as highly subservient to Religion, in that it can demonstrate the Divine Authority of the Scripture, upon which our Faith, as to all particular Articles and Duties of Religion, is grounded. This, I say, our Reason can do to the Conviction of all, who are not wilfully obstinate, and for such there is no means, either sufficient or intended by the Almighty, to satisfie them. For it is certain, that partly through the Weakness and Darkness which have arrested our Understandings, partly through the Nature, Quality, Extent and Arduousness of Objects, and our inadaequate Conceptions of them, partly through Prepossessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Prejudices, and the Bias of Lusts and Passions that we are subject to; partly through Supineness, Sloth and Inadverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, we do often prevaricate in making Deductions and Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences from Self-evident and Universal Maxims; and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on establish erroneous and mistaken Consequences as Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Truth and Reason. But then this is the fault of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, not of Philosophy, or of Philosophy in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, as existing in this or that Person, not in the Abstract, as involving such a Mischief in its Nature and Idea. Our Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Faculties being vitiated and tinctur'd with Lust, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled by Prejudices, darkened by Passions, ingaged by vain and corrupt Interests, distorted by Pride and Self-love, and fastened to Earthly Images, do often impose upon us, and lead us to obtrude upon others absurd Axioms for undoubted and incontestable Principles of Reason. It is this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, this adulterate Reason which is both unfriendly and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Religion; it is to this that most of the malignant Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies which have infected the Church, do owe its rise; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will trace the Errors which have invaded Divinity to their Source, may resolve them into false Reasonings or absurd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims of Philosophy, which have been by their Founders su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perscribed with the venerable Name of Principles of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>Indeed whatever can be made appear to lye in a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to right Reason, we may profess our selves ready to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon and disclaim: but we are satisfy'd, and do fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that a great deal which only crosses some false and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricous Principles that Dogmatists have given that name to, falls under the Imputation of Disagreement with Reason: the Repugnancy of Reason fasten'd upon some Tenets, is rather
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51616:73"/>
the Result of Ignorance, Prepossession, and sometimes Lust, than their contrariety to Universal Reason, or any genuine Maxims of it.</p>
               <p>Farther, It must be granted, and hath always been judged that the Incomprehensibleness of a Doctrine, through the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity and Extension of its Object, is no just bar to the Truth of it. And indeed it is to be wonder'd, that any who have studied the Weakness of their discursive Capacity, the Feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Intellectual Light, how soon it is dazled with too bright a Splendour, the Confinement and Boundaries our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings are subject to, together with the Majesty of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel Truth, the Immensity of the Objects of the Christian Faith, shou'd think the arduousness of framing distinct and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aequate Conceptions of them, a sufficient ground for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing renounced and disclaimed. Yet this is the Standard by which some Men regulate their Belief.</p>
               <p>As to the Bible, 'tho every thing in it be not alike necessary, yet every thing in it is alike true, and our Concernment lyes more or less in it. There is no other Rule by which we are to be regulated in Matters of Religion besides this; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the import and meaning of its Terms can be no other ways decided, but by their habitude to their Measure. For this end did the Almighty give forth the Scripture, that it might be the Foundation and Standard of Religion, and thence it is we are to learn its Laws and Constitutions. The instructing Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in whatsoever is necessary to his present or future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, was our Makers design in vouchsafing to us a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Revelation: and foreseeing all things that are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to such an end, the Respect and Veneration which we pay to his Sapience and Goodness, oblige us to believe that he hath adapted and proportioned the Means thereunto. Now the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Bible are of two sorts: 1. Such as besides their being made known by Revelation, and believed on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Divine Testimony, have also a Foundation in the Light of Nature, and there are Natural <hi>Mediums,</hi> by which they may be proved: Of this kind are the Being of, or Attributes of God, the Immortality of the Soul, the Certainty of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, the Existence of a Future State and Moral Good and Evil. 2. Such as have no Foundation at all in Nature, by which they cou'd have been found out or known, but we are solely indebted to Supernatural Revelation for the discovery of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51616:74"/>
them; their Objects having their Source and Rise only from the Will of God; a Supernatural Revelation was absolutely expedient to promulge them: and these also are of two sorts. 1. There are some Doctrines, which tho' our Understandings by Natural <hi>Mediums</hi> cou'd never have discover'd, yet being on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>evealed, our Minds can by Arguments drawn from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, facilitate the Apprehension of them, and confirm it self in their Belief: Of this kind are the Resurrection of the Body, and Satisfaction to Divine Justice in order to the Exercising of Forgiveness to Penitent Sinners. There are others, which as Reason cou'd never have discover'd, so when reveald, it can neither comprehend them, nor produce any <hi>Medium</hi> in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by which either the Existence of their Objects can be demonstrated, or their Truth illustrated: Of this kind are the Doctrines of the Trinity, and the Incarnation of the Son of God; of these our Reason is not able to give us any adaequate Conceptions: and yet these are by a clear and necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on united with other Doctrines of Faith, which Reason enlighten'd by Revelation can give a Rational account of. For the Mystery of the Trinity hath a necessary Connexion with the Work of our Redemption, by the Incarnation of the Son of God: and the Work of Redemption by the Incarnation of an Infinite Person, hath the like Connexion with the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of satisfying Divine Justice, in order to the dispensing of Pardon to repenting Offenders: And the necessity of satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Divine Justice for the end aforesaid, hath a necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with the Doctrine of the Corruption of Mankind; and this Corruption is both fully confessed and easily demonstrated by Reason.</p>
               <p>Thus tho' all the Objects of Faith have not an immediate Correspondence with those of Reason, yet these very Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Faith, which lye remo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>est from the Territories of Reason, and seem to have least affinity with its Light, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily and clearly connected with those other Principles of Faith, which when once discover'd, Reason both approves of and can rationally confirm it self in. I need not add, that the most mysterious Doctrines of Religion, are necessarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with a Belief of the Bible's being the Word of God, and that is a Truth which right Reason is so far from reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it is able to demonstrate the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:51616:74"/>Now if in Explaining the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, which is the proper Province of Reason, the most that a discreet Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher will pretend to, is to declare the possible ways by which a <hi>Phoenomenon</hi> may be accounted for, without presuming to say that it is only performed in this way, and that there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in which it may be explain'd: much more doth it become us, in the great Mysteries of Revelation, to abstain from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining the Manner how they are, and to content our selves with what God hath been pleased to tell us: for in such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines these things appertain to Reason, 1. To shew that it is not required to comprehend them: whatever God hath said is to be assented to, tho' we cannot frame adequate Notions of the Thing it self, nor understand the Manner how it should be. 'Tis as much against Reason as Faith, to think to fathom the Perfections, Councils, and Works of God; seeing Reason ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth him to be infinite, and it self finite. 2. If we will pretend to Reason in Religion, we are to believe whatever God hath said to be true, this being the greatest Reason that He, who is Truth it self, cannot lye: there is nothing more consonant to the transcendency of so high a Nature as that of God, than that it be acknowledg'd Incomprehensible; nor is there any thing more agreeable to his infinite Wisdom, than that his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs and Contrivances shou'd be held past finding out. 'Tis as well irrational, as unjust, to think that Man shou'd penetrate those Depths and Abysms, which the Angels desire only <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to look into, as vailed and hidden from sight.</p>
               <p>But on the other hand, tho' there are many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Holy Scripture which are above our Reason, yet most certainly there is nothing therein which is contradictory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. To admit Religion to contain any Dogm's repugnant to right Reason, is at once to tempt Men to look upon all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation as a Romance, or rather as the Invention of distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men: and withal to open a Door for filling the World with Figments and Lyes under the Palliation of Divine My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries.</p>
               <p>We cannot gratifie the Atheist and Infidel more than to tell them, that the prime Articles of our Belief, imply a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to our Faculties. In a word, this Hypothesis, were it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, wou'd make us renounce Man and espouse Brute in Matters of the chiefest and greatest Concernment: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out debasing our selves into a lower Species, we cannot em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51616:75"/>
any thing that is formally impossible. And when Men have filled Religion with Opinions contrary to common Sence and Natural Light, they are forced to introduce a suitable Faith, namely, such an one that commends it self from belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Doctrines repugnant to the Evidence and Principles of both. Thus the first Hereticks that troubled the Christian Church, under the pretence of teaching Mysteries, overthrew common Sence, and did violence to the universal, uniform, and perpetual Light of Mankind: Some of them having taught that all Creatures are naturally Evil; others of them having establisht two several Gods, one Good, another Bad: others having affirmed the Soul to be a Particle of the Divine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; not to mention a thousand Falsities more, all these they defended against the Assaults of the Orthodox, by pretending that they were Mysteries about which Reason was not to be hearken'd to. Thus do others to this day, who being resolv'd to obtrude their Phansies upon the World, and unable to prove or defend what they say, pretend the Spirit of God to be the Author of all their Theorems: nor can I assign a better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for the Antipathy of the <hi>Turks</hi> to Philosophy, than that it overthrows the Follies and Absurdities of their Religion; this themselves confess, by devoting <hi>Almansor</hi> to the Vengeance of Heaven, because he hath weakened the Faith of <hi>Mussel-men</hi> in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> through introducing Learning and Philosophy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them.</p>
               <p>In brief, Tho' we make not Natural Light the positive Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of things Divine, yet we may safely allow it a Negative Voice: we place it not in the Chair in Councils, but only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to keep the Door to hinder the Entry of Contradictions and irrational Fansies disguis'd under the name of Sacred My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries. And it is necessary also to be remarkt, that when we say there is nothing in Religion which is truly repugnant to Principles of Reason, we do not by Principles of Reason, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand all that this or that sort of Men vote or receive for such. The Universal Reason of Mankind is of great moment, but mistaken Philosophy, and false Notions of Things, which this or that Man admits for Theorems of Reason, are of very small importance; Men being misled by their Senses, Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Interests and Imaginations, do many times mingle Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and false Conceipts, with the genuine Dictates of their Minds, and then appeal to them as the Principles of Truth
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51616:75"/>
and Reason; when they are indeed nothing else but the vain Images of our Phansies, and the Conclusion of Ignorance and Mistakes. So that in reading the Holy Scriptures, it highly concerns us to be very careful that the proper and original Sence of the Words be not neglected: there have been those, and yet are, who will hardly allow any Text of Scripture a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sence, but do every where obtrude an Allegoric meaning, as if that alone were intended by the Holy Ghost, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else: but such kind of Expositors do in effect little less than undermine the whole Scripture, betray Religion, and turn the Sacred Oracles into Burlesque: Nor is there any Notion so Romantic, which the Scripture by a luxuriant Phansie, may not at this rate be wrested and debauched to give countenance to: yea, a very small measure of Wit will serve to pervert the plainest Scripture Testimony, to quite another Sence than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was intended by the Writer of them. An Instance of this we have in those, who by turning the whole Scripture into Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions, have wrested the Revelations of the Word to justifie their own wild Phantasms, and framed the words of Scripture <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to their own private Notions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by evacuated the Sublimest Doctrines and most glorious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, into empty Metaphors and vain Similitudes: thus the Person of Christ is allegorised into themselves, and the Birth, Death, Resurrection, and Ascension of our Saviour are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued after the manner of <hi>Aesop</hi>'s, or <hi>Phylostratus</hi>'s Fables, into useful Morals; as if these were intended only to declare what is to be done in us by way of Allusion. But leaving these, and supposing only for the present, that there has been a Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or Divine Revelation of the Almighties Will to Mankind, which every Moral Man will find his interest to believe and imbrace, if it were upon no other account than the Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Advantage it affords us towards the securing both a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and Eternal Felicity, by those Excellent Precepts it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains above what is discoverable in Natural Religion: Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing this, I say, 'tis reasonable for us to think, that there can be nothing in this admirable System essential to a Saving Faith, or fundamentally necessary to our future Welfare, but what is as intelligible as legible to every Reasonable Creature;<note place="margin">See a late Treatise of <hi>Humane Reason.</hi>

                  <hi>Most certainly the Essentials of Religion consist not in any intricate or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing Theory's, but in the Practise of our Duties. The Lord hath shewed thee, O Man,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>what is good; and what

doth he require of thee, but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> Again, saith another of them, <hi>Pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and undefiled before God the Father, is this, to visit the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therless and Widows in Affliction, and to keep our selves unspotted from the World. And it is in consequence of this Principle</hi> (saith the <note n="*" place="margin">Of this Treatise.</note> Author) <hi>that the whole Tenure of the Scripture declares unto us, that we shall be judged, not according to our Belief, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Works; witness abundance of Passages both in the Old and New Testament, particularly that of St.</hi> Paul, <hi>where he says that we must all appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ, that every one may recive the things done in his Body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. Religion lyes not in the barely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing this or that Opinion however Orthodox, neither yet in asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating our selves with this or that Sect of Professors, in admiring or following this or that Doctor, tho' even he were a</hi> Paul, <hi>an</hi> Apollos <hi>or a</hi> Cephas; <hi>but its important Work is to draw us from that which is Evil, and to engage us in the practise of that which is good.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>It is a wonderful thing to consider the Heats and Animosities which are sprung up in the World, from difference in Opinion in what we call Articles of Faith: Every Man will have his own to be the only true ones; nay some (alas too many) are so barbarous, that they not only condemn others to Death, but deliver them also by their</hi> Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma'<hi>s (as much as in them lyes) to the Devil and Damnation for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Opinion in some Metaphisical Speculations. It is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less certain that neither Christ nor his Apostles have tied the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind so indispensably to the particular Belief of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible Mystery, as some of the present Doctors of his Church now do. We read that our Lord himself pronounced St.</hi> Peter <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon the bare declaration, that he believed him to be the Christ the Son of the living God. St.</hi> Philip <hi>in like manner baptized the Eunuch upon no other Profession of his Faith than in the terms of this short Symbol, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. St.</hi> John <hi>teaches us plainly, that to confess that Jesus Christ is come in the Flesh, is a certain Characteristical Mark of the Spirit of God, and St.</hi> Paul <hi>explains himself in this point yet more particularly telling us, That if we confess with our Mouths the Lord Jesus, and believe in our Hearts that God hath raised him from the dead, we shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>

                  <hi>Cardinal has not stuck to acknowledge, That without the help of</hi> Aristotle <hi>we should have wanted many Articles of Faith: and that which aggravates yet more the Extravagance of these Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matisers is, that they themselves acknowlenge the Incomprehensibility of those very things which they undertake to explain with such Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Exactness, as if they had enter'd into the very Councils, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom'd the Depths both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God; we may therefore without Danger shake off the tyranny of those Prejudices that have possest us: the Names of Orthodox and Heretick are too partial and illusory any longer to deceive us, they have these many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges been made use of with so much Irregularity, Interest and Passion, that the ordinary Application of them cannot at this day be any just ground either of Assurance or Fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We may undoubtedly be assur'd, that the Righteous Judge of all Men, will not impute unto us the Guilt of any Criminal Heresie, so long as we sincerely believe what he has expresly revealed to us: and if peradventure we understand not clearly the whole sence of every Expression in which those things have been declared; we ought cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly for that very reason so much the less presume to alter them, or affect new forms of explaining our selves, and least of all to impose upon others, any doubtful Inferences drawn from such dark and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Premises.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But with Submission to this great Master of Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, I shall take the Liberty to reply this, That as I cannot think every thing a Fundamental in Religion, which some Men would perswade us; so on the other side, I am satisfy'd that there is more requir'd to Salvation, than some others seem to intimate. I can well enough comply with that Opinion,<note place="margin">See the Occasional Paper Numb. 1.</note> which supposes there is no more than one Essential in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, to wit, the Belief that Jesus is the Messiah, provided they take in the Genuine Consequences, and the Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults of such a Faith; such as his Divinity, his miraculous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, his Ascension into Heaven, and his coming to Judge the World at the last Day. Without these Attendants upon this one Fundamental, the System of Christianity will be lame and incoherent, and it cannot indeed be known what is meant by saying Jesus is the Messiah: A Man may say so much, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51616:77"/>
have no other Notion of him, than the Jews had who expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a Temporal Prince; but we must believe that he will raise our Bodies, and judge us at the last Day; not to instance in all the other Fundamentals which the Apostle mentions <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.1, 2. If we believe him such a Messiah as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture represents him, such parts of our Belief will have, besides the Explaining of our Faith, a great Influence on the End of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the making us good Men: for he that believes Jesus only a Temporal Prince, to govern him in this World, will never think himself so much obliged to conform his very Thoughts and Desires to his Laws, as he that is perswaded that he will one day judge him in another. Again, we ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things to be satisfy'd in his Divinity; for if we do not acknowledge him to be one God with the Father, and worship him accordingly, we neglect a Gospel Duty; and if we do worship any thing but the one God, we are Idolaters.</p>
               <p>As for his Satisfaction, a right Notion of it is of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that without it he that believes Jesus to be the Messiah, has no Notion for what he was anointed and sent, or of what he has done for us. These, I say, must all go along with that one Fundamental; and to our Belief of this, there is nothing more requir'd, than our Belief of the Authority of Holy Writ, where these things are plainly reveal'd to us. If we do believe the Scriptures to be Authentic, we must believe it our Duty not to dispute the Mysteries of Christian Religion: it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for us that we consent in our Hearts to what is there plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliver'd as to these Points, altho' we are altogether unskil'd in the Metaphysicks, and unable by the Principles of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, to account for the manner of Hypostatic Union, the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or the Resurrection; for this were to confine Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness to the Men of Letters, and to tye Salvation to the Schools.</p>
               <p>It is something pleasant (as a Modern Philosopher has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markt) to observe now adays, that the great step which makes an approved Christian as well as a Philosopher, is to talk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligibly, and to solve us one Difficulty by making twenty more. These, says he, are the Men in vogue, whilst the poor Man, that gives a plain reason for what he says, is put by for a Coxcomb, he wants profundity.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, should we go about to bring down the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Religion to the Model of our own Reason, we should
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51616:77"/>
wholly overthrow our Belief, and pay no more Respect to the Authority and Testimony of our God, than we would to a Worm like our selves. If there were no Obscurity nor Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in the Notions of Gospel Truths, where would our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and Humility be, which are the Qualifications that do most of all recommend us to God, and upon this account, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, because they prepare the Mind for Faith, and give Check to all bold and curious Enquiries.</p>
               <p>It is enough, if we can by Rational Proofs demonstrate the Bible to be his Word, whose Veracity is proportionate to his Wisdom, and both of them infinite: nor is it needful that its Doctrines should further adjust themselves to our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. <note n="*" place="margin">Interest of Reason in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                  <hi>Our Reason is often non-plus't about its own proper Objects, and the</hi> Phaenomena <hi>of Nature, and shall we think it a competent Judge of Objects to which it never was adapted? for it is below ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Works of God, and therefore much more below Mysteries of Revelation: here are many things which we ought to admire, but must never hope fully to understand; our work here is to believe, and not to enquire. If our Minds will not submit to a Revelation, until they see a Reason of the Proposition, they do not believe or obey at all, because they submit not till they cannot choose. Faith bears not upon Demonstration, but upon the Authority and Veracity of the Speaker: and therefore to believe nothing but what we do comprehend, is not to believe but to argue, and is Science, not Faith. Ye that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Gospel what you please, and what ye think fit, ye believe not, but renounce the Gospel, saith</hi> Austin <hi>to the</hi> Manichees, <hi>for ye believe your selves, not it. So that to believe nothing but what we can fully comprehend, is to remonstrate to the Wisdom and Power of God, at least to challenge to our selves an Omniscience proportionable to the Divine Wisdom and Omnipotence. Furthermore, it is true that the Rule and Measure of our Faith must be certain, but no Man's Reason universally is so; for what one Man's Reason assents to, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rejects: Every Man pretends to right Reason, but who hath it is hard to tell. If it be lawful for one Man to reject a plain Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in one particular, because he cannot comprehend it, why may not a second do the same with Reference to a Revelation in another Particular. For as the</hi> Socinians <hi>by making their Reason the sole Judge of what they are to believe, will not admit many of the prime Articles of the Gospel, so some Philosophers wou'd make their Reason Judge of what they shou'd receive, and their Reason at some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times will not admit the Gospel at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:51616:78"/>
                  <hi>Now the Certainty of Revelation is justly preferr'd to all other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and we are commanded to submit our Reason to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God in the Scripture, and by consequence we are not to set up our Reason for the positive Measure of Religion. The Sacred Writers do every where remit us to the Scripture it self, as the Rule of Faith, and not to the Tribunal of our own Reason. Herein are the</hi> Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>justly impeachable, for tho' sometimes they acknowledge Religion to be above Reason, yet at other times they speak in a very differing manner. Even in denying the Divinity of our Saviour, and at the same time paying Religious Worship to any thing which is not God, is acting contrary to the Reason of Mankind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis a very great unhappiness we labour under through the Difference of our Religious Opinions, and indeed a Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in Religion is by no means to be expected till Men grow less Speculative and more Practical. The real and sincere Practise of Piety, the Loving the Lord our God with all our Hearts, and our Neighbours as our selves, the keeping our Consciences void of Offence towards our God and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the holding fast no more than the whole form of sound words without letting of them slip: these, I say, wou'd quickly bring us together, and the Names of Sect and Party, of Schism and Heresie, would be altogether unknown to us.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, I doubt not of good Men to be found in every Christian Communion, nor do I look upon it any Scandal to the Profession, that there should be many Profane Irreligious Persons shrowd themselves under it. Yet on the other hand, tho' I am perswaded my Charity is well placed in this respect, I must be free to declare to you my Opinion, that so far as I am able to judge, there is more of Interest, Singularity of Humour, Influence of Education, Misunderstanding and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake about Essentials as well as Circumstances purely indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, than either a just, or indeed reasonable ground, for any Man to separate from the present establisht C — of <hi>E</hi>— I am sure 'tis thought no Blemish to that Constitution, that Men should be good and pious; and that they may not only be so, but have as great helps to their being so, as in any state of Separation, I am sufficiently satisfied: and I can say, I have met with few Separatists, how much soever bigotted to Non-conformity, who have not been ready to show a better liking to this Ch—than to any dissenting from it, except their own.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:51616:78"/>But whether or no this, or any other Ecclesiastical Form of Government, comes up exactly to the Primitive Pattern, I am not enough knowing positively to determine; yet considering the Nature of a National Church which must be so contriv'd and calculated, as to obviate a multitude of Inconveniencies, which cannot happen to any private or single Congregation: A Ch— which must be framed for the Reception of all Sorts and Conditions of Men, and the manner of her Worship a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to their different Capacities and Understandings: there is nothing certainly has the Marks of a better or more service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Contrivance, to answer the end of a Religious Institution. I speak in respect of her general Ecclesiastic Polity: for tho' there are many particular Flaws therein, which it were much to be wisht were better inspected; tho' the Pastoral Care is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some accounts very deficient, and that there are but too many Enormities, both in Life and Doctrine, committed by some of those who are intrusted in some Office under her, and who ought for the same to be Suspended or utterly Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; yet notwithstanding this, her Constitution is truly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and Noble: and seeing it is impossible for Men to Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the Secrets of each others Hearts, or to fathom their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, the greatest part of these Blemishes and Irregularities, are such as will <hi>almost</hi> unavoidably creep in to any other U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Church.</p>
               <p>The great Objections touching Form and Ceremony, are to my thinking no other than unreasonable Prejudices: and shou'd we, to gratifie the Humours of some inconsiderate Men, dispense with or lay them aside, I may be bold to presage, with a great Pillar of this Ch— That Religion it self wou'd quickly dwindle into Nothing, and there wou'd be no such thing as a Publick Assembly met together for the performance of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service. As for the Injunction of prescribed Forms to be made use of in our Publick Prayers, Praises and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings to Almighty God, they have beyond Controversie their proper use and advantage, and will by every impartial Judge be confest or acknowledg'd to be excellently design'd: for notwithstanding that frivolous and impertinent Objection of the Noncon— that we hereby stint or limit the Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and set Boundaries to its Power, and that a formal Worship was only invented to gratifie the lazy Humour of the Priests, we have not, according to my Sentiments, any other way to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51616:79"/>
petition Heaven as we ought, or as becomes the Supplicants to an Alwise Being, unless with our Modern Visionaries we can perswade our selves, that we enjoy at those Times some Supernatural Accession or Influence to inspire us, and that what we deliver, has no dependance upon our own, either natural or acquir'd Faculties, but is immediately dictated to our Minds by the Holy Spirit, and convey'd to our Organs by an extraordinary Impulse; for otherwise, whatever peculiar <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> Gift, Talent, Faculty or Quality some Men are endow'd with, of speaking readily without much fore-thought, there are few such Discourses, however pleasing to Sense and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by the Gesture or Deportment of the Speaker, or by his Air and Manner of Delivery, that will bear the Test of Reason, or be justify'd for the Sense and Grammar, even by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's themselves: and if so, I see not why such Men, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under the Infirmity of a mean and imperfect Delivery, a want of thinking rightly, as well as speaking, whose Sermons and Discourses, Prayers and Thanksgivings are incoherent, a Medly of Confusion, made up of a useless redundancy, of insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant words, of Circumlocution, frivolous Repetition or Tautology, where the whole is downright Nonsense; in such Cases, I say, I am not able to reconcile the Notion of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Inspiration.</p>
               <p>If we must believe these Men inspir'd from the Matter or Manner of their Expressions, here are scarce the footsteps of Humane Knowledge, much less the Characters of Divinity; and so far are the Discourses of this Nature from surmounting the Acquirements of Natural Men, or deviating in any thing out of the common Mode of Understanding, that every Prophane Hypocrite may play the Counterfeit, and the most extravagant Whim suggested to the Phantasie, has an equal Right of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a Plea for Inspiration. If we must believe they speak or teach by the Dictates of the Spirit, on the account of their more than ordinary Probity or Moral Honesty, their Devout, Holy and Exemplary Lives and Conversations, these indeed might sway us, were we not satisfy'd of the as strict Sanctity, Sincerity, and undissembled Piety of those, who as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to any special Priviledge of Supernatural Inspiration, are utterly averseto Ethusiastic Principles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:51616:79"/>Did true Religion consist in an affected Singularity of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, in a rustick or ungenteel Behaviour and Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the Dreams and Rapts of a deluded Phansie; or (to borrow a Physical term) were its Pathagnomonic Sign any set Garb or Habit, were a green Apron, a Riding Hood, a short Crevat, or a Hanging Coat, the only Characteristic Marks of Christianity, These Men above others, have a just Pretence to the Title of its best and chiefest Votaries: but if the real Acts of Devotion, such as Watchings, Fastings, Prayers and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications; if Charitable Contributions to the Relief of the Poor and Indigent; if Mortification and Self-denial in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Satisfactions, are as conspicuous and apparent, perhaps more in some others than in these, I see not the necessity of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them either to speak or act differently from any other pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and devout Person.</p>
               <p>'Tis not the Garb or Habit that makes either the true Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman or the true Christian; tho' most certainly, a decent plainness is very becoming, if not absolutely necessary to the Profession of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>The World, who take their Estimate of Things from Sense, are too apt to value one the other upon the Lineaments of the Face, or the propotionate Symmetry of other Parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and to measure each others Capacity or Mental Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by their outside Apparel: but these were never over-rated by the Wise and Prudent. There is indeed an Extream on either side; and as on the one hand an extravagant Dress looks ridiculous to the Sober and Judicious Man, and is very often the signal of Effeminacy, at best a Shallow Apprehension; so on the other, the stiff and precise Habit is very rarely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attended with a Spiritual Pride, a secret Desire to distinguish our selves from the rest of Mankind, and an overfondness to value our selves upon such Indifferencies, and to believe them in time some of the Essentials of Divinity.</p>
               <p>But to return to the prescribed Forms of Religious Worship, and particularly those enjoyned by the Liturgy of the <hi>English</hi> Ch— if we our selves, through a preconceived Prejudice, or the Influence of a different Education, can think them neither useful nor necessary, nor find our selves edify'd by the same, it behoves us however to be so charitable, as not to Condemn or Censure those who do. There is no Person in this Ch— was ever, that I heard of, so Childish as to think the Truth of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51616:80"/>
Religion, or the Advantage to be received by the Practise of its Duties, did consist in the Verbal Recitation of a Creed, in the Repetition of some certain Prayers, or the External Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with any other Performance: but since it is by all granted, that true Piety does consist in a hearty Submission and Resignation of our Wills to God, in the most humble Elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Minds to Heaven, and in our most fervent Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, Prayers, Praises and Returns of Gratitude: and since it is not only possible but certain, that in these Forms so well adapted and fitted for our Necessities, no truly Religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son did ever rest upon the Form of Words, but knows his Heart and Tongue must move together; it becomes us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Prayers, Responses, and every part of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Ch— are always new to every sincere Christian, and that they loose nothing of their Efficacy by being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. I shall not here insist upon their Usefulness and Benefit to the Ignorant and Unlearned; for notwithstanding we are to believe the God of Heaven will hear our Sighs and short E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaculations, yet where we have time and opportunity to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent our Petitions, to lay open our Wants, to acknowledge our Miscarriages, to beg pardon for our Offences, and Abilities to overcome the Temptations we may meet with; here, I say, it is expedient that we set a Watch upon our Lips, that we ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nothing unbecoming the Supplicants of the Divine Majesty, and that we pray sensibly as well as heartily: if we are so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to do this without premeditation, we are all of us left to our Liberty in our private Duties: we may pray either with or without a prescribed Form, which how ridiculous soever it may seem to the Dissenter, 'tis abundantly more so in my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that those very Men who most of all oppose a formal Prayer, shou'd themselves make use of one; for give me leave to tell you, that little acquaintance I have had amongst the Separatists, has inform'd me, that for the much greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, those who are conversant in the private Duties of Family Devotion, do still keep on in the same Road; and tho' it was first an accidental Form of Words they light on without fore-thought, yet that makes the same no less a Form, which when afterwards by the intervention of wandring Thoughts they at any time deflect from, those very Deviations render them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie, as any of their Hearers may perceive, and the rest is fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, incoherent and abrupt, till they fall into their wonted
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51616:80"/>
method of proceeding. This is so very true, that I can speak it upon my own knowledge, there are some sensible Men, in whose Families I have been for many Months, in some others Years, and all that time the Subject Matter, as well as Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Expression in their Prayers have been still the same, and wherever there has hapned any little variation by the want of Memory, or the intrusion of other Thoughts, unless they had a singular readiness this way, their Discourse would make their Hearers blush for them, if they did not blush themselves.</p>
               <p>Extempore Discourses, or such as are unpremeditated, are vastly differing in different Men: and even amongst the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastic <hi>Spiritati</hi> we find it exactly the same thing, <hi>viz.</hi> those Men who have the greatest volubility of Tongue, have collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the greatest number of Idea's, and received the largest helps from that Learning they at other times decry, speak the best Sense and most to the purpose; whilst on the other side, such who labour under a want of these, are scarce able to deliver their own Conceptions, or to let us know what they would be at; their Discourse proves burthensome, and very often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable to their own Hearers; on which account I have often times admir'd that there should be so many sensible Men among them, who have not yet discover'd the Delusion, but are content to saffer such an Imposition upon their Reason.</p>
               <p>Whoever rightly considers the force of Imagination, when it becomes heated by the Frantic Zeal of a mistaken Piety, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the deep Traces which by the several Objects are drawn out in the Brains of these Men, affording so many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Inlets to the passage of their Animal Spirits, will the less wonder at their Extravagancies, or be startled at their odd De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment.</p>
               <p>It is well enough known, that there are many of these Men whose Judgments have been so strangely prevail'd on, by the Delusion of some Spiritual Whimsie, that by the continual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging a particular Thought, the same has at length cut out so deep a Trace, or made so strong an Impression upon their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination, that not discovering the Fallacy, they have fallen into a Perswasion of Supernatural Revelations, Visions, Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Divine Illuminations.</p>
               <p>One of the admirable Instances, and perhaps the most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful President of Enthusiasm, or Religious Phrenzy that has been heard of, was not long since presented to the World in the Person
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51616:81"/>
of Mr. <hi>M—n</hi> of <hi>Water-stratford</hi> in <hi>Buckinghamshire.</hi> This Gentleman growing Hypochondriacal, labour'd under so strong a Delusion of his Imagination, as to phansie himself by a Special Revelation from Jesus Christ, to be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his sudden coming to Judge the World: upon which when our Saviour (as he thought) had several times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to him, and discourst him face to face, he selected a great number of ignorant People to be his Followers, who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed presently of what they had, and brought their whole Treasure into the Common Stock. Thus were they to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themselves from the World, and to spend the very short remainder of their Lives, in Spiritual Hymns and Prayers, in Watchings and Fastings, sometimes Singing and Dancing, Playing on Musical Instruments, together with the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Behaviour in odd Gestures and Positions of their Bodies.</p>
               <p>Thus they continued several days, till this unhappy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man their Ring-leader (whether by the constant Fatigue of his Body, or other ways) was seized, as I have been inform'd, with a violent Defluxion upon the parts of his Throat, together with an Inflamation on the Muscles of his Windpipe. During his Indisposition, there were some Gentlemen in his Neighbou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, with no small difficulty admitted to see him, in whose presence he behav'd himself as he had always done, with much Sobriety, Gravity and Devotion: his Discourse was Rational, and betray'd no such Deception of Phansie as he was possest with: He told them with a full assurance, and with all the confidence he was able to express himself, That as sure as Christ had ever been upon Earth, so certainly he had seen him, when perfectly awake, several times not many days before: and that he had discourst him concerning the approaching Destruction of the Wicked, which they wou'd find fulfilled, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in his Glory before the Consummation of many Weeks to come.</p>
               <p>He had as we have reason to believe, no apprehension that his Distemper wou'd be Mortal, but seem'd perswaded that he shou'd live to see all this accomplisht. But being thus unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly snatcht away from his Frantic Congregation, they were shortly after, to their shame and consternation, made sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that all was the Result of a distemper'd Brain in their Founder, and that the Infection was communicated to the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51616:81"/>
unthinking Multitude by the Power of Imagination.</p>
               <p>I have thought this Case the more remarkable, because ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been acquainted with a Neghbour of Mr. <hi>M—s,</hi> I have received full satisfaction that he was a Man very unblameable in his Life and Conversation, of tolerable Parts, strictly just in his Actions, and every way free from the imputation of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor or designing Counterfeit.</p>
               <p>That we may not wholly pass by the Causes of these strange <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> without essaying by some means or other an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, I shall take the liberty to assert, that however igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant we may be of the modification of our Souls, or the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our Perception, we are arriv'd to some certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what is transacted in our Brains in order to the same: for whatever Objects are represented to our Phansies, the same do make a more or less durable impression thereon; or, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words, they grave as it were Prints, more deep or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, according to our continued view of the said Objects: and hence it follows that our Animal Spirits have not only a more difficult or ready Inlet, into the Traces which are cut out, but also into those Nerves which excite the Motions of our Bodies subservient to us, or by whose assistance we procure to our selves the desired Object, accordingly as we have indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Thought of prosecuting the same. For the better illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration hereof, If at any time we are intent upon, or please our selves with any lewd Idea, if we keep the whole bent of our Minds upon the same, and are both solicitous to obtain, and uneasie till we have accomplisht our impure Designs. We must expect that the same, or the like Object, will make a very du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Print, or very deep <hi>Vestigia</hi> in our Brains; that the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into the same will lye always open, and the said Object is no sooner excited afterwards, but the Spirits as it were of their own accord rush in, and even compel us, almost contrary to our Desires, to will those Motions of our Bodies which were before employ'd in its prosecution and attainment. This is the true Mechanic Process, the Objects that are about us must excite in us some Sensation or other, and as we pursue or fly its appearance, or more or less keep up the Idea, there will be consequently the firmer or slighter Trace drawn out, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the same will either continually approach or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from us. So that by the repeated prosecution of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Object, these <hi>Vestigia</hi> are so very plain, and open, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51616:82"/>
afford so easie a passage to the income of our Spirits, that it is very much, if for a long time after the same should be oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, or the said Avenues blockt up.</p>
               <p>Again, It is by the frequent or reiterated Indulgence of our Thoughts, and cherishing our Idea's, that the Sensitive or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Soul gets the Ascendant over us: 'tis by these means that we contract our Habits, and in this the force of them consists, which when we have done all that lyes in our power to high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and aggravate our unhappy Circumstances, when we have after this manner suffer'd an ill Habit to get the Victory over us, and to subjugate our Strength, to allure our Passions to its free command, we then cry out of the Frailty of our Natures, exclaim against our Maker, or else justifie our detestable Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and foolishly please our selves in thinking, that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty would not have implanted these Appetites within us, if he design'd that we shou'd not satiate our selves in their Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: if not, they expect that however by their own volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Actions, they have with their whole strength heartily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the sinful Thought, and as desirously brought the same into a repeated Act, by which means the Traces in their Brains lye so open to receive their Spirits: here, I say, they expect Omnipotence to intervene, and by a Miracle to close up the Prints they have engraven, to snatch from them the Idea's they are hugging with all their might, or to intercept the passages of the Nerves, that their Animal Spirits may not fall into those parts, by which they are to obtain their short-liv'd Satisfactions.</p>
               <p>Surely there is no reasonable Man will countenance the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this Plea; nor can he who rightly considers the Fabrick of our Bodies, the Organization of our Brains, and the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for sensible Objects to leave their Marks upon the same, think it a fair Impeachment of the Divine Wisdom or Justice, especially if he reflects upon that high Prerogative we enjoy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the sensitive Soul; and that it is within the Sphear of our Reason to obviate these Disorders, to correct the Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities of our Senses, and by the practise of contrary Habits to set us out of the reach of those Mischiefs we should be exposed to. How these Disorders may be corrected, and the <hi>Vestigia</hi> which have been imprest by former Objects wiped out, I have toucht upon elsewhere: and indeed, were not Matters thus to be transacted, were our Objects elected to our hands, and we
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51616:82"/>
not able of our selves to choose some and reject others, I see not any business for the Exercise of our Reason, or any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage we could brag of above necessitated Agents.</p>
               <p>A considerate view of this kind of Imagery, thus trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in the Brain, will not only inform us of the Mode of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination, but will also give us some small insight into the extraordinary Effects of an over-heated Phantasie, and direct us to an Explication of some of the prodigious <hi>Phaenomena</hi> and extravagant Actions of our late Visionaries, or wild Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asts: who, by a constant application of their Minds to some particular Idea, come at length to have the same so strongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest upon their Brains, that the whole Systasis of the Soul is taken up as it were a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d loseth it self in its Contemplation: the <hi>Vestigia</hi> are so deeply cut, and all others at that time effac'd, that the tendency of their Spirits altogether is into these Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps, the Acts of Reason and Understanding are laid aside, the Result is this, They quickly grow giddy by an uninterrupted Thought upon the same Object, they fall into a sort of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and <hi>Delirium,</hi> at some times dangerous to themselves and those about them: they are possest with invincible Opinions and Conceits of extraordinary Illuminations, Illapses of the Spirit and Revelations: finally, by the contracted Disorders of the Nervous System, they are often seiz'd with very direful Paroxysms, believe themselves in Rapts and Extasies, and when the Fit is over, endeavour to perswade the By-standers, that they have been the Lord knows where, and received a Divine Mandate or Commission to do the Lord knows what.</p>
               <p>I was never over-credulous in the business of Possessions, but doubtless, according to some very impartial and faithful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, some of these I am speaking of have been pure Daemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacks, and the unaccountable <hi>Phaenomena</hi> they have exhibited, have been clear Indications of a Praestigious Delusion or Sata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Power.</p>
               <p>According to the Relation of a Learned Man, my late Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, whose Residence has been for many years in <hi>New-Eng</hi>— that Country has been the Stage on which abundance of these Tragae-Comedies (as he was pleas'd to call them) have been acted. He gave me at our last Conference, a very Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Account of several Instances of this Nature, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two, which I was almost surpriz'd at: their Names I shall designedly forbear to publish. The one had been a particular
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51616:83"/>
Acquaintance of this Gentlemans for some years past, He told me he always lookt upon him to be as Harmless and Innocent, as he knew him to be Ignorant: but of late he began to retire more than ordinarily from Conversation, and betray'd in all his Actions, in his Gesture, Speech, Motion and Behaviour, all the approaching Symptoms of a mad Enthusiast. It was not long before he betook himself to the Society of half a dozen Women, who seem'd to be at first deluded with the appearance of his extraordinary Sanctity; and without these he never stirr'd abroad. It hapned at one particular time that that the Q—r with his Women very ridiculously habited, drew near to my Friend's House, and seeing him at his Door crys out in a frantick manner, <hi>Stand still and see Salvation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth.</hi> The Gentleman, not at all surprized at the Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as having been well acquainted with his Life, and the Whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys he had been possest with, makes towards him, accosts him in a Neighbourly manner, bids him welcome to his Seat, and kindly desires him to take a Dinner with him; which t'other, after some little Pause and a deep Expiration, assents to, walks in, and his Women were about to follow him: which my Friend observing, oppos'd their Entrance, and wou'd by no means admit them in. He told the Q—r that for his part he shou'd be welcome, but he intended not his House, to be a Receptacle for Mad-women, nor such especially as were kept for a Spiritual Fornication. The Man cou'd not at first tell how to resent the Affront put upon his Women; but after some little Pause, walks to them, and orders their tarrying for him not far off: then returns and enters into my Friend's House, where they drank a Bottle of the best his House afforded; and till Dinner was getting ready, he calls for his Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, begins to tune it, and to strike an Ayre: which the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiast perceiving was extreamly disturbed, and being about to depart, the Gentleman told him he would desist, and play an Anthem upon his Base Viol, which he was sure would not sound harsh: Accordingly he prevails, sets the Instrument and plays a Psalm, when on a sudden the poor Man falls a sighing, sobbing, and roaring out. At length he begins to dance about the Room, and calls for his Women, that they might have the same Spiritual Consolation; for this he said was all Divine, it favour'd not as the other did of the Powers of Darkness, or the Carnal Kingdom. By this time Dinner was brought up,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51616:83"/>
the Gentleman could scarce perswade his Guest to leave off running about the Room, and to sit down to Dinner: but at length prevail'd; and during the time they were at Dinner, he was continually throwing out Scripture Metaphors, and wou'd have every thing from thence, however foreign to the purpose, to be an exact Simile or perfect Allusion. At length they parted, after a plentiful Repast, with a great deal of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.</p>
               <p>The more remarkable Instance, this Gentleman gave me at the same time, was of another Q—r in the same Town, who lookt upon himself to be of Heavenly Extraction, continually inspir'd and abounding in Supernatural Visions and Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It was customary with this Person, in whatever place he received either Civility or Disrespect, accordingly to denounce some Blessing or Woe, as if authorized by Heaven for his so doing. At a certain time he made my Friend a Visit, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the receipt of some slight Courtesie from him, by way of Requital upon his going forth, fell down on his Back, and there for a considerable time was most cruelly exercis'd with such violent Distortions and throwing about of his Limbs, such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Inflations of the Breast and Belly, such Convulsions of the Muscles of his Face, and forming at the Mouth, that the Gentleman cou'd scarce perswade himself these Effects cou'd proceed from any common Disorder of the Animal Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or be the Result of any thing less than a Diabolical E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergy. When the Decumbent was almost spent, be lay quiet for a little while; at length starts up, and in the usual accent of the Sect, crys out, <hi>The Tabernacle, the Tabernacle of the House of God, it shall be erected in thine House, and the Tents of the Lord shall be transplanted hither.</hi> My Friend hereupon calmly discourst him, and desir'd to know the occasion of his extream disorder. He reply'd, He had been all this time in Paradise, that he had discoursed the Lord Face to Face, and had this Message deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to him.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman and my self had a long Conference upon this Subject, together with the Writings of Mr. <hi>B</hi>— and Mr. <hi>K</hi>— some of the former, he said, he had considerately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd in the Latine Tongue. I found by his Discourse that he had formerly been inclining to the Q—rs Opinions; and was told by others that he had been very strict in that way, till finding himself growing: Melancholy, and likely to be seized
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51616:84"/>
with a Spiritual <hi>Vertigo,</hi> he happily threw off the Course of his Life, betook himself to the Study of Metaphysicks, and found his Disorder by degrees to wear of, by the help of Physick and the advantage he had of Conversing with Learned and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Men. He was a little surprized when he perceiv'd that I offer'd any thing in the behalf of Q—sm, and told me, That on what account soever I espous'd their Cause, he was satisfy'd that I cou'd not do it without a manifest Imposition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my better Judgment. The Experience, saith he, I have had of this People, and the intimate Acquaintance, both with their Principles and Deportment, has enabled me to know thus much, and I am so bold as to establish it for a solid Truth, that the perfect Q—r is either a perfect Lunatic or Daemoniac; and believe me, you will find this occur to your own obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that the looser the Q—r is, I mean, the less he is tainted with the Rusticity of their Manners, the Stiffness of their Behaviour, and the Ridiculous Gestures that appear'd in their Primitive Constitution, if at the same time he be a Man of good Morals, he is vastly preferrable in all respects to the Whimsical Precisian.</p>
               <p>There are many (continues he) amongst them that I esteem of, as of the devout and pious Ethnic, they have both of them the same Natural Light to govern themselves by, they are both of them Men of Conscience and Integrity in their Dealings: their Conversation is modest, yet withal pleasant, while they keep within these Bounds; they are some of the best of our Modern Deists; but so soon as ever they betake themselves to extraordinary Illuminations, to speak by Inspiration, and to fancy themselves directed in all things by somewhat differing from the common mode of Understanding, they are involved on a sudden in inextricable Confusion, plunged in Darkness and miserable Delusion, and truly it is the great Mercy of God that no more of them lose their Senses. The Men of Parts and Learning are the least subject to quit their Reason, and to have their Intellectuals blinded: and generally speaking, the Enthusiast is a Man of simple Education, an uncultivated <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> rude and illiterate, of a sedentary Life, much given to Contemplation, 'tho not able to digest his Thoughts: and 'tis no wonder at all, when such People come to be afflicted with Hypochondriac Melancholy, that they shou'd be seized soon after with a Religious Phrenzy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:51616:84"/>As to their peculiar Claim to the Divine Light, we have as little Reason to credit them as in their pretended Revelations. The Holy Spirit can neither be the Author of Absurdity or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherency in Discourse, neither yet of Repugnancy in Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Difference between each other and palpable Confusion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them all. Those who have the Grace of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or the Advantage of the Divine Light, will see a necessity not only to be acted by, but to think more reverently of the true Revelation of Christ Jesus, of his Incarnation and outward Sufferings, as well as of his second Coming to Judge the Quick and Dead. Now whatever these People may insinuate to the World, under the Notion of their Belief, there are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing several dangerous Heresies got in amongst them. They do most of them at the bottom, set up their own Light and private Inspirations to the written word, which their calling a Dead Letter, Food for Children, of little use to the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or such as are grown in Grace, do plainly intimate: there are many of them speak slightingly of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ridicule the Notion of Original Sin, and disparage or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit the manner of its Translation. They have none of them any other infallible Criterion or standing Rule of Faith, than a mistaken Conscience, which they Nick-name the Divine Light: This is plainly evident by their wild Enthusiams, the gross Immoralities among some of them, and the intestine Jang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings amongst them all. They do consult the Scriptures in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to an imitation of the Apostolical Writings; but alas, their high Pretences and Conceits are foil'd and qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ht so soon as ever we compare them: and notwithstanding their strenuous Pleas, with their seeming assurance that they have the same Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Spirit, and are equally inspir'd with the Divine Pen-men, I defie the whole Body of Qu—sm to produce me one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Instance, of any one of their Prophets that cou'd ever give the Proof and Attestation of their Inspiration, with the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Christianity: when they come to this, they most wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly prevaricate, and cry out with <hi>Mahomet,</hi> There is no need of Signs and Wonders. Believe me Sir, adds he, this late Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to Inspiration, is both the most egregious Cheat that was ever put upon the Christian World, and the most dangerous and destructive Fallacy that ever the grand Deceiver cou'd have invented or contriv'd. Weigh all things fairly and without prejudice, consider all impartially, and give the greatest scope

you can to the best of their Arguments, you will find all as pure deception, and as certainly false, as the Divine Illumination of the first Christians was most conspicuous and demonstrative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true. If we consider the tendency of this Notion, we shall find, that shou'd the World but once comply with, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the same, the Fundamentals of Government, both Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Ecclesiastic, wou'd presently be unhing'd, we shou'd have one Revelation in opposition to another; the Gospel of our Saviour, that Divine System of true Religion, wou'd be trampled under soot, we shou'd be expos'd in our Fortunes to the State of Levellers, in our Minds to Diabolical Illusions or Phansiful Suggestions: Our Religion wou'd soon grow volatile and fly away into Air and Spirit, a profound Sign o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> we shou'd find our selves in the midst of a destructive Ignorance and barbarous Confusion. I can the more readily presage this, having been much pester'd with these People in some of the Towns of <hi>New-Eng</hi>— tho' not altogether in such a manner as <hi>Germany</hi> has been with the frantick Anabaptists. I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take notice to you in one word more, that when ever you may happen to discourse these People upon almost any single Article of the Christian Faith, you will find that there are scarce two of them of the same Opinion: Their Igno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ance in the Explanatory part of Religion is so great, that for want of a settled Creed or generally establisht System, they will unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably clash and jar with one another: indeed, so far as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, they are capable of arguing nothing solidly but the Principles of Deism: and even their grand Notion of the Light, is as yet unprincipled, and as Mr. <hi>Norris</hi> says, unphilosophic, notwithstanding the two learnedest Props of their Cause have set it out to the best advantage their Learning cou'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nable them. 'Tis true, there are some of the most Judicious, who will talk to the purpose for some little time, but there is no keeping them close to their Argument. The want of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chistical Exercise to instil their Principles into those under their Care, has rendred their Religion rude and ill-shapen; and to me this seems none of the least Causes that the greater part of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51616:85"/>
them are so very unknowing in Divinity, that they can say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for themselves but this, that they have a feeling Sense of an inward Light which is sufficient to direct them.</p>
               <p>Thus ended my Friend's Discourse, which I shall leave with this short Remark, That for the most part his Idea's seem to be clear and Rational, his Judgment sound, and setting aside a little Heat, his Discourse in the main to consist with Truth, or Matter of Fact and Common Observation.</p>
               <p>Whoever consults Antiquity, or the Chronicles of the Times, may find many Histories of this wild Enthusiasm, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies that have attended this Whimsical Pretence to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration.</p>

                  <hi>I grant,</hi> saith he, <hi>that it is as possible in it self for God to reveal himself at some time hereafter, as it was for him to have revealed himself heretofore; but he that will assert the Futurity of this, must have more to prove it than a Possibility. It is certain that God has revealed himself, and that the Gospel was by Revelation from him: but there is nothing of the like Certainty for a Revelation after the Gospel, or in after times of the Gospel, as there is that the Gospel it self was of Divine Revelation; so that altho' I am not positive, but that there may be some particular Revelation or Inspiration with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to some especial Case, yet it may arise, for ought we know, from bare Imagination, and if not attended with the greatest Caution and Circumspection, may end in the Whims and Frensies of a</hi> Bridget, <hi>a</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharina, <hi>or a Mother</hi> Juliana, <hi>and what not: nay, it may proceed to the disanulling the Gospel it self, and to the preferring their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Inspirations (as they will have it) above it.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But again, The Scriptures conclude all with this Revelation, and because we have none other besides that written Revelation, we cannot suppose any Revelation beyond it, and much less derogatory to it, or that shall direct us to any other way by which we are to be saved, then that we have already received, and is therein recorded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to the Case of Personal and Occasional Revelation, which may be conceived only to serve to a more spiritual Manifestation of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation already made, I wou'd not altogether deny this, because I know not how far some Persons may, in some Cases, be inlightened by a Spirit of Prophecy, nor what particular directions they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in an extraordinary way in some special Cases, with respect to themselves, to others, and to the Church of God: which may be like a special Providence to some particular Persons, but now as a Man must govern himself by the general Rules of Divine Providence, and not by particular: and because he has sometimes met with Deliverances, Supplies and Directions beyond all his own foresight and reasoning, must not forsake his own Reasonings and Care, and wholly rely upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary: so it is to be here. 'Tis not impossible but a Person may have some occasional Revelation, some Divine Inspiration at an especial Season, or in some special case; but if he forsakes the ordinary to depend upon the extraordinary, &amp; expects a Revelation in every case, because he has had it in some Particulars, he will as much be subject to Errour, and err no less dangerously than if he wholly rely'd upon Divine Providence, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook all other means whatever; and truly this is a way much liable to be abus'd to mislead Persons, and is very suspicious as also dangerous. It is a Case liable to Imposture and Abuse, forasmuch as those that are under the Influence of such a conception, are not always, if at all, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of making a certain Judgment of it, for it is all transacted within, and the Imagination may be so much influenc'd by the Body,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51616:88"/>
and by an Agitation of the Blood and Spirits from an Enthusiastical and even Devout Temper, by prepossessions and fore-conceived Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and by the Circumstances of Life, that it may be wholly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, as natural as Dreams, or the Deliriums of a Fever, which proceed from an Ebullition of the Humours and such like ordinary Causes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is very certain that abundance of Persons have been imposed on, and taken the Effect of Imagination for Inspiration and Divine Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: I am far from condemning all the Instances of this kind of Hypocrisie and a Design to Deceive, like</hi> Maria Vesitationis <hi>in</hi> Portugal; <hi>I will rather think more charitably, that very often they have thought themselves thus moved and acted by the Spirit of God, and yet notwithstanding all their pretences, and the opinion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have had of them, it has been afterwards evident, that all has been far short of Divine Infusion or Illumination.</hi>

                  <hi>We are required in all Cases to search and try, which doth suppose the free Exercise of our Reason; and where this is rejected, 'tis a sign there is no truth in the Thing pretended: but farther, 'tis very suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious when Men exalt their own private Revelations to the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with the Revelations of holy Writ, and seek to justifie the one by the other; when they esteem the way of Religion as described in Scripture, to be mean in comparison of this that they are in, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this way of Contemplation and Inspiration, above the plain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Christianity; when it is a condescention in them to joyn in External Worship. A state indeed of Perfection that is above what the Gospel hath described, and is another Gospel than what we have in Scripture received, and which there needs an uncontroulable Evidence for: the want of which increaseth the suspicion. 'Tis certain that there is no Evidence for all this, beyond their own simple Affirmation, and who is there that without good Evidence can believe that those Rapturous Ladies</hi> (<hi>such as</hi> Santa Teresa <hi>and</hi> Donna Marina d'Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobar) <hi>did in</hi> Molinos'<hi>s Phrase, hear and talk with God hand in hand, when he reads the Interlocutory Matters that are said to have passed between them.</hi>

                  <hi>The desire of Revelations has so wonderful an Influence over the Souls, especially of such Women, that there is not an ordinary Dream but they will Christen with the Name of Vision; and I must needs say, the credulous World has been much imposed on this way: The Pretence abovesaid of</hi> Maria Visitationis <hi>is an Instance beyond all Exception, who impos'd upon her Confessor,</hi> (<hi>no less a Man than</hi> Lewis Granada) <hi>the Inquisition, and even the Pope himself, and yet notwithstanding she pretended to somewhat more than Internal, for her Converse with our Saviour,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>was at last detected of notorious Imposture.

                  <hi>From all which we see, what Evidence we have for the Truth of Revealed Religion by the various ways of its Manifestation, if we had such Inspirations, such Visions of things future and remote,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>what Evidence cou'd we desire more to attest and bear witness to what we are to believe and receive, and what Absurdities must we be cast upon, if we shou'd venture to call those Matters of Fact in question, which tho' peculiar to those Times, lose not their Force and Evidence, because they are not in our own, nor have been for several Ages, nor are to be again in the Christian Church.</hi>

                  <hi>'Tis true, when a Person is himself the Recipient to whom the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation is imparted, there is no absolute need of a Sign of farther Evidence to ascertain the Truth of it to him, when if God so please the Revelation of it self may be made as clear as it can be made by the Sign: but when the Revelation comes at second hand to a Person,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51616:90"/>
and rests on Humane Testimony, on the Ability and Sincerity of the Relator or Person supposed to be inspir'd, there needs some further Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, some Sign or Signs that may shew the finger of God, since all</hi> Men are Lyars, <hi>Psalm</hi> 116.11. <hi>that is, may be deceived, or may deceive, may either be so weak as to be imposed on by their own Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, or the Imposture and Practises of Evil Spirits, or so wicked as under the pretence of Revelation and Inspiration to impose upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. In such a Case, I say, no Man's Affirmation or Pretence is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily to be heeded, any farther than he is able to produce a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony as really Divine as he wou'd have his Revelation to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For as before said, all Revelation must have a sufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and if it be a true Revelation, it will be able to produce the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Revelation to another, how evidently and convincingly soever it may be represented to him, is nothing to me, unless I am fully assur'd that he has had such a Revelation: but that I cannot be assur'd of, unless it be by the like immediate Revelation, or by sufficient and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable Testimony. Since the former wou'd be absurd, and is not to be expected at all times, it is as reasonable for us to believe, where there are sufficient Motives of Credibility, as if we our selves were alike actually inspir'd, as they to whom the Revelation was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately convey'd: And if I mistake not, these Motives are to be resolved</hi> 1. <hi>Into the Veracity, Sincerity, and Credibility of the Persons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to Inspiration.</hi> 2. <hi>Into the Matter or Subject of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And</hi> 3. <hi>into the Testimony produced for it. By the Credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Person we understand his Probity and Sincerity, his Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Prudence, and Understanding, which render him worthy of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and are necessary Qualifications of a Divine Missionary: the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Prophet to others (as those are to whom a Revelation is made, and that are inspired by Almighty God) so as to teach and direct them in the stead as it were of God, whose Mouth and Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives they are to the People, is an Office of great Dignity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires somewhat of the Divine Image, as well as Authority, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them and their Message to others. I grant in the ordinary Cases, as there were Prophets bred up in the Schools or Nurseries of Learning and Morality, there might be such Persons as were employ'd without a strict regard had to these Qualifications, as Messengers that carried an Errand by the order of their Superiors. I grant also that God might, and did sometimes upon occasion, inspire such Persons as had none of these Qualifications to recommend them, as he did</hi> Balaam. <hi>But this was no more than when he opened the Mouth of the Ass, to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51616:90"/>
rebuke the madness of that Prophet, and who was so ever-ruled by the Divine Power, as against his will, to bless those whom he came to curse, which was so much the more considerable, as it was the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of an Enemy. But as Revelation is a Divine Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a Mark of Divine Favour, so it doth suppose in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, that the Person so dignify'd is duly qualify'd for it; and which is so requisite, in the Opinion of Mankind, that without it he wou'd rather be accounted an Impostor than a Messenger from God, and ordinarily have no more Reverence paid to his Errand than to his Person.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What has been thus said in general, as to the Morality and Vertue of the inspired Person, will hold for the most part as to his Prudence and Understanding, which is so necessary a Qualification, that the Divine Election of Persons for so peculiar a Service, doth in that way either find or make them fit.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Laying all this together, let us see what it amounts to,</hi> viz <hi>the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, Ability, and Integrity of the Persons to whom this Revelation is made, the Unanimity and Consent of Persons remote and distant in Time and Place; the Usefulness and Reasonableness, the Excellency, Sublimity and Perfection of the Doctrine they taught, the Testimony given to them by such Operations and Productions as exceed the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of created Causes, and are wholly from the Supream: where these are concurring, and with one Mouth, as it were, giving in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, we may say it is the Voice of God, and that it his Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which carries upon it the conspicuous Stamp of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>

               <p>You are well acquainted with a sort of Men,<note place="margin">For your farther sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction you may consult a late impartial Treatise of an Ingenious Author, in his Second Edition of the <hi>Snake in the Grass.</hi>
                  </note> I need not name them, who have amus'd the World as well as themselves, with a confused System of new Principles of Religion: These,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51616:91"/>
in their own Judgment, are arriv'd at so happy a state as to live and sin not, they carry it seems the Deity always about them, and will neither speak, preach nor pray, without a Divine Mandate; nay farther, their very Words and Expressions (tho' why or upon what account I know not) must be supernatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forced on them, and they will deliver nothing but in Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Extasies, or by Inspirations. If we tax them with Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities, want of Sence and Incoherency in their Discourse; or if we tell them that Religion is both a Reasonable and a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, they presently exclaim against Humane Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Arts and Sciences, and misapply that Scripture Text which they think pat to their purpose, <hi>Man's wisdom is foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with God.</hi> Thus, in the Opinion of these Men, we must shake Hands with our Reason, resign up our Intellectual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and become a sort of Idiots or insensible Statues: and thus all Religion must be resolved into a Spiritual Delirium or Dotage, a Sensless Stupidity, whilst the Learned Man and the Divine, the Christian and the Philosopher, must be accounted Terms incompatible.</p>
               <p>Whether the Name <hi>Enthusiast,</hi> is derived from them, or any other Pretenders to Revelation, is not material: but certainly, as they are a People, who above all other Religionists, have abounded in Prophetic Rapts, Predictions, lamentable Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and Denunciations of Publick Woes, Calamities and Judgments; so have they for the most part (if not all) been miserably benighted and overshadowed with Darkness: and there have been those amongst them, who when the Cloud has been remov'd, and their Imaginations freed from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity, have confest to the Sense of a Deception, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd the Delusion.</p>
               <p>'Tis more then ordinarily remarkable it seems of Mr. <hi>M—l</hi> that he scarce ever speaks amongst them, but in a sort of fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic or wild transport, he is delivering his Prophesies and Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticating the certainty of impending Judgments. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Mr. <hi>K—th</hi> sometime ago took notice to me, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many hundreds, he had heard him utter, not one had ever come to pass. I speak not this out of any Personal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, neither yet with a desire that any Man shou'd ridicule and contemn them. I have, I must needs say, too certain a Knowledge of the Honesty, fair Dealing, and Integrity of some in that Perswasion, to tax their Morals: And as for their
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51616:91"/>
Divinity, their fundamental Hypothesis of the Divine Light, if they knew rightly to explain it, or to account for the same, either rationally or intelligibly, I am ready to believe it might prove both serviceable and solid. The rest of their Principles have been deliver'd too loosely to pass for any Regular System, and it may be thought designedly, least they shou'd be found to clash and disagree. Their late intestine Janglings, their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions and Fewds, with their separation into Parties, give us reason, without the help of Revelation, to portend the likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of their Extinction; and as they started up at first al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most imperceptibly, so may they very probably, within the Compass of another Century, dwindle into nothing again. However, be that as it will, this is certain, They are not the People they were at their first Rise; at least, the greatest part of them: their quitting some of the Marks and Badges of their Profession, and their gradual Conformity to the Habit and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms of other People, which they now seem to think indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, is an Argument of this; and truly, I believe I may not err, if I take three parts of the younger People among them to be but nominal, or to act only in compliance with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of their Governours, on which account I am induced to surmise Q—sm may be but little longer liv'd than the Supports of their several Parties and Divisions.</p>
               <p>It is not without some Reason, that I impute your present Scepticism to the unhappiness of Circumstances attending your Education: we do not often find that when Men shake of their first imbibed Principles, they stick to any other: the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move is very commonly to infidelity; and altho' I cannot think you are to be discommended for quitting what you find nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consonant to right Reason nor true Religion, yet in this you are extreamly blameable, and I hope may live to see the danger, that from the madness and folly of some, you shou'd take the Measure of Divinity in general, and hereupon resolve all Religion into a pious Fraud.</p>
               <p>The People of other Churches, even the Church of <hi>England</hi> it self, meet together (you say) habited fitter for the Theater than a place of Devotion; They have their Prayer Books brought after them, they fall upon their Knees cry, Lord have mercy on them, they are miserable Sinners: they have done those things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they proceed and say, They believe in God the Father Almighty, and cry out Our Father which art
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51616:92"/>
in Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when this is over (nay a great many of them in the time of repeating their Prayers and Petitions) are viewing each others Dress, taking notice of the Fashions, and reflecting upon each others Deportment: the elder sort are thinking of their worldly Business, who will be their best Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and how to dispose of their several Commodities: and as soon as all is over, instead of retiring into their Closets, for the sake of private Devotion or Contemplation, they enter into Consult where is the best Wine, what Friends to visit, and to make merry, or where to walk that they may spend their time, as they call it, in some Recreation or Diversion.</p>
               <p>All this I must needs say is too notorious to be evaded, it is indeed as just as miserable a Complaint, and therefore as I shall not go about to extenuate the Errors or Impieties of these Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, so neither does there seem to want any other Reply than this, That Religion in it self is no more sullied by the Scandal of pretended Devotee's or Irreligious Proselytes, than the truth of any other Science by the Impositions and Cheats of an In-intruding Impostor. You must consider the People you are speaking of have no more Religion than your self, they go to Church with their Neighbours, whom they think wou'd other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise take notice of, and Censure them: but for their own parts their Principles are to choose, they never embraced any in such a manner as if they were certainly convinced of their Truth, neither have they any thing to plead for their sometimes fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting a Religious Assembly, such as their Parish Church, more than the Custom of their Country, and the Necessity that there is of Securing their Reputation. I question not however, but you may find some sincerely Religious, and truly affected with the Divine Service; Men whose Piety is as conspicuous in their Lives and Actions, as in their Words and Expressions, such whose Hearts are fervently affected with the Love of God, and whose whole delight it is, as well as utmost endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to live Godlily, Righteously, and Soberly in this present World, in order to the Securing of an Everlasting Happiness in a World to come.</p>
               <p>In a word, all that I have farther to say with reference to Reveal'd Religion, that compleat and setled Standard of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith, is this, that how diffident soever you may be at present of its Authority, let not the same by any means suffer from your impious Reflections: You are no ways able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51616:92"/>
the Matters of Fact, they may be true, and you have all the reason in the World to believe they are so: However, in the end, I may securely predict this, That it will be a much less trouble to you, your never looking into those Sacred Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, than your searching them with the foolish Patrons of Irreligion, only to furnish your self with a profane Witticism, or an impious Scoff.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The folly of such Derision</hi> (that I may give you the Sentiments of a Reverend and Devout <note n="*" place="margin">Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi>'s Sermon before the King upon <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.9.</note> Person) <hi>is very conspicuous, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering to whom the Injury redounds, by Mens making themselves so pleasant with their Sins.

Do they hope to slip beyond the Bounds of his Power, by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into Nothing when they dye? or to sue out Prohibitions in the Court of Heaven to hinder the Effects of Justice there? Do they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to out-wit infinite Wisdom, or to find such Flaws in God's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World, that he shall be content to let them go unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd? All which Imaginations are alike vain and foolish, and only shew how easily Mens Wickedness baffles their Reason, and makes them rather hope and wish for the most impossible things, than believe they shall ever be punisht for their Impieties.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>It is well</hi> (says the same Judicious Man) <hi>in the Age we live, that we have the Judgment of former Ages to appeal to, and of those Persons in them whose Reputation for Wisdom is yet unquestionable, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise we might be born down by that Spiteful Enemy to all Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Goodness, the Impudence of such, who it is hard to say, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they shew it more in committing Sin, or in defending it: Men, whose Manners are so bad, that scarce any thing can be imagined worse, unless it be the Wit with which they use to excuse them: Such who take the Measure of Man's Perfections downwards, and the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they approach to Beasts, the more they think themselves to act like Men. No wonder that among such as these the Differences of Good and Evil be laughed at, and no Sin thought so unpardonable as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is any at all: the utmost these Men will allow in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of Sin, is, That it is a thing that some live by declaiming against, and others cannot live without the practise of. But is the Chair of Scorners at last prov'd the only Chair of Infallibility? Must those be the Standard of Mankind, who seem to have little lest of Humane Nature, but laughter and the shape of Men? Do they think that we are all become such Fools to take Scoffs for Arguments, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51616:93"/>
Railery for Demonstration? He knows nothing at all of Goodness that knows not that it is much easier to laugh at than to practise it; and it were worth the while to make a mock at Sin, if the doing so wou'd make nothing of it: but the Nature of things does not vary with the Humours of Men: Sin becomes not at all the less dangerous, because some Men have so little Wit to think it so; nor Religion the less excellent and advantageous to the World, because the greatest Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of that are so much to themselves too, that they have learnt to despise it, but altho' that scorns to be defended by such Weapons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by her Enemies assault her (nothing more unbecoming the Majesty of Religion, than to make it self cheap by making others laugh) yet if they can but obtain so much of themselves, as to attend with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to what is serious, there may be yet a possibility of perswading them that no Fools are so great as those who laugh themselves into Misery, and none so certainly do so as those who make a mock at Sin.</hi>

This indeed is the true Language of Atheism, and the Cause of it too; were not this at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, no Man in his Wits cou'd contemn and ridicule the Expectation of Immortality; and yet I may be bold to say, it is a plain Instance of the Foily of those Men, who whilst they repudiate all Title to the Kingdom of Heaven, meerly for the present pleasure of Body, and their boasted Tranquility of Mind, besides the extream Madness in running such a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate hazard after Death, they unwittingly deprive themselves here of that very Pleasure and Tranquility they seek for, there being nothing more certain than this, that Religion it self gives us the greatest Delights and Advantages even in this Life also, tho' there shou'd prove in the Event to be no Resurrection to another:<note n="*" place="margin">

But the truth of our future Existence has had the Attestation of the Learned and Judicious in all Parts of the World. I have elsewhere taken notice of it, and must again inculcate to you, That Religion is somewhat more than a childish unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Fear of any pretended invisible Power, and that the Terrors it strikes us with are vastly different from those Tales about Specters, which do at some times frighten pusillanimous Minds: those that do arise from our knowledge of having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the Divine Being, or from the just fear of his Anger and Indignation, are such as do not only disturb some small Pretenders and puny Novices, but do approach even the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundest Rabbi's, or Masters of Atheism, it being well known both from Ancient and Modern Experience, that the very, boldest of them, out of their Debauches and Company, when they chance to be surprized with Solitude or Sickness, are the most suspicious, timerous, and despondent Wretches in the World: and the boasted happy Atheist in the indolence of the Body, and an undisturbed Calm and Serenity of Mind, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as rare a Creature as the <hi>Vir Sapiens</hi> was amongst the Stoicks, whom they often met with in Idea and Description, in Harangues and in Books, but freely own'd that he never had or was likely to Exist actually in Nature. Believe me, my good Friend, here is more in this than Prepossession of Phancy or Disease of Imagination; and if you object that had we not been told of these things by designing Men,<note place="margin">See the Discourse of Ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational Souls.</note> we shou'd never have thought on them our selves; the Answer is ready, who told these designing Men? if they thought of these things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being told, why may not others do so too? It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest enough to every Man, that his Soul, whilst in the Body, is capable to retire it self from Corporeal Images, and to be busie with Idea's of another Nature, which no Corporeal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression cou'd possibly make; and hence also it is as clear, that our Souls may operate and be capable of Pleasure and Pain when separated from Body. For if the Soul were no more than a <hi>Crasis</hi> of the Body, it wou'd be capable of no other Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than what arises from the Compression or Dilatation of Matter, or from the Obstruction and Turgescency of Humors. Since therefore we find it subject to Maladies, which spring meerly from Moral Causes, and which are no more curable by the Prescripts of Physicians, than the Stone or Gout are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd by a Lecture in Philosophy, we have sufficient Cause to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51616:94"/>
it of an Incorporeal Nature. Farther, The Essences of Things are best known by their Operations, and the best guess we can make of the Nature and Condition of Beings, is from the Quality of their Actions, while therefore by contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our selves, we find that we do elicite Actions, which do exceed the Power of Matter, and the most subtil Motion of Corporeal Particles, we have all imaginable ground to think that we are possessed of a Principle Immaterial as well as Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual.</p>

                     <hi>Vide</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of Reason in Religion.</note>He who considers that there is not one perfect Organ in the Humane Body, but the Parallel of it is to be met with in the noblest sort of brute Animals, and yet that there are divers O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations performed by Men, that no Beast whatever is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of doing the like, must need apprehend that the Rational Soul is not a Corporeal Faculty, nor a Contexture of Material Parts. To prove this, we have already instanc'd in the Acts of Intellection; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Acts of simple Apprehension. 2. Acts of Judgment. 3. Acts of Ratiocination. 4. Acts of Reflection. 5. Acts of Correcting the Errours and Mistakes of the Imagination. And lastly, Acts of Volition, or those whereby we choose and refuse by a Self-determinating Power, according as things are estimated, remaining exempt from all Coaction and Necessitation by the Influence of any Principle foreign to it. All these are impossible to Matter, because that acts always according to the swing of Irresistible Motion; nor can it be courted or solicited to Rest when under the forcible Impulse of a stronger Movent. So that whatever insensibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity you may fancy of a Soul divested of Corporeal Organs, you will experience, that as the Body is unconcern'd in any thing but Sensation, there will remain a Power of Exerting those Superiour Acts and Faculties which have no relation thereunto, and consequently a Capacity to suffer Pain or Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, the Rewards and Punishments of a well or ill spent Life, for it is not Sense but Reflection that wounds the Conscience: Sense, it's true, may divert the Pain, but can never make it; and when Death puts an end to sensible Diversions, the never-dying Worm may lash without controul. In fine, if bad Men were sure to undergo no other Pains or Horrors, and if the good were sure to receive no more Joys or Pleasures till the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, than proceed out of the Heaven or Hell they carry with them, and from the certain and constant Expectations
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51616:94"/>
of another, that might be sufficient, if well consider'd, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Men from Vice, and to encourage them to Righteousness: but the Scriptures intimate more, and plainly inform us, that the Souls of bad Men are immediately upon Death translated to a place of Torment, and the Souls of the Good to a place of Joy and Happiness; whether those Places are what we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally understand by Heaven and Hell, or whether or no the Completion of our Happiness or Misery shall precede the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Judgment, will not certainly be determined till we make the Experiment.</p>
               <p>Thus Sir, having given you my own, together with the more weighty Opinions of other Men, as to the Business of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, I hope the Light set up in your Understanding will put you upon Embracing what upon a serious attention to the same you find unquestionable. I am far from insinuating the Necessity of an implicite Faith, or perswading you to shut your Eyes, and leave the rest to your Guide: God Almighty has made you a reasonable Creature, and if you make a right use of that Divine Prerogative, you need not fear a secure Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage into the Harbour of solid Happiness. What pains soever some may take absolutely to exclude Reason from having any thing to do in Divinity, or however lightly they may esteem it, this will be found certain, that we have no surer Pilot when we first set out, to keep us from the Rocks of Atheism on the one side, and from Superstition, Polytheism, and Idolatry on the other: or indeed any other Director to secure us from making Shipwrack of our Faith, than the pure Acts of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Understandings, which I call right Reason.</p>
               <p>A Superficial Knowledge, may raise some unhappy Doubts, and a light smattering, especially in some kinds of Philosophy, may draw us into the danger of Infidelity, with respect to our Immortality: but all this we may be freed from by the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of a true Judgment, and a solid Enquiry in Physicks, or after the Nature and true Causes of Things, will with no other difficulty more than serious attention and application help us to dispel those Errors of our Intellects.</p>
               <p>It is not enough what some Men think, that a Man is able to account for some of the Appearances in Nature, by the <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Doctrine of Qualities and Forms, or the <hi>Cartesian</hi> of Geometrick Principles, and then in a foolish Exultation to cry out <hi>Inveni,</hi> or boast that there is nothing so abstruse, but
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51616:95"/>
will admit of a Mechanic Explanation. To give an Instance, 'Tis not sufficient that out of a Lecture upon the Opticks, we explicate the manner of Vision, by saying that <note n="*" place="margin">See Sir <hi>Samuel Morland</hi>'s Urim of Conscience</note> the Figure and Colour of a visible Object make the Base of an imaginary Cone, which is composed of a multitude of visual Rays, and instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convey'd through a lucid <hi>Medium</hi> to the Superficies of the Beholders Eye, where a Section of the Apex of that Cone is refracted by the several Waters and Tunics, and the Figure of the said Object, being inverted by the Crystalline Humour, is in the same posture lodged in the <hi>Retina,</hi> from whence it is convey'd into the common Sensory. Again, It suffices not that in hearing we judge that different Percussions do beget infinite Spheric Figures of Aerial Motions, which every where spread themselves till they meet with some harder Body that makes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, which suppose to be the Ear, in the Cavity of which the foresaid Figures of Aerial Motions, suffer several reverberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and then make a percussion upon the Tympanum or Drum (a nervous and pellucid Membrance of exquisite Sense) and from thence are convey'd into the Brain. However con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentaneous these Conjectures may be to the Truth, they are all, I say, too short of Satisfactory or Compleat Accounts: there are yet insuperable Difficulties behind, and we must expect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Disputes about the Matter and Modification, both of the visible and audible Species: But admitting these also were fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decided, that Light, Colours and Images are the same Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, that the Rays which cause the visible Species, are either certain Particles or Effluvia's darted from a lucid Body, reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed in their going forth, and reflected variously here and there, according to <hi>Gassendus,</hi> or that these Particles beaming forth from the same lucid Body, move other Particles of a Nitro-sulphureous Quality implanted in the Air, and as it were by inkindling them render them luminous, and these at length others, and that so a diffusion on every side of Light or Images is propagated by a certain Undulation, which is the more probable Opinion, if we may credit Dr. <hi>Willis.</hi> Farther, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting in the Case of Hearing, that the audible Species or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norisick Particles are a kind of Saline little Bodies, after the manner described, or some other way stirred up into act for the production of Sound: in a word, admitting the rest of the Senses, the Touch, the Smell and Taste, and all other <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> relating to the Humane Body, might after some such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51616:95"/>
be explor'd by the Corpuscular Philosophy; yet all this will not direct us to a knowledge of the Substance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our own Souls, the Speculations of this Nature may indeed inform us that the Being which exerts such admirable Powers, and judges so exquisitely of each of these Sensations, must it self be independent both of Matter and Mechanism. How then is it possible for any Man, without a wilful blindness or debauch of his Understanding, when he has made this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, and satisfy'd himself in the wonderful and divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of Structure in the several Organs destinated for so many Functions: how is it, I say, that this shou'd incline a Man to Atheism, unless, contrary to the Dictates of his own Conscience, he were resolv'd that way: or how can we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a reasonable Creature so strangely degenerate from the rest of Mankind, as to imagine where there can be nothing more conspicuous than the Workmanship of a most powerful and most intelligent Being, that the same at first proceeded either from no Cause at all, or one no better, <hi>viz.</hi> Chance or Fortune. So that to deal freely, I can do no less than believe, with a Modern Philosopher, That whoever does profess Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, and thinks not rightly of God, may be judg'd not only to have shaken hands with Religion, but with his Reason also, and that he hath at once put off Philosophy as well as Christianity. The sum of this Argument lyes here, That no Man can indeed scarce Reason at all, or to be sure cannot Reason rightly and be Irreligious: On the other hand, to be truly and indeed Religious is to be truly Reasonable: So that to put the Cause upon this Issue, let us examine what it is that Right Reason teaches us, whether it be to do Good or Evil: Let us consider whether it point out unto us a direct and sure way to future Happiness, or engage us in the Paths that lead to Destruction. For if in effect it be Reason that imprints upon our Minds any Notion of Irreligion, or that in any manner inclines us to Vice, we ought undoubtedly to reject it without the least Hesitation: but if on the contrary it appear, that true Reason be the only Foundation both of true Piety and real Vertue, and that any Pretence, either to the one or to the other, not built on Rational Principles, may in truth be no other than the Effect of Superstition or Hypocrisie, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51616:96"/>
our Search of Holy Scriptures; 'tis this must guide us in our Enquiry after the Founder of the Christian Religion; and when by our Reason we are perswaded of the Authority of the Sacred Writings, and that the Penmen thereof were Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally Inspired, which as is intimated before, we have abundant Reason to believe, we must then let our Faith take place, and not only assent unto those things which we can account for, but even of those also, which tho' not contrary to, are above our Reason, and must be acknowledg'd to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount our Apprehension.</p>
               <p>The Belief of a God, of his Providence, and of future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Punishments, is that Faith which is the true and only Foundation of all Religion, but the Foundation of that Faith lyes in the Perception we have of the Truth of those Things, by that general Light or Capacity of discerning which is imparted to all Mankind.</p>
               <p>All the Certainty, saith the pious Father <hi>Malebranch,</hi> which we can have in Matters of Faith, depends upon that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which we have by reason of the Existence of a God, and thus we see one inestimable Advantage derived to us by the right use of our Reason, and a powerful Argument in favour of this Opinion, That it is by Reason only we are made capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to lay the first Foundation of all Religion, which is the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Knowledge of the Existence of the Divine Being.</p>
               <p>If you expect any Definition or Explication of this word <hi>Reason,</hi> I may answer with a very Ingenious <note n="*" place="margin">In his Treatise of Humane Reason.</note> Man, That <hi>by Reason, is to be understood that steddy, uniform Light that shines in the Minds of all Men; that Divine Touchstone or Test by which all Men are enabled (so far I mean as they are able) to discern the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity and Incongruity of Propositions, and thereupon to pronounce them true or false.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>There are indeed different degrees of Clearness in the Intellectual Perception of different Men, occasion'd by the different Degrees of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in themselves, and the different Representation of Things from without; but the Light by which all things are discerned, is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally one and the same.</hi>

                  <hi>By Religion I understand the Belief of the Existence of a God, and the sense and practise of those Duties that result from the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we have of Him, of our Selves, and of the Relation we stand in to Him, and to our fellow Creatures. The Existence of a God is demonstrable from the Necessity of admitting some first Cause of all Things; whatsoever that Cause be, I call it God: and the Idea that we have of this powerful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

By the Being then of God, I mean the first Principle of all Things, He that made all Things what they are, and endow'd them with all their different Powers and Vertues, from whence I conclude him to be a Being abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perfect. My own Existence is a Self-evident Principle: No Reflection can give unto a Philosopher any greater Assurance of his own Existence, than the intimate Perswasion that every Plowman has of his without Study or Meditation. Now the Idea that Men have of themselves is twofold, Material and Immaterial: The Material part of Man is his Body, which is evidently subject to the general Laws of Matter, and liable to all the Mutations that are incident to other Material Beings. The Immaterial part is his Mind, which disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it self in his Capacity of Thinking and Reasoning: for Thought exceeds the power of Matter, that therefore which thinks,</hi> viz. <hi>the Mind or Soul of Man, is not material, and by consequence not subject to the Laws of Matter, nor lyable to the Mutations that are incident to Matter, but capable of a Subsistence, notwithstanding any Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or Dissolution that shall happen to the parts of his Body.</hi>

If we consider the Relation that we stand in towards one another, the Law of God obliges us indespensably to Truth, Equity, Charity, Benevolence, and to every thing which tends to the Settlement of Societies, or to the general Welfare of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; for every particular Man's greatest Interest being involved in the Interest of the whole, the Observance of such Things, as tend to the general Good, is every particular Man's Duty, and is not to be transgrest for the sake of any lesser or private Advantage.</hi>

The Observance of these Rules is a Duty Incumbent upon Mankind by the said Law of God; the breach of any of them is a breach of God's Law, an Offence against the Law-maker, or a Sin. Laws are of no vigour unless inforced by Rewards and Punishments, which are therefore to be proportion'd to the Nature and Degree of the Observance and Transgression of the Laws. The Observance and

               <p>This I take to be the pure Language of Impartial Reason, unassisted by Revelation; and they seem indeed to be the most Natural Inferences which can be drawn from truly Rational Propositions: whatever false Deductions or Conclusions some Mens false Judgments have invented for the support of their wretched Cause, the Fallacy is soon detected, and a stricter Inquisition will soon lay open the grand Absurdities of their mischievous Opinions. But truly 'tis plain enough, tho' some Men may be reputed a sort of Reasoning Atheists, yet the much greater part of them are Infidels by Imitation, and so far from being able to oppose the Truth of the Divine Being, the Certainty of Reveal'd Religion, or their own Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they scarce ever gave themselves time to consider seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously the meaning of the Words. These have no quarrel with Religion on the Account of its Truths, not being firmly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough establisht; but their Pique proceeds from hence, that they fear it will lay them under a Necessity of putting a Check to their Exorbitant Desires, and hinder them in the Pursuit of their Vitious Inclinations.</p>

            <head>The Appendix. Concerning the Corruption of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Necessity of Divine Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To Mr. —</head>
            <p>THere remains, my Friend, as a necessary Suppliment to what has been so lately deliver'd, that we make a short Enquiry into the Nature of the Divine Grace; I mean, that we consider whether or no there is an absolute Necessity of any Extraordinary or Supernatural Accession of Aid or Assistance to the Security and Confirmation of our Faith and Practise, or if with <hi>Pelagius,</hi> we are to conceive our selves able, by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Powers of our own Souls, or the free Exertion of our Rational Faculties (exclusive of this extraordinary Co-operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to obtain the same, and that Grace (according to this He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Opinion) consists only in the free Pardon of our Sins through the Mediator, and the Doctrine and Perswasions on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a Holy Life, for the time to come, with God's ordinary Concurrence.</p>
            <p>If the former of these Opinions be true, that there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what necessary which is independent on the Powers of our own Souls, we may be able to satisfie our selves, in that it is possible to give credit to the Truths of Religion, and yet at the same time to neglect their Practise; but if the latter be the most consonant to the Truth, it will be then, as I imagine, scarce conceivable that any Man, who is satisfy'd in the Verity of Religion, shou'd at the same time be negligent or remiss in the performance of what his Faith requires, or deflect out of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51616:99"/>
the Paths which he knows will conduct him to his greatest Happiness. At this rate, we must think every Man who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves does practise accordingly, and that whatever Verbal Confessions we may meet with of their Creeds, yet if they act not steddily in conformity to the same, we are to suppose there is a certain Diffidence intermixed with their Faith, a sort of Disbelief, or at the least, a distrust of the Certainty of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Truths, which they think may be no more than empty Notions.</p>
            <p>But this Opinion seems so directly opposite both to right Reason and the Experience of Mankind, that to admit it we must Exclude the whole Creation from any just Claim to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Happiness, and take for granted that there never was such a Thing as a Religious Man, or a true Believer in the World. On the contrary, as we have no reason to question, but that there have been vast numbers, both of Men and Women, who have been as convincingly satisfy'd of the Truth of the Supreme Being, and their Soul's Incorruptibility, as of any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: so may we safely assert, that there never was any one of these, who has not at certain times been an actual Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, or a Trespasser against his Faith. And farther, that in whatever State of Purity the first Man was created, yet since the Lapse or Degeneracy of Humane Nature from its Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Perfection, there is no Man able, without the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of this <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or <hi>Divinium aliquid</hi> we are treating of, to live in a real Contempt of the present World, or to disregard its manifold Temptations.</p>
            <p>It is besides my Intention to make a scrutinous Enquiry, How the first Man came to fall from Original Righteousness, or how this Degeneracy comes to be derived from him to his Posterity. It seems hard indeed to perswade our selves that the Rational Soul is immediately contaminated with this Sin, but is so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, so soon as we become capable of sinning: so that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a right Notion of the Matter, the Damage we have su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained proceeds from our first Parents unhappy Forfeiture of Immortality; since which it is impossible, without Divine Assistance, for Mankind, thus propagated in the constant Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Nature, to secure themselves from Falling, and from rendring themselves obnoxious to a Transgression of the Laws of God.</p>

               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:51616:99"/>I know the Atheist does here wonderfully pride himself, in having found out an Objection impossible to be resolved by our finite Understandings: For, saith he, if the Grace of God be sufficient for all Men, and that the Co-operation of Man's Will to sufficient Grace, is to be conceived the Cause of his Election, why did not God so constit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:51616:100"/>Whoever looks upon our Modern Deism any otherwise than disguised Atheism, will find himself deceiv'd: for my own part I never yet heard of any one of them that cou'd forbear, at one time or other, giving us to understand that he was the modester sort of Infidel; and whatever advantage it may be to their Principles, this is certain, that there is scarce a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, Irreligious Person or Libertine about the Town, who pretends not to be a very devout Deist.</p>
            <p>As to their wild Ravings against the Christian Religion, we have no occasion to reply other ways than this; That had Christianity been all transacted behind the Curtain, or in the Clouds; had its Founder been as invisible as the King of the Pharies; or were the History of Christ no better attested than those of the Mythologists, who talk of once upon a time, and the Land of <hi>Utopia,</hi> we shou'd then, I say, have no small grounds for our Hesitation: but since we find it otherwise, and that all was acted openly at Noon-day, before the Face of the Multitude; since not only the Names of Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, but their Lives and stupendious Actions, together with a Narrative of their Sufferings and Deaths, are deliver'd to us by as undoubted Testimony as it is possible for any other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact to be, and stand upon perpetual Record: their Adversaries will be lookt upon as a brain-sick People, and no Man in his Wits will think this Religion soil'd, till it is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionably proved, that there never were such Persons on the Earth as our Saviour and his Disciples; or that they never performed those works of which it is reported they were the Authors; till they can do this, it signifies nothing at all that they cannot reconcile the want of a Mediator, or the Mystery of Man's Redemption by the Sufferings of Christ, to their own crack-brain'd Fancies, or to their own Notions of the Divine Attributes.

Before Man eat of that, his lower Soul was in perfect Subordination to his Mind, and every Motion of his Appetite did attend the Dictates of his Reason, and obey them with that resignation or ready willingness, with which our outward Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do execute the Will's Commands: then any thing, however grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Senses, was no otherwise desir'd than a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> but as it does again establish the Subordination of the Sensual to the reasonable part within us: that is, till by denying Satisfaction to the Appetite (which is now irregular and disorderly in its desires) we have taught it how to want them, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent without them, and by that means have subdued its Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
            <p>According to this great Man, the Corruption of our Nature does not lye in the Mind, but only in the lower Soul; and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is no more than the reducing that lower Soul to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to its superior, the Mind: but because this plain Point has been made a mighty Mystery by some People, I shall yet farther explain it. When Man by his Fall had incurr'd the Penalty of Death, and became a Mortal Creature, he thereby usher'd in Diseases and Infirmities, the Fore-runners of Death and Dissolution, and therefore propagated unequal Mixtures
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51616:101"/>
and Constitutions, which naturally, according to the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the Mixture, raises powerful and pressing Lusts and Passions, which not only make violent and repeated storms upon Reason, but they also interrupt her Operations in other Duties, by the frequent touches of the Animal Spirits, upon that Image in the Brain of the Beloved Action, and intrudes it among our Thoughts whether we will or no: and for this cause (tho' in other things we are reasoning Men) when the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is toucht, we can scarce understand a plain Conclusion from plain Premises; till the gratifying of the prevailing Lusts has wasted many of our sensible Spirits, and then Reason freed from Violence puts on Shame and Remorse for her Defeat: but no sooner is Nature recruited than Reason is prest to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her Repentance. And this is the best of our degenerate Condition: for in most Men, either through the want, or the abundance, or irregular Motions of the Animal Spirits, the reasoning Faculty is generally obstructed, and they reason weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in every thing: nay, sometimes this power is quite blockt up, and some Men become distracted, others meer Changlings. But besides that, in the best of us the Reasoning Power is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten obstructed, and has forcible Inclinations to deal with: the work of Reason in general, is by the first Apostacy abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increased: She must maintain Patience and Submission un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Diseases, Pains, Infirmities, Poverty, Loss of Parents, Husbands, Children and Friends: She must maintain Charity and Humility in the Rich and Wise, command Visits to the Sick, Assistance to the Prisoner, Fatherless and Widows: but in the State of Innocence there were no Objects for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of these and many more Vertues, nor no Provocations to the contrary Vices: all these are the Natural Consequences of <hi>Dust thou art, and to Dust thou shalt return</hi>; and of that Curse which was the Consequence of Man's Transgression. It is here that we see the Reason why the first Covenant was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory, <hi>The day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely dye,</hi> because Man was blessed with an ability to keep his Covenant with God: but through the greatness of Mercy in the Second, we are promis'd the assistance of the Holy Spirit, and when we fall (as the best of us must with our utmost care) God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to accept of our Repentance, knowing it impossible for Man, under his present Circumstances, and the manner of his Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication, to keep himself free from Sin. To be short, in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:51616:101"/>
the State of Innocence Constitutions were regular, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Reason was strong and uninterrupted in her Operations, and her Work was short and easie; but by the Apostacy they became irregular, the strength of Reason was impaired, her Operations interrupted, and variety of hard Works, which were not in the primitive State, are now become our Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Service.</p>
            <p>I must confess my self better pleas'd with this account, than many others I have met with, and chiefly for its placing the Corruption of our Nature in the sensitive or inferiour Soul: for notwithstanding <hi>Cartes</hi> and his Followers have disallow'd the Division, and will by no means comply that there should be any more than one and the same Soul, and that those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine Conflicts between the Flesh and Spirit, which we do all at sometimes experience, do arise only from a determination of the Spirits by the Will one way, and from another deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of them by the Corporeal Appetite, yet the Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion elsewhere given, as it is more consistent with holy Writ, so it is likewise with the Belief of the greater number of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, who have solidly establisht this Doctrine of a Duality of Souls in every individual Man. But leaving this, we must all grant him to be a Creature endow'd with Reason, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing him to be such, it will be now worth the Enquiry how it comes to pass that he shou'd be so very incident to Failings, and to act even against the clearest and most demonstrative Reason. There have been several Attempts made to explain this Matter, by several Men: some of which will have the Cause to proceed from certain Errors or Mistakes in Judgment, for, say they, since it is impossible that Man, as he is endow'd with Reason, shou'd <hi>appetere Malum, qua Malum,</hi> whatever he makes choice of, tho' in it self never so great an Evil, must be offer'd to his Appetite under the Disguise of some certain good of which he believes himself to stand in need: and thus, through the want of due Consideration, or Errors of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, the <hi>Bonum apparens</hi> takes place of the <hi>Bonum reale</hi>; and thus likewise it happens that the <hi>Bonum vicinum</hi> puts in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Bonum remotum.</hi>

               <hi>so stablisht and setled a Maxim by the general Consent of Mankind, that Good, or the greater Good determines our Wills: that I do not at all wonder, that when I first publisht my Thoughts upon this Subject, I took it for granted: and I imagine, that by a great many I shall be thought more excusable for having then done so, than that now I have ventur'd to recede from so receiv'd an Opinion, but yet upon a stricter Enquiry I am forced to conclude, that Good, even the greatest Good, tho' apprehended and acknowledg'd to be so, does not determine the Will, until our desire proportionally raised to it, makes us uneasie in the want of it.</hi>

               <hi>Convince a Man never so much, that Plenty has its Advantages above Poverty; make him see and own that the handsome Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of Life are better than nasty Penury; yet as long as he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the latter, and finds no uneasiness in it, he moves not, his Will is never determined to any Action that shall bring him out of it. Let a Man be never so well perswaded of the Advantages of Vertue, that it is as necessary to him who has any great aims in this World, or Hopes in the next, as Food to Life; yet, till he hungers and thirsts after Righteousness, till he feels an uneasiness in the want of it, his Will is not determin'd to any Action in pursuit of this confessed greater Good, but any other uneasiness he feels in himself, shall take place, and carry his Will to other Actions. Let the Drunkard see that his Health decays, his Estate wasts, Discredit and Diseases, and the want of all things, even of his beloved Drink, attends him in the Course he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; yet the Returns of Uneasiness to miss his Companions, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual thirst after his Cups at the usual time, drives him to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, tho' he hath in his view the loss of Health and Plenty, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of the Joys of another Life: the least of which is no inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Good, but such as he confesses is far greater than the tickling his Palate with a Glass of Wine, or the idle Chat of a soaking Club. 'Tis not for want of viewing the greater Good, for he sees and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges it, and in the Intervals of his drinking Hours, will take Resolutions to pursue the greater Good: but when the Uneasiness to miss his accustomed Delight returns, the greater acknowledg'd Good loseth its hold, and the present Uneasiness determines the Will to the accustom'd Action, which thereby gets stronger footing to prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the next occasion: tho' he at the same time make secret Promises to himself, that he will do so no more: this is the last time he will act against the attainment of these greater Goods: And thus be it from time to time in the state of that unhappy Complainer,</hi> Video Meliora, proboque, Deteriora sequor; <hi>which Sentence, allowed

            <p>
               <hi>If we enquire now into the Reason, of what Experience makes so evident in fact, and examine why 'tis Uneasiness alone operates on the Will, and determines it in its Choice, we shall find that we being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable but of one determination of the Will to one action at once, the present uneasiness that we are under, does naturally determine the Will in order to that Happiness we all aim at in all our actions; foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as whilst we are under any Uneasiness, we cannot apprehend our selves happy, or in the way to it. Pain and Uneasiness being by every one concluded and felt to be inconsistent with Happiness, spoiling the relish even of those good things we have: a little Pain serving to marr all the Pleasure we rejoyc'd in, and therefore that which of course determines the Choice of our Will to the next Action, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be the removing of Pain as long as we have any left, as the first and necessary step towards Happiness.

                  </gap>, because that alone is present, and 'tis against the nature of things, that what is absent should operate where it is not. I know it may be said that absent Good may, by Contemplation, be brought home to the Mind, and made present; the Idea indeed may be in the Mind, and viewed as present there, but nothing will be in the Mind as a present good, able to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terballance the removal of any Uneasiness we are under, till it raises our Desire, and the Uneasiness of that has the prevalency in determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Will. Till then, the Idea in the Mind, of whatever Good is there only like other Idea's, the Object of bare unactive Speculation, but operates not on the Will, nor sets us on Work, the Reason whereof I shall shew presently.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>How many are to be found that have had lively Representations set before their Minds, of the unspeakable Joys of Heaven; which they acknowledge both possible and probable too, who yet would be content to take up with their Happiness here, and so the prevailing Uneasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Desires, let loose after the Injoyments of this Life, take their turns in determining their Wills, and all that while they take not one step, are not one jot moved towards the good things of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life, consider'd as never so great. Were the Will determin'd by the view of Good, as it appears in Contemplation greater or less to the Understanding, which is the state of all absent Good, and that which in the received Opinion the Will is supposed to move to, and to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by: I do not see how it cou'd ever get loose from the infinite Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Joys of Heaven, once propos'd and consider'd as possible; for all
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51616:103"/>
absent Good, by which alone barely propos'd and coming in view, the Will is thought to be determined, and so to set us on Action, being only possible, but not infallibly certain: 'tis unavoidable that the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater possible Good should regularly and constantly determine the Will in all the successive Actions it directs; and then we should keep constantly and steddily in our course towards Heaven, without ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing still, or directing our Actions to any other end: the Eternal Condition of a future State infinitely outweighing the Expectation of Riches or Honours, or any other Worldly Pleasures we can propose to our selves, tho' we shou'd grant these the more probable to be attain'd; for nothing future as yet in possession, and so the Expectation even of these may deceive us: if it were so that the greater Good in view de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the Will, so great a Good once proposed cannot but seize the Will, and hold it fast to the Pursuit of this infinitely greatest Good, without ever letting it go again; for the Will having a power over and directing the Thoughts, as well as other Actions, will hold the Contemplation of the Mind fixed to that Good. This would be the state of the Mind and regular tendency of the Will in all its determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, were it determin'd by that which is consider'd and in view the greater Good: but that it is not so, is visible in Experience, the infinitely greatest confessed Good being often neglected to satisfie the successive uneasiness of our Desires, pursuing trifles. But tho' the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est allowed, even everlasting unspeakable Good, which has sometimes moved and affected the Mind, does not stedfastly hold the Will; yet we see any very great and prevailing Uneasiness, having once laid hold on the Will, lets it not go, by which we may be convinced what it is determines the Will: thus any vehement Pain of the Body, the ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable Passion of a Man violently in Love, or the impatient Desire of Revenge keeps the Will steddy and intent; and the Will thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd, never lets the Understanding lay by the Object, but all the Thoughts of the Mind and Powers of the Body are uninterruptedly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd that way, by the determination of the Will influenc'd by that topping Uneasiness, as long as it lasts; whereby it seems to me evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Will or Power of Setting us upon one Action in preference to all other, is determin'd in u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51616:103"/>
to suppress those inordinate Desires which occasion this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness; 'tis that which must heighten in us a desire of a more durable Happiness, and Content, and render us dissatisfy'd till we have conquer'd our unruly Appetites, and brought them into subjection to the Will of Him who made us. It is neither a bare knowledge of the ill Tendency of our Designs or Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 'tis neither want of Consideration nor Deliberation nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the over-looking the Necessity of a Supernatural Concurrence, a disregard to the Divine Grace, and a total Dependance upon the Powers of our own Souls, that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally occasions our repeated Failings, even against our clearest Knowledge and Intentions of doing otherwise. A due Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and deliberate Attention to what we are about to act, will, I grant, be very serviceable to suspend the Execution of our Designs for some little time, and to keep our Minds, as it were, in <hi>Aequilibrio:</hi> but if we are remiss in seeking for Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Strength beyond our own, or if we depend upon our own Sufficiency, 'tis a very great Chance but our Sensations will over-set us, and the Impetuosity of our Passions prevail upon us. We may set our selves upon a Contemplation of those solid Truths, which present themselves to our most seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and abstracted Speculations, but our sensible Idea's are so continually crowding in upon us, and fill up so great a part of our Minds, by the Sensations they excite, which are always present to us, that it is but seldom that we finish our Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without some sensible Interruption: or if we do, it is not long before some pressing and importunate Desire of Sense intercepts the Light of our Understanding, and we are brought into a slavish Vassalage, by the gratifying its Desires; so that however light we make of it, or how much soever we contemn it, there is nothing can secure us in the Prosecution of our greatest Good or Happiness, but a just regard to, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Consultation with the Divine <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But for the better establishment of this necessary Truth, I shall insert some of the Sentiments of the Devout <hi>Malebranch,</hi> who in a Discourse of the great Advantages our Sensations have over the pure Ideas of the Mind, expresses himself as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It seemeth Evident that our Knowledge consists only in a clear view of the Relations that things have to one another:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Maleb. de Verit. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirend.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>therefore when it happens, as in difficult questions, that the Mind must see at one view a great number of Relations, which two or more things have amongst
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:51616:104"/>
themselves, it is evident also, that if it has not consider'd these things with much attention, and only knows them confusedly, it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for it to perceive distinctly their Relations, and consequently to form a solid Judgment of them. One of the chief Causes then of a want of Application of Mind to abstracted Truths, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s that we see them at a distance, and things which are nearer are continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented to our Minds. A great Attention of Mind approaches, if I may so say, to the Idea's of Objects, with which it is affected: but it often happens, that when we are attentive upon Metaphysical Speculations, we are diverted from them, because some Sensation comes upon the Soul, which is nearer to it than those Idea's: the least Pain or Pleasure is sufficient to effect this: the reason of it is Pain and Pleasure, and generally all Sensations, are within the Soul it self, they modifie and affect it much nearer than the simple Idea's of Objects of pure Intellection, which, tho' present to the Mind, do not modifie it. Thus the Soul being on the one hand very narrow, and on the other not being able to hinder Pain, Pleasure, and other Sensations, its ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity is filled with them, and it cannot at the same time be sensible of any thing, and think freely of all other things of which it cannot be sensible. The buzzing of a Fly, or some other little noise (suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it to be communicated even to the chief part of the Brain, so that the Soul perceives it) is capable, notwithstanding all our Efforts to the contrary, of hindring us from considering abstracted and elevated Truths; because all abstracted Idea's do not modifie the Soul, tho' all Sensations do. It is this which causes a Stupidity and Dulness of Mind, in respect of the great Truths of Christian Morality: Hence it is that Men only know them after a speculative and unfruitful manner, without the Grace of Jesus Christ.</hi>

There are very few who are not sensible of the Emptiness and Instability of the Goods of this World, and who even are not toucht with an abstracted and always with a very certain and evident Conviction that they deserve not our Application and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; but where are those that practically despise these Goods, and who are not anxious and careful to obtain them? 'Tis those only who perceive some bitterness and disgust in their Enjoyment, or else by the Grace of God are made sensible of a Spiritual Good, by an inward Delight which God hath joyned to them, who overcome the impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Senses, and the Efforts of Concupiscence. The bare Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51616:104"/>
of the Mind does not therefore make us ever resist these Efforts as we ought to do, unless an internal Motion of the Heart does also second it. It is this Light of the Mind only which is, as some say, a sufficient Grace, enabling us to condemn our selves, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming us of our own Weakness, and that we ought to have recourse by Prayer to Him, who is our Power. This inward Sentiment of Heart is a lively Grace, which operates; 'tis this which affects and fills us, which perswades the Hearts of Men, and without which there are none of them can think heartily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All the most constant Truths of Morality lye hid in the secret Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses and Windings of the Mind, and so long as they stay there, are barren and without any Power: since the Soul does not taste them, but the Pleasures of the Senses are nearer the Soul, and it being impossible that it shou'd not be sensible, and love its Pleasure with a natural Love, (for one may hate Pleasure with a hatred of Choice) its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be freed from the World, and shake off the Charms of its Senses by its own Power, because a Love of Choice cannot long refrain from conforming to a Natural Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I deny not that the Righteous, whose heart hath been livelily turn'd towards God by prepossessed Delights, cannot without this particular Grace, do some deserving Actions, and resist the Motions of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence. There are some that are generous and constant in the Law of God, by the Power of their Faith, by an assiduous privation of sensible things, and by a Contempt and Disgust of all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. There are some who act for the most part without tasting preventing and unthought of Pleasure, the only Joy which they find in acting piously, is the Pleasure alone they are sensible of; and this Pleasure is sufficient to stay them, in that Estate, and to confirm the disposition of their Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Those who begin their Conversion have commonly need of a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed and an indiliberate Pleasure, to free them from their sensible Goods to which they are united by other preventing and indeliberate Pleasures. Sadness and Remorse of Conscience is not enough, and they do not yet taste any Joy: But the Just can live by Faith, and in Want: and it is even in this Condition that they deserve more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Men being reasonable, God will be loved by them with a Love of Choice, rather than with a Love of Instinct, or an indeliberate Love, like that by which they love sensible things, without knowing them to be good otherwise than by the Pleasure which they receive from them. However, the greatest part of Men have little Faith, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually led to taste Pleasure, they cannot long preserve their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:51616:105"/>
Love for God against a Natural Love for sensible Goods, if their delight in the Divine Grace does not uphold them against the Efforts of Pleasure; for it is this delight that both begets, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves and increases Charity as sensible Pleasures do Desire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is plain from what has been said, That Men being never without some Passion, or agreeable or disagreeable Sensations, much of the Capacity and Extension of their Minds is taken up with them, and when they are willing to employ the rest of their Capacity to examine some Truth, they are often di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by some new Sensation, or by a Disgust which they find in this Exercise, and by an inconstancy of the Will, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitates and runs the Mind from one Object to another, so that unless they have accustomed themselves to overcome these Oppositions from their Youth, as I have elsewhere explain'd, they will at last be incapable of penetrating into any thing that is a little difficult, or which requires a little Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The Operation of Divine Grace, upon the Souls of those who are qualify'd for its Reception, is so invisible, and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly communicated, that the Irreligious and Profane have hence taken an occasion to ridicule and contemn it, and as far as lyes in their Power to explode the very Notion out of the World. These will allow of no other Grace than the force of certain Habits, by which Men suffer themselves to be govern'd, and which are for the most part the Result of their Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We must own indeed that the Efficacy of this Grace, above the Prevalency of Habits, however deeply radicated or woven into the Constitution, or the Difference between one and the other, is certainly known by none but the Regenerate Man: Those who are never so intimately acquainted with the Nature and Powers of the Mind, know how the <hi>Vestigia</hi> of Sensible Objects come to be imprest and drawn out upon the Brain, or after what manner, not only Imagination, but the pure Acts of the Understanding are perform'd: Those, I say, who know all this by the clearest Idea's, together with the whole Process of the common Mode of Natural Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, can at best but guess, and that very faintly, at this Divine Influence, which must co-operate even with such Persons, whose Habits of Goodness are as deeply rooted as possible, if they receive a solid Pleasure and Satisfaction in its Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:51616:105"/>Meer Habits of Moral Goodness, may be in many respects, very serviceable, and an occasion of securing, us from an limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Practises of Wicked Men; from being at all times over-power'd by the Storms and Tempests raised in our own Breasts: They may keep us from being extremely injur'd by the Precepts of such, by whose evil Communication our Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners wou'd be corrupted, and our Minds debaucht; They may serve to render us somewhat the more impregnable, and better fortify'd against the treacherous Assaults of those, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to frame and model us into the same temper with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. In a word, they may place us in a State of some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Security, against these and the like Adversaries ready to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Being in the World than what proceeds from a contracted or long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Habit: if Conversion of the Heart to God, Contrition for past Offences, if Renovation or Regeneration have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ground for their Support and Truth, than meerly natural Habit, how come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> it to pass that some Men; who have been throughly harden'd in Iniquity, by the force of an obdurate habit of Impiety, shou'd be at some times so sensibly touche with a sudden Horrour, as presently to awaken out of their Dreams of Carnal Security, and by a refulgent Ray of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light, to have their Souls so strangely illuminated, as that they have often found themselves, even contrary to their own natural Inclinations, put upon impeaching their formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Lusts and darling Satisfactions, and also upon an open Confession of their desperate Madness, in having so long pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd them. The Instances of this Nature are very numerous, some of them I have already mention'd, and more might be here inserted if I thought it necessary, not only of those whose Understandings being weak or shallow, we might believe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd on; but even of the most accute and profound Despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do's in all sorts of Villany, Men who have undauntedly bid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Defiance to Heaven, and admir'd how the silly World shou'd be frighted with that Childish Whim (as they have term'd it) of their Immortality: But leaving these, I shall take notice, that as on the one hand there are some who will allow
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51616:106"/>
of no Grace at all, so on the other we find those, who reckon every several Vertue to be a distinct Grace; thus there must be a Grace of Temperance, a Grace of Chastity, a Grace of Patience, a Grace of Charity; and so in like manner, there is nothing more common than to hear them talking of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining Grace, Preventing Grace, Saving Grace, Renewing Grace, Persevering Grace, Regenerating Grace; as if these were so many several Graces, and not one and the same Grace of God. Thus others of them will have the Divine Light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Spirit of God, the Grace of God, and the Grace of Jesus Christ, to differ essentially; which improper ways of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, have, for want of Explanation, been the occasion of les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sening and obscuring the Fundamental Notion, as well as of Contempt to the profane Jesters at all things S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I remember sometime since, before I made my first Visit to the Reverend Dr. <hi>H—k,</hi> I sent him a long Epistle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining my own Sentiments of Divine Matters; and desired him to inform me wherein he dissented. There were some particular Queries therein relating to this Subject last menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, which, as I find them in the Copy of my Letter, I shall here Transcribe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 1. Whether there be any thing essential to Salvation, but a holy or good Life, or a Conscience kept without Offence towards God and Man. Granting this, 2dly, Whether it is not possible for this happy Man to be found under any Christian Communion. 3dly, Whether this State of true Felicity and content is to be attained by any surer Method than that of a due attendance upon the Divine Monitor which is planted in our Souls, I mean the Divine resplendent Light of the Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipal World, as explicated by Father <hi>Malebranch,</hi> and after him by Mr. <hi>Norris:</hi> for however inconsiderate Men may cavil at the Notion as a Principle of Q—sm, I am satisfy'd we do all receive a certain secret irresistable Reproach from this faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Monitor, when we have thought of, or committed any unworthy Action: and an inexpressible Satisfaction from our doing Good. I desir'd, with submission, to be farther inform'd whether or no these words, <hi>the Grace of God, the Spirit of God,</hi> or <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> have any other true import than that of this Divine Manifestation to the Soul: or if to say (commonly speaking) such a Person is endow'd with the Grace of God, does not bear a strict Analogy with his being more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:51616:106"/>
attentive to this <hi>Lux Divina:</hi> it seems hard indeed to conceive any other different Degrees of Grace, than there are different Degrees of Reflection upon, or attention to the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Admonitions of this Invisible Being: and surely it can be nothing but the want of this Reflection and Attention to which our present Infidelity owes it Rise. I know Mr. <hi>Norris</hi> will have this Light in some degrees thereof, to be not only the same with what we call the Grace of God, but that it is also in a more inferiour acceptation, the common Mode of the Humane Understanding: I desire to know in what you dissent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, as likewise your Explication of the word <hi>Conscience</hi>; it seems to me but little short of an Absurdity, that there should be any other Sence presiding in the Soul over all her Actions, than what is communicated from the Supream Being. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, I wou'd gladly be inform'd, whether any Man has the power, as of himself, heartily to believe that which at some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he confesseth with his Mouth. The Rehearsal of a Creed is no difficult matter, but a solid Conviction, that what we do rehearse, is apparently clear to us as Mathematical Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is very rarely to be met with. It is surely impossible for any Man, who limits his Faith within the narrow bounds of his Reason, to submit an entire assent to those Propositions, which tho' perhaps necessary to be credited, he himself can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not account for: I have often thought this the Infirmity of the Supplicant in Holy Writ, when he cry'd out, <hi>Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Lord help my unbelief:</hi> for it is otherways very difficult to conceive how a vicious Life can consist with a full Conviction of the Divine Existence, and our own Separate Beings. 6thly, What you think of Enquiries into Nature, whether they prove not to some the Causes of Modern Deism, and to others of pure Scepticism. I have been often apt to imagine that there are no Natural <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> which may not admit a Solution from those two grand Principles of Matter and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by Axioms deduc'd from the Corpuscular Philosophy: and I doubt not but 'tis our resting in an ability to discuss the same by this kind of Disquisition, has been the occasion that the prime or supream Cause of all, has been veiled from our Eyes. Curiosity is so natural to the Soul of Man, and the seeming Satisfaction that does at sometimes attend a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Enquiry, is so great as to render the same to some sort of People a dangerous Temptation; it is not that I think the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:51616:107"/>
Enquiry of it self such, but the resting in the simple knowledge that such or such Productions must be the Result of such and such Causes, without reflecting upon the first and chiefest which puts these upon concurring, must certainly be so: and truly, 'tis very seldom that the generality of Men make any farther Appeal, unless it be to Fate, Fortune, Chance, Destiny, or some such like unaccountable Chimaera which they substitute in the room of an all-powerful, infinite and intelligent Being. Lastly, I desire you wou'd send me your Thoughts of the espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Providence of God, and your Opinion of Mr. <hi>B</hi>—<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> late Draught of the Q—rs Principles.</p>
            <p>In some few Days after the receipt of my Letter, the good Doctor was pleased to return his Answer in these words:

                     </p>
                     <p>A pious Life and holy Conversation, are without peradventure the principal things aimed at in the Gospel of Jesus Christ: but since we are there told that there are such things as dangerous, and damnable Heresies, the Fundamental Doctrines which all Christian Churches have believed, it is our duty sincerely and conscienciously to receive; and whoever does so, will find them very excellent Motives to the practise of Religion.</p>
                     <p>I deny not the possibility of a Man's being dev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>Grace, and Divine-Light, and the Spirit of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the same in effect. It is the Holy Spirit which both gives us Grace, and inlightens our Minds by a Divine Manifestation to our Souls. Every true Christian is in some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>egree a partaker hereof: for without it we can neither believe, nor obey, nor as we ought rely upon the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of our God. It is this which we receive upon our earnest and fervent Prayer, and it is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> which doth excite both our Attention and pious Resolution: which as the same produces in us lesser or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Effects, or different degrees of Love, Obedience, Self-denial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        <pb n="203" facs="tcp:51616:107"/>
so these are called the Degrees of the Divine Grace, as our endeavours are either weaker or stronger, uneven or steddy, inconstant or more constant: and as our Self-denial rises to a higher or a lower pitch. Now to secure us from the danger of a mad Enthusiasm, from the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of Imagination, the deception of Phancy, or the delusion of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Spirits, in the business of private Inspiration and pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, we are most certainly to bear in mind that the Holy Spirit and the revealed Will of God, do exactly at all times correspond: so that whatever Light we pretend to, which contradicts, or is not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifiable by the written Word, the same is most certainly either Design or Delusion, and always false and counterfeit.</p>
                     <p>For my own part, I am not against the Notions either of Father <hi>Malebranch</hi> or Mr. <hi>Norris,</hi> provided their Hypotheses do not disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, by supposing Him in any manner the Author of our Sins: however, there were very good Christians in the World, before either of them spun Philosophy to so fine a Thred.</p>
                     <p>To believe in God, and that he inspects the most secret of our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: to be truly sensible of the Love of the blessed Jesus, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a Life hereafter: to believe what the Gospel delivers to us, so as to be acted by those Principles: to become truly penitent, meek and humble, patient and charitable, and ready unto every good word and work: in a word, to be sincere and constant and faithful unto death, this is to be a Religious Man and a true Christian, an Heir to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and a much happier Man than all the Masters of Philosophy can make you.</p>
                     <p>In order to this Attainment, we are to quit anticipated Prejudices, instill'd either by Education or our own false Reasonings: and we may much shorten the trouble by seriously resolving to our selves this single Query, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the Matters related in our Saviour's Gospel are certainly true: if they be, there is nothing in this World must hinder us from a serious and consciencious Practise, and from living up to those holy Rules and Precepts as far as we are able. For the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Threatnings, if true, are things of that consequence, that all is to be laid aside for to gain the promis'd Blessings, and to avoid the threatned Misery.</p>
                     <p>I doubt not but a Person of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> must have had a liberal Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and altho' a superficial or slight knowledge in Physicks, may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose to Scepticism, yet you have doubtless by your Profession, a very great advantage; for however it may be abus'd, a profound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and substantial Knowledge, must undoubtedly lead us to very great Devotion: and the more exquisitely curious the Anatomist is,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51616:108"/>
the greater Reason will he have, if he abuse not his Understanding, to adore and admire the Infinite Power, Wisdom and Goodness of his great Creator, and consequently to worship, to love, and to obey him.</p>
                     <p>If you believe Reveal'd Religion, which was never so question'd or refuted as to deserve the Answer of any soberly learned Man, you must believe the Truth of God's particular Providence, altho' you cannot reconcile every particular <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> either to your own Reason, or the Corpuscular Philosophy. The holy Scriptures are a System of Divine Philosophy, and I should think that the Assertions of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty ought to be received by Rational Men, before the seeming clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of any meer Humane Hypothesis. Alas! how little is it that we know; and granting the Supream Being to have made our World in the Nature of a Clock, is this an Argument that its first Fabricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the Motions bestowed upon its several Parts, can result from any thing short of an Almighty and Divine Power, but our Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy is unable to inform us, of all the Wheels, the Pius, and several Motions of this stupendious Frame: 'tis true, we set it move accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mechanick Laws, but there may be many thousand Motions in it, of which we are ignorant. Let us bless our God for the Revelation which he has given us, and let us (as most certainly it behoves us) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his special Providence, whoever does so, will in the event find Comfort and Satisfaction: nor do I see how a good Man can have any real Happiness or Consolation without it.</p>
                     <p>As for Mr. <hi>B—s</hi> Divinity, I must own there are many things in it, both Rational and Solid; but when he comes to spiritualize the Divine Ordinances and Institutions of Christ and his Apostles, he not only sets himself up in opposition to the Churches of Christ, to the Sense and Practise of the Primitive Christians (as I am able to prove) but exposes a want of knowledge in Scripture Interpretation. The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of the Sect, and the dangerous tendency of their pretended Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is argument enough to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>e of their Inconsistency with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and true Religion: and surely we ought to be extreamly cautious how we side with such whimsical upstart Opinions, till we can recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the Possibility for Divine Goodness and Mercy, to suffer Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to lye in Ignorance for Sixteen hundred years, and that the Churches immediately planted by the Apostles, shou'd make Mistakes of that vile Consequence (even when their Founders were present to set them to rights if they had done so) as we must believe they did, if Q—sm be true.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="205" facs="tcp:51616:108"/>A well-grounded knowledge in the Primitive Christianity, which may be truly fetcht out of Ecclesiastick History and the Fathers of the Church, will give you this Satisfaction, that the holy Ordinances from the first promulgation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, such I mean as Water-Baptism, and the Eucharist, have been practis'd even to this day, by all good Christians by the use of the outward Elements in their Administration. I deny not but there have been both great Abuses, Misapprehensions and Mistakes, in the performance of them, or in the manner of their Reception, and I think I may say there are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Some little time after this, I receiv'd a Second Letter from that sincerely Religious and most excellent Divine, by way of Answer to one that I had sent him, which as I find it amongst my Papers, begins thus:
<floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <opener>
                        <salute>SIR,</salute>

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>H—k</hi>'s second Letter.</note>
                        <hi>I</hi> Rejoyce with you, that it hath pleased our good God to confirm in you such a Belief of his Existence, and your own Creation after the Divine Image, as may secure to you a Remembrance of the Duty incumbent on you: and put you both upon a constant and fervent Prayer for the supply of Divine Grace, together with a steddy and devout Submission to, and Dependence upon his especial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
                     <p>I do look upon your last Letter to be the Picture of your Mind, and bating the Ceremony, I find no other fault than this, that how la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably true soever your Remarks may be upon the present Age, for the most part; yet I am free to acquaint you with my Thoughts, that there are a much greater number of good People amongst us than you imagine. I may say (blessed be our God for it) I have the personal knowledge of many whom I can call truly pious and sincere Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: Some of them such, who as they by no means value themselves upon their Humane Acquirements, are yet able to silence the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Profane even by their own Weapons of Humane Reason. I speak not this to shew my own good liking, of such for the most part vain and unprofitable Argumentations; but yet I think it no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviceable Office to Religion, neither yet to the Cause of our great Creator, that some Men have left both the Atheist, and his Friend the Deist, without Excuse: and that they may see their Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:51616:109"/>
heighten'd by their obstinate disbelief of the Christian Religion, contrary to the natural unprejudic'd Light of Reason, as well as the Extraordinary of Divine Faith.</p>
                     <p>Your Character of Mr. <hi>B—l</hi> I think no whit too large, nor do I dislike your Thought of his being design'd by Providence, as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrative and clear Evidence to satisfie the doubting World, that the larger portion of right Reason or solid Knowledge a Man is endow'd with, the clearer prospect he enjoys of the Truth and Certainty of Divine Revelation: and that it is not only unlikely, but impossible to philosophise as becomes reasonable Men, without thinking venerably of Almighty God, and his Son Christ Jesus.</p>
                     <p>The true Christian Vertuoso is indeed not often met with, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Character of a practically Religious Man, and at the same time a very great Philosopher, suits any Man so well as it did the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased <hi>B—l,</hi> may very well be made a Question.</p>
                     <p>For my own part, I the less value the Attempts or Endeavours of Men philosophising about Religion, being perswaded that there are not many sincerely pious Converts made thereby. Religion wants not the Rhetorical Flourish of fine Language; Aiery Notions and School Distinctions render her but confus'd, and are really Blemishes to her Purity and Simplicity. Her Paths are plain and easie; in her Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dress she is all over amiable, and wants not the imbellishment of Philosophic Lustre.</p>
                     <p>There are Arguments enough already from the Store-house of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reason, to silence the Complaints of Atheism; it is not Reason that will satisfie the unreasonable Infidel: and I am perswaded, were there no Mortification or Self-denial in the Case, no Restraint to be laid upon the brutish Appetite, the Truths we plead for would be clear enough to the Unbeliever. The depth of their Philosophy lyes here, they will not believe in God, because he has not made them irrational or brute Creatures, which since they came not such out of the hands of their Maker, they resolve to make themselves so, and then foolishly please themselves with the Childish Expectation of escaping Divine Judgment, because they have so long suffer'd themselves to be acted by what they call the irresistible impulse of their sensitive Appetites, and wilfully indulged Passions.</p>
                     <p>What every good Man glories in <hi>(viz.)</hi> that he is endow'd with Reason and a Capacity to shun the Evil, and to choose the Good, is the greatest Misery of these Men: who finding themselves able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour their Creator, to turn their backs upon Religion, and to do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite unto the Spirit of Grace; since there is a possibility for them left
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:51616:110"/>
to blaspheme their God, to trample upon all things Sacred, and that they are not hereupon immediately destroy'd by the Divine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Indignation; they grow harden'd in their Vices, their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Habits are at length woven into their Constitutions, and they act indeed but little differently from Irrational Agents.</p>
                     <p>Right Reason, or Philosophy, will do but little good with such, the Reformation, if at all, is owing to the hand of God: it is beyond the skill of Man to inlighten our Understandings, in such a manner as to give us a taste of the Divine Goodness. We may frame to our selves some speculative Notions, we may confess with our Mouths, as find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves unable to resist or to hold out any longer; but it is the Grace of Jesus Christ that must compleat our Conviction, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with our Souls in a perseverance to the end.</p>
                     <p>This is a Truth so clear to me, that I am firmly perswaded you will find no sincerely pious or true practical Christian of a differing Opinion: the worldly wise Man may despise and contemn us; the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine may scoff at us, and impute all to our want of Knowledge, to Phansie or Prepossession: let them mock on, and mark the end: it is sufficient for us, and will recompence to us these Indignities, if we are happy in the Grace of our Lord Jesus.</p>

            <p>I had not been long acquainted with this Reverend Divine, before his fatal Distemper depriv'd me, with many others, of the advantage of his Conversation: and it is the least respect I can pay his Memory, in publick to acknowledge my own belief, that he was a Man of undissembled Piety, strictly holy and devout in his Life and Converse, laborious and painful in his Ministry, of very easie access, and ready to succour all Men to the utmost of his Capacity: He was a Man universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly respected by Persons of different Perswasions, and I have reason to surmise that he died as generally lamented. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways exprest himself with a more than common earnestness, and had something in his Air and Mein, so soberly grave and modest, yet withal so pleasant, that I never met with in any other Person. He had nothing of Affectation, of a precise or reserved Temper, and so little regarded a Courtly Demeanour or Ceremonial Deportment, that I have heard it objected as the greatest of his Faults, that he was ungenteel, and too neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in his manner of Address: but least this should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for his full Character, which makes so small and even so inconsiderable a part thereof, I shall for the present leave it, whilst I pursue my Argument of the Nature and Necessity of the Divine Assistance, to the Completion of Man's Eternal Happiness; something more particularly relating to which Theam, I find so pertinently handled by the Author of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Interest in Religion,</hi> that I care not to pass it by without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice and considering upon the same.</p>
            <p>As nothing (saith this Author) but charming Lusts,<note place="margin">The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of Reason in Religion.</note> false Delusions, carnal Interests, foolish Prejudices, indulging the Appetites of the Animal Life, and attending to the titillations of the Flesh, can hinder Men from the performance of what God, in subserviency to his communicating of Grace (at least in his ordinary dispensing of it) doth require: so the being in the Exercise of those Means, and in the Discharge of those Duties which God prescribes and enjoyns, doth not only take us from, and prevent those Sins, which would render our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version difficult, if not impossible, but they are further useful as Means appointed and blessed of God unto such an end.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:51616:111"/>Tho' our Obedience hath neither any Physical Efficiency upon our Regeneration, nor is Grace bestow'd in the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of any previous Merit that is in our Performances, yet it is neither superfluous nor vain, much less doth it lye in any repugnancy to our Conversion, being only perfected by an effectual subjective Work of the Spirit of God. This Doctrine is not only opposed by <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Socinus,</hi> but of late by Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> whom we may very well allow to combate the Grace of God, having before-hand listed himself in opposition to the Divine Being.</p>
            <p>Now having lost the Divine Image and our Integrity by the Fall, we not only contend that there is the Efficacy of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Agent, necessary for the recovering it, and that he who imprinted the Image of God upon Humane Nature in the first Creation of Man, must again restore it in his Regeneration: but we affirm withal, that till the Sanctifying Spirit effectually, infallibly, and by an unresisted Operation, transforms us into the Divine Nature, and communicates to us a Vital Seed, we remain polluted, unholy, and uncapable of doing any thing with all that duness of Circumstances, as may commend us or our Performances to God's Acceptance: Not but that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently to the Holy Ghost's renewing us, by a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Grace to us, we may both dogmatically believe the Doctrines of the Scripture, and be found in the discharge of the Material Parts, not only of Natural Duties, but of the Acts of Instituted Religion; but to say that we ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to be denominated Holy, is to remonstrate to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in a thousand places, and to overthrow the very Tenor and design of the Gospel. While we remain thus unholy, we are so far from being actually united unto Christ, or capable Subjects of Justification or Forgiveness, that till we are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made Partakers of the Washing of Regeneration, and the Renewing of the Holy Ghost, we cannot possibly have any U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Him, or a Right to Pardon of Sin, or any thing that ensues or depends thereupon by him.</p>
            <p>There is nothing hath, at least ought to have the true deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Holiness, but what proceeds from the Spirit of Christ in us, and Principles of Grace by Infusion communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, which are the Foundation, Matter, and Bond of our Union with Him, and under whatever Gloss or Varnish, we or our Works appear to the World, yet without such a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:51616:111"/>
to Christ we are none of his, nor are our Duties, as to the Principles and Circumstances of them, acceptable to God: The Obligation upon Men to Obedience in what state soever we suppose them, the consistency of God's right to command them, with our contracted inability to the yielding of due O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: the Capacity that all Men remain in, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any congenite Impotency for the performing many External Duties good in themselves, and in the Matter of them, with the Subservience of these Performances to Conversion, as they are Means appointed of God in order thereunto: all these I in some measure understand, and can reconcile with the Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy of the Gospel: But that our Lives can be holy, till our Hearts be so through the Renewing of the Holy Ghost, or that our Works can be adequately good antecedently to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Supernatural Grace, I do in no wise understand, nor can I conceive the same can be made intelligible without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing <hi>Paelagianism</hi> upon us.</p>
            <p>But farther, The Gospel acknowledgeth no Acts of true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness performed by any, where there is not, antecedently at least, in order of Nature, a Principle of true Holiness in the Persons performing them; no Acts, Operations or Duties of ours, are in the Esteem of the Gospel, holy, but what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from, and are done in the Vertue, Power and Efficacy of Grace, previously derived from and communicated to us by Jesus Christ: there is prae-required to all Acts of Gospel Obedience, a new real Spiritual Principle, by which our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is renewed, and our Souls rendred habitually and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively holy. Grace is not the Effect and Product of any previous good Action of ours (whatever Subserviency through the appointment and dispose of God, they may lye in as to his bestowing of it) but all Acts and Operations truly good are the Fruits of Divine Grace; to talk of sincere Obedience pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding our antecedaneous Adeption of a new Principle, and the Communication of a Divine Vital Seed to us, is to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Paelagianism</hi> upon us, and that in a more fulsome way, and in ruder terms than many of his Followers used to declare themselves.</p>
            <p>I deny not the things revealed and commanded in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, being both good in themselves, and suited to the Reason and Interest of Mankind; and also inforced by the most at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive Motives which we can either desire or imagine; but
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:51616:112"/>
that Men in the alone strength of their Natural Faculties, may perform many External Duties, and in that manner also, that we who judge only according to appearance, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to account them holy, yea, that nothing but Supineness, lustful Prejudice, consuetude in Sin, and a being immersed into the Animal Life, can hinder them from so doing; but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that any Act or Duty hath the proper Form or Nature of Holiness, or is so denominated in the Scriptures, but both what proceeds from an antecedent Habit or Principle of Holiness in the Persons by whom they are performed, and an immediate Influence from Christ, in the virtue of our Union with him, as our quickning Head, vital Root and living Spring in the actual performance of them; so that tho' no Physical Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency is to be ascribed to the Gospel, yet besides a Moral Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, which through its own frame and complexion it hath to reform Mankind (beyond what any Declaration of God and our selves that ever the World was made acquainted with had) there is a Physical efficacious Operation of the Spirit of God accompanies it, on the score of God Almighty's having in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wisdom ordained it as a means for the communicating of Grace; but still it is not the Doctrine of the Gospel that we are united to: 'tis true that it is both by the Doctrine of the Gospel that we are brought to be united to Christ; and it is also true that whosoever are united to Him, have the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospel, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The way and manner how the Spirit assists us in the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Understanding of Things, is either through its immediate indwelling (if I may so speak) or through the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of new Principles, a <gap reason="foreign">

And farther, there is a suggesting of <hi>Media</hi> for eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:51616:112"/>
the Truth, there is also frequently an irradiation of the Word it self, an attiring and cloathing it with a Garment of Light, and upon the whole, the Soul both feels and is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd into what it knows, its apprehensions are no longer dull and languid, but vigorous and affective.</p>
            <p>This Mystical Union of the Soul of the true Believer with Jesus Christ, however difficult it may appear, and hard to be reconciled to the Natural Understanding, ought not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated or distrusted by us, upon the account of our Ignorance in the manner of it. We do assent to the Continuity and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hesion of one part of Matter to another, notwithstanding the Difficulties that encounter us about its Mode; and tho' there be not yet any Philosophic Hypothesis, that can resolve us how it comes to pass that one part more indiscerptibly cleaves to another, than if they were fastened together by Adamantine Chains: and therefore there is no Reason why the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibleness of the Manner of our Union with Christ, shou'd any ways obstruct or weaken our belief of it, having all the assurance that Divine Revelation can give us concerning our being united to Him: as we assent to an evident Object of Sense, or to that which is plainly demonstrated by Reason, tho' there occur many things in the manner of their Existence, which are unconceivable, so the <hi>Quod sit</hi> and Reality of our Union with Christ, being attested by him who cannot lye, it becomes us to embrace it with all steddiness of Belief, tho' we cannot conceive the <hi>Quo modo</hi> or manner how it is; we have reason to think, that through our Maker's leaving us pos'd and nonplust about the most ordinary and certain Natural <hi>Phae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Nor is the manner of the coherence of the Parts of Matter the only Difficulty in Nature relating to Union, that perplexes and baffles our Reason; but the Mode of the Mystical Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of the Rational Soul with the Humane Body, doth every way as much entangle and leave us desperate as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. That Man is a kind of Amphibious Creature allied in his constituent Parts, both to the Intellectual and Material Worlds, and that the several Species of Beings in the Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cosm, are combined in Him as in a System, Reason as well as
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:51616:113"/>
Scripture instructs us. That we have a Body, we are fully assur'd by its Density, Extension, Impenetrability, and all the Adjuncts and Affections of Matter; and that we have an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material Spirit, we are demonstratively convinc'd by its re-act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it self, its consciousness of its own Being, and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: not to mention other <hi>Mediums</hi> whereof we have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken elsewhere, and that those two are united together to make up the Composition of Man, is as plain from the influence that the Body hath upon the Soul in many of its Perceptions, and which the Soul hath upon the Body in the Motions of the Spirits and Blood, with all that ensues and depends thereupon. Nor could the Affections and Adjuncts of the Material Nature, nor the Attributes and Properties of the Immaterial, be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But now how this can be, is a knot too hard for Humane Reason to untye. How a pure Spirit should be cemented to an earthly Clod, or an immaterial Substance coalesce with Bulk, is a Riddle that no Hypothesis of Philosophy can resolve us about. 1. The <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotelick</hi> substantial Uniter will not do; for besides its repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy to Reason, that there should be any Substantial Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in the Constitution of Man, save his Soul and Body, the un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>onable Faculties will never allow us to subscribe to; the Idea's which we have of Body and Spirit having no Alliance the one with the other, and to style it a Substantial Mode, is to wrap up Repugnancies in its very Notion; for tho' all Modes be the Modification of Substances, yet they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicamental Accidents, and how essential soever this or that Modification may be to a Body of such a <hi>Species,</hi> yet it is wholly extrinsecal and accidental to Matter it self. In brief, the voluminous Discourses of the <hi>Aristotelian</hi>'s, both about U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in general, and the Union of the Rational Soul to the Organical Humane Body in particular, resolve themselves ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into idle tattle and insignificant words, or obtrude upon us Contradictions and Nonsence. 2. To preclude all Union betwixt the Soul and Body on Supposition that they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct constituent parts of Man, is plainly to despair of solving
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:51616:113"/>
the Difficulty for not to dispute whether the Soul and Body may, in Philosophic rigour, be called Parts; or whether Man, in reference to them, may be stiled a <hi>Compositum:</hi> 'tis enough that the one is not the other, but that they are different Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; and that neither of them, consider'd seperately, is the Man. Tho' the Soul and Body be perfect Substances in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and tho' the Soul can operate in its disjunct State, and in its Separation, will be no less a Person than Soul and Body now together are, yet there are many Operations belonging to the Soul in this Conjunct State, of which it is incapable in the Separate; and there are many things predicable of the Soul and Body together, which cannot be affirmed of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder. How close and intimate soever the Union betwixt the Soul and Body be, and how great soever in their mutual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancies in most of their Operations upon one another; yet not only the Intellectual Spirit, and the duly organized Matter, remain even in their Consociation classically different, (their Essences, Affections and Operations admitting a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity as well as a distinction) but there are some Operations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to each of them, upon which the other hath no influence. For as the Mind is Author of many Cogitations and Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to which the Body gave no occasion; so the Body is the Spring and Fountain of several Functions, over which the Soul hath no Dominion, nor any direct influence, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as much distinct, nothwithstanding the Union which intercedes between them as they would have done, shou'd we suppose them to have had an Existence previous to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federations, or as they shall be after the dissolution of the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:51616:114"/>Nor thirdly, doth the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Hypothesis, tho' the most ingenious and best contrived of any hitherto thought upon, fully satisfie an inquisitive Mind in the Matter before us: their Hypothesis is briefly this, That God in his infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom chose to create three distinct and different kinds of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: 1. Some purely Material, which through difference of the Figure, Size, Number, Texture, and Modification of their Parts, come to multiply into many different Species. 2. Some purely Immaterial, among whom, whether there be any Specifical Difference, is <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con</hi> disputed. 3. Man, a <hi>Compositum</hi> of both, having an Immaterial Intellectual Soul joyned to an Organical Body: Now, say they, God having in his Soveraign Pleasure thought good to form Man such a Creature, he hath not only by an uncontroulable Law confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Soul to an intimate Presence with, and constant Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Body, while it remains a fit Receptacle, or till he give it a discharge, but withal hath made them dependent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another in many of their Operations; and in this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual dependence of one upon the other, with respect to many of their Operations, they state the Union betwixt the Soul and Body to consist: for through the Impressions that are made upon the Organs of Sence, there result in the Soul cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Perceptions; and on the other hand, through the Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that arise in the Soul, there ensue certain Emotions in the Animal Spirits, and thus, say they, by the Action of each upon the other, and their Passion from one another, they are formally united. But all this, instead of loosing the Knot, serves only to tye it faster: For 1. this Mutual Dependancy, as to Operation of one upon the other, cannot be apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but in Posteriority of Nature to Union, and consequently the formal Reason of Union cannot consist in it. 2. There are Cases wherein neither the Impressions of outward Objects upon the Sensory Nerves, beget or excite any Perceptions in the Soul (which whether it proceed from obstinacy of Mind, or intense Contemplation, alike answers my drift) and also Cases wherein Cogitations of the Mind, make not any sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Impressions upon the Body (as in Extasies) and yet the Union of the Soul and Body remains undissolved, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues that it imports more than either an intimous Presence, or a Dependance between them in point of Operation. 3. 'Tis
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:51616:114"/>
altogether unintelligible, how either a Body can act upon a Spirit, or a Spirit upon a Body. I grant it may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated that they do so, but the manner of doing it, or indeed how it can be done, is not intelligible. That a Tremour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got in the Nerves by the jogging of Particles of Matter upon the Sensory Organs, shou'd excite Cogitations in the Soul, or that the Soul by a meer Thought should both beget a Motion in the Animal Spirits, and determine through what <hi>Meatus</hi>'s they are to steer their Course, is a <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> in the Theory of which we are perfectly non-plust. How that which pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates a Body without giving a jogg to, or receiving a shove from it, shou'd either impress a Motion upon, or receive an impression from it, is unconceivable: so that to state the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Soul and Body in a reciprocal Action upon, and Passion by and from one another, is to fix it in that which supposeth the Sagacity of our Faculties to conceive how it can be.</p>
            <p>Now if common Unions, of whose Reality and Existence we are so well assur'd, be nevertheless, with respect to their Nature, not only so unknown, but unconceivable: we may lawfully presume, if their lye nothing else against the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Union of Believers with Christ, save that it cannot be comprehended, that this is no Argument why we should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately renounce the Belief of it. If we can but once ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie that there is such an Union betwixt the blessed Jesus and sincere Christians, the incomprehensibleness of the manner of it ought not to discourage our Faith, if we can take up with the Evidence of Sense and Reason, as to the reality of other Unions, whose Modes are as little understood, I see no cause why the Veracity of God, provided we can produce the Authority of Divine Testimony, shou'd not satisfie us as to the Reality of the Union; tho' the manner how it is were a question we cou'd not answer; and indeed, if Men will not be huff't and talk'd out of the perswasion of those things, of whose Existence their Senses and Reason ascertain them, tho' they cannot answer all the Difficulties they are accosted with in their Enquiries about them, much less ought Christians to be hector'd out of the Belief of the Doctrines of Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Entanglements which attend the Conception of them; 'tis the Nature of Faith to embrace things upon the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:51616:115"/>
Testimony of God, tho' it understand nothing of the Mode and Manner how they are: the highest Assurance of the Reality of any thing is God's affirming it, and what he asserts, we are with all reverence to assent unto its Truth, tho' we can frame no adaequate Idea of it, nor fathom it in our own Conceptions: Our Saviour himself hath adjourned the perfect knowledge of this Mystery till the glorified state, in these words, <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 14.20.</note> 
               <hi>At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far you have had the Thoughts of the before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Author, which I shall leave you to consider seriously at your leisure; the Subject is indeed noble, how despicably soever it may be treated by the Libertine, whose Belief is stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd, because he himself is not possest of what he has slighted and contemned, and for that he finds himself at liberty to live as he listeth.</p>
            <p>I must own indeed that it is scarce possible, for one Man to infuse such Idea's into another, as may be able to perswade that other, that he himself is a Partaker of such a Spiritual Refreshment and Divine Consolation, as nothing less than the Divine Gaace can communicate to his Soul; and on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I have the less admir'd that both <hi>Paelagius, Socinus,</hi> and their Adherents, have gain'd so great footing in the World, and that the Doctrine of the Divine Grace shou'd be redicul'd by them, and esteemed little otherwise than as a sensless No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the Opinions of these Men run so smooth to the sense of the Natural Understanding, that so long as Men are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and unwilling to look farther, they are constrained to make their Reason the positive and adaequate Rule, both of their Morality and Divinity. But for my own part, I shou'd not so much dispute with them this Mysterious Co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Divine Concurrence, provided they cou'd but show me any true Practical Christian, one who is so in Deeds, as well as Words, who has espoused their Opinions: I may be free to say, I know nothing like one, nor do I think it possible to meet with a sincerely devout Convert, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Person, who is not ready to acknowlege that of himself he was able to do nothing as he ought, and that the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:51616:115"/>
Renovation or happy Change of his Mind was purely owing to the Adeption of a new Principle, or to a Union with the Divine Spirit of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, amongst the Followers of <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Socinut,</hi> there are those who understanding the Verity of their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, would be measur'd by their Practises, have been more than ordinarily exemplary in their Conversation with the World, and their Self-denial of some Temporal Enjoyments: Men who have kept themselves to a constant attendance upon Religious Worship, and set those about them an extraordinary Pattern, for the practise of private Duties, and all these we may readily grant the possibility of their attaining, by the meer strength of their Natural Faculties, or the Powers of their own Souls, independent of the Divine Grace: these, however necessary, were never lookt on by considerate Men for more than the Introduction or Outside of true Religion; but altho' there are amongst them Persons so very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect in their Deportment or Behaviour, yet the greatest part of them are such as wholly devote themselves to disputation in mixt Companies, where they continually gain Proselytes among loose People, such, who as they never cou'd reconcile themselves to the practise of Religion, are very glad to find the same resolv'd into Matter of Speculation, by which means every Man may have an opportunity to raise a suitable Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his own Inclination<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. Now I must confess, that which has principally induc'd me to dissent from the Principles of these Men, is a consciousness I have had that it is not only possible, but certain, that Men may have an Historical Faith, and that they may believe or assent to the Truth of the Revelation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and yet at the same time to show themselves as if wholly unconcerned in their Lives and Practises, whether the things deliver'd in that Gospel be true or not, which I think is hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable even to our own Reason, nor can be otherwise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed than to the want of that Supernatural and Divine Aid I plead for.</p>

            <p>The adventurous Determinations of the School-men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the beatifical Vision, smell rank of the same blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous nonsensical Figment; for by their contending that the Divince Essence is immediately united as an intelligible <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> to the Intellect of the blessed, and that this <hi>Species,</hi> and the glorify'd Understanding do not remain distinct things, but become identify'd, they do in effect affirm the Soul to be transubstantiated into God, and to be really deify'd: and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it's a Matter of easie Demonstration, that the Knowledge which we shall enjoy of God in Heaven, differeth only in degree from that which we possess here (otherwise it is both altogether unintelligible and uncapable of Rational Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) it will follow by a short Harangue of Discourse, either that Believers have no Knowledge of God at all in this Life, or else that their Soul's become Deify'd and Essentially uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God by knowing him.

Enthusiasts, which carry a broad-fac'd Aspect this way, 'tis easie for us to instruct our selves, from what Springs these, with the like Visionaries, have drawn the putrid Conceits which they propine to the World. 'Tis enough for us that we believe the Person of Christ, and the Persons of Believers to remain distinct after all the Union that intercedes between them: Let us be thankful for the Influences of his Grace, and for the In-dwellings of his Holy Spirit; but let us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test those swelling Words of Pride and Ignorance, of being Christed and Deify'd; for whatsoever be the nature and kind of the Union between Christ and Christians, that the same shou'd by Hypostatical, cannot without Blasphemy be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>
            <p>And thus, my Friend, I hope I have with no unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Prolixity, gone over these very weighty Subjects; I pray God we may all of us have right Notions of them fixed on our Hearts: and that they may be attended with the Fruits of a sincere Repentance and Amendment of our Lives. I shall endeavour to conclude all with the most sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Advice I can, and in order to the same, wou'd wish and desire you to think often and seriously upon the certainty of your Death (for whatever you may think of an Immortality hereafter, 'tis manifest you can obtain none here) consider what Thoughts will be most likely to intrude upon you, what Business you will principally be employ'd about (shou'd you have time allotted you for such a purpose) the Conflicts and Consternation you must encounter, the Confusion of your last Minutes, the Agony of your Soul in the moment of its flight: For let me tell you, however you may please your self in this time of Health and Vigour, that an approach of a privation of your present Life will not surprise you, that you shall be able to Philosophise sedately and unconcernedly concerning the Condition of your Soul, and that whatever fearful Apprehensions may assault you, your beloved Musick will charm them into Silence, and the well-struck Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall lull you into an Abyss of Darkness and Oblivion; notwithstanding these aiery Notions and unlucky Phancies, believe me, your Thoughts of other Matters will prevail and interpose, your perplexed Soul will be too restless and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie,

            <p>THE Person upon whose Account these Letters were first written, not having thought fit to return any material Answer, the Author has been prevaild with to print them by themselves; but lest it be thought designedly to give them the fairer shew of Demonstration, or by the want of any weighty Objection, to procure to them the greater Esteem in the World, he does promise, That if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one does object against, or can confute the main Points herein debated, if the same be done with that Sobriety and Seriousness which becomes the Subject of such Enquiries, and sent to the Publisher of these Printed Letters, the same shall be faithfully publish'd, with a Reply annex'd. And to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such an Undertaking the less laborious, if the Arguments of the first Letter, particularly those of Mr. <hi>Bently</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> are found to be fairly overthrown, or any new Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis advanc'd which will intelligibly solve the Cosmical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanism, and make it clear to us that Perception, Volition, and Ratiocination, can derive their Source from any thing short of that First, Supream, Intelligent, or Alwise Being we call God: if this, I say, be once perform'd, the rest, such as our Belief of Providence, our Immortality, and the Divine Grace, shall be readily given up. Till this be done, he will not think himself concern'd to answer every petulant Cavil which may be raised against these Sacred Truths, by Men devoted to Scepticism and Irreligion: for if after all they have said, they find themselves constrained to grant there must be one First, Supreme, and Powerful Being, who made the World, the same Consideration, if carried a little farther, will show them the Necessity of the same Power to continue and preserve its several Parts from a ruinous Destruction, which is, tho' in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words, to allow a Providence. And farther, since 'tis apparent that this Almighty Being has bestow'd upon Man a Principle of Freedom, or a Capacity to Will and Reason,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:51616:118"/>
which is vastly different from, and Superiour to his Fellow Creatures, it would be very strange, allowing the common Attributes of the Divine Being, if he shou'd be unaccountable to his Maker for the Abuse of these Endowments.
