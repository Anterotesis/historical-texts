            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE MOST REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, <hi>GEORGE,</hi> LORD ARCH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Canterburie his Grace, Primate of all England, and Metropolitane: <hi>And one of his Maiesties most</hi> Honourable Priuie Counsell.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S in the <hi>Romane</hi> triumphes, the worthy Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour gloriously ascending vnto the <hi>Capitoll,</hi> did shew his magnificence by giuing ample gifts vnto the people: euen so (most reuerend father) our victorious Sauiour and noble Redeemer, hauing conquered Hell, Death, Diuell and damnation, Triumphantly ascending to the <hi>Capitoll</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, did shew his vnspeakeable bountie in giuing admirable and incommparable gifts vnto men,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 8. 11.</note> That is, some to be Apostles, some Prophets, some Euangelists, some Pastours and Teachers. For what hath the Church of God of so precious account, as the holy ministery of the Word and Sacraments, whereby <hi>CHRIST IESVS</hi> with all his blessings is reuealed and applied to the soule and conscience? It may well be resembled to the Riuers of <hi>Paradise,</hi> which did water and fructifie the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 10.</note> of God: to the <hi>Golden pipes,</hi> whereby the two Oliue branches replenished<note place="margin">Zach. 4. 2, 3.</note> the seuen Lampes in the golden Candlesticke: to the <hi>Crowne</hi> (which the woman in the <hi>Reuelation</hi> cloathed with the Sunne, and hauing the Moone vnder her<note place="margin">Reuel. 12. 1.</note> feete, had vpon her head) being richly beset, not with stones, but with Starres.</p>
            <p>Which holy function flowing from <hi>CHRIST,</hi> as from the fountaine to his
<pb facs="tcp:14672:3"/>
blessed Apostles, was by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deriued to posterity. But as the water which neere the spring is cleare and chrystalline, in further passages may be polluted: so in processe of time, (by the subtiltie of Satan) the Ministery of the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments being the ordinance of God was mingled with sacrifising and other humane inuentions. Yet such was the goodnesse of God, that euen in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Poperie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Baptisme, so the Ministeriall function (notwithstanding the abominations cleauing thereunto) was wonderfully preserued; for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by Gods speciall prouidence, in her Ordination of Priests, reteined such Euangelicall words, as in their true and natiue sense, include a<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 18. 19.</note> ghostly Ministeriall power to forgiue sinnes, by the <hi>Ministery of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> consisting in the due administration of the Word and Sacraments. So remission of sinnes is ascribed to the Minister, as to Gods instrument in effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting it, and Ambassadour in pronouncing it. Wherefore in that they haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to forgiue sinnes, they haue also authority to vse the meanes thereof, that is the Word and Sacraments. Thus the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> gaue power to her Priests to teach the truth, although it did not reueale the truth vnto them.</p>
            <p>Now when it pleased him, which causeth the Light to shine out of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in the riches of his Mercie, to remember his distressed Church, those blessed instruments which hee first vsed in the Reformation, were such as had receiued their Calling corruptly in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> But when their eyes were opened, they disclaimed the sacrifising abomination, and other impurities, which by the iniquitie of the time were incorporated into their calling. Thus the pollution of Poperie (by the Grace of God) was drained and drawn away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; the Ministeriall function restored to the original beautie.</p>
            <p>And here let vs admire and magnifie the Mercy of God, who did not forget this remote Iland situate in a corner of the world, but did most graciously shine vpon it with his Golden beames from the Sphere of Heauen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For whereas in other Countreys the Bishops which should be starres and Angels of the Church, did resist the Reformation, and persecuted such as sought it; It pleased God that in <hi>England,</hi> among other Bishops, Archbishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> the chiefest Prelate of the Kingdome, was Gods chiefest instrument to restore the Gospel, which afterward he sealed with his blood; The euent whereof was, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as other Reformed Churches were constrained by necessity to admit extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary fathers, That is, to receiue Ordination from Presbyters, which are but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Ministers, rather then to suffer the Fabrick of the Lord <hi>IESVS</hi> to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued: the Church of <hi>England</hi> had alwayes Bishops to conferre sacred Orders, according to the ordinary and most warrantable custome of the Church of <hi>CHRIST.</hi> And although in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time, fiue blessed Bishops were burned to ashes, yet God reserued to himselfe a number, which being then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

to take the wings of the Doue, and fly beyond the Seas, or to hide themselues in the clefts of the rocke; when the tempest was ouerblowne, the cloudes cleared, and the Sunne of Righteousnes began to display himselfe in the happy raigne of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> returned againe, clapped their wings for ioy, praised God, preached the Gospel, and with holy imposition of hands, ordained Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the Ordinations which reprochfull Papists doe most traduce and slander, as though they were no Ordinations at all, but onely <hi>Nullities;</hi> thence perswading their Proselytes, That our present Ministers are no Ministers, but meerely Lay-men, and thereupon inferring that wee haue no Church, no sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. In which point some Popish Recusants haue beene so confident, that they haue professed, That if we could iustifie our Calling, they would come to our Churches, and bee of our Religion. The consideration whereof (most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend father) gaue me occasion to made into this Controuersie, being desirous, next the assurance of mine owne saluation, as I am a Christian, to bee fully and clearely assured of my Calling, as I am a Minister. In prosecuting whereof, I did euidently find, That their chiefest Obiections are nothing but slanders, confutable by Authenticall monuments of publique Record. Whereupon I wished, from the bottome of my heart, That some learned man would haue vouchsafed for the glory of God, and the good of the Church, to scatter these Popish mistes, and to set the Trueth in the cleare light.</p>
            <p>A worke in my opinion very important; First in respect of vs of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie; and secondly in regard of the people committed to our charge. For how chearefully, and with what ioy of heart may we preach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they heare vs, when the lawfulnesse of our Calling is made manifest to all men? Thirdly, If any haue formerly made scruple to enter our Orders, out of ignorance, how these odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and scandalous imputations blazed in Popish Bookes might bee truely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, and the point soundly cleared by Record, it is verely to bee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, That all such shall receiue singular comfort, when they see our Calling iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified not onely in it selfe, as the true Ministerie of the Gospel, but also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the deriuation to vs by such Bishops, and in such maner as is most cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent to the sacred Scripture, and the practise of Primitiue Antiquitie. And if any vpon this surmise bee fallen away to our aduersaries, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what effect God may worke in them, when they shall plainely perceiue how they haue bene deluded with Popish stratagemes? Or who can tell whether this may bee a gracious meanes to stay others from yeelding to the inticements of subtill serpents? Finally, the defence of innocencie in a matter of so high a nature, must needes reioyce the hearts of the godly, when Popish polititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans shall bee forced to hide their faces for shame, and confusion. These mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues
<pb facs="tcp:14672:4"/>
induced mee to wish, that some great Master in our Israel would haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken this eminent Argument, which now (the Diuine prouidence so dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing) is befallen vnto me, One of the children of the Prophets.</p>
            <p>Which my labours concerning the Ordination of the Pastours of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> to whom should I rather present, then to your Grace, whom God (by the meanes of a most prudent and Religious Soueraigne,) hath to the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular comfort of all that sincerely loue the Gospel, aduanced to bee the chiefe Pastour, and chiefe Ordainer in the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Especially, seeing I proceeded in this Argument with your graces fatherly direction, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. Now the Lord so direct and sanctifie your endeuours, That as the Rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> did bud and blossome, and bring foorth ripe <hi>Almonds:</hi> so<note place="margin">Num. 17. 8.</note> the Church and Ministerie of <hi>England</hi> by the meanes of your Grace, as of Gods blessed instrument, may prosper, flourish and bring foorth fruits of Righteousnesse to the glory of God, and the comfort of all true Christian hearts.</p>

As for the exercises of our Vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, you might know (if malice did not blinde you) that they are famous throughout the Christian world and that these Campes of <hi>Christ</hi> haue from time to time trained vp Souldiers, able to encounter the proudest <hi>Philistines.</hi> Neither doubt we but they shall alwayes haue a <hi>Dauid</hi> to cut off the head of <hi>Golias</hi> with his owne sword.

                     <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> against <hi>Queene Elizabeth:</hi> for when that vertuous Princesse had banished the Pope, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish abominations, and planted the Gospel of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> continuing constant in the profession thereof, her Religion he iudged <hi>heresie,</hi> her constancie he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>obstinacie,</hi> and thereupon pronounced her <hi>depriued of her Crowne and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, dissolued</hi> the sacred bond of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and <hi>cursed</hi> all that should obey her.

Thus you make a shew of Learning and Religion, but traine vp your schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to treason and rebellion. Is this the preaching of the Catholicke faith? Is this the ghostly good of your Countrey? Is this the Popes incomparable loue? And as hee hath small loue to England, so notwithstanding his faire pretences, he beareth not very much to you: for the Pope being an old poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titian, may be well resembled to the Mariner, which looketh one way, and roweth another; He sendeth you ample gifts, but he sendeth them vpon a hooke, and while you catch at the bait, you swallow the hooke.

But that you may the better perceiue the dangerous state wherein you stand, giue me leaue to vse a plaine, but a fit comparison; An Ape seeing a Chesnut in the fire, and not knowing how to get it, spied a Spaniel by the fire side, and suddenly catched his foote to rake out the chesnut. Here you may see your owne faces in a homely glasse. The <hi>Golden Supremacie</hi> is the Chesnut, perils and dangers are the fire, the Pope loath to burne his owne fingers, vseth you but as the Spaniels foote to scrape for the Chesnut; little regardeth hee how you be scorched, so hee bee in hope to obtaine his desire. But though many of you haue burned both your handes and your hearts, yet hitherto (God be thanked) he hath missed the Chesnut.</p>

                  <p>All that are called of God by the Church, deriue their authoritie by lawfull succession from Christ and his Apostles. If you doe so, then let it appeare, shew vs your discent, let vs see your pedegree. If you cannot, then what are you? whence come you? If you tell vs that God hath raised you in extraordinary maner, you must pardon vs if we be slow in beleeuing such things; there are many deceiuers gone out into the world, and Sathan can transforme himselfe into an Angel of light. In a word, euery lawful calling is either ordinary or extraordinary: if yours be ordinary, let vs see your autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: if extraordinary, let vs see your miracles. If one take vpon him extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary authoritie, as an Ambassadour from a King, he must produce his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission vnder the Kings seale. If you will challenge the like from God, then we require a miracle, that is the Seale of the King of heauen.

In the infancie of the Church, when <hi>Christ</hi> ascending into glorie had consecrated <hi>Peter,</hi> and made him the spring and fountaine of all Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall Order, it was necessarie that the first should bee consecrated by <hi>Peter</hi> alone, the next by two at the most, and these consecrations were sound and sufficient: but when <hi>Iames</hi> the brother of our Lord was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Bishoppe of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by <hi>Peter, Iohn</hi> and the other <hi>Iames,</hi> they gaue a <hi>Forme</hi> or <hi>Patterne</hi> to their successours, as <note n="e" place="margin">Anacl. ep. 2. c. 1. apud Bin. tom. 1. p. 101.</note>

A Church cannot be without Bishops, as we haue declared: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Lutherans there are no Bishops, for they haue no ordination, nor succession from the Apostles: therefore among them there is no Church, And verely that neither Luther who was accounted Bishop of Wittenberge, nor Zuinglius, who was reputed Bishop of Tigur, nor Oecolampadius, who in the very Epitaph vpon his graue is called the first Bishop of Basill, nor Caluin, who was called the first Bishop of Geneua, nor any other of them were ordeined of three Bishops, nor of one by dispensation with the assistance of Abbots is a thing notoriously knowen; neither do they deny it. Therefore these are no Bishops, at least in the iudgement of the Fathers of the Nicen and Carthaginian Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, yea in the iudgement of the Apostles themselues, who haue decreed that a Bishop ought to be ordained by three Bishops.</hi> Thus <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is clearely of opinion that a Bishop must either be ordained of three, or haue assistance of Abbots with a dispensation, or else he is no Bishop, and this argument he calleth insoluble.</p>

                     </gap>ty, why do you vrge the other as of absolute necessitie? Againe these Councels were holden, <hi>Florente Ecclesia,</hi> when the world was furnished with plentie of godly Bishops, but you vrge them against a Church lately e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipsed and newly recouered from darkenesse, the world round about being drowned in superstition and Idolatry. These answeres might bee sufficient; but for your better satisfaction, let vs search the sence of your authorities, by comparing them one with another. The first was a Canon ascribed to the Apostles, which being made when Bishops were scant, requireth two or three. The second drawne from the decrees of Popes, supposed to be made when the number was somewhat increased, requireth three at the least, and the consent of the rest. So the <hi>Nicen</hi> Canon being made when the Church flourished, as also the second at <hi>Arles,</hi> the sixt at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and the second at <hi>Brachar,</hi> besides three present requireth the consent of the absent: but the fourth Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> contenteth it selfe with the present, and maketh no mention at all of the absent, wherein it agreeth with the Canon ascribed to the Apostles. Whence commeth this variety? surely the very consideration of time and persons may teach vs, that they thought it a thing in it selfe indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to be disposed by the discretion of the Church in sundry maners, as sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry occasions and occurrences did leade them. This exposition runneth gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and all things doe sweetely agree; but if wee followe your rigorous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, then your witnesses crosse and discredit one another. For your <hi>Anacletus</hi> requireth three at the least, so doe the Councels alledged; but doe they require them of simple necessitie? if it be so, then hee is no Bishop which is ordained by fewer then by three. But the Canons of the Apostles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him for a Bishop which is Consecrated by two. Againe, the <hi>Nicen</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and others by you alledged, require the consent of the absent, which is not required by the fourth Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> nor by the Canon ascribed to the Apostles. By this it appeareth that reuerend antiquitie did iudge these things to bee onely matters of conueniencie, and not of simple and absolute necessitie. And being of this nature, they are subiect to alteration in case of necessity. Neither is this to despise the Commandements of the Church, but to yeeld to the countermand of the great tyrant necessitie. And this is confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by your owne Writers, concerning all ecclesiasticall constitutions: Pope <note n="a" place="margin">Gel. epist. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bin. t. 2. p. 243.</note>

                  <p>Thus I dispute. <hi>Timothy</hi> was consecrated Bishop by imposition of hands of the Presbytery: But this Presbytery was an assembly of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Therefore <hi>Timothy</hi> was consecrated by an assembly of Presbyters: Now those Presbyters were not inferiour Priestes, but Bishops, as appeareth by <note n="g" place="margin">In hunc locu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> 
                     <hi>Chrysostome, Theophylact,</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius:</hi> therefore <hi>Timothy</hi> was consecrated

by an assembly of Bishops. But an assembly of Bishops must needes be three at the least. Therefore <hi>Timothy</hi> was consecrated Bishop by three Bishops at the least. Now this consecration of <hi>Timothy</hi> should bee a necessary and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall patterne inuiolable, and vnchangeable to all posterities. Therefore all Bishops must of necessitie be consecrated, by three Bishops at the least, which was to be proued.</p>

                     <hi>S.

Secondly, because he was designed and pointed out to this Sacred function, by the <hi>Spirit of Prophecie.</hi> Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was ordained by the imposition of the hands of the Presbyterie. What this Presbyterie was, I will not take vpon mee to decide and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; It shall be sufficient so farre to discouer the weakenesse of your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it may appeare, that you cannot hence conclude your purpose by any sound consequence.

For seeing the text faith only, that there were in the Church which was at <hi>Antioch</hi> Prophets and Doctors, among whom were <hi>Barnabas, Simeon, Lucius, Manahen</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> why should not we thinke <hi>Barnabas</hi> to be called a Prophet as well as <hi>Simeon, Lucius</hi> and <hi>Manahen,</hi> seeing hee is first named? A point so cleere that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by <note n="e" place="margin">

If these Prophets were Bishops as <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> imagineth, then it will follow that <hi>Barnabas</hi> was a Bishop before they laid hands vpon him. And consequently, that he was reordeined, which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd.

For <hi>Paul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Apostle could not receiue any Episcopal grace from man, as hath been declared.

                  <p>Why then did the Church of Rome dispense with the <note n="a" place="margin">Sess. 21. Can. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Cuppe</hi> in the Communion? Can you take away one halfe not diminishing the substance?

If <hi>Episcopall</hi> Consecration bee a Sacrament, and the Pope may not dispense with the <hi>Substance</hi> of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet hee may dispense with two of the three Bishops required in a Consecration; then it followeth, that two of the three are not of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of Consecration. Secondly, your owne present practise doeth proue the same. For you professe that in your Church sometimes, <hi>one</hi>

                  <p>I Will beginne with the fourth <note n="b" place="margin">Conc. Carth. 4. c. 2.

When one alone pronounceth the wordes, thenone alone ordaineth. For the wordes are confessed on all sides, to bee the very essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall forme of Ordination. This is agreeable to the collection of your owne <note n="c" place="margin">Turrec. in Gratian. p. 493.</note> Cardinall, <hi>Tenent librum, &amp;c. Ergo videtur quod nihil agatur per illos Episcopos quod sit ad substantiam consecrationis pertinens. Ergo eorum assistentia non pertinet ad substantiam consecrationis, sed magis ad quandam solennitatem. i. They hold the booke, &amp;c. Therefore it seemeth that nothing is done by these two Bishops which is pertaining to the substance of Consecration. Therefore their assistance doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the substance of the consecration, but rather to a certaine solemnitie.</hi>

                  <p>IN the yeere of our Lord 441. there was a Councell holden at Orenge in<note place="margin">3</note> France where it was thus <note n="d" place="margin">Conc. Auraus. c. 21. Bin. t. 1 pag. 1010.</note> decreed. <hi>Duo si presumpserint ordinare Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum in nostris Prouincijs, &amp;c. If two presume to ordaine a Bishop in our Prouinces, it pleaseth vs (to decree) concerning those presumptuous persons, that if it shall any where happen that two Bishops shall make a Bishop against his will, the authors being condemned, he which suffred violence, shalbe substituted in the Church of one of them, if his life be answerable; and that another neuerthelesse be ordeined in the place of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being cast out: If two shall make a Bishop with his consent, then he also shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, to the end that those things which were instituted by antiquitie, may be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued more warily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Here are two Cases: for the ordained was either vnwilling or willing: If vnwilling, he enioyed the Bishopprick, because he was not consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the breach of the Canon: If he were willing, then he also was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp; put from the Bishopprick, which was not for want of receiuing the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall power; for if two Bishops could confer it to one against his wil, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly they could giue it to one that was willing. But the first is confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Councell, in that they allow him, and giue him a Bishoppricke, where he may exercise his Episcopall function, therefore the latter was not then doubted of. But though both had receiued alike power in their ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet the innocent was allowed, &amp; the offender reiected for discipline sake.</p>

                     <hi>Binius</hi> saith, <hi>When Pelagius had approued the fift Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, he so greatly offended all the Westerne Bishops, that he could not find sufficient Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of which he might be ordained according to the Apostolicall constitution; and so it was necessary that at the Command of Pelagius, a Priest of Ostia (which had neuer happened before) should performe the office in stead of a Bishop.</hi> Heere is a cleare confession, that a Bishop of Rome in case of necessitie, was consecrated only by two Bishops and a Priest. And yet it appeareth by the same place of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasius,</hi> that he ordained in his time 26. Priests, and 49. Bishops. Now if three Bishops be required of absolute necessitie, then there was a nullity in his Consecration, and consequently in all the Consecrations deriued from him, and so there will follow a world of nullities in the Church of Rome: or if there be no nullitie in his Consecration, then you cannot conclude a nullitie for the want of three.</p>
                  <p>HItherto of three, Now I will proue that two are not required of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute<note place="margin">6.</note> necessitie. For <hi>Euagrius Patriarch</hi> of Antioch, was ordained by <hi>Paulinus</hi> alone, and yet was allowed for a lawfull Bishop.</p>

                  <p>No, Neither for your Priesthood, nor for your Church; Not for the first, because the Priesthood which the Apostles conferred, was only a power to minister the word and Sacraments, which being conueied to posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie successiuely by Ordination, is found at this day in some fort in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in regard whereof you may be said to succeed the Apostles, and <hi>Cranmer</hi> you, and wee <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and consequently we also in this succeed the Apostles as well as you. But besides this, which is the Ordinance of God, you haue added another thing, the imagination of your owne braine, which you esteeme the principall function of Priesthood, to wit, a power to offer a Propitiatorie Sacrifice for the quicke and the dead. Now, how is it possible that in this you should succeed the Apostles, seeing (as in due place shall be prooued) they neither were such Priestes themselues, nor

                  <p>What is this to the purpose?

                  <speaker>PHIL.</speaker>
                  <p>We can, if you will grant that vnto vs which is reason should bee graunted. For you must vnderstand that our English Catholicke
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14672:29"/>
Bishops deriue their succession from the Saxons, the Saxons from the French, some of both from the Romane, and the Romane from all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; therefore an infinite number of Recordes must bee searched, if wee will particularly deduce the successiue ordination of any one Bishop of later times. Now although the Church in all ages hath beene carefull to record the Consecrations, yet it is possible that some may bee omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by negligence of Registers, it is possible that some formerly recorded may bee perished by iniury of time, it is possible that some yet remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vpon record, cannot by vs bee attained because they are in the hands of our enemies. But what of all this? seeing the law of the Church in all ages and kingdomes required three, seeing the constant practise of the Christian world, was continuallie by three, therefore when wee reade of any Bishop generally reputed a Bishop, performing the office of a Bishop, by giuing holy orders, subscribing to generall Councels, executing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any checke or controulement the duties belonging to a Bishoppe, wee may in all reason presume that he was made canonically by three; if there be neither publike fame, nor probable reason nor suspition to the contrary. For wanton wittes must not bee suffered vpon their owne fancy to call reuerend antiquity into question. Otherwise seeing none can bee a Bishop vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse hee bee first a Priest, a peeuish man might denie them to bee Bishops vnlesse hee did see their letters of orders. Againe seeing no man can bee a Priest except hee bee baptised, a froward fellow might deny their Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, vnlesse it could bee produced, by whom and where they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised. No Sir, wee may not admit of such dealing, neither must wee bee put to prooue these things, but when there is nothing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, wee may presume them to bee done according to the lawes of the Church, and the generall practise of all Christian nations.</p>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14672:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who at his command, cast his net into the riuer, and tooke a great draught of fishes, which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> bad him take for his passage, reseruing onely one of extraordinarie greatnesse to himselfe, which <hi>hee sent for a token to Mellitus</hi> Bishop of London. Here is his miracle, his presence, and his dedication of the Church, with his owne hands; but here is no preaching; or if there were, then he preached more then 500. yeeres after he was dead. But why doe I dwell so long vpon so fond a fable? Or what is this to the first Conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of England? Wherefore I conclude, that though S. <hi>Peter</hi> were a famous Fisher, searched innumerable streames through the wide world, and cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched many thousand soules; yet father <hi>Parsons</hi> hath not made it appeare by any sound authoritie that euer hee spred hisnet in the English Ocean.</p>

Dauids; Which also in time growing ruinous, was repaired by 12. men comming out of the North: but <hi>K. Inas</hi> pulled it downe, and reared a stately one to <hi>Christ, Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> In this certaine Verses are written; The first 12. whereof, are a continuall commendation of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> by way of comparison; then follow those two which you haue cited, in which he willeth <hi>England to reioyce.</hi> And why? because <hi>Rome sendeth her health:</hi> But how? the next verse declareth, <hi>Because the Apostolicke brightnesse doeth lighten Glastenbury.</hi> Where if the Poet speake of the <hi>brightnes of doctrine</hi> (as you seeme to take it) then it is not necessary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it to the first inhabitants; it may haue relation to the doctrine not long before preached by <hi>Austin:</hi> For I know you will call his doctrine Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicke. Yet it seemeth, that the Poet meaneth not the brightnesse <hi>of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but of patronage and protection:</hi> imagining according to the corrupt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of those times, that the Saints by whose names the Churches were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were Patrons and Protectors of the said Churches. For in the words following, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> are called <hi>two Bulwarks and towers of faith.</hi> And <hi>K. Inas</hi> (who dedicated the Church vnto them,) is said to haue <hi>giuen these Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, as euerlasting gifts</hi> to his people. By which what can be meant, but that those Apostles were now by his Dedication, become their Bulwarks and towers of protection? So the <hi>Apostolicke brightnesse,</hi> (that is their glorious Patronage and protection,) is said to <hi>shine most radiantly ouer Glastenbury;</hi> And <hi>health is said to be sent from Rome,</hi> because they ascribe their safety to those A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, which were the founders of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> which doeth in no case argue that Christianitie was first brought hither from <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <p>In that he wrote this Epistle to this purpose, you may see the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proceeded from his owne brest, and not from <hi>Eleutherius:</hi> he was already made a Christian by the baptisme of the spirit, and therefore was desirous to be made a Christian by the baptisme of water. Hee had already entred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into the schoole of Christ, and sought meanes that his whole kingdome might follow after.

                  <p>To whom had <hi>Frumentius</hi> recourse for the conuerting of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia? The Story whereof is this. A Tyrian Philosopher arriuing in India, was slaine by the Barbarians, with all his company, except two little children which were gone out of the shippe and were learning their lessons vnder a tree. These children were brought vp by the King and aduanced by him: one of them, that is <hi>Adesius,</hi> beeing made his Steward, the other, that is <hi>Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentius,</hi> his Secretary. Afterward the King dying, and leauing his sonne in his nonage, the Queene intreated them both, but especially <hi>Frumentius,</hi> to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist her in the Gouernement of the kingdome. While <hi>Frumentius</hi> was in this authority hee inquired among the Romane Merchants for Christians, hee shewed them all fauour and countenance; and admonished them to haue their assembles for praier and the seruice of God. When the King came to age, they deliuered him the kingdome and departed: <hi>Adesius</hi> to <hi>Tyre, Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentius</hi> to <hi>Alexandria:</hi> where hee went to <hi>Athanaesius,</hi> and told him what was done, intreating him to send some worthy Bishop to those multitudes of Christians, and to those Churches which were built in that barbarous place. Then <hi>Athanasius</hi> calling an assembly of Priests, said, <hi>Where shall we finde such a man in whom is the spirit of God to performe these things?</hi> so hee made <hi>Frumentius</hi> Bp. &amp; sent him into India, and the Lord blessed his labours, signes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were wrought by him, and an infinite company of those barbarous people were conuetted to the faith. This Story is recorded by <note n="a" place="margin">Ruff Eccl. Hist. l. 1. c. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Ruffinus</hi> (who liued at the same time) not out of the rumors of the people, but by the relation of <hi>Adesius</hi> himselfe (the companion of <hi>Frumentius</hi>) who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a Priest of Tyre: And <note n="b" place="margin">Soc. l. 1. c. 15</note>

                  <p>Doctor <hi>Stapleton</hi> being a man of such learning, wisedome, and zeale, and purposing to benefite his country in singular manner by turning the story of Saint <hi>Bede</hi> into English, without question did vse all possible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to get varietie of copies, both printed and manuscript, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all together, made choice of the best.</p>

                  <p>Then haue I followed the best edition of <hi>Bede,</hi> for I haue not departed one letter from the translation of <hi>Stapleton;</hi> yet you see your owne approued edition which <hi>Stapleton</hi> made choise of, conuinceth, that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> willed <hi>Austin</hi> at first to make bishops alone, though hee would haue none created afterward without three or foure.</p>

                  <p>Doe you thinke that there came no Bishops out of France to assist?</p>

                  <p>No such thing can bee collected out of <hi>Bede;</hi> neither is it probable: for in the very next <note n="a" place="margin">Bed. l. 1. cap. 28.</note> Chapter, <hi>Gregory</hi> writeth to the Bishop of <hi>Arles, to giue kinde entertainement to</hi> Austin, <hi>if hee should come vnto him,</hi> But of any Bishops to bee sent into England, there is not a word. And in the Chapter following, <hi>Gregory</hi> writeth to <hi>Austin, sendeth him a Pall, and willeth him to ordaine twelue Bishops,</hi> But of French Bishops to assist him, he saith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. And in the second booke and third Chapter it is declared, how that <hi>in the yeere of the incarnation of our Lord</hi> 604. Austin <hi>Archbishop of Britane consecrated two Bishops, Mellitus Bishop of London, and</hi> Iustus <hi>Bishop of Rochester,</hi> but of any French Bishops assisting him there is no mention. And for the Brittish Bishops that they should helpe him, it is not once to be imagined, because they stood at vtter defiance with him. Therefore if wee consult with <hi>Stapletons Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi> and embrace that copy for best which hee followed, it will appeare that <hi>Austin</hi> proceeded to <hi>Episcopall</hi> consecration, and yeelding to necessitie, made the first Bishop, that is <hi>Mellitus,</hi> alone, and the next that is <hi>Iustus,</hi> by the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Mellitus</hi> onely, and when there was a canonicall number, then they obserued the number of three at the least.</p>

                  <p>Surely in diuerse copies it is otherwise then you haue allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: as for example, in the Parisian edition of <hi>Gregory,</hi> Anno 1586. It is thus, <hi>Et quidem etiam in Anglorum ecclesia in qua adhuc solus tu Episcopus inueniris, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare Episcopum non aliter nisi cum Episcopis potes. i. Truly euen in the Church of the English, wherein thou onely art found as yet to bee a Bishop, thou canst not ordaine Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops otherwise then with other Bishops.</hi> And because <hi>Austin</hi> was the onely Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop then in England, therefore in the next sentence he telleth him, whence hee shall haue Bishops; <hi>Nam quando de Gallijs Episcopi veniunt, illi in ordinatione Episcopi testes tibi assistant. i. For when the Bishops come out of France, let them assist thee in the ordination of a Bishop.</hi>

                  <p>For the clearing of this point we must consider both these sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences with their dependencie and connexion. In the former there are two
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:14672:38"/>
readings, <hi>cum Episcopis,</hi> and <hi>sine Episcopis.</hi> The latter was followed by Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour <hi>Stapleton,</hi> and is the true reading. For vnderstanding that in Oxford some were appointed for the collation of the printed copies of <hi>Gregorie,</hi> with the manuscripts, I enquired how this place was read in the manuscripts, and answere was made that these <hi>Interrogata</hi> were not in the written co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, but inserted as it seemeth into the workes of <hi>Gregory</hi> out of <hi>Bede.</hi> Then I enquired after the manuscripts of <hi>Bede,</hi> and saw diuerse, all consenting in this reading <hi>sine Episcopis,</hi> with which concordeth a most worthy copie of vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable antiquitie at <hi>Eton</hi> Colledge, which the learned and iudicious Sir <hi>Henry Sauil</hi> did shew vnto me. With the manuscripts agreeth your own last edition of the workes of <hi>Bede</hi> printed at Collen in the yeere 1612. As also the Epistles of <hi>Gregory</hi> both in the Romane edition, as they are in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels set out by <hi>Surius</hi> and <hi>Binius:</hi> yea these <hi>Interrogata</hi> are produced by <hi>Iohn</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">

                     <hi>Capgraue</hi> who readeth precisely in the same manner. Wherefore it is as cleare as the noone day, that the true reading is <hi>sine Episcopis,</hi> as <hi>Stapleton</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slateth: and thus much of the first sentence. In the second wee must consider, both the reading and the pointing, concerning the varietie of reading (to passe ouer <hi>de gallis</hi> and <hi>de gallijs, veniunt</hi> and <hi>venient,</hi> which are of small mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and doe not alter the sense.) The Parisian and Romane editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, read (<hi>illi</hi>) which is erronious, for the true treading is <hi>qui,</hi> to bee iustified by <hi>Capgraue,</hi> the manuscripts before alleadged, and Doctour <hi>Stapleton.</hi> Now the wordes being thus cleared, must needes bee read with an interrogation, (otherwise there will bee no sence) and the latter sentence rendreth a reason of the former in this manner. Thou must needs make Bishops alone, for who should assist thee? the Britaines? they stand in opposition, and are not once to be thought vpon: the English? there are none: both which branches hee presupposeth as granted: the French? but when doeth any of them come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer into England: as though hee should say, their comming is vncertaine, so he concludeth, that <hi>Austin</hi> must make Bishops alone without other Bishops. Now from <hi>Austin</hi> we will proceede to his successours</p>

For what needed he to moue any such que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, if it were not to raise a mist, and cast a cunning surmise to induce men to thinke that it was so? But indeede it was not so: for our soueraignes in the aduancing of Bishops do nothing but that which they may lawfully by their Princely right, agreeable to the patterne of most religious Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and iustifiable both by the lawes of God and the land, as in due place shall appeare.

such a fire in the kings bosome, that it vexed his very soule and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.

                     <hi>Campeius</hi> who arriued the seuenth of <hi>October</hi> 1528. At this time there was great war between <hi>Charles</hi>

                     <hi>the Emperor, and Francis the French king,</hi> about the kingdome of Naples, wherein the Pope wished that the French might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, least the Emperour obtaining it should sit too close vpon his skirts. Wherefore to weaken the Emperour, he moued a league betweene the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and the French; for procuring whereof hee did not onelie referre this matrimoniall cause to his said Legats but also of <hi>his owne meere motion no man requesting him,</hi> gaue <hi>Campeius</hi> a secret Bull <note n="c" place="margin">The coppie whereof is in Antisand: p. 200.</note> in his bosome, dated the sixth of the kal: of <hi>Ian. anno</hi> 1527.

                     <hi>openly he commaunded him to handle the cause with all expedition, yet secretlie hee willed him to protract the time, promising that hee himselfe would watch a fit oportunitie to publish the Decree.</hi> So the King and Queene were cited to appeare before them in May following, at which time after some debating of the cause, they protracted the sentence till the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of August, notwithstanding the Kings earnest entreatie, to haue a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall determination one way or other, for the better quieting of his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled conscience. When August came, the King expected an end, but the crafty Cardinals considering, that if they should iudge according to Gods law, it would bee a great derogation from the Church of Rome, deuised delayes; so <hi>Campeius</hi> alleadged, that hee was a member of the Court of Rome, whose custome was to keepe a solemne vacation in the dogge daies, and thereupon deferred iudgement till October following. In the meane time the Pope seeing that King <hi>Henry</hi> could not bee drawne by hope of diuorce, to take part with the French, sent to <hi>Campeius,</hi> 
                     <note n="d" place="margin">Antisande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus p. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Commanding him to burne the former Bull.</hi> And before the beginning of October <hi>Campeius</hi> was called home by the Popes letters. The King beeing thus deluded sent to the Pope at Bononie, requesting some end, but hee would needs pause vpon the matter till he came to Rome.</p>
                  <p>ABout this time it pleased the diuine prouidence so to dispose, that<note place="margin">3</note> the King <note n="e" place="margin">Antiq.

It fell out, that they lodged in the house of one Master <hi>Cressy,</hi> whither <hi>Cranmer</hi> also (beeing tutor to two of Master <hi>Cressyes</hi> sonnes) was come at that time with his pupils, by reason of the plague then in Cambridge.

                     <hi>answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that nothing did more prolong the cause, nor more torment the Kings conscience, then the dilatory protractions, and winding inuolutions in the Romane Court, with which snares whosoeuer are once intangled, doe hardly euer recouer themselues.</hi>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:14672:42"/>
                     <hi>Wherefore hee thought good, that leauing those Courtly trials and delayes wherewith the King was so tossed with such griefes of minde. The opinions of Diuines both in our owne Vniuersities and in others should bee enquired concerning this cause which is determinable by the Lawe of God, and not by the Law of man. And if the Diuines shall agree and pronounce that the marriage is lawfull or vnlawfull by the Law of God, let not the king seeke any more to the Court of Rome, but cause sentence to bee giuen in his owne dominions, according to the iudgement of the Diuines, so being cheerefull in minde, and free in conscience, hee may liue a Princely life, and worthy this common-wealth in lawfull matrimonie, which is to be wished of all vs Christian subiects.</hi> This answere pleased them exceedingly, and they presently related it vnto the King, to whom Doctor <hi>Fox</hi> made mention of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> but <hi>Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> would haue challenged all the glory to themselues. Then said the <note n="a" place="margin">Act. &amp; Mon.</note> King, <hi>Where is that</hi> Cranmer, <hi>hee hath the sowe by the right eare.

                     </note> sentence, dated in his consistorie at Rome the twentie third of March, Anno 1532.</p>
                  <p>ABout this time dyed Archbishop <hi>Warham</hi> while <hi>Cranmer</hi> was Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour in Germany, and vpon the vacancie of the Archbishopricke, the King sent for him home, with purpose to aduance him to that great dignitie: but he pretended matters of great importance requiring his abode in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, by which meanes he deferred his comming for halfe a yeeare. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come home, and perceiuing that the place was reserued for him, hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his greatest friends to shift it off. When the King did personally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part his intent vnto him, hee disabled himselfe by all possible meanes, vsing all perswasions to alter the Kings determination. When he saw the Kings constant resolution, he humbly crauing pardon of his grace, franckly opened his conscience vnto him, declaring that if hee accepted that office, then hee must receiue it at the Popes hand; which he neither would not could doe, for that his highnesse was the onely supreme gouernour of this Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as well in causes ecclesiasticall as temporall, &amp; that the donation of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprickes belonged to the King, and not to any forraine authoritie what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer. All which proceedings doe not argue any ambitious or aspiring co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, but rather an humble and lowly minde: preferring the sinceritie of a good conscience before all glorious pompe, and worldly dignities. The King seeing the tendernesse of his conscience, consulted with the learned in the law, how hee might bestow the Bishopricke vpon him, and yet not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force him to any thing against his conscience. In conclusion, hee tooke the oath to the Pope, but not after the manner of his predecessours, as <note n="d" place="margin">De Sch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> l. 1. pag. 58.</note>

For then hee should haue taken it <hi>simply and absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> which hee did not, but with a <hi>protestation,</hi> expressing the condition and qualification. Neither did hee make his protestation priuately in a corner, and then take the oath in publicke, as <hi>Sanders</hi> would make the world beleeue, (for if this could bee proued, then had you reason to condemne him of fraud and periurie,) but it was not so. He did not vse his protestation in any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and concealed manner like to equiuocating Papists, which take oaths in absolute words, and yet delude them with mentall reseruations: but he made it plainely and publickly, first in the Chapter house; secondly kneeling before the high Altar in the hearing both of the Bishops and people at his consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Thirdly, in the very same place, and in the very same forme and tenour of wordes, when by commission from the Pope, they deliuered him the Pall.

Wherefore, if King <hi>Henries</hi> case were any of these foure, his resistance was lawfull. To passe ouer the first, and the last, it shalbe suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient if we ponder the other two, touching the inuading of the soule, and the troubling of the Commonwealth. While the King was yet in his nonage, hee was dispensed with all by the Pope, against the eternall Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, to marry his brothers wife: and afterward being informed of the vnlawfullnesse thereof, hee intreated the Pope either to iustifie his dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation by the word of God, or to dissolue the marriage; yet hee would doe neither, but left him long in anguish of minde and perplexitie of conscience: and at last gaue finall sentence to binde him to liue in a marriage, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his owne Cardinals, his owne vniuersities, yea and by his owne former Bull, wherein hee had pronounced, <hi>That the King could not continue in it without sin.</hi> Let any indifferent man iudge whether this were not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade the soules of men? Now let vs see, whether hee did trouble the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. By meanes of this dispensation the mindes of men were greatly distracted, some holding with the Pope, others embracing the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of learned men through the famous vniuersities of Christendome. Thus the whole world stood in suspence, and the inheritance, and succession of the Crowne was commonly called in question both by subiects and stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: Was not this euidently &amp; notoriously to trouble the Commonwealth? So according to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> positions, it was lawfull for K. <hi>Henry,</hi> and his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to resist the Pope, and therefore this resistance was not schismaticall.</p>

Now, in holy Orders it must be obserued, That the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Character doeth differ from the Episcopall. For the Episcopall is either an other, or the same extended: so that it conteineth the Priestly, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what else. A Priest in respect of his Priestly Character, is first of all the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke and ordinary Minister of Baptisme: For a Lay-man may not Baptise publickely, but onely priuately; Neither priuately in the presence of the Priest or Deacon, but onely in their absence. Neither alwayes in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; but onely in case of necessitie; for then a Lay-man, be he Iew or infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, may Baptize, so hee intend to doe that, which the Catholicke Church doeth, in that kinde of Administration. A Deacon may Baptise, not onely priuately but publickely, so it be at the appointment of the Bishop or Priest. But a Priest may <hi>suo iure</hi> Baptize, <hi>ex Officio,</hi> euen in the presence of a Bishop; as is declared by <note n="a" place="margin">In Catechis. Trident.</note> 
                     <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> and the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> who qualifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion, and reduce it to a tollerable sence. Secondly, a Priest by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Priestly Character, may consecrate the <hi>Hoaste,</hi> which no Lay-man, King, nor Emperour, no Angel, nor Archangel, can performe: because they want this Character. Indeed a Deacon may helpe to minister the Eucharist, but he cannot Consecrate, no not by dispensation; If he should take it vpon him, he should effect nothing. But euery Priest receiueth in his Ordination, a Character, not from man, but from the Eternall God, which in respect of the Eucharist, is absolute, perfect and independent. <note n="b" place="margin">Bell de sacr. in Gen. l. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So saith <hi>Baronius,</hi> but I will proue the contrary. For as you heard before, it was decreed that all which <hi>Constantine</hi> did in Ecclesiasticall Sacraments and diuine worship should be reiterated, excepting onely Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me and confirmation; but what thinke you, did not Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Councell, account holy orders an Ecclesiasticall Sacrament?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>PHIL.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes vndoubtedly.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>ORTH.</speaker>
                  <p>Then vndoubtedly they decreede that the holy orders should be reiterated, which were giuen by <hi>Constantine.</hi> And therfore if they were one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reconciled, and not reordained, then Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> did contrary to his own decree; which is most absurde. Wherefore it is a cleare case that Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> the fourth vsed reordination.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>PHIL.</speaker>
                  <p>If he did so, then he was blame worthy. For though <hi>Constantine</hi> were a Schismaticall Antipope, though of a lay man, hee was suddenly made Bishop, and hudled vp his orders in all hast contrary to the Canons: yet wee cannot deny, but he receiued those orders, and had power in respect of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall Character to deliuer them vnto others. And seeing his Character was indeleble as wee haue proued, therefore though he had not onely beene a Schismaticke, but also an Hereticke excommunicated and degraded, yet he could not haue lost his power of giuen orders.</p>

                  <p>We thinke that no man can possibly haue the order of a Bishop which hath not the right order of Priesthood, but the Priesthood conferred in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time was no Priesthood, because they wanted the authority to offer the blessed sacrifice of the Masse, therefore those Priests were not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the Episcopall order.</p>

                  <p>I answere first that seeing that King <hi>Edward</hi> rained but sixe yeeres and fiue moneths, it is likely that most of them which were aduanced in his time to bee Bishops, were before his time in the order of Priesthood. Secondly, if any be produced which were not, yet it shalbe iustified (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) when we come to the point, that the order of Priesthood conferred in the dayes of King <hi>Edward,</hi> Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>Iames</hi> is the true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of the Gospel, and that your sacrificing Priesthood is sacrilegious, and abominable.

                  <p>The old Bishops were all made in the dayes of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and almost all in those very times, which you brand with imputation of schisme and heresie: when none could bee Consecrated, vnlesse hee did sweare to the king against the Pope. Wherefore seeing you iudged both Consecrators, and Consecrated schismaticall, and hereticall, and yet esteeme them Canonicall, your obiections of schisme and heresie, must eternally bee silenced in the question of Canonicall Bishops. For if these crimes can frustrate a Consecration, then their Consecration was frustrate, and they were no Bishops, or if they were Bishops and Canonicall, then all the Bishops in King <hi>Henries</hi> time, were likewise Canonicall. Moreouer, some of them whom you so commend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were Bishops in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, as for example. <hi>Thomas Thurlby,</hi> whom King <hi>Henrie</hi> promoted to be Bishop of Westminster, was aduanced by King <hi>Edward</hi> to the Bishopricke of Norwich, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward preferred by Queene <hi>Mary</hi> to the Bishopricke of Ely, and moreouer to be one of her priuie Councell.

Chauncelour of Eng. made open declaration in Parliament, of Q. <hi>Maries</hi> death, and the vndoubted title of the Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth:</hi> Whereupon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> she was presently proclaimed Queene. For which loyalty he was honorably regarded, neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to prison or custody, but permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to liue at his owne liberty, (vpon some lands which he had purchased) in quietnes and ease, and last of all dying full of yeeres, was suffered to bequeath his substance by will &amp; testament. From Yorke, let vs go to Durham, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop wherof <hi>Cut. Tonstal,</hi> after his depriuation, kept at Lambeth, with <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Parker,</hi> Archbishop of Canterbury, where he liued, (so long as he liued) with comfort, and being 85. yeeres old, yeelded to nature, and was honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly buried. The third was <hi>Owen Oglethorp</hi> Bishop of Carlill, who as he had shewed himselfe more dutiful then the rest, in the Coronation of the Queene: so there is no doubt but he was accordingly respected: who being neither in prison nor custody, shortly after paid his debt to nature, and dyed of an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy. The last of these foure was <hi>Cutbert Scot,</hi> Bishop of Chester, who slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:14672:59"/>
away beyond the seas, where he liued in voluntary banishment. From the Prouince of Yorke, let vs come to the Prouince of Canterbury: where we find that <hi>Iohn white</hi> Bishop of Winchester, saluted the prison, though not for any of the reasons alleadged by <hi>Sanders,</hi> but for an vndutifull Sermon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet afterward he was set at liberty, and died out of prison. <hi>Thomas Thurlby</hi> Bishop of Ely, hauing indured a time of imprisonment, neither very sharpe nor very long, was permitted to liue in the Archbishoppes house, where till the day of his death, (that is, for tenne yeeres) hee was intreated so kindly, that he is supposed to haue taken more pleasure in this time of his restraint, then euer he did before, in the middest and fullest streame of his highest honours. <hi>Gilbert Borne</hi> Bishop of Bath was committed to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody of Master <hi>Carew,</hi> his olde acquaintance, Deane of Exeter. <hi>Iames Turberuill</hi> Bishop of Exeter enioyed a priuate life a long time, liuing and dying in liberty. <hi>Dauid Pole,</hi> Bishop of Peterborrow, being alwayes vsed with courtesie, and vsing his liberty, dyed in his owne house in a ripe age. Neither doe I finde that <hi>Bayne</hi> Bishop of Lichfield, was in durance, who dyed soone after of the stone. <hi>Richard Pates</hi> Bishop of Worcester, and <hi>Thomas Goldwell</hi> of Saint <hi>Asaph,</hi> departed the kingdome, not by constraint of law, but of their owne accord. The Bishop of Lincolne <hi>Thomas Watson,</hi> a churlish and froward man, liued after his depriuation 24. yeeres, first at more libertie in the houses of the Bishoppes of Ely and Rochester, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when your Emissaries from Rome, did trouble the Church, he was kept somewhat more streightly in the Ile of Ely. The last of all is <hi>Edmund Bonner,</hi> Bishop of London, who in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Butcher, and therefore so odious to the people, that as our learned <note n="a" place="margin">Tort Torti<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pag. 147.</note> Bishop hath of late truely deliuered, <hi>It was not safe for him to goe abroad, least the people should haue stoned him to death:</hi> and he indeed liued, and dyed in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but where, if you had seene him (to vse the wordes of our Reuerend <note n="b" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> Bishop) <hi>You would not haue sayd, that he had beene pined, or starued with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, hee liued daintily, there were Gardens and Orchards, if it pleased him to walke: Finally this prison was nothing like a prison, but onely that (therein) he was confined.</hi> Thus it appeareth, that of the 14. some were neuer confined at all; Others confined onely to the custody of their friends, but neuer saluted the prison: others saluted it, but were soone released; and those which stayed longest in prison, yet were not layed in fetters, as impious <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> hath blazed to the world. All these 14. did liue euen till the glasse of Nature was fully runne and expired, and some of them were intertained at the Tables of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, <note n="c" place="margin">Ibidem.</note>

cursed opinion of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> and deposed <hi>Flauianus</hi> Bishop of Constantinople, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> vpon this occasion wrote thus vnto the Emperour <hi>Theodosius;</hi>

                     <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, most Christian and reuerend Emperour, I, with the rest of my fellow Bishops, make supplication vnto you, That all things may stand in the same state, in which they were before any of these Iudgements, vntill a greater number of Bishops may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the whole world.</hi> Who made this supplication? Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> a holy and learned Pope. To whom? To the Emperour <hi>Theodosius.</hi> For what? That the Emperour would command; not intreat, but command: So this is an action of Royall authoritie. What should he command? <hi>That all things might stand in their former state.</hi> What things meaneth he? The highest mysteries of Religion, concerning the Natures and person of <hi>Christ.</hi> But what is it to stand in the former state? That it might be lawfull for all men, so to iudge and speake of these holy Mysteries, as they did before the springing vp of the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Heresie: for then they held the Trueth, according to the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke faith. And this he beseecheth the Emperour to command, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the contrary determination of the Councell of <hi>Ephesus.</hi>

                     <hi>The second Councell of Ephesus, which apparantly subuerted the faith, cannot rightly bee called a Councell, which your Highnes for very loue to the Trueth, will make voyd by your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to the contrary, most glorious Emperour. I therefore earnestly request and beseech your Maiestie by our Lord</hi> Iesus Christ, <hi>the founder and guider of your Kingdome, That in this Councell (of Chalcedon) which is presently to be kept, you will not suffer the Faith to be called in question, which our blessed Fathers preached, being deliuered vnto them from the Apostles; Neither permit such things as haue bene long since con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by them, to be freshly reuiued againe, but that you will rather command, That the Constitutions of the ancient Nicene Councell may stand in force, the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hereticks being remooued.</hi> Here the Pope ascribeth to the Emperour power to ratifie and establish those Councels, which are according to the Scripture, and to disanull those whose determinations are contrary to the Scripture; Yea, he acknowledgeth, that the Emperour hath authoritie to inhibite and restraine Generall Councels, that they call not the Trueth of God in question.

Therefore when the Emperor said, <hi>That the diuine prouidence had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him the gouernment of the vniuersall ship,</hi> hee must needs be vnderstood as well of causes Ecclesiasticall as ciuill. Which may yet appeare further by the Emperors words, as they are in <hi>Surtus</hi> immediatly following in the same sentence; <hi>Omne studium arripuimus &amp; ante publicas curas Ecclesiasticas dissoluere,</hi> i. <hi>When the diuine prouidence had committed vnto vs the gouernment of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall ship, we vsed all diligence to dispatch Ecclesiasticall cares, before the publike af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the Commonwealth.</hi> So if <hi>Surius</hi> wilbe iudged by his owne Edition, and giue the Emperour leaue to expound himselfe; then <hi>Ecclesiasticall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires</hi> must be comprehended in the gouernment of the <hi>Vniuersall ship.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though <hi>Surius</hi> would raze out the word <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> foist in <hi>Vobis</hi> instead of <hi>Nobis,</hi> yet whether we compare either of them with himselfe, or each of them with other, it is euident that the Emperor <hi>Basil,</hi> did challenge <hi>the gouernement of the vniuersal ship, both Ecclesiastical and Ciuil,</hi> and that in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell, no man resisting him.

                  <p>Here are two things to be considered. First the princely power and authority; Secondly the ability rightly to vse and exercise the same. The princely power and authority is giuen immediatly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, both vnto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes, and also vnto Ethnickes which are guided only by the light &amp; law of nature, and by constitutions thence deduced by the wit of man.

A Prince, as a Prince, be he good or bad, Christian or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, in respect of his princely calling hath sufficient power and authoritie to gouerne his people according to the will of God. And it is his dutie so to doe. <note n="c" place="margin">Esai. 45. 2. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord said vnto Cyrus, I will goe before thee and make the crooked streight; I will breake the brasen doores, and burst the Iron barres.

So it is their dutie to serue God, not onely as they are men, but as they are Kings. And <hi>Kings</hi> (saith Saint <note n="d" place="margin">Aust. ep. 50.</note> 
                     <hi>Austin</hi>) <hi>doe in this serue God as Kings, when they doe those things to serue him which none but Kings can doe.</hi> But what is that? It may appeare by these wordes; <note n="e" place="margin">Epist. 48.</note> 
                     <hi>Seruiant reges terrae Christo, eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am leges ferendo pro Christo.</hi> i. <hi>Let the Kings of the earth serue Christ euen by making lawes for Christ.</hi> For though the immediate end of humane societes be peace and prosperitie, yet the last end of all, and most principally to bee respected is the glory of God, and eternall happinesse. For which purpose it is the dutie of all subiects to pray for their Prince, though hee bee a Pagan, <hi>that</hi>

                     </hi> But though euery Prince, in that hee is a Prince, hath authoritie to serue God as a Prince, yet for the due execution thereof there is required grace. Authoritie is in a Pagan; the due execution requireth a Christian. The King of Niniuie had authoritie long before, to proclaime a fast; <hi>Nabuchodonosor</hi> had authoritie to commaund, that all nations and languages should worship the God of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel:</hi> but they put it not in execution till God touched their hearts: and when they put it in execution, it was not by any new authoritie, but by vertue of their former Princely power heretofore abused, but now vsed rightly by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Gods Spirit, and assistance of his grace. The truth of which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere that you may see in another glasse, let vs a little remooue our speech from the Prince to the Priest: I demande therefore, if the Priestes, the sonnes of <hi>Aaron</hi> were not the messengers of the Lord of hosts?</p>

It was of such a transcendencie, that all the diuels may seeme to haue holden a blacke conuocation in Hell, and there to haue concluded such a sulphurious and Acheronticall deuice, as was neuer heard of since the world began.

                  <p>But you told vs that the Character is indeleble: therefore they could not loose the power of Consecrating by loosing their Bishopriks.

                     <hi>We would haue you to know that</hi> Gregory, <hi>being made Bishop vnlawfully, by heretickes, and brought by them into your citie is deposed from his Bishopricke by the whole Synode, although in very deed hee was neuer Bishop, therfore farewell, and receiue your Bishop Athanasius.</hi> Thus you see that though <hi>Athanasius</hi> fled away in time of persecution, though he were deposed by a Councel, and another chosen in his place, by another Councell, with the consent of the Emperour; yet for all this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is iudged to be the true Bishop of Alexandria, and <hi>Gregory</hi> neuer to haue beene the Bishop thereof.

                  <p>Betweene the <hi>Regall</hi> and <hi>Episcopall</hi> there are many differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but it shall bee sufficient for our present purpose to obserue these two: first the <hi>Episcopall</hi> Iurisdiction is onely spirituall, or Ecclesiasticall: but the <hi>Regall</hi> is both Ecclesiasticall and temporall. Secondly, the King doth gouerne Ecclesiasticall affaires, not Ecclesiastically but regally, that is, with a soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne authoritie outwardly coercitiue with temporall punishments: The Bishop handleth Ecclesiasticall matters in Ecclesiasticall manner. For hee is enabled by himselfe, and <hi>ex officio ordinario,</hi> not onely to minister the word and Sacraments, but also to performe other holy and eminent actions: as for example, to ordaine Ministers, and to inflict spirituall censures vpon the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendours, namely the sentence of excommunication, and againe, to absolue and restore them to the Communion of Saints: Which sacred offices <note n="a" place="margin">Nos Principi censurae pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statem non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>our Church ascribeth not vnto the person of the Prince,</hi> neither did our Kings or Queenes euer practise them. For regall Iurisdiction consisteth not in a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall power, nor personall performance of such things, but in an outward supreame commanding authoritie, as was <note n="b" place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 3.</note> before declared out of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition annexed to the Queenes iniunctions, an acte of Parliament, and the Articles of Religion: Wherefore as it was not lawfull for the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> to take vpon them the Priestly office, to <note n="c" place="margin">2.

belonging to those Courts, are onely such as are originally and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Ecclesiasticall: the manner to ratifie their iudgements, is not properly vnder any corporall mulct, but onely by spirituall censures, as suspension excommunication and such like. In both which respects, the Iurisdiction of Bishops hath beene much inlarged by the fauour and indulgence of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes.

                     <hi>As though they had beene pronounced by the Emperour himselfe.</hi> Now all the Iurisdiction which Bishops haue in Ciuill Causes is meerely from the Prince. Concerning the manner, it seemeth sometimes expedient to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex coactiue power to the Episcopall office, both for the honour of Prelacie, and also to make their spirituall censures the more regarded, which also without controuersie, must bee acknowledged to proceede from the Prince. For as the Lord hath compacted the light into the body of the Sunne, that thence it might be communicated to Moone and Starres: So hee hath put all ciuill and coactiue Iurisdiction, into the person of the Prince, from whom as from a glorious Sunne or fountaine, all other inferiour lampes doe bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row their light. But if wee speake of that Episcopall Iurisdiction, which both in respect of matter and manner, is meerely spirituall; the immediate fountaine of it is God himselfe; as our most learned and religious King, with his royall Penne, hath thus witnessed to the world. <note n="c" place="margin">Prae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="5 letters">

                     <hi>To stirre vp the grace which is giuen him,</hi> it is to be expounded not onely of the grace of Order, but of all Episcopall grace. And <hi>S.

For who can giue any grace to the Pastours of the Church, but onely the God of all grace, which giueth Pastours to the Church, and appointeth them to be rulers ouer his family? To <hi>Salmeron</hi> we may adde <hi>Henr.

                  <p>The power it selfe is equall in all, though the determination of the power, which is from the Church, be vnequall. When a Bishop is translated to another See, hee doeth not lose his former habituall power, no more then the Sunne doeth lose his light when hee passeth to the other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere. When a Bishop of a smaller Circuit is aduanced to a greater, he getteth not a greater power, but a larger subiect whereupon he may exercise his power. And when a Bishop is deposed, hee is not absolutely depriued of his power, but the matter is taken away, vpon which his power should worke. This is confessed by <note n="c" place="margin">Franc.

So that to loose, and to open: to shut, and to bind: is altogether the same.

Feed them by doctrine, Feed them by example: thou shalt meet and encounter with many Beares, and lyons, yet forsake not thy function for feare, but if thou loue me, feed my flock.

                  <p>Then it seemeth there is great difference betweene the Apostles and the Pope, for the Apostles did not challenge their owne right, they did gratifie the people and grant it vnto them: but the Pope will rake all vnto himselfe though hee rob Prince, Priest, and people. Now whereas you say they did that by the grant of the Apostles, it is true, if by grant you meane the consent and counsel of the Apostles; <note n="i" place="margin">Actes 6. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

For there was then speciall reason, why the whole Church should haue interest, in the choice of Deacons, because the treasure of the whole Church was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to their trust. But admit it were absolutely <hi>by the grant of the Apostles:</hi> yet marke what you say, <hi>by the grant of the Apostles;</hi> not of <hi>Peter</hi> alone, but <hi>of the Apostles.</hi> Thus it doth not appeare that

They had power to minister the word and Sacraments, wherein euery Presbyter succeedeth them.

                     <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith; <hi>In those dayes the pastours were made by prophesie: what is, by prophecie? by the holy Ghost; as Saul was shewed by prophecie, when hee lay hid among the stuffe: as the holy Ghost said, separate vnto me</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas, <hi>so was</hi> Timothie <hi>chosen.</hi>

Now of these three, the first and third were by God himselfe; the second by all the faithfull. This is all wee finde in Scripture; yet here is no precept, but onely example. Wherefore it seemeth that the Lord hath left this point as a thing indifferent to bee ordered by the discretion of the Church, so all things be done honestly and in order. From the Scripture, if wee come to the ages following, they referred it to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and people.</p>

Yet for al this the Popes would neuer be quiet till they had, if not wholly vanquished, yet wonderfully weakened it, especially <hi>Pius</hi> the 2. who was one of the Bishops in the councel of Basil, but now beeing Pope, hee is become another man; neither wanted there some which to please the Pope, opposed themselues against it; whose subtilties and Sophismes are answered by that famous Canonist Archbishop <hi>Panormitan,</hi> who was himselfe also one of the Bishops in the councel of Basil.

                     <hi>Paris did interpose an appeale to the next general councell,</hi> which appeale stood with iustice &amp; equity for 3. reasons; first because the fact of the king was not voluntary but by compulsion: Secondly, because the Parisians whom it must concerned were neither called nor heard. Thirdly, because there is no reason that the councell of Lateran and constitution of <hi>Leo,</hi> should derogate from the authority of the councel of Basil. And if we should suppose, that it did not onelie derogate from it but also abrogate it, yet the verie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> yeeldeth to the King the power of nomination, in these wordes: <note n="h" place="margin">Duarenus quo supra. c. 12</note>

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:14672:99"/>
king referred him to the Parliament following, which would by no meanes consent that Rome-runners, should get their benefices as in former time. In the dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> the fift, when the Pope by his bulles, translated <hi>Richard</hi> of Lincolne to Yorke, the Deane and Chapter standing vpon the lawes of the land, refused to admit him, as hereafter shall be declared. Shall wee now say that the kings of England conferre spiritual promotions by the Popes indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence? let king <hi>Edward</hi> the first be witnesse: let the Parliament in the raigne of <hi>Edward</hi> the third be witnesse: let the like Parliament in the time of <hi>Richard</hi> the second, be witnesse: let the Deane and Chapter of Yorke be witnesse: all which were of the Popish religion, and yet referred this to the king, and not to the Pope. Hitherto, that the kings of England vsed Inuestitures.</p>
                  <p>NOw I will prooue that they vsed them lawfully by a double right, as<note place="margin">2</note> Princes, &amp; as Patrons. As Princes, for many reasons: First, if we looke into the old Testament, we find that <hi>Salomon</hi> set <hi>Sadock</hi> in the roume of <hi>Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar:</hi> by what authoritie? Verely by the same by which he cast out <hi>Abiathar.</hi> Which I haue already prooued to be done by the lawful and ordinary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a Prince. If this be a perpetuall patterne for all posteritie, then the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of spirituall dignities, is the Princes right. Secondly, it was prophesied of Christian Princes, that they should be <note n="a" place="margin">Isa. 49. 23</note> 
                     <hi>nursing fathers</hi> of the Church; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must bee a part of their Princely care to prouide such nurses as shall feede it with the milke of the Gospel. Thirdly, in the new Testament, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the election of pastours, we find neither precept, nor any such exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as can bee vrged, for an euerlasting and vnchangeable rule. And if wee look into the practise of the Church, it will appeare that it hath bene disposed of in diuers ages, in diuers maners, according to diuers customes, and positiue lawes of Princes, growing out of the diuersitie of circumstances and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Wherefore it seemeth that the Lord hath left it as a thing indifferent to the discretion of the Church: whereof the Christian Prince is not onely a part, but Supreame gouernour vnder Christ; in which respect though hee were not Patron, he hath a transcendent and supereminent power, so that the Soueraigne direction and moderation of the matter belongeth vnto him. Which was acknowledged to be the kings right, euen in the time of Popery, as may appeare by the practise: for after the death of any incumbent of any Church with cure, if the Patron presented not within sixe monethes, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of that Diocesse might bestow it, to the end the cure should not bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of a pastour: if he neglected the time appointed, the Metropolitane of that Diocesse might adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce one to that Church; &amp; if he also should leaue the Church destitute, by the space limitted vnto him, then it belonged to the king and not to the Bishop of Rome to prouide a competent pastour for that Church. Thus it is euident that though Churches had Patrons to prouide Pastours for them according to the kings Lawes; and Bishops and Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to see it sufficiently done, yet in case of neglect, the care of it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolued to the King, as being Supreme gouernour euen in these cases within his own Dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. If you say that this was by the grant of the Pope, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is manifest, because in the 25. of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. in the noble statute of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisours, <hi>the Bishop of Rome</hi> is said <hi>to vsurpe the Seignories of such possessions and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices.</hi> Wherefore the Lawes of the land, and the ancient custome of the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:14672:100"/>
Kingdome concurring with the generall practise of Princes, receiued with the applause of the whole Christian world, doe sufficiently proclaime the right of our Princes in this behalfe; especially seeing as K <hi>William Rufus</hi> truly said, <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. Par. p. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>The king of England hath all the liberties in his Kingdome, which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour challenged in the Empire.</hi> Hitherto of the right of Princes, as they are Princes. Now of their right as they are Patrons.</p>
                  <p>IN Patronages, we may consider two things, The causes and the effects,<note place="margin">3.</note> The causes originally inducing the Church of God to approoue them, were three. First, because Princes and Lords of the soile, out of their deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and charitable bounty, gaue some of their owne ground for the situation of Churches, and the habitation of Ministers, resigning their owne right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the Bishop of the Diocesse, and so dedicating it euerlastingly to the Lord. Secondly, because vpon that ground they built Churches for holy meetings, and dwelling places for the messengers of the Lord. Thirdly, because they allowed maintenance, both for the Church and the Minister, as is expressed in this verse: <q>{<note n="b" place="margin">Glossa in. 16. q. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Perusia.</hi> These prerogatiues of Patrons, were all anciently approoued both by Ciuill and Canon Law. But to passe ouer the rest, I will onely single out the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue of presenting. In the 9. <note n="f" place="margin">Conc. Tol. 9. c. 2. Bin. t. 2. p. 1163.</note> Councell of <hi>Toledo</hi> holden in the yeere 655. it was decreed as followeth, <hi>As long as the founders of Churches remaine aliue, they shall bee suffered to haue the chiefe care in those places, and they shall offer fit Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours vnto the Bishop to be ordained in the same Churches; And if the Bishop while the Founder liueth, shall despise them, and presume to ordaine Rectours in the same place, Let him know that his Ordination shall be voide, and to his shame others shall be ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whom the Founders shall chuse.</hi> And before that, in the yeere 541. <hi>Iustinian</hi> made this Constitution, That <note n="g" place="margin">No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>if any man will build an house of prayer, and hee or his heires will haue Clerkes to be promoted therein, if they allow maintenance for those Clerkes, and name such as are worthy, let those which are named be ordained.</hi> Now to apply this to our present purpose; <hi>It is a cleare case, that all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks in England were founded by the Kings Ancestours; And therefore the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uousons of them all belong to the King.</hi> And it is cleare by the Lawes of the land, That <note n="h" place="margin">See B. Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, perpet. gouernment. c. 15. p. 264.</note> 
                     <hi>our Kings haue had, and ought to haue the custodie of the same in the Vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the presentments and collations of those Prelacies as Lords, and Aduowes of all the lands and possessions, that belong either to Cathedrall Churches, or Bishops.</hi> Vpon all these premises, this conclusion followeth, that this right we speake of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to our Princes, as Patrons, by Ciuil, Canon, and the common Lawes of the land. To these two former respects, we may adde a third, drawne from this consideration, that our Bishops by the fauour of Princes, are Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Lords and Barons in Parliament, and therefore it were very hard if men
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:14672:100"/>
of so great power and place, should be <note n="a" place="margin">Vide Epis. Eliens. in resp. ad Apol. Bel. c. 6. p. 151.</note> obtruded vpon the Prince without his consent. Hitherto of the lawfull right of Princes.</p>
                  <p>ANd as they haue the collation of Bishopricks most lawfully, so they conferre them most fitly, most freely, and most safely. Most fitly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<note place="margin">4.</note> they haue largest scope to choose, best meanes to discerne, greatest power to procure and assist such as are most eminent for learning and vertue. Most freely, because they are farther from suspition of corruption, then either people, or Prelate. For to vse the words of a reuerend <note n="b" place="margin">Bishop <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> perpet. gouernment. c. 18. p. 350.</note> Bishop, <hi>Howsoeuer am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious heads, and couetous hands, may lincke together vnder colour of commendation to deceiue and abuse Princes eares, yet reason and duetie bindeth mee and all others, to thinke and say, that Princes persons are of all others farthest from taking money for any such respects. In meaner persons more iustly may corruption be feared, then in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who of all others haue least need, and so least cause to set Churches to sale. Their abundance, their magnificence, their conscience, are suerties for the freedome of their choice.</hi> These are the sayings of the learned Bishop; among which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlaced a memorable example of <hi>Guntchrannus</hi> King of France, who, when one offered him money for a Bishoprick, returned this answere; <hi>It is not our Princely maner to sell Bishopricks for money, neither is it your part to get them with rewards, lest wee be infamed for silthy gaine, and you compared to Simon Magus.</hi> A fit Embleame for a Prince, and worthy to be written in letters of Gold. Most safely; for how dangerous a thing it is to commit such matters to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Elections, the Primitiue Church had lamentable experience. What vprores also followed the Elections by the Clergie alone, let the longest Schisme that euer was in the Church of Rome testifie. And for the Popes prouisions whereby hee hath incroached vpon the Princes right, they haue bene such as haue giuen both Kings, Nobles, Clergie and people, iust cause of lamentation. But since the nomination rested in the Princes hands, all tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and grieuances (Gods Name be blessed) are vtterly extinguished. Now I will adde a word or two, of their singular moderation in this behalfe. In ancient time our Kings had the collation before free Election was granted, as was declared out of the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. whereby it is manifest that they had then in themselues a plenarie power. And though this were not without presidents of former ages; yet as <hi>Charles</hi> the Great granted freedome of Elections vnto the Church, so haue our Princes established the like by the Lawes of the land, according to which they proceed most mildly and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, doing all things agreeably to the patterne of famous Princes, and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Canons of ancient Councels. With vs the King hath <hi>the nomination of Bishops,</hi> and so had good <note n="c" place="margin">Sozom. l. 7. cap. 8.</note>

With vs the Deane and Chapter elect him, <hi>whom the king hath nominated:</hi> So the <note n="e" place="margin">Sozom. ibid.</note> Clergie of Constantinople, with the whole generall Councell there assembled, did thinke it their duetie solemnely to elect <hi>Nectarius</hi> whom the Emperour had nominated. With vs the electours signifie their election to the king, <hi>humbly crauing his royall assent:</hi> so the Romane <note n="f" place="margin">Ex Onuphr. annot. in Plat in Pel. 2.</note> Clergie 1000. yeeres agoe did vse to signifie their election to the Emperour, that he might ratifie it

                  <p>Anno 1253. <hi>Robert</hi> Bishop of Lincolne sent to the Pope this <note n="c" place="margin">Pag. 843.</note> Epistle fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>Let your wisdome know, that I obey the Apostolicke Mandates, with a filiall affection, deuoutly and reuerently; And being zealous of my Fathers honour, I am contrary and opposite to those things which are contrary to the Mandates Apostolicke. For I am bound to both by the Mandate of God. Apostolicke Mandates neither are, or can be other then the doctrines of the Apostles, and of our Lord</hi> Iesus Christ, <hi>the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and Lord of the Apostles: For the Lord</hi> Iesus Christ <hi>saith,</hi> He that is not with me, is against me; <hi>But the diuine Holinesse of the Apostolicke See, neither is or can be against him. Therefore the tenour of the aforesaid Letter is not consonant to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicke Holines, but a thing much dissonant and disagreeing. First, because from this Addition</hi> Non obstante, <hi>annexed to this and such like Letters which are dispersed farre and wide, and not induced with any necessitie of the Law of Nature, which is to be obserued, there flowes a whole deluge of inconstancie, boldnesse, malepertnesse, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modestie, lying, deceiuing, distrusting, and all vices thereupon insuing: where of the number is infinite, shaking and disturbing the puritie of Christian Religion, and the tranquillitie of humane societie. Moreouer, after the sin of Lucifer, which shall also be the sinne of Antichrist, the child of perdition, whom the Lord shall destroy with the breath of his mouth, There is not, nor cannot be any other kinde of sinne, so aduerse and contrary to the doctrine of the Apostles and Euangelists, and to our Lord</hi> Iesus Christ, <hi>so hatefull, so detestable, and so abominable, as to kill and destroy soules, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding them of the Office and Ministerie of the Pastorall charge. Which sinnes they are knowne by most euident testimonies of holy Scripture to commit, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed in the power of Pastorall charge, doe get the wages of the Pastorall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Ministerie, arising of the milke and wooll of the sheepe of</hi> Christ, <hi>which ought to be quickened and saued, and do not minister such things as are due vnto them. For the very not administration of Pastorall Offices, is by the testimony of Scripture, the killing and destruction of the sheepe.</hi> And to passe ouer the rest, because it is somewhat long, I will onely adde his conclusion. <hi>And briefly recounting, I say, the Holinesse of the See Apostolicke, can onely doe such things as tend to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not to destruction. For this is the fulnesse of power, to be able to doe all things to edification But these things which they call Prouisions, are not for edification, but for most manifest destruction. Therefore the blessed See Apostolicke cannot accept of them, because flesh and blood (which shall not possesse the Kingdome of Heauen) hath reuealed them, and not the</hi> Father of our Lord Iesus Christ <hi>which is in Heauen.</hi> When this Letter came to the audience of the Pope, he being not able to containe himselfe, said, <note n="d" place="margin">Pag. 844.</note> 
                     <hi>Who is this dotish, surd, absurd oldman, that with such rash presumption iudgeth our acts? By</hi> S. Peter, <hi>and</hi> S.

                     <hi>we may confesse the trueth) those things which he saith are true, we cannot condemne him, he is a Catholicke, yea and a most holy man, more Religious then we, and more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then we, more excellent, and of a more excellent life; so that he is supposed among all the Prelates of the world, not to haue his better, nor his equall. The whole Clergie of France and England knoweth so much. The trueth of such an Epistle which peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is already knowne to many, will be able to moue many against vs: for he is counted a great Pilosopher, perfitly learned in Greeke and Latin, a zealous louer of righteousnes, a reader in schooles of Diuinitie, a preacher among the people, a louer of chastitie, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuter of Symonists.</hi> These things said <hi>Aegidius Hispanus</hi> the Cardinall: and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whose conscience did touch them, gaue councell to the Pope, that he should wincke and dissemble the matter, lest some tumult should be raised vpon this occasion, especially <hi>because it is wel knowne, that once there shal a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture come.</hi> The same <hi>Robert</hi> lying vpon his death-bed, sighing, said thus, <note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 847.</note> Christ <hi>came into the world to gaine soules: therefore if any man be not afraid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy soules, is not he worthily called Antichrist? The Lord in 6. dayes made the whole world, but he laboured more then 30 yeeres to repaire man; Is not therefore this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer of soules, worthy to be iudged an enemy of God, and an Antichrist? The Pope blusheth not impudently to disanull the priuiledges of former Popes his predecessors, by this barre</hi> Non obstante, <hi>which is not done without their preiudice and manifest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie: for so he pulls downe that, which so great and so many Saints haue builded. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the contempt of Saints: therefore the contemner shall iustly be contemned, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of</hi> Esay, Woe to thee which despisest, shalt thou not be despised? <hi>who will obserue his priuiledges? The Pope answering, doth thus defend his errour: An equall hath no authority ouer an equall: therefore a Pope cannot binde me being a Pope, &amp;c.</hi> And againe, <hi>Although many other Apostolicke men haue afflicted the Church, yet hee hath compeld it to be in bondage more grieuously then others, and hath multiplied inconueniences. For the</hi> Caursini <hi>being manifest Vsurers, which the holy Fathers and our doctors haue driuen out of France, this Pope hath raised vp and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in England, and if any speake against them, he is tired out with losses and labours; Witnes</hi> Roger <hi>B. of London. The world knoweth, that Vsury is accounted detestable in both Testaments, and is forbidden of God; but now the Merchants of my L. the Pope, do practise Vsury openly at London, they contriue diuers grieuances against Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Religious persons, forcing poore men to lye, and to set their Seales to lying writings. As for example, I receiue so many marks by yeere for an 100. pound, and am forced to make a writing, and sealè it, in which I confesse my selfe to haue receiued an 100. pound to be payed at the yeeres end. And if peraduenture thou wouldest pay the Popes Vsurer the principall againe within a moneth or fewer dayes, he will not receiue it, vnlesse thou wilt pay the whole hundred pound. Which condition is heauier then any which is required of the Iewes: for whensoeuer thou shalt bring a Iew his principall, he will take it kindly, with so much gaine, as is answerable to the time, &amp;c.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>We haue seene one of the Popes Letters, wherein this clause was inserted, That such as made their Testaments, or caried the Crosse, or yeelded ayde to the Holy-land, should receiue so much pardon for their sinnes, as they gaue money. And wee know our lord the Pope, wrote vnto the Abbot of S.</hi> Albans, <hi>that he should prouide for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine man called</hi> Iohn de Camezana, <hi>in a competent benefice, and shortly prouision was made in a Church worth fortie marks by the yeere: but he not content therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all complained vnto the Pope, who wrote to the same Abbot to prouide more bountifully</hi>

                     <hi>for him, and yet the Pope reserued the donation of the former benefice vnto him selfe. And to passe ouer other things, the Pope graunted for secular fauour, that one may obtaine a Bishoprick, and not bee a Bishop but an euerlasting elect, which is as much to say as that he should receiue the milk and the wooll of the sheepe, and yet not driue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the wolues.

                  <speaker>ORTHOD.</speaker>
                  <p>Concerning the first, <note n="k" place="margin">Greg. Epist. l. 4. ep. 38.</note> 
                     <hi>Gregorie</hi> hauing said, that the name of Vniuersalitie was offered by the Councell, addeth immediatly, That <hi>neuer any of his predecessours did vse so prophane a title.</hi> So it is cleare, that he calleth that very title, prophane, which as he saith, was offered by the Councell; Which iustifieth my former answere. For vnlesse you will accuse the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of prophanenesse, you must needs say, that <hi>Gregory</hi> speaketh improperly, ascribing that to the Councell, which was onely done by the Popes Legate, and a few supplicants in the Councell. Moreouer, if this prophane title ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all other from being Bishops, then the Councel (consisting of 630. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,) in giuing this title, should exclude themselues from being Bishops: which is absurd, seeing in their subscriptions they intitled themselues Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:14672:108"/>
Concerning the second, If he be an vniuersall Bishop which hath care of the whole Church, then <hi>S. Paul</hi> was Vniuersall Bishop as well as <hi>S. Peter:</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 28.</note> for he had care of all the Churches. Then <hi>Athanasius</hi> was an Vniuersall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop: for <note n="b" place="margin">Basil. ad A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanas. Ep. 52.</note>

                  <p>Nor of them onely, but of others also: For <hi>S. Basill</hi> saith, <note n="c" place="margin">Epist. 48.</note> 
                     <hi>The whole state of the Church of Antioch dependeth vpon thee.</hi> So though his iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was confined within the Patriarchdome of Alexandria, yet he caried a tender care ouer the whole Church of Christ. Wherefore in this sence the title of Vniuersall Bishop, belongeth as well to the Patriarch of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, as to the Patriarch of Rome. Moreouer, the very title of <hi>Vniuersall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch</hi> was giuen, and that by a Councell, to <hi>Iohn Patriarch of Constantinople.</hi> In what sence trow you? You produced but two sences of it out of <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> In the first, which prophanely excludeth all other Bishops they did not giue it, for then they should deny themselues to be Bishops, contrary to their own subscriptions. If in the latter, then it was common to him with the Bishops of Rome; and so cannot proue your Monarchicall iurisdiction.</p>

Wherefore the decree of Pope <hi>Pelagius,</hi> requiring all Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes to send to Rome to professe their faith, and receiue the Pall, extendeth not to them of the East, but onely to them of the West.</p>

                  <p>Then you grant that hee was Patriarch of the West, and that is sufficient to inferre my conclusion, for the Westerne Patriarch must needes haue iurisdiction ouer the Metropolitanes of the West, in which compasse is Brittany. I need not here speake of the ancient diuision of the Prouinces, nor of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> nor of <hi>Eleutherius:</hi> It is famously knowne that Saint <hi>Austin</hi> was sent hither by the Bishop of Rome, receiued a pall from him, and apparently submitted himselfe to his iurisdiction; so did his successours for almost a thousand yeeres together.

It might also be declared how little his ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sures were here respected, vnlesse they receiued strength by the kings permission.

These points might bee much inlarged, but this little touch is sufficient to shew that whatsoeuer iurisdiction hee had in England, was by the courtesie of the King: whatsoeuer hee tooke vpon him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, was by vsurpation. Now his challenge by custome is repelled by custome. For, these sixe hundred yeeres last past, hee affecting to bee

                  <p>You intend to proue that Metropolitanes should sweare to the Pope before their confirmation, or receiuing of the palle; the example you bring concernes no such matter: For first he was only a Bishop, not a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan. Secondly, this oth was voluntary, not exacted. Thirdly, it was not vpon a confirmation or receiuing of a palle, but vpon an abiuration of his heresie. Neither doth it appeare, that this oth was in the time of <hi>Gregory,</hi> though some haue gone about to ascribe it to the time of Pope <hi>Pelagius,</hi> wherein behold, and you shal see the cunning of Popish proctors.

                     <hi>Pelagius</hi> reproued some Metropolitanes, <hi>because they did delay, fidem suam exponere,</hi> and thereupon made this decree that <hi>those which did not send within three monthes, ad fidem suam exponendam, should be depriued:</hi>

                     <hi>the Lord our righteousnesse.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Melchisedec</hi> was King of <hi>Salem,</hi> that is, king of peace: <hi>So</hi>

                     <hi>standeth in ordinances, for to make of twaine one new man in himselfe, so making peace. And that hee might reconcile both vnto God in one body by his Crosse, and slay hatred thereby, and came and Preached peace to you which were a farre off, and to them that were neere.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Melchisedec</hi> was <hi>both King and Priest:</hi> so was Christ Iesus. Fourthly, <hi>Melchisedec blessed Abraham:</hi> and the blessing of God commeth through Christ Iesus vpon all the sonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is vpon all beleeuers. For we ought all to say with the Apostle, <note n="a" place="margin">Ephes. 1. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Blessed bee God, euen the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, which hath blessed vs with all spirituall blessing in heauenly things in Christ.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>Melchisedec receiued tithes of Abraham,</hi> and conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, <hi>euen Leui being as yet in the loines of Abraham payed tithes to Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedec;</hi> Whereby was signified that the Priesthood of Christ who was after the order of <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> was farre more excellent then the Priesthood of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</hi> Sixtly, <hi>Melchisedec</hi> was <hi>without father, without mother, without kindred,</hi> not simply, but is said to be so, in respect of the silence of the Scripture which bringeth him in sodenly, making no mention at all of father, mother, or kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, thereby representing Christ Iesus, who as he was man, had no father; as he was God had no mother nor kinred. Seuenthly, <hi>Melchisedec had neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of dayes, nor end of life:</hi> That is, the Scripture doth not mention the one nor the other, that therein hee might bee a representation of the eternitie of Christ Iesus, who as hee is God, is from euerlasting to euerlasting. Thus the Scripture vnfoldeth the type of <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> plentifully and particularly, and yet saith not one word concerning his sacrificing, which is an euident ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that it is a meere deuise and imagination of mans braine.</p>

                     <hi>he receiued the signe of Circumcision as the seale of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of the faith which he had when he was yet vncircumcised:</hi> so circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not onely <hi>a signe to signifie,</hi> but also a <hi>seale to confirme</hi> vnto him <hi>the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of faith,</hi> that is, the righteousnesse of Christ apprehended by faith, and imputed to all that beleeue.

Lambe, it was made a Type of the Lambe of God which taketh away the sinnes of the world: or as the water of Baptisme is changed, when of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon water, it is made a holy representation of the blood of Christ: So the Bread and Wine are changed in the Lords Supper, that is, in vse, not in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, for before they bee brought to the Lords Table, they are common Bread and common Wine, for the feeding of the body, but when they are sanctified according to Christs institution, then the God of heauen setteth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other stampe vpon them, and maketh them a Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ: yet as the lambe still remained a lambe in substance: as the water euen in the action of Baptizing, still remaineth water in substance: so the Bread and Wine still retaine their former substance, euen after the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.

                     <hi>Paul</hi> elsewhere calleth it <hi>the Cuppe of blessing.</hi> Likewise whereas Saint <note n="i" place="margin">Luk. 12. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Luke</hi> saith, that Christ <hi>tooke the fiue loaues and the two fishes, and looked vp to heauen, and blessed them:</hi> Saint <note n="k" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, that <hi>Iesus tooke the bread, and gaue thankes;</hi> whereby it is euident, that the holy Ghost vseth the word blessing, and thankesgiuing indifferently. But withall we must obserue that vnder the word <hi>thankesgiuing,</hi> is comprehended <hi>prayer.</hi> As when the <note n="l" place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 5.</note> Apostle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs <hi>to receiue the creature with thankesgiuing, he renders</hi> this reason, because it is <hi>sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</hi> Where it is plaine that thankesgiuing in the former place, comprehendeth prayer, and the word Prayer vsed in the latter place, comprehendeth thankesgiuing: as though the Apostle
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:14672:119"/>
should haue said; we on our part must receiue the creature with prayer and thankesgiuing, because it is sanctified as on Gods part, by his word and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, so on our part, by prayer and thankesgiuing. Secondly, we must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue that the creature may be sanctified to a double vse: That is, either cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall or spirituall, and to both by prayer, and thankesgiuing. Thirdly, that the sanctifying of a creature is in the Scripture called blessing, as when it is said, <hi>the Lord blessed the seuenth day and sanctified it.</hi> Now our Lord Iesus inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to institute a Sacrament, tooke the bread and gaue thankes, not only for the bread, but especially for the redemption of the Church, and praied that these elements of Bread and Wine, might be euerlastingly sanctified to Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall vse, thus the Bread and Wine were blessed. And whereas you with <note n="a" place="margin">Bell. de Sacr. Euchar. l. 4. c. 13</note> 
                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others say, that this blessing was performed by these wordes, this is my Body, it cannot bee; For the blessing was finished, before those words were vttered. Saint <hi>Marke</hi> saith, that <note n="b" place="margin">Mark. 14. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>when he had blessed the Bread, hee brake it,</hi> by which it is euident that the blessing was accomplished before the bread was broken, &amp; it is manifest that he brake it before he gaue it, therefore the blessing was finished before the Bread was giuen. But he gaue it, saying, <hi>take eate, this is my body,</hi> therefore the blessing was finished before he said, <hi>this is my body.</hi> Now how is it possible that he should blesse by those wordes seeing the blessing was fully ended before those words were begunne?

                     <hi>thing that is seene and openly knowne, cannot be termed this thing, vnlesse that thing be of the Neuter gender: for no man when hee demonstrateth his brother, will say, this thing is my brother, or demonstrating the Image of Caesar, will say, This thing is Caesar: therefore neither could it be rightly said of the Bread, which the disciples did see, This thing is my body. The reason is, because the</hi> subiectum <hi>of the Proposition should be better knowne then the</hi> praedicatum, <hi>therefore when the</hi> subiectum <hi>is knowne to the hearers in particular, it ought not to bee vttered by a name that is generall, but then onely it ought to be vttered by a name that is generall, when it is not knowne, but onely in generall. As for example; Certaine men see a thing afarre of, but yet they discerne not what it is, whether a tree, a stone, or a man, but I see that it is a man; Wherefore I will say to the rest, that thing is a man, and not he is a man; But if they see him to be a man, yet doe not discerne who it is,</hi> Peter <hi>or</hi> Paul, <hi>or some other, I will not say, that thing is</hi> Peter, <hi>because they know it already to be a man; But I will say he is</hi> Peter. <hi>Therefore seeing the disciples did see the Bread, and were not ignorant that it was Bread, it had bene a most absurd speech, if of that Bread the</hi> Lord <hi>had said, This thing is my body, when he should haue said, This Bread is my body: therefore it cannot bee that the word</hi> hoc, <hi>should demonstrate the Bread as the subiect of the Proposition.</hi>

But if they say they put no third thing which is diuerse from the Body of Christ, why doe they spend so many wordes to teach that the Body is not demonstrated? Why doe they not propose to vs the naked matter? why doe they hide it with so many folds of wordes? In the word of God there is onely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of two Substances, and verely there was no substance in Christes handes beside Bread and his Body which can possibly bee demonstrated by the Pronoune, and yet hee did demonstrate onely that singular substance which was in his hands vnder the formes of Bread: therefore to seeke a third distinct from the Bread and the Body is a labour most vaine and full of absurditie.</hi> For what shall this third thing bee? you say

Now the Body of Christ it cannot bee, for then it should bee there before Consecration, and without Consecration; and consequently it should bee the Body of Christ, before it were the body; and there should be blood in the Chalice before Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secration, &amp; without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration; and consequently it should bee blood before it were blood, and blood without blood: which are intollerable absurdities.

You haue left the Scripture and the Fathers, <hi>you wander in the wildernesse</hi> of your owne conceites, and loose your selues in the laberynth of your owne imaginations.

                  <p>Hee spake the wordes of wisedome, and that in the most excellent manner, for which manner of speech two reasons may bee ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. The first because hee was desirous to speake most emphatically: when wee see a childe like vnto his father, wee vse to say this childe hath his fathers face, and yet wee meane onely that hee is very like vnto his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet wee say not hee is like vnto his father, but hee hath his fathers face, to expresse a most wonderfull similitude in a most emphaticall manner. So if one should haue seene the image of <hi>Alexander</hi> made by <hi>Phidias,</hi> hee might haue saide this is <hi>Alexander</hi> himselfe, not meaning that his wordes should bee taken properly, but to expresse the similitude most emphatically. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so our Lord Iesus willing to expresse in how liuely manner the Bread and Wine doe represent his Body and Blood, doth not say that they signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Body and Blood, or that they are signes and Sacraments of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood, but speaking most significantly hee saith this (Bread) is my Body, this (Wine) is my Blood. Another reason is because our sweete Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour would seale all his comfortable blessings vnto the soule of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie receiuer, as if a King bestowing a Castle vpon one of his subiects, and reaching vnto him the sealed writing containing the graunt, should say vnto
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:14672:123"/>
him, behold here, take what I giue thee, it is such a Castle. For though hee might haue said, this writing doth signifie the gift of such a Castle, yet it is more significant and more comfortable to say, it is such a Castle. For so the king doth cheere vp his heart, and by that writing doth put him into actuall possession of the Castle. Euen so our Lord Iesus, though he might haue said, this is a sacrament of my body, yet to giue vs more cordiall comfort, he saith, <hi>this is my body,</hi> assuring vs thereby, that in giuing vs that Bread, hee giueth vs himselfe, and putteth vs in actuall possession of his graces and blessings, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased vnto vs by his body and blood.</p>

                     <hi>And when they came to the place which God had shewed him,</hi> Abraham <hi>builded an Altar there, and couched the wood, and bound</hi> Izhak <hi>his sonne, and laied him on the Altar vpon the wood:</hi> Here the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was really laide vpon the Altar, but it cannot bee said that hee was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sacrificed or offered for a burnt offering, but onely in <hi>Abrahams</hi> intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Gods acceptation. Thirdly, if the sacrifice bee the body and blood, then seeing by your owne doctrine the bodie and bloud are not vpon the Altar, til the words of Consecration be finished, it followeth, that there is no sacrifice till the Consecration be finished, and consequently there is no obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sacrifice begunne before the Consecration bee finished. Now if the oblation beginne after the Consecration is ended, then is it not ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by the wordes of Consecration, vnlesse you will say that an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation may bee celebrated before it bee, and that a thing is ended before it beginne. But let vs faigne, that the body and blood of Christ, were properly offered to God by the words of Consecration, yet you cannot thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a sacrifice. For you required a third condition in a sacrifice, that is, the destruction of the thing sacrificed.</p>

                  <p>Then it will follow from your owne positions, that if Christ bee aliue in the Eucharist, either the Priest doth not Sacrifice him, or else he killeth him before hee sacrifice him, and consequently either there are no sacrifising Priests in the New Testament, except Christ onely, or if there bee any, they are all murtherers and killers of Christ. If you say that Christ is in the Eucharist, and yet not aliue, how can this bee? Is not Christ in the Eucharist now, as hee was at the first institution?

But nourishment is, when the substance of the meate is changed into the substance of the nourished; &amp; therefore if the consecrated elements doe nourish, they must needes haue a substance which must bee changed into the substance of the nourished. What substance is this? Bread you say it is not; for that is vanished by Consecration. And therefore it can bee nothing but the Body and Blood of Christ; whereupon it wil follow, that the naturall Body and Blood of Christ are substantially changed into the substance of the nourished, be it man, bird, or beast, which is out ragious blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie.

                     <hi>Flee from the seruing of idoles, I speake as to wise men. Your selues iudge what I say, the chalice of benediction, which we doe blesse, is it not the Communication of the blood of Christ? and the bread which we breake, is it not the participation of the body of our Lord? For being many, wee are one bread, one body, all that participate of one bread. Behold Israel according to the flesh: they that eate the hostes, are they not partakers of the Altar? what then? doe I say that that which is immolated vnto idoles, is any thing? or that the idol is any thing? But the things that the heathen doe immolate, to diuels they do immolate, and not to God. And I will not haue you become fellows of the diuels. You cannot drinke the chalice of our Lord, and the chalice of diuels: you cannot be partakers of the Table of our Lord, and of the Table of diuels.</hi>

                     <hi>Out of these words, are gathered three argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the first from the comparison of the Lords Table, with the altar of the Gentiles, where they offered to idoles, and with the altar of the Iewes, where they offered carnall sacrifice to the true God. For thence it followeth that the Lords Table is a kind of altar; now an altar is erected to sacrifice,</hi> and there is no sacrifice without a Priest. The like reason may be drawne from the comparison of the Eucharist, with their sacrifice, and from the partaking the one and the other.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>ORTHOD.</speaker>
                  <p>The point of the comparison consisteth in this, that as those which receiue the Sacraments of Christians, doe therein declare themselues to be partakers of the Christian religion: so those which vse the sacrifices and ceremonies of Iewes or Gentiles, doe thereby signifie that they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of their religion; and thereupon the Apostle exhorteth them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine from the tables and feasts of idoles, least thereby they should haue fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowshipwith the diuels. Therefore you cannot conclude hence either sacrifice or altar.</p>

                  <p>When wee say that the Minister forgiueth sinnes by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, wee doe not exclude the Sacraments but include them. As when wee referre a pardon to the Kings letters patents, wee doe not exclude the seale, but meane the letters patents with the seale annexed. For (as the Apostle saith) to <hi>vs is committed the ministerie of reconciliation.</hi> Which is not a ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the word onely but without all controuersie of the Sacraments also. Therefore Christ in giuing vs authoritie to forgiue sinnes, hath withall giuen vs authoritie to vse the meanes thereof, that is, the ministery of the word and Sacraments, and because wee apply these meanes whereby God forgiueth sinnes, therefore we are said to forgiue sinnes.

But what is the key to open this locke? There is a threefold key; the first of authoritie, the second of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and the third of Ministery. The key of authoritie belongeth onely to God. For seeing euery sinne is a transgression of Diuine law, he only hath soueraigne authoritie to remit it, against whom it is committed, and when he doth remit it, then he setteth open the gates of heauen.

Now whereas you say, that a Key is not giuen to signifie or declare that the doore is open; it is true. Yet you may know that similitudes must not be extended to euery circumstance; it is sufficient if there be a correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie in the maine point. What though a Key cannot declare that the doore is open? Yet it is the Ministers duety to declare, that heauen is opened to all that beleeue and repent; and this very declaring is an effectuall meanes of opening it indeed.

Neither is the place of <hi>Esay</hi> for your purpose: when the sky is darkned with clouds and mists, the Lord sendeth a wind out of his treasure house, whereby they are scattered, the skie cleared, and the golden beames of the sunne restored: euen so, when the poore soule and conscience is ouercast with clouds of sin, and mists of sorrow, God by his holy spirit concurring with his blessed word, bringeth men to faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and so forgiueth their sins, that he will neuer remember them any more.

                  <p>Doth the Priest altogether purge the spots of the soule? then it seemeth when the penitent is presented before the Priest, his soule is spotted, but by vertue of the Priestes absolution the spots are present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly washed away; but I pray you tel me, whom doth the Priest forgiue and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue? him whom the Lord hath absolued? or him whom the Lord hath not absolued? if the Priest absolue him whom the Lord hath absolued, then hee doth not altogether purge the spot of the soule, no nor properly purge them at all, but onely declare that the Lord hath purged them. If you say that the Priest absolueth him whom the Lord hath not absolued, then hee shall bee forgiuen, whom the Lord hath not forgiuen: which is most absurd. Againe, doeth the Priest before hee pronounce absolution see any tokens of faith and repentance: If hee see none, then how dare he pronounce absolution? and if hee see any then the party is already purged. Whereby it appeareth that the absolution of the ministerie is onely declaratorie. Therefore the speech of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> cannot bee taken properly, but his meaning must bee this, that the Priest seeing him brought by the ministery of the Gospell to faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and consequently purged, certifieth his conscience, that he is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purged, and his sinnes washed away by the blood of Iesus Christ.</p>

And moreouer how great mourning there is of their faithfull friends, which shall not haue them with them, in the rest of life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall?</hi> And <hi>Leo</hi> writeth the like to <hi>Theodorus.</hi> Out of which places we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that sacramentall reconciliation hath power to iustifie, and is not onely a declaration of iustification alreadie receiued or hereafter to be receiued.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Austin</hi> doth not say, that some desiring to be reconciled and therefore beleeuing in Christ, doe perish euerlastingly. For he knew very well that this is contrary to the Scripture, which saith, <note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. 3. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>He that beleeueth shall neuer perish, but haue life euerlasting.</hi> Therefore it is most certaine that the true beleeuer cannot perish for want of a Priest. If you ground vpon these words, <hi>some desiring Baptisme, others reconciliation,</hi> they are not referred to the parties themselues which were in danger of death being as yet vnbaptised &amp; vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, but to their friends, which flocked together in respect of their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: therefore it doth not appeare that <hi>Austin</hi> speaketh of such as desired re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation; but rather the contrary, for <hi>ligati</hi> are such as stand bound with the chaines of their sinnes. You will say, how doe they perish for want of a Priest? I answere that if one were present which by commission from Christ might display the riches of Gods mercy vnto them, who can tell whether their hearts might be opened to beleeue and repent vnto saluation, and so their chaines might be loosed? but when there is none present, that can mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster a word of comfort vnto them, they being knowen to be notorious sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may be thought to perish for want of a Priest, not for want of a Popish but for want of a preaching Priest. Which may yet appeare more plainely by the other branch of the vnbaptised. For these wordes (<hi>desiring Baptisme</hi>) must be either referred to the parties or to their friends. If the parties desire Baptisme, then they doe not perish for want of Baptisme, for the Baptisme of the spirit doth supplie the want of the Baptisme of water. <note n="c" place="margin">Bell. de sacr. bapt. cap. 6.

                  <p>Who taught this Parret thus to speake, let wise men iudge. But to the point; A man may be said to pronounce and declare remission of sinnes two wayes. First, by a narratiue and historicall rehearsall out of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall duetie of charitie; and so may euery Christian. Secondly, by a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall power giuen by a speciall commission from God, adorned and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished with a speciall promise, and so may euery lawfull Minister. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission is giuen vs in our Ordination, <hi>Whose sinnes you forgiue, they are forgiuen.</hi> The promise was made in these words, <hi>Behold, I am with you vntill the end of the world.</hi> Both are expressed in these words of <note n="b" place="margin">Iob 33. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>Iob, If there be an Angel with him,</hi> (that is with the man whose soule draweth neere vnto the graue) <hi>or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, one of a thousand to declare vnto man his righteousnes, then will hee haue mercy vpon him, and will say deliuer him that he goe not downe into the pit, for I haue receiued a reconciliation.</hi> Here are two persons to be considered. First, a man lying at the point of death, distressed and groning vnder the burthen of his sinnes; Secondly, the man of God appointed to comfort those that mourne in Sion. The latter is described foure wayes: by his Titles, Office, Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and Gods promise vnto him. His Titles are <hi>an Angel or interpreter:</hi> his Office, <hi>to declare vnto man his righteousnes;</hi> that is, the righteousnes of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> imputed to all beleeuers, according to the couenant of grace: his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, <hi>Deliuer him that he goe not downe into the pit:</hi> The promise, <hi>Then will God haue mercie vpon him, and say, I haue receiued a reconciliation.</hi> Such Titles, such Office, by such speciall Commission and promise, are not giuen to any Lay man in the Booke of God. Wherefore, though they are bound by their generall calling, to edifie and comfort one another, yet this belongeth to the Minister in a speciall maner. Neither is there any doubt but God will giue
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:14672:136"/>
a speciall blessing to his owne Ordinance. Thus haue we examined all <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmines</hi> arguments, and find them to be nothing els but smoke: <hi>He hath sowne the winde, and reaped the whirlewinde.</hi> Hitherto of Absolution, as it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the Minister.

Yet giue me leaue to tell you, that Auricular confession, as it is vsed in the Church of Rome, is a pollicie to diue into the secrets of men, not so much to apply salues vnto their sores, or to yeeld true comfort to the wounded conscience, as to worke for your owne aduantage, and to turne all things to your owne pleasure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.

                  <p>That is no barre to <hi>Reordination;</hi> for if a child bee Baptised in the true forme of words, &amp; an Heretick shall Baptise the same child in the same wordes, though in another sense, yet all good Christians will iudge it to be <hi>Rebaptisation;</hi> and there is the same reason of <hi>Reordination.</hi> Therefore thus I reason.

For you hold these words necessary in ordination, to the conferring of one of the principall functions of Priesthood, and therfore in not repeating them you acknowledge that they had receiued that function before, in the Church of England, &amp; consequently that the ministers of England are not lay men. So your owne practise, doth either condemne your selues, or iustifie vs, but our practise condemneth altogether the first part of your Priesthood, that is, your carnall sacrificing as simply abhominable: and the latter part so farre as it is polluted with your popish constructions.</p>

                  <p>If the first part of our Priesthood bee simply abhominable, and the latter as it is vsed by vs bee polluted, then <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Parker, Grindall,</hi> and the rest of your Coronels, had no other Priesthood, but that which was partly abhominable and partly polluted.</p>

                  <speaker>ORTHO.</speaker>
                  <p>When God opened their eyes, they did vtterly renounce your carnall sacrificing, as derogating from the all-sufficient sacrifice of Iesus Christ; the other part, that is, the power of forgiuing sinnes which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued corruptly in the Church of Rome, they practised purely in the Church of England, renouncing the Pope and all Popish pollutions.</p>

                  <p>But when the question is concerning the validity of orders, wee must not so much respect the practise as the power receiued in ordination, how <hi>Cranmer, Parker,</hi> and such like receiued both parts of their Priesthood in the Church of Rome. And as the Church gaue them so they receiued them, in that very sense which the Church of Rome holdeth at this day.

                  <p>Let me aske you a question; If one Baptize a Conuert in the Element of water, according to the true forme of the Church, yet so, that both the Baptizer and the baptized haue some pernicious errour: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:14672:140"/>
If they deny the Godhead of the Sonne, or of the holy Ghost, shall this hinder the validitie of the Baptisme?</p>

                  <speaker>PHIL.</speaker>
                  <p>No: for you must consider that there is a visible Priest, and an inuisible. It is required to the substance of Baptisme, that the visible Priest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply water to the baptized, <hi>In the Name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost.</hi> If he faile in any of these points, the Baptisme is frustrate. And therefore it was decreed in the great Councell of <note n="a" place="margin">Can. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Nice, that the Paulianists should be rebaptized;</hi> where they take the word <hi>rebaptised</hi> improperly, meaning that the former was not performed in the true wordes, and therefore was in deed no Baptisme. But if it were duely performed in water with such words as <hi>Christ</hi> hath appointed, their priuate opinions and misconstruction, cannot hinder the validitie of the Baptisme. <hi>Satis ostendimus</hi> (saith <note n="b" place="margin">Aug. de Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismo Contra D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So I say to you, there is a visible Bishop, and an inuisible; if the visible shall impose hands vpon a capable person, vsing those Euangelicall words which <hi>Christ</hi> hath sanctified, his owne priuate opinions cannot hinder the validitie of the Ordination: for so that right and sufficient words be vsed, we will not respect the erronious construction of the seruant, but the true sense and meaning of the Lord and Master. Therefore though <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Parker</hi> were ordained in the rite of the Church of Rome, though both the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers gaue the power, and the ordained receiued it in the erronious sense of the Church of Rome; yet neither the error of the ordainers, nor of the ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, pertaineth to the Ordination.

                     <hi>Adrian, the key of ministery:</hi> so whosoeuer is ordained by these words, receiueth the keyes, and may open the kingdome of heauen, by the Word and Sacraments. Wherfore see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these words were retained in the Ordination of Priests, euen in the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Poperie, it followeth that the Church of Rome had power by these words, rightly vnderstood according to the Scripture, to minister the word and Sacraments. But that which in it selfe was lawfull, to them was made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, by adding the abhomination of sacrifising, and by wresting the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:14672:140"/>
words of Christ to their Popish shrift. Thus though the Church of Rome gaue her Priests authority to preach the truth, yet she did not reueale the truth vnto them but plunged them in ignorance and errors. Therefore whereas those words of Christ (in themselues a Rose) by corruption of time were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne with nettles, those heroicall spirits which reformed religion, did weede away the Romane nettles, and so there remained onely the sweet Rose of Iesus Christ. Thus it came to passe that that which was practised in the Church of Rome vnlawfully, as beeing polluted with wicked humane inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was by the goodnesse of God purged and restored to the orient co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and natiue purity. To conclude, in the primitiue Church, the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall power was receiued purely, and deliuered purely; In the beginning of Popery, it was receiued purely, and deliuered corruptly: During the sway of Popery it was receiued corruptly and deliuered corruptly: In the beginning of the reformation it was receiued corruptly, and deliuered purely: Now in the sun shine of the Gospell, it is receiued purely and deliuered purely. Thus it appeareth that although we receiued our Orders from such as were Popish Priests, yet our calling is lawfull, which was to be declared. Now the Lord of his mercy so blesse his owne ordinance, that we may vse this holy functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his glory, and the winning of many thousand soules. Amen.</p>

But now the Authour of the Preface af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth in particular, that <hi>Iewell, Sands, Horne</hi> and <hi>Grindal</hi> were there, then, and in that maner <hi>Consecrated</hi> by <hi>Scory,</hi> and <hi>Scory</hi> by some of them, saith <hi>Sacroboscus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To answere briefly (for the glasse is almost runne,) First, it is a sillie surmise that Bishop <hi>Scory</hi> should be Consecrated by them, seeing he was <note n="*" place="margin">See aboue pag. 93.</note>

               <hi>Sands,</hi> were both Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated vpon one day by <hi>Matthew</hi> Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:14672:141"/>
three other Bishops, as you haue heard out of the Records. To which I adde moreouer, vpon a reuiew of the same Records, that the place of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration was, <hi>the Chappell at Lambehith:</hi> the time, <hi>the Sabboth day in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone after Morning prayer:</hi> the maner, <hi>with imposition of hands, and such forme of words and Praiers as are vsed in the Church.</hi> For the better performance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; there was a <hi>Sermon Preached by Master</hi> Alexander No well, <hi>then the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops Chaplaine,</hi> vpon this Text; <note n="a" place="margin">Acts 20. 28</note>

The place of his Consecration was likewise <hi>the Chappell at Lambehith:</hi> the time, <hi>the Sabbath day in the fore-noone:</hi> and the maner in all respects as the former. Thus all things were most orderly and reuerently performed. Now let the world iudge, what is to bee thought of these men, which dare so confidently blaze such vntruthes, and are not ashamed to produce an eye witnesse for that which was neuer seene by the eye of man. As for their <hi>downe Pigge, and vp Pike,</hi> and such other of the same stampe, I may say with the Prophet, <note n="d" place="margin">Esay 57. 4.</note> 
               <hi>On whomhaue you iested, vpon whom haue you gaped and thrust out the tongue?</hi> And I aduise you to remember the saying of <hi>Salomon,</hi>

               <hi>As the noise or crackling of the thornes vnder the pot: so is the laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a foole:</hi> As also that of <hi>Dauid,</hi>

               <hi>Blessed is the man that hath not sit in the seat of the scornefull.</hi> I will conclude this point with this saying of <hi>Salomon,</hi>
