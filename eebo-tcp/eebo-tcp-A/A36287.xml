         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>YOuth has generally its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies,
and they
that are ſeduc'd by the
temptations of Pleaſures and bad
Company in great Cities, will
have their times to ſow their wild
Oates: For <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s part
he has ſow'd his already, and
finding it ſuch ill husbandry to
deal in that ſort of Grain, has
reſolv'd to give over. And now
I have thought it convenient to
give the World an account of his
<pb facs="tcp:56677:3"/>
Tranſgreſſions, to the end that
People, as many have done,
may not think him worſe than he
was, what ever ſelf-intereſt
would have made him. Nor
does he expect that any man will
henceforth upbraid him for what
is paſt, as being under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of his Sovereigns Pardon,
to which all true Subjects ought
to give an awful reſpect and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>Had it not been for the high
miſdemeanours of <hi>Clavel</hi> we had
miſs'd a neat and excellent
Poem, and the Diſcovery of a
great Myſtery of Iniquity. The
Cheats and cunning Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Guſman</hi> and <hi>Lazarillo de
Tormes</hi> have been made <hi>Engliſh</hi>
out of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Language, as
<pb facs="tcp:56677:3"/>
well to inſtruct, as to delight.
And the greateſt Hiſtorians have
taken as much pains to recount
the Lives of Bad Men, as of the
moſt deſerving Subjects of their
Pens. Mirrors that do not ſhew
the Deformities, as well as Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of a Face, are of little uſe.
In ſhort, all ſorts of Men may
gather hence, how vain a thing
it is, to contend with the Law,
and that they muſt inevitably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
the Misfortune of the Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
by going often to the
Well. But the way to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is never out of date. St.
<hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf had occaſion e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to repent the Follies of
his Youth. Not that he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to excuſe his Offences; but
this he hopes he may preſume to
<pb facs="tcp:56677:4"/>
ſay, That it was not his cuſtom
to put any man in danger of his
life, but himſelf. He only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
upon the belief and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings
of others, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deluded, miſguided their
Wills. And it is no ſmall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
that his being ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for the deſigns for which he
was call'd out, was half a proof,
that his diſcoveries were true;
which perhaps had they not been
ill manag'd, might in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
have made ſatisfaction for
his paſt Tranſgreſſions; nor does
he deſpair, but that ſome of
them may yet take effect. In
the mean time, while he lives
to ſhew that <hi>Horace</hi>'s <hi>Quo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel</hi>
—is not always true; Let
the Vertuous hence obſerve,
<pb facs="tcp:56677:4"/>
how laborious a thing it is to
be wicked, and the Vicious
learn by his Example to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend.</p>

            <p>THe firſt Corrupters and Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of Youth, eſpecially if
active and ſprightly, are the
whiſpers and temptations
of Pleaſure, and that which Boys call
<hi>Freedom,</hi> Men <hi>Extravagant Looſeneſs:</hi>
Which inclination in forward Strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
being once inflam'd by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate
ſeverity of Parents, labours
with more violence to caſt off the yoke
of Bondage; ſo that unwilling to be
under the continual awe and terror of
the Laſh, they rather chooſe to ſtand
to the favour of Fortune, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56677:10"/>
of the wide world, then the
cruel mercy of them that begat 'em.
A <hi>Cynical</hi> way of Education, which
perhaps many may have learn't from
the moroſe Documents of <hi>Solomon's</hi>
whipping Proverbs, and ſtill as eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proſecute, not obſerving the ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
it met with in his own Son. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which inſtigations, no ſooner has
incens'd Extravagancy reſolv'd to
take it's flight, but immediately Vice
appears in all her Harlotry attire, and
expoſing all the ſplendour of her gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
allurements, ſo hampers unwary
Innocence in the Nooſes of Neceſſity,
that not knowing which way to diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
it ſelf, the Scene quite alters. So
that of a ſudden Innocence becomes
criminal, before it knows what a crime
is, and young offenders incurr the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
of the Law, ere they hardly
underſtand what the Law forbids.
Till at length perceiving what they
have done, and not believing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſafe from the puniſhment of
leſſer facts but by committing greater,
they abandon themſelves to thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56677:10"/>
ſtratagems, which becauſe they
relieve at preſent, are by them lookt
upon as the effect of Fortune's favour
and their own prudence; ſo that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
by ſucceſs, they cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the delightful practice of thoſe
Enormities, which maintain the ſweet
and tickling pleaſures of riot and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauſhery.
So eaſie a thing it is for
Parents to beget, ſo difficult a task to
hit the true method of Education; for
want of which, ſo many lofty Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us's,
ſo many active courages, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſoaring and refined wits, all tender
pieces, ready for all the fair impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

Bias; ſo many blooming <hi>Expectations</hi>
have periſh'd in the deep Abyſſes of
miſtaken Conduct, and irregular ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity.
How near the Subject of this
Story was to falling from this fatal
Precipice, the enſuing Relation will
declare, which, it may be, well believ'd,
will prove neither unpleaſing nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
to the Reader, or rather an
incitement to acts of Vertue, when
he ſhall obſerve the pains and labours
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56677:11"/>
which extravagance undergoes to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it ſelf in profuſe and guilty
Luxury.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> (for ſo he muſt be
call'd, as having put his name into the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garb, to which he was moſt
accuſtom'd in his Travels) was by
birth of Engliſh Parents, born in
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> no leſs famous for pleaſure
then plenty. His tender years were
under the eye and government of his
Father, a perſon of a ſevere and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging
auſterity. In him perhaps it
might be thought paternal <hi>care,</hi> who
obſerving which way the current of
his Son's inclinations ran, deem'd it
the ſafeſt courſe by violence to ſtop
the ſtream of his unruly paſſions. And
indeed there was ſufficient cauſe of
ſuſpicion, &amp; the Father had a fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of what the future would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
by the early exerciſes of his Son's
childiſh Talents. For which reaſon
poor <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> was not onely daily
rated and rebuk'd, but frequently and
vigorouſly chaſtiz'd, and expos'd to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56677:11"/>
the rigid laſh for every trivial miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour.
This ſurly uſage ſo diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
the frank and generous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> which was to
have been corrected rather by Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
then Corroſives, that he look'd
upon his Father as a Maſter rather
then a Parent, and himſelf to be a
Slave rather then a Son. So then for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
of theſe grievances, there muſt be
a ſpeedy remedy provided, for finding
out of which his tender wits were ſoon
employ'd. They argu'd in his brain,
that there was no living at home,
therefore he muſt venture abroad, and
that if a ſervitude muſt be endur'd, it
was more eaſie to be born under the
frowns and ſpurns of Strangers, then
of near Relations, where Extravagance
had no body to thank but it ſelf for
the hardſhip it ſuffer'd.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of theſe ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations,
the Devil and Ill-Luck
ſoon found him out a Meet-help for
his purpoſe; a pure Satanical Privy-Counſellour,
even a Servant of his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56677:12"/>
own Fathers. He was call'd by the
name of <hi>Jemmy,</hi> a <hi>Scot</hi> by Nation, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Conditions; Indigent, Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Perfidious: true only to the
Son to cheat the Father; perhaps out
of a deſire to reviſit his Houſhold
Gods, at the expences of a defrauded
Maſter. To this Inſtrument of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub,</hi>
the young diſguſted <hi>Squire</hi>
diſcloſes all the Secrets of his Heart,
tells him the occaſion of his diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
and his deſign to throw off the
Yoak of Paternal Severity, which
ſince there was no way to do but by
Travelling, he was reſolv'd to take
that courſe, and therefore requeſted
both his advice and aſſiſtance. <hi>Jemmy</hi>
liſtned to this Diſcourſe like a Sow
i'th Beans; he applauded his deſign,
magnify'd his Youthful Courage, and
by a large Encomium upon the worſt
of Countries, perſwaded the Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Stripling to Steer toward the
<hi>North-Pole,</hi> to the Land of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
whither he might be ſure of a
faithful Guide, and when there, of
an Aſſiſtant in the midſt of Wealthy
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56677:12"/>
and generous Relations. This being
concluded, they were both ſenſible
that it would be very uneaſie Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
without Horſes; but that care
was ſoon over, when <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>
call'd to mind that his Father was
well ſtor'd with that ſort of Cattle,
and being their own Caſuiſts, they
eaſily overcame all ſcruples of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
upon a ſuppoſition that an
Heir in a caſe of neceſſity, might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
a ſmall pittance of his Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
and that the ſo doing was
poſitively no Theft. But then again
well knowing that neither Horſe nor
Man could Travel upon the Road,
without Corporal Food, and that it
was in vain to ſwear at an Hoſtler,
or to kick a Chamberlain without
Money in Breeches; it was farther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
that the young <hi>Squire</hi> ſhould
fly to <hi>London,</hi> there to take up what
Money he could among his Father's
Correſpondents, and that truſty <hi>Jem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
upon notice given of his ſucceſs,
ſhould preciſely meet him at the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz,
which was before appointed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56677:13"/>
at <hi>St. Alban</hi>'s. Theſe bleſſed begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
were ſo fortunately favour'd by
the aſſiſtance of their friend <hi>Monſieur
Satan,</hi> who was loth to loſe two ſuch
fair Gameſters, that all things being
accompliſh'd according to their hearts
deſire, away haſtens <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> to
<hi>St. Alban</hi>'s, and there meets his pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Companion with his Fathers
two Horſes; and ſo well mounted, the
young Maſter and the young man,
Knight-Errant-like, ſet forward upon
their Northern Progreſs. By the way
to make the Journey the more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
<hi>Jemmy,</hi> who was endued with a
nimble utterance, and the true faculty
of <hi>Scotch</hi> lying, entertain'd his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
with ſeveral diſcourſes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the reſt, told him ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
ſtories of the ſweet plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
the contentment and plenty
which he ſhould meet with at his
Fathers ſtately Manſion, that he had
rais'd <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s expectations
Steeple high. But after ſome days
travel, there befel them a ſmall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of delay, which ſomewhat abated
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56677:13"/>
the Squires jollity: For it ſo happen'd,
that <hi>Jemmy,</hi> already poſſeſſ'd with
one Devil, was ſeiz'd with another
Devil of an Ague, which enter'd him
with that violence, that to exorciſe
the robuſtious Spirit, they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to lye ſtill for four or five whole
days and nights; in which time <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi>'s Father had been amply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
which way the two Edomites
were march'd with the Spoyls of his
Purſe and Stable. How fatal this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
might have prov'd to theſe
young Practitioners in iniquity may
be eaſily conjectur'd, had the Father
been eager to follow them. But he
being more tender of his credit, as
diſdaining the world ſhould know
how his grave Experience had been
over-reach'd by two raw Whipſters,
then to make a noiſe of his loſſes, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
the purſuit; ſo that upon <hi>Jem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>'s
recovery, the two Knight-Errants
ſet forward again, without any diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
But <hi>Jemmy,</hi> as unſound in body
as in mind, having ventur'd too ſoon
into the ſharp winter air, (for ſuch was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56677:14"/>
the ſeaſon of the year which they
choſe for their Journey of pleaſure)
before they could accompliſh four
days travel more, fell into a new di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
to the great grief and ſorrow
of <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> who had then no ſmall
reaſon to doubt the loſs of his Guide,
and pillar of his hopes, as finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
for the love and friendſhip which
he bore to <hi>Jemmy,</hi> now more likely
to be expoſ'd then ever to the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
of unhappy Undertakers, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
foreſeen, but ſo not eaſie to be
prevented, eſpecially conſidering the
great expence he then and ſtill was
like to be at. Theſe reflections, and
the thoughts of being a ſtranger,
without having any Bills of Exchange
for future ſupply, among a rude ſort
of people that would no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
him then his money laſted,
which was not likely to be long, at
the rate of Nurſes and Pothecaries
Bills, were ſufficient to have confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
all the cogitations that an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd
Stripling could muſter toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But Fortune and good Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56677:14"/>
ſo well agreed to encourage <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> in his firſt Eſſays of <hi>Guſmanry,</hi>
that in three weeks time, <hi>Jemmy</hi> not
yet mellow enough for the Devil's
palate was well recover'd, and able
to undertake the remaining part of
the Journey. And indeed he had then
more reaſon then ever to promiſe a
retaliation of that care and kindneſs
which his Maſter had ſhewn him in
his Sickneſs: nor, to ſay truth, could
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> accuſe him in the leaſt
while he was yet in <hi>England,</hi> where
he was as laviſh of his acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as could be expected, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
ſuch works of ſupererogation
at home, as if his Fathers Opulent
Seat had been the Manſion of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
it ſelf. But the Reader ſhall
ſoon find the vaſt difference between
<hi>Scotch</hi> Promiſes and <hi>Scotch</hi> Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</p>
            <p>Well—after a cold and tedious
Journey, all weather-beaten as we
were, at length we arrived at <hi>Jemmy</hi>'s
Father's Palace, lying in the County
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56677:15"/>
of <hi>Anderdale,</hi> near a Town call<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d <hi>Mof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fut.</hi>
When <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> beheld it, he
was ſo far from being over-raviſh'd
with joy at the ſight, that he took it
for ſome inchanted Caſtle, in regard
he could not ſee ſo much as one ſtone
of all that magnificent Pile, which
<hi>Jemmy</hi> all the way upon the road had
been building in his fancy. Rather
he was more than uſually ſurpriz'd
at the humility of the Structure, and
the lowlineſs of the Owner. Had he
not been a Scot, you would have ſworn
him a Turk, regardleſs of his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in this world, in expectation of
Fools Paradiſe in the next. It was a
Hovel, or rather Stie, in length about
ſix and thirty foot, not covered Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral-like
with Lead, nor yet with
glittering Copper after the Swediſh
manner, but according to the Scotch
cuſtome, very meanly thatcht with
oaten Reeds; not ſuch as the Arcadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Shepherds pip'd withal, but plain
down-right illiterate Straw. The fire
was made near the Bed-ſide, at one
end, which for want of a Chimney,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56677:15"/>
wrapt the whole Family, Gueſts and
all, like ſo many <hi>Ixions,</hi> in a continual
cloud of Eye-tormenting ſmoak. Near
to the Bed-ſide lay the Corn and Hay,
which you may be ſure was not worth
its weight in Gold: and at the other
end, without the diſtinction of Partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſtood two Sheep, a Cow, and the
Squires Horſes: So that it may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
believ'd, that Vertue her ſelf in
all her exiles and perſecutions never
liv'd in ſuch a <hi>Homely Hermitage:</hi> and
<hi>Marius,</hi> when he lay hid among the
Bulruſhes in the Fens of <hi>Minturnus,</hi>
might be thought to have lodg'd in
a Palace to this ill-favour'd reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as we came to this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Apartment, the Old man, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
with joy not only to ſee his Son,
who had been abſent from him ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
years, but to behold him in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage
ſo Gentile, after the Engliſh
mode, could not forbear bedewing his
Cheeks; but when <hi>Jemmy</hi> fell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on his
Knee to crave his Fathers bleſſing the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56677:16"/>
old man, who well knew he had none
to give, ſtood amaz'd; <hi>What a muc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
Dee'l,</hi> quoth he, <hi>is the Carle wood?</hi>
Whereupon <hi>Tomazo</hi> obſerving his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment,
acquainted the old Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con-fac'd
<hi>Lown,</hi> that it was the onely
cuſtomary way for Children in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
to acknowledg their reſpect and
duty to their Parents, and that <hi>Jem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
had done it purely out of natural
affection, and to ſhew his improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Engliſh Behaviour and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
Thereupon the old man
ſeeming to be better ſatisfi'd, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
to the breeding of his Son,
and Embrac'd him. Which Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
being ſoon over, he requeſted
the Squire to enter his <hi>Polyphemes</hi>
Den. But <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> being very
hungry, and not finding the place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for many Complements, came
cloſe to the point, and demanded
what Proviſion they had in the
Houſe? To which they made anſwer,
that they had good ſtore of Oatemeal
and water, but neither Fleſh nor Fowl,
Milk nor Butter, Bread nor Drink; and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56677:16"/>
which was worſe, that none of theſe
Creature-comforts were to be had for
money within ſix miles of the place;
ſo that poor <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
far'd well at a plentiful Table,
began to curſe his man <hi>Jemmy,</hi> who
after ſuch mountainous promiſes of a
ſplendid Entertainment, and Princely
Viands, had betray'd his longing Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
to ſuch miſerable Commons,
hardly worth the acceptance of a
Country mouſe. But <hi>Jemmeys</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
diſcovering diſcontent in <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi>'s face, and taking pitty of
his Youth, or rather for joy of her
dear Darlings return, began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
up our deſponding Stomachs with
the hopes of a notable Banquet. This,
after the expence of all her Huſwifery,
prov'd to be that ſumptuous Scotch
Diſh, called a <hi>Steane-Bannock,</hi> which
was a certain Compoſition of Bean,
Peas'n, Barly and Oat'n-meal mix'd
together with water, and made into
the form of a large Cake, and being
ſet to the fire againſt a ſtone, and ſo
bak'd, was to be eaten with water;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56677:17"/>
and this without firſt or ſecond Courſe
was the cream of their entertainment:
a ſtrange ſort of Philoſophical Diet
that no way anſwer'd <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s
pamper'd Expectations. Supper, if
ſo it might be call'd, being thus ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly
diſpatch'd at the meer inſtance
of craving hunger, the weary Gueſts
were no leſs deſirous of repoſe, then
they were before of food; to which
the old man repli'd, that 'twas the
Faſhion in that Country for the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to go to bed all together, and not
one before another, and therefore in
regard that <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> and his Son
had prevail'd with him to be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to an Engliſh Ceremony, he
would conſtrain them to be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to one of his Country Cuſtomes.
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> not a little diſguſted at
his Diet, and like to be worſe pleas'd
with his Lodging, began to enter
into a ſerious conſideration of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn
Condition. He found on the one
ſide how miſerably he had been fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
by his man <hi>Jemmy,</hi> whoſe
faus tongue he now began too late
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56677:17"/>
to curſe; he ſaw himſelf in a wild
Deſert among a ſort of Savages,
more prone to make him a prey to
their cruelty, then afford him relief:
which on the other ſide fill'd his Head
full of jealouſies and fears, as now miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubting
that his truſty Man <hi>Jemmey</hi>
had ſome further deſigns rather of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
then of kindneſs, as being privy
to the ſmall Treaſure he had about him.
To repent was irkſome, to fear, below
him. There were no ſhady Woods
for Nightingales to lull him into ſoft
ſlumbers; no murmuring Rills, to
which he might make his ſorrowful
complaints; no kind Hermites to invite
him to their Cells. All his comfort was
in Hope, and the Compaſſion of his
Guardian Angel.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of theſe Diſtractions
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> perceiv'd through the
thick ſmoak, which forced thoſe Tears
from his Eyes that he ought more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
to have ſhed, the two aged Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and five Children, of which
<hi>Jemmey</hi> was one, preparing for bed;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56677:18"/>
which made him deſire leave that he
might ſit up by the Fire all night. But
that requeſt would by no means be
granted him; ſo that poor <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>
was conſtrain'd to uncloath, and go to
bed with the reſt. But in that comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
place he was ſo far from finding any
Sheets, that he ſcarce found Woollen
enough to cover him from the nipping
Cold. However, all things conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the old Man was very friendly;
for he laid the diſtreſſed <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> by
one of his brawny ſides, that ſmelt
like Hung-Beef; a kindneſs more then
ordinary; though it fell out to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
detriment of the ſadly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
Squire; for the warmth of his
Body had ſoon ſummon'd together
multitudes of that creeping Vermin,
Lice, the common curſe of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
which finding the eaſie penitrable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the young Squires tender Skin,
and the ſweetneſs of his well-nouriſh'd
Blood, fell to their freſh Viands, with
ſuch an eager appetite, that the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> inceſſantly tormented
with the continual nippings of thoſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56677:18"/>
hungry Animals, would be often ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up in his Litter to throw off his
Shirt, to prevent thoſe villanous Inſects
from taking poſſeſſion of the folds of
his under Linnen; for which the Old
Man as often rebuk'd him. But alas!
it was impoſſible for the ſuffering <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> to obey the checks of his ſurly
moroſeneſs, while the ſharp-ſet Vermine
were ſo buſily employ'd upon his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſs,
which it was as natural for the reſt
to endure, as it was to ſleep. This reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs
of <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> at length made
the peeviſh Cinque and Quatre angry;
ſo that at laſt he began to cry, <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> was a <hi>ſubtle Karle,</hi> and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be immodeſt with his Daughter.
Whereupon in a grumbling tone he
commanded him to ſurceaſe his cunning
excuſes and lie ſtill: inſomuch that the
afflicted Squire was compell'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with his auſtere Governour, and
to ſpend the reſt of the night in wiſhes
for the ſlow-pac'd Morning. Which
had no ſooner diſplay'd her comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Light, but up he riſes, leaving the
whole Family aſleep, deſigning to be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56677:19"/>
gone forthwith, and rather to expoſe
himſelf to the mercy of the cold Winds,
the ſevere Weather, and the unknown
Paſſages of the rugged Mountains, then
to the barbarous kindneſs of ſuch a
ſavage entertainment for another night.
Thereupon, in order to his farther
progreſs, he puts on his Boots, and
leads forth his Horſe; but going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the Houſe with his Steed in his
hand, (for to avoid the trouble of
leading, he had left his other Courſer
at <hi>Jemmey</hi>'s diſpoſal, as the reward of
his Fathers obligations) here Fortune
ſhew'd him one of her curſed ſlippery
tricks, which had like to have coſt him
his ſweet Life, and put an end to all his
diſconſolations. For ſtepping by chance
upon certain rotten Boards cover'd
with Snow, that lay over a deep Well,
the treacherous Boards giving way, in
dropt <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> who had like to
have drawn his Horſe alſo after him,
had not the Bridle broke. Well it
happen'd for the unfortunate Squire,
that the Water in the Well was frozen
to a conſiderable thickneſs, elſe you
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56677:19"/>
might have bid <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> good night
by the Name of <hi>Nich'las.</hi> But the Ice
putting a ſtop to his farther deſcent, he
receiv'd no more hurt then a ſlight
bruiſe by the Fall. So odly ſometimes
bad and good luck conjobble together.
However, there he was forc'd to ſtand
in a kind of cold Little-eaſe, or Lobſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
being fall'n much lower then
was within his reach to get out again.
Now by that he had remain'd there for
ſome time meditating upon his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
in Chil-blood, <hi>Jemmey</hi> gets up,
and perceiving his Maſter gone, runs
into the Back-ſide, where he finds the
Horſe in a cold Trance, wondering
what was become of the Graſs that us'd
to grow in <hi>England,</hi> but could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
where <hi>Tomazo</hi> ſhould be. In that
amaze he flies about to ſeek him, but
not ſucceeding in his Search, away he
poſts to <hi>Moffutt.</hi> In the mean while
the Old Man riſes, who finding both
his Son and <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> abſent; yet
ſeeing their Horſes, could not conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
what the <hi>Dee'l</hi> ſhould be become
of 'em. He waited, for ſome hours,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56677:20"/>
with patience, expecting their return,
but neither appearing, away goes he
alſo to draw Drie-foot after both. The
Old Man prov'd a cunninger Huntſman
then the Son; for he tracing the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps
which he obſerv'd in the Snow,
came directly to the Well, where he
found the unfortunate <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi>
who eſpying the Countenance of his
ſuppoſed Deliverer, invokes his aid,
and begs his aſſiſtance to help him out
of his Winter Sweating-Tub. But
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> was extreamly deceiv'd in
the humour of the Churliſh Chuff; for
he perceiving his Prey in the ſnare, told
the ſhivering Squire that there were
more words went to a Bargain: You,
<hi>quo he,</hi> would have deflow'red my
<hi>dear Moggee,</hi> and therefore you ſhall
ſtay there a while to cool your courage.
Nay farther, <hi>qho he,</hi> I am apt to believe,
that becauſe I ſpoil'd your ſport, you
have taken your revenge upon my Son,
and made him away; ſo that until he
be found, you are not like to ſtir. This
was a ſad Morning Lecture to poor
<hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> who would have given
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56677:20"/>
all the Shooes in his Shop for a warm
Chimney-corner; but there was no
help for no remedy. For the old Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,
full of miſchief, leaving him to
his Soliloquies, returns to the Houſe,
and there conſults the Hag his Wife,
and his Daughters, as ready as himſelf
to exerciſe their cruelty upon poor
<hi>Tomazo,</hi> well underſtanding by <hi>Jemmey</hi>'s
information, that he had, what they
had been but little acquainted with,
both Silver and Gold about him: And
therefore having fram'd their deſign,
they came to the Well, let down a
Rope, and bid <hi>Tomazo</hi> to faſten it about
him. To theſe glad Tydings, as to a
Voice from Heaven, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
condeſcended; ſo that obeying
ſuch welcome Orders, they preſently
drew him up. But he was no ſooner
come forth, but the <hi>Old Caitiffe</hi> was as
yare for his Caſh; who with a grim A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
threatn'd to ſtab him with his
<hi>Durk,</hi> a doleful ſight <hi>God wott,</hi> if he
did not fairly deliver all he had. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> finding himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Paws of an unavoidable vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56677:21"/>
put his Hands into a Pocket
that contain'd about three Pound in
Silver, which the falſe old Miſcreant
took. But not ſo contented, he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
told <hi>Tomazo</hi> of the concealment
of his Gold, which he muſt either part
with, or with his Life; and with that
pull'd him down by main force i'th
Snow, menacing nothing leſs then
down-right murder if he did not ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
give it him. <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> did by
no means like this bitter Breakfaſt; loth
he was to part with the life of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
and it was as ſad a thing to think
that he ſhould take ſo much pains to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
into <hi>Scotland</hi> to be buried in a Well.
While he was in this peck of troubles,
the Wife and Children more merciful,
prevail'd with the old Tyrant to ſpare
his Life, but to examine his Cloaths
for the Gold, which he ſoon found;
and then fetching forth the deſpoyl'd
<hi>Tomazo</hi>'s Horſe, bid him be gone, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
in regard the Ground was thick
cover'd with Snow, and <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>
an abſolute Stranger in the Country,
that either he might fall into ſome hole
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56677:21"/>
and be ſtarv'd, or elſe never be able to
give any account of the Place where
he had been ſo courteouſly entertain'd.
But <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s better Fortune ſo
guided the Horſe, and the barbariſm of
the old Ragamuffin had ſo imprinted
all imaginable Obſervations in <hi>Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi>'s
Memory, that they were never to
be forgotten.</p>
            <p>In this forlorn condition <hi>Don To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo,</hi>
having wander'd till ſome time
before the next night, and about ten
Miles from the Den of his griſly Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
happen'd to eſpy a ſmall Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
to which he rode with great joy.
There the Scene alter'd, and he found
ſomething of generoſity in an ancient
Gentleman, who was call'd the <hi>Laird
of Corheid,</hi> and owner of the Village,
to whom <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> after he had
made an Apology for himſelf, gave
an account of the Old Mans entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Which being deliver'd by the
diſmantled Squire in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>Laird</hi>
could ſcarce underſtand the meaning of
his Story, till by frequent repetition he
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56677:22"/>
better apprehended the matter, and
then gave credit to the Relation; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> withal, that he
would uſe him more kindly. Upon
which he bid the empty young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
welcome, and commanded him to
be as free as if he were at his Fathers
Houſe: Moreover he aſſur'd the poor
diſconſolate Traveller, that the next
day he would ſend his Warrant (for he
was in Commiſſion of the Peace) for
the whole Family, which had been ſo
barbarous to a Stranger, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
accordingly; ſo that both the
Parents, and all the Children, together
with <hi>Jemmey</hi> himſelf, were brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him. There they met to their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
their injur'd Gueſt, who charg'd
the Old Man ſo home, that he could
not deny the Fact, eſpecially when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſearch'd, the joyful <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s
Gold was found about him. Thereupon
the old Rogue, his Son <hi>Jemmey,</hi> and
the Daughters, were all pack'd away
to Goal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:56677:22"/>
By this time the good <hi>Laird of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heid,</hi>
being truly ſenſible of the hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
abuſes that had been put upon the
ſuccourleſs <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> by this ſame
crew of <hi>Scotch</hi> Monſters, and alſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing
a natural tenderneſs of Heart,
took ſuch an affection to <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi>
that he requeſted him to remain in his
Houſe, till he could more opportunely
diſpoſe of himſelf. Which kind and
ſeaſonable offer <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to refuſe, eſpecially finding the
temper of that whole Family ſo truly
generous; ſo that he took the boldneſs
to continue there near upon forty
days. During which time he had ſo
won the <hi>Lairds</hi> favour, that he call'd
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> his Son, and was often
wont to take him, when he went a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting,
to the Houſes of ſeveral Perſons
of Quality, by whom he was ſo nobly
and familiarly treated, that it would be
a foul ingratitude not to acknowledge
their moſt obliging generoſity.</p>
            <p>Now was <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> as it were in
a ſerene Calme after a violent Storm,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56677:23"/>
living at eaſe and in plenty; he had
ſeen himſelf reveng'd upon thoſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators
of the Laws of Hoſpitality; he
found his Money all reſtor'd, and his
company acceptable to the chiefeſt in
the Province: Which had inſpir'd ſo
much greatneſs into <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s
Breaſt, that he, according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
<hi>Taking that for his Country where
he far'd best,</hi> did not much care to quit
his Poſt. However, conſidering with
himſelf in the midſt of his Delights,
that it would be a rudeneſs beneath the
breeding he had ſhewn, to treſpaſs upon
the <hi>Laird</hi>'s good Nature beyond reaſon,
he bethought himſelf that it was high
time to take his leave, yet with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to return, (for ſuch was the <hi>Lairds</hi>
obligation laid upon him, provided he
could find no better Quarters.) Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he ſet forwards, being furniſh'd
with a Letter of Recommendation to
a Perſon of Quality that liv'd about
fifteen <hi>Scotch</hi> Miles from the <hi>Lairds</hi>
Houſe, the moſt part of which way
lay over the Mountains. But now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
another jades trick of that fickle
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56677:23"/>
Whore that Men call <hi>Fortune.</hi> She had
for forty days together given the exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> her ſweet Milk, but
now ſhe reſolves to kick down the
Pail; as if by checquering the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of his Travels, ſhe intended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to teach him what he was to truſt
to, if he rely'd upon the mutability
of her humour. For by that time
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> had rode about ſix of the
foremention'd Miles, from a little Cave
between two Rocks out leap'd a Brace
of St. <hi>Nicholas Clerks,</hi> who violently
ſeizing the Perſon of the Squire, took
away not only his Gold and Silver, that
had already been in ſo much jeopardy,
but alſo his Horſe and Cloaths, ſtripping
him to his very Shirt: In lieu of which
they gave him a piece of an old <hi>Pladd,</hi>
adding withal, that that ſort of Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
would make him as perfect a <hi>Scotch</hi>
Man as either of them; and thus peny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
diſmounted and naked they left
him to pilgrim it over the Snowy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
without ſo much as directing him
one ſtep of his Way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:56677:24"/>
You may now eaſily conjecture, that
this unfortunate Youth had reaſon ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to condole the calamity of his
condition. And indeed there was no
Perſon of pity that did not highly
blame theſe rigorous proceedings of
that hare-brain'd Beldame <hi>Fortune;</hi> but
ſhe made anſwer for her ſelf, that they
could be no true-taught Sons of hers,
that were not bred up in the School of
Affliction: Experience was not to be
learn'd by living at a certain rate of
content and plenty: It was the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of good and bad luck that was
the Miſtreſs of Knowledge. Quo
ſhe, this young Guſman will be the
better for theſe two Robberies, and
this damn'd Walk over the curſed
Rocks, as long as he lives. This is
the way to try whether he have courage,
whether he have patience, whether he
have ingenuity. And ſo indeed it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd;
for though at firſt the ſtrip'd
and ranſack'd Cavaleer could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
lamenting the raſhneſs of a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
that had brought him into ſo many
almoſt intollerable misfortunes; yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56677:24"/>
his natural courage, rather then
return in that miſerable condition to the
good Laird, (who would moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
have cloath'd and entertain'd
him as before) he reſolv'd to march
forward, and to try, ſince he had no
more to loſe, how he might revenge
himſelf by getting ſomething from a
People that had taken all from him; a
task very difficult to be perform'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Sons of Poverty it ſelf, in a
Country as barren of Riches as the
Mountains that disfigure it. Full of
theſe thoughts <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> ſteers his
courſe by accident to another Lairds
Houſe, whoſe Title was the <hi>Laird of
Creyback Borne;</hi> to whom the rifled
Squire related his laſt misfortune only,
omitting all the former Paſſages, nor
owning that he knew any Perſon in the
Country, but only that he was travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where he was in
expectation of meeting with ſome
Friends. This Lairds compaſſion was
not much inferior to that of his firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance;
for when <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> had
told him his Story, he clad him with a Suit
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56677:25"/>
of his Sons Cloaths, civilly entertain'd
him all night, and the next morning,
after he had directed him the beſt way
to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> gave him alſo three
Pounds <hi>Scotch,</hi> which is five Shillings
Sterling, to bear his Charges.</p>
            <p>From hence <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> walk'd on,
till he came to the old Town of <hi>Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi>
about ten Miles from the laſt
Lairds Houſe, and ſtill in the ſame
County, where it fell out that he met
with the very Perſons that had ſo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcharg'd him of the burthen of his
Cloaths and Money; but though he
kept 'em company, and drank with
'em, till he had ſpent half his ſmall
Stock, their diſguiſes were ſuch as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
them altogether from his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
till it was too late to proſecute
his revenge.</p>
            <p>His Tut'reſs <hi>Fortune</hi> had a mind to
keep him faſting, on purpoſe to put
him upon Tryals of skill. She knew
Neceſſity, and the lowneſs of his
Pocket, would ſoon conſtrain him to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56677:25"/>
ſummon his Wits to a Conſultation for
Repleniſhment. Every Fool can put
the Sweat of his Tenants in his Pocket;
He's the darling of Fortune that carries
his Eſtate in his Brains. She never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes
the bold and daring, O brave
Wits! for by their prompt aſſiſtance
<hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> now at a deſperate pinch,
had call'd to his remembrance a way
what to do; not to laze under hedges,
not to go whining from door to door,
to court penurious Charity; but to
cheat the Crafty, out-knave the Knave
in grain; to white-waſh <hi>Boatles,</hi> one
of which is the ſixth part of a Peny,
ſo as to make them paſs currently
for a certain <hi>Scotch</hi> piece of Silver,
call'd a Forty-peny Piece, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to twenty <hi>Boatles</hi> in Copper.
Of theſe Pieces <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> by the
help of ſome Ingredients which he
bought at <hi>Peebles,</hi> had got good ſtore,
which being by him vended for good,
in a weeks time put about five Pounds
in his Pocket. And thus you ſee the
wide World is no dangerous Sea for
one that can ſwim.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:56677:26"/>
With this jolly recruit <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi>
now a <hi>Don</hi> indeed, returns to his friend
the <hi>Laird of Corheids,</hi> to whom he
related the manner of his being rob'd
the ſecond time, which the good Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
could hardly believe, till <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> had deſcrib'd one of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
moſt exactly well, and the other
ſo near as could be poſſible. The firſt
happen'd to be one of the Lairds Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
who had often ſeen <hi>Tomazo,</hi>
and knew of the Gold and Silver's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reſtor'd to him at the <hi>Lairds</hi> Houſe.
The temptation of which booty prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
him to act a crime, which he had
never been guilty of before. But that
lame confeſſion ſerv'd neither his nor
his Companions turn; for being both
apprehended, they were both ſent to
Goal, Companions in their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as they had been Aſſociates in the
Crime. Which put <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> into
ſome apprehenſion of his own danger,
fearing leſt his condition might be the
ſame, ſhould he linger much longer
near the Places where he had ſo lately
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56677:26"/>
been ſowing his counterfeit Pieces.
But Fortune that deſir'd his improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
only, not his ruine, found out a
way to deliver him. For about two
nights after, as the <hi>Laird</hi> was ſitting
by the Fire with his Family, and <hi>Don
Tomazo,</hi> there aroſe a diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the misfortunes of <hi>Don Tomazo;</hi>
at which the Laird fell into a rapture
of admiration, how miraculouſly Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
had deliver'd the Unfortunate
Stranger; ſaying very devoutly withal,
That ſurely Providence had reſerv'd
him to be an Inſtrument of ſome great
Work or other. And therefore, leſt
the noiſe of <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s Gold and
Silver might prove a Bait for others to
deſtroy this precious Inſtrument, he
reſolv'd the next morning to go for
<hi>Edenburgh,</hi> to look after the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Priſoners, and to take
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> along with him, as indeed
the Proceedings of Juſtice requir'd.
Now the Road to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> lay
through a Village call'd <hi>Per<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſſen,</hi> where
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> had been very buſie in
vending his Forty-peny Pieces. So that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56677:27"/>
as he paſs'd through the Town, the
Perſon who had exchang'd the greateſt
part, eſpying him, ran to ſtop his Horſe;
at which the Laird being ſurpriz'd, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of the Fellow, whether he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to rob him? No, ſaid he, but
I want ſome Money which that Perſon,
pointing to <hi>Tomazo,</hi> cheated me of
about five days ſince. But the <hi>Laird</hi>
had too good an opinion of his Son
<hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> to give credit to his
Story; but rather believ'd that the
noiſe of his Gold being ſpread over the
Country had ſet the People a gog to
be hang'd for it. So that the <hi>Laird,</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> before him, without
taking any farther notice of the Villagers
complaint, rode on. By which means
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> ſcap'd a ſcouring, and got
clear to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> with his true Friend
the good <hi>Laird,</hi> who carri'd him to
one of the Judges to give in his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
againſt the Priſoners; but <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> being under age, could not be
admitted as Evidence againſt them, and
ſo they were all acquitted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:56677:27"/>
At <hi>Edenburgh Don Tomazo</hi> acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
met with certain <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
whoſe curioſity had lead them
to travel into thoſe Parts. Theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
knew <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> to whom
he related the occaſion of his coming
thither, as alſo how he had been treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as well by the <hi>Laird</hi> in particular,
as others: He alſo gave them an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his misfortunes and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances;
which as they were Stories
pleaſing to the Ear, induc'd them to
take <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> for a Companion,
and to make the ſame proviſion for
him as for themſelves. After which
they went with <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> to wait
upon the Laird, to give him thanks
for the great favours he had ſhewn their
Country-man. Which piece of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance
was ſo grateful to the <hi>Laird,</hi>
that after he had drank a Bottle or two
in the Company, with Tears in his
Eyes (for ſuch was his affection to his
new Son) he took his leave of <hi>Tomazo</hi>
in particular, and then of the reſt of
the Gentlemen. Where note, that it
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56677:28"/>
is not for Clowns and Men of ſullen
tempers, but for Perſons of accute
complyance, and airy behaviour, to be
<hi>Guſmans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With theſe Gentlemen <hi>Tomazo</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd
through divers parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
which prov'd a very pleaſant Journey;
in regard thoſe Gentlemen had Letters
of Credit to moſt Perſons of Quality
in the Country; by whom they were
for the moſt part very nobly entertain'd
with good Muſick, and other Rarities;
nay in ſome Parts their ſplendid Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page
produc'd ſuch credit of it ſelf,
without their Letters, that ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of the Country would ſtand at
the back of a Chair, waiting while they
ſate at Dinner, uſing no leſs then the
Title of Lord to the meaneſt of them,
though they endeavoured as much as
in them lay to perſwade them to the
contrary. Thus having travel'd almoſt
through the whole Country, and
meeting nothing worthy obſervation,
the Gentlemen fac'd about homewards;
when coming to a Town call'd <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freize,</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:56677:28"/>
upon the Borders of <hi>England,</hi>
they concluded there to reſt for a
Week or ſo: in which time they became
acquainted with ſeveral of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the Place, with whom they
us'd to drink ſmartly. One day among
the reſt, as they were merry at a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
an old Woman came into the
Room to beg a Glaſs of Wine, and in
particular of <hi>Don Tomazo;</hi> who for
that very reaſon refus'd to give her any,
unwilling to aſſume a preeminence in
the company of Friends to whom he
was ſo much beholding. At which the
Woman went away, refuſing to take
Wine from any other Perſon, but
threat'ning <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> with moſt
dreadful misfortunes, and an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Curſe that ſhould attend him;
which the Gentlemen little regarding,
drank on to that exceſs, that very few,
if one went home ſober.</p>
            <p>That night <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> was not in
a condition, but the next morning he
went to look after his Horſe, which he
found in ſuch a poſture as amaz'd him;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56677:29"/>
for his Body was drawn up in ſuch
a ſtrange manner, that his Head and
his four Feet were all in a huddle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
beſides this, the colour of his
hair was alter'd, and a thick white
Foam bedaub'd his Chaps from one ſide
to the other. This putting <hi>Don To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>
in mind of the Womans threats
the night before, made him ſuſpect her
for a Witch. Which he found upon
enquiry had been the hard opinion of
her Neighbours for many years. Upon
which information <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
with immediate revenge, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to draw blood of her, according
as his Nurſe had taught him, went to
the old Womans Houſe, where he
found her cutting of Wood. So ſoon
as ſhe ſaw him, it ſeem'd to <hi>Tomazo,</hi>
that the antickneſs of her behaviour
was ſuch as ſhew'd her jealous of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>'s
deſign in coming to viſit her,
who while ſhe diſcours'd him ſmoothly
and calmly enough, waited for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but an opportunity to ſurprize
her. At length, perceiving ſhe had
got a great Stick in her hand that ſhe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56677:29"/>
could not eaſily cleave, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>
very officiouſly deſires her to give him
the Bill, and to hold one end of the
Stick, to which ſhe readily conſenting,
<hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> having by ſome diſcourſe
or other oblig'd her to look another
way, with a home ſtroak cut off one
of her Thumbs, and ſo leaving her to
curſe and ban him to the Devil, went
immediately to the Stable, where he
found his Horſe upon his Legs in decent
order, and feeding as well as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
had ever ail'd him.</p>
            <p>This accident of the Witch, if ſuch
ſhe were, exalted <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> to a
very high pitch; as believing he was,
or ſhould be ſome great Hero. For,
quo he, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> was belov'd by a Witch,
and <hi>Aeneas</hi> was belov'd by a Witch;
St. <hi>George</hi> was charm'd by a Witch, and
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> was belov'd by a Witch.
So that had he given her Wine, and
not cut off her Thumb, who knows
what happineſſes had been prepar'd for
him. But having cut off her Thumb,
ſhe withdrew her affections from him,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56677:30"/>
and was ſo far from advancing his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
that ſhe complain'd to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
of the Town of the loſs of
her Joynt; for which ſhe accus'd the
<hi>Engliſh Lad,</hi> as ſhe call'd him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the <hi>Engliſh Lad</hi> was ſent for, and
upon a full examination of the matter,
committed to Priſon. For indeed he
own'd the Fact, and upon what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
he did it, but could not make out
by any ſort of reaſon why he ſhould
aſſume the doing of juſtice to himſelf.
The reſt of the Gentlemen offer'd to
be his Bail; but nothing would ſerve
but one of <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s Thumbs, which
the Magiſtrate proteſted ſhould be
cut off, and given to the Old Woman
to burn before his face. Which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
Sentence you may be ſure did
not a little trouble <hi>Don Tomazo.</hi> But
Fortune, who knew he had more oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
for his Thumb then the Old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
was for none of thoſe Moſaical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions,
ſo that what by her aſſiſtance,
and the Gentlemans induſtry, a Rope
was convey'd to <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> by
means whereof he made his eſcape
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56677:30"/>
out of the Goal, without paying his
Fees; and ſo being privately convey'd
out of Town to a Place where his
Horſe ſtood ready, he receiv'd dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to poſt with all ſpeed to <hi>Carliſle,</hi>
and there to ſtay at an Inne appointed,
till the Company came to him. Which
by the good conduct of Fortune, and
with no ſmall hazard he accompliſh'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
being purſu'd almoſt to the Walls of
the City. About a week after arriv'd
his Companions, who being ſuſpected
to have been privy to <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s Eſcape,
were detain'd by the Magiſtrate till
they had pay'd their ten Crowns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
to the Poor of the Town, which
amounted to a conſiderable Sum, there
being five in number.</p>
            <p>Theſe Gentlemen being come to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle,</hi>
found there their beloved <hi>Tomazo,</hi>
for which they were not a little joyful;
their kindneſs to him being nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to the <hi>Laird of Corheids.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Carliſle</hi> they ſet forward for
<hi>London</hi> with all ſpeed; where in a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56677:31"/>
little time being ſafely arriv'd, the
Company ſeparated, and <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>
was left to himſelf; who though ſo
near his Parents, was almoſt in as bad
a condition as at his firſt entrance into
<hi>Scotland.</hi> But neceſſity prompting
him to ſome ſerious reſolution, the
Story of the Prodigal Son took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of his Pate, and he began to
ſtudy how to be reconcil'd to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
A kind Office which was ſoon
accompliſh'd by the Interceſſion of a
particular Favourite of his Fathers,
who ſo far prevail'd, that <hi>Tomazo,</hi>
after a hearty ſorrow and deep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition
for his Crime, was again admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into his Fathers favour: both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
various effects of the paſt
Ramble; the Father believing that the
Son, now well read in the Lectures of
neceſſity, would be more careful how
he plung'd himſelf into the ſame Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
again; and the Son preſuming,
that the Father now knowing what it
was to want a living Child, would be
more tender of provoking him for the
future. In both which Conjectures both
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56677:31"/>
were miſtaken. As for <hi>Tomazo</hi> (for
while he is under his Father's Roof we
muſt un-Don him) for about half a
year he continu'd very patiently within
the bounds of modeſty. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
auſterity of his Father, together
with certain Impreſſions that Love had
made in his Heart, ſoon put his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
into an uproar, and quite al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
that compoſure of mind, which
had given ſuch life to their hopes of
his becoming a new Creature. The
<hi>Don</hi> began to cloſe again with <hi>Tomazo,</hi>
and all his paſſions being in a ferment,
ſo alarum'd his Father, that he was forc'd
to double his Guards. However, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the Fathers diligence
and correction, the Son, having laid
aſide all thoughts of reformation, and
forgotten all his vows and proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of penitence, betook himſelf ſo
far to his former more natural, and
conſequently more pleaſing extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies;
ſo that the Old Man, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
able to endure the bad Examples
which he gave in his Family, one day
in the Garden took an occaſion to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56677:32"/>
               <hi>Tomazo</hi> that he muſt depart
thoſe Walls. This Sentence ſounded
very harſhly in <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s Ears; and
therefore duly weighing the miſery of
an eloignment from his beloved Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,
a near Neighbour, the great
dangers he had eſcap'd in <hi>Scotland;</hi> his
preſent eaſe, and the apparent extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
he ſhould be expos'd to by the
Caſualty of new Travels, he began to
intercede with his Father, whoſe good
nature at that time was eaſily prevail'd
with to have ſome farther patience,
provided his Son would keep up to his
promiſes of mortification. But <hi>Tomazo</hi>
being engag'd in an Amour with a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Female, that was the ſole and firſt
Miſtreſs of his affections, had not the
power to perform his engagements, and
therefore found out a ready way to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel
all his Fathers hopes.</p>
            <p>This Miſtreſs of his was Daughter
to a neighbouring Gentleman, in her
thirteenth year, of no great Fortune,
more then what Nature and Art in
point of Education had accompliſh'd
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56677:32"/>
her withal; which for the moſt part
are the chief allurements of Youth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
ſuch as are not capable of taking
a proſpect of their future well-being.
Between theſe two Children, as I may
ſafely ſay, for <hi>Tomazo</hi> was not then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
fourteen years of age, there was
an amorous intreague ſo cunningly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd,
as could hardly be expected from
ſuch early Lovers. To which purpoſe
the Damſel, who had a Father as ſevere
in all particulars as <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s, had order'd
our meetings in the night; to the end
ſhe might ſteal her enjoyments, when
the old Gentleman thought her moſt
ſecure, that is in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> faſt aſleep.
<hi>Tomazo</hi>'s condition was the ſame. So that
for ſeveral nights they entertain'd each
other with all the amorous careſſes that
an innocent and harmleſs converſe could
afford. But it ſo fell out, that <hi>Tomazo</hi>
was unfortunately ſuſpected by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whoſe <hi>Argus</hi> Eyes kept a continual
Watch upon him, even to that degree of
ſtrictneſs, that nothing would ſerve but
that <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s Quarters muſt be remov'd
to a Chamber, the paſſage to which lay
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56677:33"/>
through his Fathers. So that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
impoſſible for <hi>Tomazo</hi> to meet his
Miſtreſs that night, as by ſolemn Promiſe,
ſacred among Lovers, he had engag'd
himſelf to do. But Love, that has more
ways to the Wood then one, furniſh'd
him with an Expedient; for <hi>Tomazo,</hi>
conſidering the vaſt damage it might be
to him, to diſappoint a Lady that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
all for his ſake, reſolv'd to make
the attempt, though it were through his
Fathers Chamber. With this reſolution
of a deeply-ſmitten Gallant, up he riſes,
puts on his Cloaths, and laying in his
place a Periwig and a Block with the
face of the Block turn'd to the Wall, and
carefully heal'd up for fear of catching
cold, he takes a Sheet along with him,
and adventures croſs the old Gentlemans
Chamber, who being more wakeful then
<hi>Tomazo</hi> expected, over-hear'd him, but
yet let him alone, well knowing the
door to be faſt, and the Keys of all the
Houſe to be ſafe by his Bed ſide. <hi>Tomazo</hi>
underſtood all that before, and therefore
not to put himſelf upon vain and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
delays, he takes his Napkin and his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56677:33"/>
ſhort Stick, Utenſils that he had ready
fix'd, goes to the Window, and having
with much Art, but no noiſe, drawn the
Barr, he faſtens his Sheet, let himſelf
down into the Garden, and thence with
no leſs ſpeed then joy, repairs to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,
whoſe patience was almoſt tyr'd
with waiting for his company, which ſhe
had ſcarce enjoy'd above two hours, but
break of day-light forc'd them to retire.
But before that time, <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s Father,
having heard ſomething trip through
his Chamber, concluded that it was his
gracious Son; but becauſe he was almoſt
aſſur'd that he could find no way out of
the Houſe, he therefore expected his
immediate return, which not being
made, the Old Gentleman, miſtruſting
ſome treachery in his own Senſe of
Hearing, conſulted his Wife. She was of
the ſame opinion, that it was impoſſible
for <hi>Tomazo</hi> to get out of the Houſe, and
therefore undertook to perſwade her
Huſband, that <hi>Tomazo</hi> was return'd to
his Chamber. However, the Old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
not being ſatisfy'd, gets up, and
taking a Candle examins the Bed;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56677:34"/>
where finding a Head with hair that lay
very ſnug and quiet in a true ſleeping
poſture, he could not imagine but that
<hi>Slipstring</hi> was faſt in <hi>Morpheus</hi> Chains,
who was then indeed in the Fetters
of his Miſtreſſes Arms. But Jealouſie
and Age, being generally ſuch inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Companions, it would not out
of the Old Gentlemans Pericranium,
but that either ſome Hobgoblin or ſome
Thief had been viſiting the Secrets of
his Houſe: and therefore reſolving to
be farther ſatisfy'd, once more up he
takes the Candle down Stairs he rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and examines all the Doors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
finding all faſt in a pelting chafe to be
put thus to dance about i'th' cold in his
Shirt, up he comes again; when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> loe, as
he aſcended he ſpy'd a pittance of the
Sheet hanging within the Window<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he march'd immediately, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the poſture of the contrivance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
concluded there was a Robbery in the
caſe. Thereupon the Old Gentleman
calls up his Servants, and bid 'em ſearch
the Houſe: who finding all things in
due decorum, brought in an abſolute
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56677:34"/>
               <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> to the great amazement of
the Maſter and themſelves: in which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment
he returns to his warm
Wife, and relates the Story to her. She
preſently call'd 'em all Fools, and bid 'em
call up <hi>Tomazo,</hi> who there was no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be made would ſoon unfold the
Myſtery. Thereupon one of the Maids
was ſent to wake him; who receiving
no anſwer, began to jog the Block, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
it to have been the drowſy Body
of her Maſters Son; which ſhe did ſo
rudely, that the Block, turning, the black
Phyſiognomy of the graven Image,
ſtar'd her full i'th' Count'nance. Which
ſo terrify'd the Maid, that ſhe ran to her
Maſter crying out, that <hi>Tomazo</hi> was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
for he look'd black i'th' face. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the Maſter and Miſtreſs both
roſe, and went into <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s Chamber;
where upon a true examination of the
whole matter, they diſcover'd the Plot,
and ſo leaving the wooden Idol in the
ſame poſture, as it lay when the Maid
firſt found it, they went to bed in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s return; who ſoon
after made his ſilent entry, and having
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56677:35"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:56677:36"/>
rectify'd the diſorders of the Window,
ſtole bare-foot through his Fathers
Chambers, who heard him well enough,
into his own, and with much inward ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for the purloyn'd pleaſures he
had had, went to ſupply his broken reſt,
not dreaming he was diſcover'd, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
he found all things as he left them.
But woe is me, before <hi>Tomazo</hi> was well
ſettl'd in his repoſe, the Father, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
able to conceal his paſſion, came to
correct the amorous Night-walker. <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo,</hi>
by the cloud upon his Fathers
Brows, perceiving the Storm coming,
pleaded hard for mercy, beſeeching his
Father to conſider, that the innocency
of his years could not draw him forth
to any more then only a merry-making
with honeſt and civil Perſons, ſome of
whom he well knew. But that would
not qualifie the incens'd Old Gentleman,
who at firſt laid on very ſmartly; but
obſerving no returns of childiſh howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but rather a manly ſuffering, and
paſſive ſubmiſſion to Paternal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he forbore any farther School-boys
chaſtizement, which he ſaw was but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56677:36"/>
thrown away upon one that ſo little
regarded it; and upon <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
entreaty came to a Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which produc'd theſe Articles of
Agreement, That the next fault that
<hi>Tomazo</hi> did commit, he ſhould be thruſt
out of doors, never more to ſee his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
face again. This was a doleful Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
yet but a Flea-bite to the irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
commands of Love. An Article
with a Father was not to ſtand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
with a Promiſe made to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.
And the Devil would have it,
that he had made one to meet her again
the night following in the ſame place.
So that, after the mode of Princes, <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>
ſoon found a flaw i'th' Treaty,
and was reſolv'd to venture a breach,
though he loſt the reverſion of all his
Fathers Dominions. Thereupon, being
inform'd, that his Father, who look'd
upon him as a <hi>Carthaginian</hi> of no faith,
was reſolv'd to lock him into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the next night; by way of preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Love inſpir'd <hi>Tomazo</hi> to go in the
day-time and pluck up one of the
Boards under his own Bed, which gave
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56677:37"/>
him free paſſage into a Cellar, and ſo
through a Window as before. That
done, the hopes of enjoying his Miſtreſs
made <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> very pleaſant the reſt
of the day, having made ſo fair a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
already, which gave his Father no
leſs cauſe to ſuſpect that he had ſome
notable Stratagem in his Pate, that made
his Heart ſo light, and therefore that
night he reſolv'd to watch <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s
motion himſelf. Which being come, and
the uſual hour having ſummon'd the
Family to bed, <hi>Tomazo</hi> was lock'd into
his Room; where, after he had made a
ſeeming preparation to go to bed, he fell
to work, and firſt having remov'd the
Board, he let down his Cloaths with a
Line, the paſſage not being otherwiſe
wide enough for his Body: then he
deſcended himſelf, like an Angel from
the Roof of a Play-houſe, and thinking
himſelf as ſecure as a Thief in a Mill; but
no ſooner was he in the Cellar, but at the
ſame moment his Father was in the
Room, who immediately ſeizing the
Line, drew back all <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s Cloaths,
and left him to meditate i'th' cold Cellar
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56677:37"/>
all night in his Shirt, having nothing to
keep him warm, but the heat of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire;
a ſort of practice of Piety which
no way agreed with <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s temper.
Theſe diſappointments did but ſerve to
height'n <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s Reſolutions, whoſe
Fires meeting with reciprocal and equal
Flames, burnt with that ardent heat,
that the leaſt ſeparation from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his Love, was a gaſh that woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Heart, not to be endur'd.
Love of it ſelf, crafty and ſubtle e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
is a meer Devil in a young Guſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
lawleſs as an <hi>Iriſh Torie,</hi> as impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
as <hi>Ajax,</hi> and as cholerick as <hi>Hector.</hi>
So that had not his modeſty argu'd hard
againſt it, he had ventur'd, as he was in
his Shirt, to ſhew himſelf a punctual
Lover to a moſt faithful <hi>Hero,</hi> who had
ſpent all the night in waiting and moan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and moaning and waiting for her
dear <hi>Leander,</hi> till the Tell-tale Sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to peep into her amorous Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
At what time, deſpairing, ſighing,
and accuſing the Infidelity of her young
Gallant, ſhe retir'd to her broken reſt;
while on the other ſide the Old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56677:38"/>
came not only to releaſe his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
Pris'ner, but alſo to diſcharge
him without Fees out of his Houſe; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Conditions of the Treaty
ſo lately concluded. Which as ſoon as
he was apparel'd was abſolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
and poor <hi>Peel-Garlick</hi> turn'd
adrift into the wide World in a worſe
condition then when he travel'd for
<hi>Scotland;</hi> for then he had the Bleſſings
of Mony, now not a <hi>Boatle</hi> in his Pocket.</p>
            <p>It was now high time to conſider
what courſe to ſteer. The laſt diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of his Miſtreſs had ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
him in his Amours, that he had
not the face to appear in his Miſtreſs's
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight. He thought it a crime ſo far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
forgiveneſs, that he durſt not
crave it. And therefore giving her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
for loſt, (for he was yet but in his
Love-primmar, and had not learn'd
thoſe Leſſons of cajeoling tender Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells,
which afterwards he became a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
in) he abandon'd all his Amorous
Thoughts, and rather choſe the retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Hay-cock the remaining part
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56677:38"/>
of that day, there to condole his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny.
So ſoon as it was night, with the
Beaſts of Prey, to avoid his diſcovery,
he began his Rambles, ſteering directly
for <hi>London,</hi> once more to try his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
credit, which prov'd not ſo hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
as the Old Gentleman intended.
Who ſuſpecting that <hi>Tomazo</hi> would
make bold with it, as he had formerly
done, had, by way of prevention, fairly
warn'd all his Correſpondents not to
pay any Money upon his account, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Warrant under his own hand.</p>
            <p>Now was <hi>Tomazo,</hi> with a ſlender
ſtock of Nine-pence, arriv'd at <hi>Englands</hi>
Metropolis, where he was hard put to it
to find a Lodging. However, he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
couragiouſly into a publick Houſe,
and having refreſh'd himſelf with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Supper, he calls for Pen, Ink and
Paper, and then drawing a Letter of his
Fathers out of his Pocket, he did moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
counterfeit the Old Gentlemans
Hand, to a Perſon of his acquaintance,
for thirty Pound; who not at all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
the Note, but extreamly jealous
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56677:39"/>
of the Meſſenger, of whom he had had
ſome former experience, was at a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Nonplus what to do about the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the Money. At length, rather
then run the riſco of diſobliging <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>'s
Father, the politick Citizen
found out an expedient; which was,
that he would ſend his Servant and the
Money with <hi>Tomazo</hi> to his Father, to
which <hi>Tomazo</hi> chearfully agreed. So the
Money was immediately deliver'd to the
Servant, with poſitive orders not to part
with his Treaſure to any Perſon living
but <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s Father. With theſe Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the Knight of the burning Peſtle
and <hi>Tomazo</hi> ſet forward toward his
Fathers forbidden Gates. Upon the
way, <hi>Tomazo,</hi> full of invention, often
courted his Companion with the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of drink, a Bait that would not
take with a zealous Writer of Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
ſo jealouſ-pated, that when he
came to a Houſe upon the Road, where
he had a mind to reſt himſelf, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
his Charge to the Maſter of the
Houſe to ſecure it, while he took a nap.
<hi>Tomazo</hi> wholly intent upon his Prey,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56677:39"/>
and watching all opportunities with the
vigilance of a Tigre, was not a little
troubl'd at this reſerv'd warineſs of the
coy <hi>Purſe-bearer.</hi> But ſuch was <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s
patience, that he ſtifl'd all his diſcontents,
and ſtill beheld his Companion with the
careleſs glances of a merry Countenance.</p>
            <p>After ſome hours of ſlumber and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<hi>Tomazo</hi> and his cautious fellow-traveller
ſet forward again; but going
over a Heath, they met with ſeveral
Perſons that inform'd them that if they
went ſuch a Road, they would be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rob'd, as they themſelves had been
but juſt before. Which ſo alarum'd the
Cuckow-brain'd Prentice, who was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to deliver his Money to none but
<hi>Tomazo</hi>'s Father, that to prevent a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
to breach of Truſt, he examin'd
<hi>Tomazo</hi> what private ways there were
that led to his Fathers Houſe? Bleſſed
<hi>Mercury</hi> ſoon inſpir'd <hi>Tomazo,</hi> ſo that he
preſently call'd to mind a ſolitary by-way
through long Graſs and Corn, which
prov'd ſo tireſome, that the careful <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doner,</hi>
to eaſe himſelf in ſome meaſure of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56677:40"/>
his Burthen, believing he could deal
well enough with <hi>Tomazo,</hi> moſt inauſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly
deſir'd <hi>Tomazo</hi> to relieve his
weary Arms. <hi>Tomazo</hi> moſt affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
embrac'd both the Opportunity and
the Bag; ſo that from that time they
carry'd it by turns, to the great but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
comfort of each other. About
eleven a Clock at night (for ſo eager
was the faithful Truſtee to be at his
Journeys end) it came to young <hi>Iſcariot</hi>'s
turn to bear the Sacred Load; who had
no ſooner lodg'd it next his Heart, but
<hi>Judas</hi>'s own Devil poſſeſs'd him, and
preſently taught him a trick, that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Blunderbus</hi> ſhould be no more
troubl'd with his Burthen. For <hi>Tomazo</hi>
paſſing by a heap of Stones, privately,
but with a dext'rous ſlight of hand, takes
up a good big Brickbat, and lays the
ador'd <hi>Mammon</hi> in its place. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>Tomazo</hi> being to go over a Bridge,
makes a falſe ſtep, as if he had been near
a fall, and drops the Stone into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Which the City-Dromedary hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
demanded what it was? 'Tis the
Money, reply'd <hi>Tomazo;</hi> Pox take it,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56677:40"/>
quo he, let it go and be hang'd,—bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
let the Money fall, then ſuffer my
ſelf to be ſous'd at this time a night. The
poor <hi>Seagul</hi> was in ſuch a diſmal conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
at the news, ſo that his Senſes
were juſt packing up their Awls to be
gone from a place where they prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy'd
that they ſhould be but very rudely
entertain'd by the Paſſion of the Maſter,
upon his Boobies return; in ſo much
that <hi>Tomazo,</hi> who all the while laugh'd
in his ſleeve, would have given ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to have had his Picture as he then
look'd. In this amazement truſty <hi>Tom-Fool</hi>
would have perſwaded <hi>Tomazo</hi> to
have put off his Cloaths, and to have
gone into the Water to make ſearch for
the Money, which <hi>Tomazo,</hi> to avoid all
ſuſpition, willingly offer'd to do, but
withal told Nickapoop, that it would
be but a vain attempt without the help
of a Candle. So that he eaſily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the tame Dottrell, now as ſubmiſſive
as a pump'd Bailiff, to ſtay by the Bridge
while he went back to certain Houſes
about half a mile off to get a Light. In
his way, <hi>Tomazo</hi> had recover'd and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56677:41"/>
his Money, and ſo making for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to the Houſes, call'd up the People,
told them the misfortune of young <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus,</hi>
deſir'd their aſſiſtance, and ſent
them all, for a company of Fools, to the
Bridge, where while they were poking,
and groping, and treading a Mortar
i'th' Water with their bare feet, <hi>Tomazo</hi>
having travers'd his Ground, and taken
another Road, had made a fair ſtep in
his way back to <hi>London,</hi> leaving <hi>Tom-Tottie</hi>
to con the ſhort Leſſon of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
which he had ſet him. So far <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>
had reaſon to applaud his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity.
But Fortune would have her
turns and her changes, to ſhew him he
was yet but a young Guſman, and that
there were others ſuperior to him,
whoſe Art was not to be learnt by Rules
of <hi>Accidence</hi> or <hi>Grammar,</hi> but by a ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Experience. For he had no ſooner
ſecur'd himſelf in the City, but he fell
into the company of certain Town-Bullies,
who carry'd <hi>Tomazo,</hi> to <hi>Speirings</hi>
Ordinary, where having eaſily allur'd
the young Squire into play, they ſoon
reduc'd the thirty Pound, for which he
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56677:41"/>
had taken ſo much pains, and which he
look'd upon as one of the Trophies of
his Mercurial Stratagems, to twenty
Shillings, to the great grief of <hi>Tomazo,</hi>
who, to add to his afflictions, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
Information that his Father was
alſo in purſuit of him. For the dejected
<hi>Counter-ſcrubber,</hi> perceiving as well by
the vain ſearch that the People had
made, as by the not returning of <hi>Tomazo,</hi>
that the Serpent had been too crafty for
him, with a heavy Heart jog'd on to the
Old Gentlemans Houſe, and there told
the uncomfortable Story, not daring to
venture his Maſters diſpleaſure, though
there were not above two Inches diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the depth of their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
only the Maſter truſted the Man,
and the Man truſted <hi>Tomazo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Alarum <hi>Tomazo</hi> makes
down for <hi>Graveſend</hi> with all ſpeech,
where he was inform'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſeveral
Ships lay bound for the <hi>Straights.</hi> Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Tomazo</hi> reſolv'd to venture, rather
them fall again under the Juriſdiction of
his Father. There it was that <hi>Tomazo,</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:56677:42"/>
to whom <hi>Fortune</hi> was never more kind
then when ſhe had empty'd his Pocket,
while he was treating with one of the
Captains for his Paſſage to <hi>Gadiz,</hi> met
with two of the Gentlemen, with whom
he had travel'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> bound in the
ſame Ship, for the ſame place. To thoſe
Gentlemen, as to his Confidents, he made
known his condition, and related all
that had befal'n him ſince the time that
they parted at <hi>London.</hi> True it is, that
the Stories of his Extravagance were
not ſo pleaſing to their more ſerious
humours; however, for old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
ſake, they promis'd to take ſuch
care of <hi>Tomazo,</hi> provided he would be
govern'd, that while he continu'd with
them, he ſhould want nothing that was
convenient for him, (a kindneſs eaſily
within their Power, as being the Sons
of Perſons of Quality, and Heirs to fair
Eſtates;) and thus far <hi>Tomazo</hi> had <hi>Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molkin</hi>'s
luck, ſtill to fall upon his Legs.</p>
            <p>While the Ship was under Sail, the
two Gentlemen and <hi>Tomazo</hi> had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Conſultations, how to ſhape their
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56677:42"/>
Travels after they came aſhoar; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whereunto it was agreed, that they
ſhould travel all <hi>Spain</hi> firſt; and after
that ſet Sail for <hi>Aegypt,</hi> from whence
they would viſit <hi>India, China, Tartarie,</hi>
and ſo through <hi>Muſcovie</hi> and <hi>Germanie</hi>
home into <hi>England</hi> again. Full of theſe
deſign'd Rambles, they arriv'd at <hi>Cadiz,</hi>
from whence they made haſt to <hi>Madrid,</hi>
where they had not been above four
days, but one of the Gentlemen hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to kill a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Count, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd
an immediate and diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
after all Perſons that had been in
his company. Thereupon the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
upon notice of the ſearch given
them by a <hi>Blackamore</hi>-Maid that ſerv'd
in the Houſe where they lodg'd, ſtole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
afoot though all the by-ways of
the Country, ſhaping their Courſe for
<hi>Ligorn,</hi> and leaving miſerable <hi>Tomazo</hi>
behind, without either Money or Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
who in two days after was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
and in that bleſs'd condition
committed to Goal. There he found
ſeveral other <hi>Engliſh</hi> People, whoſe
Crimes were only their acquaintance
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56677:43"/>
with the Gentleman that had kill'd the
<hi>Gount;</hi> which Gentlemans Name (the
ſequel of the Story ſo requiring) is to
be henceforward <hi>Don Pedro Perguelio.</hi>
But ſuch was the kindneſs of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Juſtice, that when the Search was over,
all the Pris'ners were brought before
the Court, where nothing appearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, they were all diſcharg'd.
Had not <hi>Tomazo</hi> had a wonderful Love
for the Light of the Sun, it had been all
one for him to have confeſs'd the Fact
and been hang'd, as to ſtarve for want
of mouldy Cruſts: Such were the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
perſecutions of a hungry Stomack,
under which <hi>Tomazo</hi> pin'd and waſted
at that time. But, if it had not been
for theſe bleſſed <hi>Butts,</hi> of which you
ſhall meet with anow, before the Story
concludes, poor <hi>Tomazo</hi> had been half
worm-eaten by this; but then I ſay, it
ſo fell out one day, as <hi>Tomazo</hi> was
walking upon the Parade among the
Soldiers, for his inclinations were always
Martial, a certain <hi>Captain,</hi> whoſe Name
was <hi>Don Pedro del Viejo Castello,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<hi>Tomazo,</hi> by his Habit, to be a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56677:43"/>
Forreigner, ask'd him his Country; to
which <hi>Tomazo</hi> reply'd, of <hi>England;</hi> for
which the Captain liking him much the
better, perſwaded him to liſt himſelf in
his Company, which lay then at <hi>Puerto
Ferrara,</hi> promiſing him due payment of
his Wages, which came to three half-pence
a day; but withal by his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
giving <hi>Tomazo</hi> to underſtand that
there might be ſome hopes of advance,
and better uſage for an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi>
then for the riffraff of the Country.
The Offer, conſidering the nick of time,
was as welcome to <hi>Tomazo,</hi> as Rain to
the parch'd Earth, he having been a
Stranger to all ſort of Suſtenance for
ſome time. So that now being advanc'd
on a ſudden from the <hi>Grave,</hi> to be a
Gentleman Soldier, he again reſumes
his forſak'n Title of <hi>Don,</hi> and marches
away in ſtate to his new Quarters at
<hi>Puerto Ferrara.</hi> There he liv'd about
three quarters of a year, upon his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
allowance, and the augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of a pound of Bread a day; at
the end of which term, the Garriſon was
in a moſt violent manner beſieg'd by the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56677:44"/>
               <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> with whom the Beſieg'd
had many Encounters; in one of which
the Collonel of <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s Regiment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
kill'd, <hi>Don Pedro del Viejo Castello</hi>
ſucceeded him in the employment:
who not forgetting <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> in his
advancement, whoſe courage and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
had very much won his Heart,
took ſuch a ſpecial care of him, that he
rais'd his Pay from three half-pence to
four pence, and after that, for ſome
works of ſuper-arrogation that <hi>Don To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>
perform'd, from four pence to
eight pence a day. About which time
the Beſiegers drew off, leaving all their
Trenches in good order, and retreated
home for ſome time; which gave the
Town both leiſure and opportunity to
recruit. During this Calm, the reſt of
the Soldiers, who had recover'd their
Spirits, envying <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and the great eſteem which his
Collonel had for him, enter'd into Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals
and Conſultations among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to contrive his ruine; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no ſucceſs in their <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Plots, a
Brace of the Conſpirators undertook
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56677:44"/>
to attaque him by main force; and in
purſuance of their deſign, one evening,
at the turning of a Corner, ſet upon him
with that violence, that <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>
was very ſeverely wounded; but having
recover'd himſelf, he drew forth a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol,
and ſhot one of his Aſſailors, who
ſoon after dy'd of his hurts: and while
he was in purſuit of the other, a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
came in to his aſſiſtance, who took
the other, and ſecur'd him upon the
Guard. Nevertheleſs, upon the death of
the firſt Aggreſſor, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> was
try'd by a Counſel of War; where, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a full examination of the Fact, <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> was acquitted with great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe,
and the other Aſſailant that was
taken, both degraded and caſhier'd.
This Exploit made <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> more
famous then before, and more eſteem'd
and redoubted in the Garriſon. So that
when the Enemies return'd again, and
renew'd their Attacques upon the
Town with that fury, that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
began to be apprehenſive of the
loſs of the Place, ſeveral of the better
ſort deliver'd their Jewels to a very
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56677:45"/>
conſiderable value to the cuſtody of
<hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> the better to ſecure 'em
upon the ſurrender of the Town. Which
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> no longer, after ſeveral rude Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults,
able to hold out, yielded upon
honourable Conditions, and ſo the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Garriſon march'd forth, and as one
of the Number, <hi>Don Tomazo.</hi> Who
now poſſeſs'd of ſo fair a Booty, and
knowing the danger of Delays, went
to his Collonel for a Paſſ-port. The
Collonel, unwilling to part with <hi>Tomazo,</hi>
promis'd to advance him to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
and to make his Fortune, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
he would ſtay in his Service. But
<hi>Tomazo,</hi> who had an unknown Fortune
within the compaſs of his Breeches, gave
thoſe preſſing Arguments for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
to his Collonel, and preſs'd him
ſo home, that at length vanquiſh'd by
Importunity the Collonel granted him
his Paſs; by vertue of which <hi>Don To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>
poſted away for <hi>Ligorn,</hi> as faſt as
his Legs would carry him, and there
embarqu'd for <hi>Scanderoon,</hi> whither, he
was inform'd, ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen
had taken Shipping about fourteen
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56677:45"/>
days before, with a reſolution to viſit
<hi>Grand Cairo.</hi> When he came to <hi>Scande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roon,</hi>
upon enquiry, by all deſcriptions
he gueſt them to be the Perſons that
had left him to his ſhifts at <hi>Madrid,</hi>
which was the reaſon he was not very
ſollicitous to follow them. At <hi>Scande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roon</hi>
therefore he ſtay'd, till upon the
ſale of ſome of his Jewels to a <hi>Jew</hi> that
was bound for <hi>Ligorn,</hi> he was inform'd
by his Landlady, an <hi>Engliſh-woman,</hi> that
that there was an expreſs come with
Orders to apprehend him. For the <hi>Jew</hi>
coming to <hi>Ligorn,</hi> preſently offers his
new Purchaſe to ſale, and, as the Devil
and ill luck would have it, to a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
nearly related to the very Perſon
from whom <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> had receiv'd
them, who had alſo particular order
from his Relation, to ſeize all ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
as ſhould expoſe any ſuch ſort of
Jewels to ſale, of which he had ſent a
particular deſcription. So that the <hi>Jew</hi>
being queſtion'd about the Jewels, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
againſt his Chapman, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
where he was. Thereupon <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> thought it high time to ſhift
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56677:46"/>
his Quarters, and poſts away with all
imaginable ſpeed for <hi>Grand Cairo;</hi>
where if a Man do but alter his Habit,
'tis impoſſible to find him out. To which
purpoſe he puts on the diſguiſe of a
<hi>Turk,</hi> and in that dreſs one day met
with his old Fellow-Traveller, <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro
Perguelio,</hi> who admir'd to find <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> in ſuch a Mahometan Garb;
but being acquainted in few words with
the occaſion, he receiv'd ample ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
more eſpecially when <hi>Don To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>
farther told him, that at that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from his Country, he could in
that Heatheniſh City command a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pound. Which was at that time
no Rodomantado, in regard the Jewels
were worth above four times the value.
Certainly there can be no greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in this World, then for one diſtreſs'd
Guſman to meet another of the ſame
Order fluſh in the Trophies of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
project; Guſmans being the only
relict of the Golden Age that have all
things in common; ſo that if one has
it, the reſt never want. So that it is but
reaſon that the Purſes of Fools ſhould
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56677:46"/>
pay Tribute for the maintenance of
ſuch a noble Generoſity. <hi>Don Pedro</hi>
was upon his laſt Legs, when the happy
accident to meet a Member of the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
ſo richly laden, made his Heart
dance in his Breaſt without a Violin.
On the other ſide, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
that it had not been ſo much the
ill huſbandry of <hi>Don Pedro</hi> which had
brought him ſo low, but a generous
Charity to two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen his
Comrades, who dy'd there of the
Plague, the Expences of whoſe Sickneſs,
together with their Funeral Charges,
had exhauſted him to a very ſmall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder.
So that as if the two decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Gentlemen had left <hi>Don Pedro</hi>
the Executor of their gratitude, from
thence forward <hi>Don Pedro</hi> and <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> enter'd into an inviolable
League as well offenſive as defenſive,
in ſo much that though they were two
Bodies, there were the ſame thoughts
and the ſame mind in both, and an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
force now manag'd all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:56677:47"/>
               <hi>Grand Cairo</hi> is a City famous for its
ſituation, and the variety of Pleaſures
it affords all Perſons ſo well able to
purchaſe 'em as then <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> was;
who reſolving to know the difference
between three half-pence a day, and
the ſplendor of unlimited plenty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with his friend to debarr them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of no freedom or recreation
which Money could command in the
greateſt Mart of the World. But as the
Sea it ſelf would dry up, without the
continual ſupply of ſwelling Rivers, ſo
it was impoſſible for <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s unreple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
Bag, had it been as deep as <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gils</hi>
Paſſage to Hell, to anſwer the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
of a Brace of <hi>Scattergoods,</hi>
that thought it would never be ev'ning:
till at length their inconſiderate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeneſs
having reduc'd their lean Bank
to the low ebb of not above a hundred
and fifty Pounds, Repentance ſtept in,
and put them in mind of the calamities
of Poverty, a very unſucceſsful remedy
to cure the Surfeits of Exceſs, among
the pitileſs Adorers of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they began to think of a new
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56677:47"/>
Ramble; and underſtanding that there
was a Caravan of 800 Paſſengers ready
to depart for <hi>India,</hi> both the <hi>Dons</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree'd
to make a part of the Company.
But the ſeaſon of the year for paſſing
the ſandy Deſerts proving more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous
then uſually, gave them leiſure
enough to ſpend a hundred and twenty
Pound out of their low Stock, (for the
curſes of the credulous <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had
by this time taken their deſir'd effect)
ſo that they perceiving no more then
thirty Pound remaining, alter'd both
their Reſolutions and their Habits, and
embarqu'd from <hi>Scanderoon</hi> for <hi>Genoa,</hi>
where they continu'd fourteen Months,
to the total conſumption of all the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi>
Booty. Then it was that Neceſſity
put <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> to employ the Talents
of his Youth, to which purpoſe he made
Love to a <hi>Genoeſe Widow,</hi> over whoſe
Affections in a ſhort time he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
a Conqueſt, that very fairly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
both his own and his Friends Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations.
But having made that Poſt
too warm by debauching the Woman,
getting her with Child, and waſting
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56677:48"/>
her Fortunes, they departed <hi>incognito</hi>
in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man of War, that brought
them ſafe to <hi>Cadiz.</hi> Where they behav'd
themſelves ſo well, that the Merchants
gave them daily invitations, and were
very free in all manner of accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
But one day among the reſt, <hi>Don
Tomazo,</hi> to retaliate the Kindneſſes they
had both receiv'd, (for true Guſmans
never mind Morality) propos'd to his
Friend <hi>Don Pedro</hi> a Deſign, which had
it taken effect, would have made them
Maſters of a new Fortune to the value of
above five hunder'd Pound. But it ſo
happen'd, that as they were walking
upon the <hi>Beach,</hi> in a deep Conſultation
about the moſt compendious and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
way to proceed in their attempt,
not minding their way, they were ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl'd
about a League from the Town,
where they were overtaken by three
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen, who were in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
of eight Land Pirates, for a Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Murder they had committed the
night before upon the Perſon of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Lucie</hi> Eſq;. Theſe Gentlemen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
their aſſiſtance, which they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56677:48"/>
promis'd and joyn'd in the Purſuit.
After a chaſe of four hours they found
one of the Criminals ſitting upon a
Sand-hill, who pretended himſelf half
dead. This crafty Devil ſate there as a
Decoy, having planted his other ſeven
Confederates under the Sand, whence
they were all ready to riſe with Piſtols
and Stilletoo's if occaſion requir'd; as
indeed it moſt unfortunately fell out.
For the Gentlemen eagerly falling to
ſearch and examine the ſingle Picka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roon,
he preſently gave the watch-word
to the reſt, who preſently riſing from
their Ambuſcado, fell upon the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
not a little ſurpriz'd at their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and their Inſtruments of death,
with that violent fury, that one of
them was kill'd outright, having receiv'd
near twenty ſtabs with a Stilletto, and
the other two ſo wounded, that they
were left for dead. <hi>Tomazo</hi> was ſhot in
the Back and Shoulder, and <hi>Don Pedro</hi>
prick'd in five or ſix places with a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Tuck, and both convey'd by the
Victors among the great Sand-hills. The
other two, who were left for dead,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56677:49"/>
made ſuch hideous out-cries, through
the extremity of their Pain, that a
<hi>Spaniard</hi> fiſhing not far from the Shoar,
came and took them into his Boat. <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had the good
luck to taſt of the Free-booters mercy,
who very carefully dreſs'd their
Wounds, as if natural inſtinct had
prompted them to be kind to Perſons
that liv'd upon the ſpoil as they did;
and when they were in a hopeful way
of recovery, perſwaded them to enter
in their Society, and to run the riſco
of their Fortune: which there was a
neceſſity for the two <hi>Dons</hi> ſeemingly to
condeſcend to. Nor was it long after
the compleating of their Cures, before
thoſe Sons of Rapine had cut them out
an Employment. For thoſe Miſcreants
hearing of a parcel of Merchants that
were to paſs by their Territories, ſet
the two <hi>Dons</hi> to guard a Paſs upon
the Road to <hi>Madrid,</hi> which was conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for an Eſcape if need requir'd,
while the Maſter-Rogues, having met
with the unfortunate Merchants, rob'd
them of their Goods and Money to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56677:49"/>
the value of ſix thouſand Pounds Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
of which they gave a reaſonable
proportion, according to the juſtice of
Thieves one among another; promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
that the next time they ſhould
be both equally concern'd. From thence
they made to their Sanctuary among
the Sand-hills; a Place which did not
afford thoſe delights to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants
that their Hearts panted after
when their Pockets were full. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to make their Eſcape in the night;
which an odd accident much facilitated
to their advantage. For one night a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the reſt, which prov'd darker
then ordinary, one of the Pickaroons
being upon the Watch, certain flaſhes
of combuſtible Meteors appearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Sand-hills, ſo terrifi'd the
guilty Sentinel, that he awak'd his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
who believing the Country
was riſen upon 'em, and hearing <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> affirm withal,
that they had heard the Voices of
ſtrange People, put the villanous crew
into ſuch a Conſternation, that for their
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56677:50"/>
better ſecurity, they concluded to march
off ſeveral ways by couples, having
appointed a Rendezvous when the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
was over. The two <hi>Dons</hi> keeping
together, ſteer'd directly for <hi>Cadiz,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
follow'd by two more of the Gang
aloof off. Upon the way they met with
two of their old acquaintance in the
Town, with whom they preſently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to pillage the two Pickaroons
that came behind, which they did, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them ſorely maim'd and beaten
upon the place, and ſo with light Hearts
and heavy Purſes continu'd their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to <hi>Cadiz:</hi> where being arriv'd,
they were entertain'd with great joy
by their former Correſpondents. Being
thus got together among their Friends,
the main diſcourſe of the Company was
about two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen that had
been moſt barbarouſly us'd by eight
Thieves, and of two other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
that were gone away with the
Robbers. Thereupon <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
firſt made enquiry how the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
did, and underſtanding they
were ſafe and well, began to relate the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56677:50"/>
whole Story, confeſſing himſelf and
<hi>Don Pedro</hi> to be the two loſt Sheep;
and after that gave them an account of
the laſt Robbery. Which happen'd not
a little to their diſadvantage; for one
of the Merchants that had been rob'd
being then in company, ſpar'd not to
bellow forth his Loſſes and his Uſage;
inſomuch that the two <hi>Dons</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious,
that they had about them ſome
of the Goods which the Merchant had
deſcrib'd, and unwilling to run the riſco
of a diſcovery, thought it very condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to their future ſafety to refund
what the Merchant laid claim to, and to
put the reſt into the Hands of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
who promis'd them an ample
recompence for their fidelity; but were
never ſo good as their words. Which
coſt one of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Merchants, by
way of revenge, a Cornuting; <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> having enter'd into a League
of Familiarity with his Wife, to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of a very comfortable ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
for himſelf and his Friend while
they continu'd in the Town. At length,
perceiving no more good to be done
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56677:51"/>
there, and finding ſeveral Ships bound
for <hi>England,</hi> they embarqu'd for the
Land of their Nativity in one, which by
the Maſters ill conduct, had the ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to be caſt away; ſo that there had
been an end of all the Ships company,
and the two young Guſmans had been
coffin'd in ſome Sea-Monſters Belly, had
not a <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſel been ſo kind as to
ſend out their Boat, and ſave all the
Men, whom they carry'd along with
them to <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> A Place to which
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> were both
abſolute Strangers. But finding ſeveral
<hi>Engliſh</hi> there, they told their Tale ſo
ſmoothly, that they found very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate
entertainment among their
Countrymen. During which leiſure
time, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> having made his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
with a Burger's Wife, had ſoon
wheedl'd the Loving Soul out of three
hunder'd Guilders, which amounted to
near thirty Pound <hi>Engliſh.</hi> With this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
the two <hi>Dons</hi> having pick'd up and
joyn'd themſelves in confederacy with
two more <hi>Spaniards</hi> of the ſame Order,
<hi>Philippo de Mexico,</hi> and <hi>Gulielmo Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feire,</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:56677:51"/>
fell to the National Cheat of Coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
wherein, after they had cut their
own Stamps, they were ſo ſucceſsful, that
in two months time they had fill'd all
<hi>Amsterdam</hi> ſo full of double Stivers,
compos'd of three parts Copper, blanch'd
with Arſenick, and one Third Silver,
that there was hardly any other Money
ſtirring among the <hi>Butter-boxes.</hi> By
which piece of dangerous Induſtry, they
advanc'd their Stock to twelve hunder'd
pound Sterling. All which being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſider'd by the four Engineers,
they forſook <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and retir'd
with their Bank into <hi>Zeland.</hi> Where
they were no ſooner arriv'd, but the
twelve hunder'd Pound had ſo inſpir'd
them with high thoughts, that then
little gains were look'd upon as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and nothing would ſerve leſs
then ten thouſand Pound apiece. For
the raiſing of which Princely Sum
there was a general conſultation of all
four Heads; wherein it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that <hi>Doublon</hi> Stamps, <hi>Ducatoon</hi>
Stamps, and all ſorts of Stamps for <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Gold ſhould be forthwith prepar'd;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56677:52"/>
but the Metal could not be fix'd, till
near four hundred Pound of the main
Stock was embezel'd in Experiments,
and neceſſary Expences. But then, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
loth ſuch Men of Art and Induſtry
ſhould lye any longer idle, found them
out a Compoſition to their Hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
conſiſting of one Third Copper,
artificially tinctur'd with Yellow, one
half Third Gold, and half Third Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and one Third ſuper-fine Silver. Of
which Metal they made about 2000 <hi>l.</hi>
according to their modeſt computation,
and the Conſcience they us'd in putting
them off. Which that they might do
with the more facility and ſpeed, they
dealt with all Perſons, bought the beſt
Commodities, and gave the largeſt
Rates. And for the better management
of the Affair, every Confederate had
his particular employment aſſign'd him.
<hi>Philip de Mexico,</hi> and <hi>Gulielmo Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feire,</hi>
were to reſide at <hi>Middleburgh</hi> and
prepare the Coyn; <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was the
Merchant that bought the Goods, and
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> the Factor, who reſided at
<hi>Gaunt,</hi> whither all Commodities were
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56677:52"/>
ſent, and immediately expos'd to ſale,
or tranſported to Places more ſecure.
But this Trade laſted not long: For
<hi>Philip de Mexico</hi> being a Perſon inclin'd
to all ſorts of debauchery, one day gave
a certain Female, that had careſs'd him
with more then ordinary civilities, one
of his counterfeit Pieces, who having
a ſudden occaſion for Money, as Women
of that Profeſſion are ſeldom Hoarders,
carry'd the Piece to exchange for Silver
with a Goldſmith, who had forfeited his
judgment by being bitten with about
30 Pieces of the ſame nature before.
Whoſe revenge exaſperating him to a
ſtrict examination of the Woman, ſhe
was conſtrain'd to diſcover where ſhe
had it; and then to go along with the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of the City, and ſhew them <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>'s
Lodging, who was immedately ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
and apprehended with all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
and Inſtruments about him, and,
without enquiry after farther proof,
committed to Priſon. This apparent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
and the great alarum it gave the
whole City, was notice ſufficient for
<hi>Don Pedro</hi> and <hi>Gulielmo</hi> to ſhift for
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56677:53"/>
themſelves, who made all imaginable
haſt to <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> to whom they rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the doleful diſaſter, and the ſad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of their interrupted Commerce.
Thereupon <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> ſold off all his
Merchandize, and having quarter'd his
Companions in a Village near to <hi>Gaunt,</hi>
he went himſelf to <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> with an
intention to uſe all his endeavours to
help <hi>Philip</hi> out of the Briars. But by that
time he had been twice with <hi>Philip</hi> in
the Priſon, and had order'd all things
ready for his Eſcape, there came in the
middle of the night ſeveral of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of the Town to ſeize <hi>Tomazo,</hi> upon
information given to the <hi>Heers</hi> againſt
him by <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf, who not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was in <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s power to
bring him off, was in hopes, by an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
confeſſion, and the conviction of
<hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> to ſave his own Bacon. But
his treachery did him no kindneſs. For
he wanted Money, without which there
is nothing to be done in that, nor in any
other part of the World. On the other
ſide <hi>Tomazo</hi> had plenty, and with his
Golden Showers ſo mollifi'd the Goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56677:53"/>
Daughter, that ſhe not only brought
him an Iron Inſtrument to dig his way
through the Wall, a Rope to let him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
down, and a Boat to receive him,
but accompany'd him her none tender
ſelf, leaving Father and Mother for the
ſweet ſatisfaction of her fleſhly appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.
Being both ſafe in the Boat, away
ſail'd <hi>Feliciano</hi> and his <hi>Feliciana</hi> to
<hi>Fluſhing,</hi> and from thence without any
Proviſion put to Sea, where they drave,
almoſt ſtarv'd to death, upon the Wide
Ocean, till Fortune threw them at
length upon the Coaſt of <hi>Flanders;</hi> at
what time they quitted the Boat, and
travel'd the Country by Land, like a
Tinker and his Doxey, till they came to
<hi>Don Pedro</hi> and <hi>Gulielmo,</hi> to whom <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> gave an account of the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<hi>Philip</hi> would have done him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital
of his pains and friendly Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Nor was it long after that we heard
of poor <hi>Philips</hi> being tranſported to the
other World in a Caldron of boyling
Oyl, according to the Sentence of his
Judges; which ſort of terrible Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did not little ſtartle the reſt of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56677:54"/>
Confederates, yet not ſo as altogether
to daunt 'em in the progreſs of their
profeſſion. For <hi>Don Tomazo, Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro,
Gulielmo,</hi> and the Goalers kind
Daughter, whoſe Name was <hi>Mariana,</hi>
removing to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> they fell again in
that Place to their <hi>Zeland</hi> ſport, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to hazard t'other Caldron; where,
after they had made a conſiderable
quantity of Coyn, they took their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Stations and Employments of
Merchandizing, till all their Pieces were
gone. Which good ſucceſs encourag'd
them to go on afreſh. But ſo it fell out,
that <hi>Mariana,</hi> who had alter'd her Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
and went for a <hi>Dutch Minheir,</hi> and
<hi>Gulielmo,</hi> going one day to Court to
buy Horſes of Count <hi>Monterey</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
were ſpy'd by a Perſon of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
of whom they had purchas'd other
Horſes before, and pay'd him two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
Piſtols of Coyn out of their own
Mint. This ſame Perſon was a certain
<hi>Count,</hi> who made ſuch a noiſe, that the
whole Court was alarum'd, the Parties
accus'd were both apprehended, and
ſent to eat the Bread of affliction in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56677:54"/>
Lobbſ-pound; where they endur'd
no ſmall torment both of Body and
Mind; eſpecially <hi>Mariana,</hi> whoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
was the greater for want of her
dear <hi>Don Tomazo.</hi> But neither were his
Love nor his Jealouſie ſo importunate
nor ſo vehement at that time, but that
he was content rather to truſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi>
with his Miſtreſs, then venture his
Carcaſs for them, as he had done for
<hi>Philip.</hi> A piece of ingratitude which his
Conſcience and Self-preſervation were
forc'd to diſpenſe with at that time, in
regard he was too well known to be
their Sollicitor. Which was the reaſon
that both the wary <hi>Dons</hi> ſtole private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
away for <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> there to attend
the Iſſue of <hi>Gulielmo</hi>'s and <hi>Mariana</hi>'s
Impriſonment; who in a ſhort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
were both convicted by their own
Confeſſions, and forc'd to evaporate
their Souls in boyling Oyl, as <hi>Philip</hi> had
done; by an Infernal Torment in this,
the better to prepare them for the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuminous
Tan-pits of the other World.
The news of which helliſh Execution
reaching the Ears of the two <hi>Dons</hi> at
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56677:55"/>
               <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the very thoughts of <hi>Dutch</hi>
and <hi>Flemiſh Crucibles</hi> ſo cool'd their
courages, that for the future they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
utterly to abandon the <hi>Melting</hi>
Trade. And believing that Time would
obliterate the memory of theſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies,
they reſolv'd to employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in Travel, as they did through
moſt Parts of <hi>France.</hi> But returning
for <hi>Calice,</hi> with an intention to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque
for <hi>England,</hi> the boyling Oyl
had ſo perfum'd thoſe Parts, that not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to endure the ſcent, they retreated
to <hi>Diepe,</hi> from whence they arriv'd ſafe
and ſound at <hi>Rye</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> where when
they came to caſt up their Accounts,
they found themſelves reduc'd to 500 <hi>l.</hi>
apiece; a ſound Foundation, could they
have had the patience to build upon it
like either <hi>Suttons</hi> or old <hi>Audleys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they had no skill in Grazing, or
Maulting, or ſetting up of Brew-houſes,
by which they had known as many ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd
as rais'd: They were for the quick
diſpatch: They were for drink and be
rich: They look'd upon themſelves like
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56677:55"/>
two Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and all the World
beſide as <hi>Aegyptians;</hi> from whom they
thought it no crime to borrow in their
neceſſity. And Guſmans call that Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
when they want Fewel to feed
the heat of their Prodigality.</p>
            <p>The inſeparable <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> and
<hi>Don Pedro</hi> being thus return'd into
their Native Country, like two Sons of
<hi>Priam, Per varios caſus, per tot diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina
Rerum,</hi> made haſt to <hi>London,</hi> the
Grand Receptacle of all the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
Virtuoſo's in Guſmanry, where
they made it their buſineſs to repair
the loſs they had ſuſtain'd by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyling
of their <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Companions.
Nor was it long before they had found
out a parcel of Projectors as fit for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treague
as themſelves, to whom they
communicated a certain Conundrum,
which they had juſt coddl'd in their
continually working Brains; the ſum
and ſhape of which piece of Midwifery
was this: That ſix Perſons ſhould lay
down 300 <hi>l.</hi> apiece to fit out a Privateer
to Sea; a Gudgeon quickly ſwallow'd
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56677:56"/>
among Perſons that took all for Fiſh
that came to Net. Thereupon there
was a Perſon employ'd to go to <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk</hi>
to buy a Veſſel, and to fit and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
her out to Sea. They that made the
Grand-Councel at <hi>London</hi> were to pick
up Men, and to have them ready to go
aboard, when the Veſſel ſhould arrive
upon the Coaſt of <hi>England;</hi> wherein
the concording Guſmans were ſo pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,
(for the Sinews of their War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to waſt) that the Men being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
away in Boats, the little <hi>Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nought</hi>
ſet forward in purſuit of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
which was no leſs then the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Deſtruction of the whole <hi>Guiney</hi>
Trade. See here the difference between
a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and an <hi>Engliſh Guſman;</hi> the
one purſuing a poor hungry Plot upon
his penurious Maſters Bread and Cheeſe;
the other deſigning to graſp the Riches
of the fourth part of the World by the
Ruine of a National Commerce.</p>
            <p>Thus with a firm belief that they
ſhould have ballaſted their Ship with
Duſt-Ore, they hois'd their Sails; but
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56677:56"/>
being driven by moſt violent Storms
upon the Coaſts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> they loſt
both their Veſſel and all their Hopes;
no other good luck attending that Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
but only that of ſaving the Men,
which were in number above three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
who dividing into ſmall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
for convenience of Travel, took
ſeveral ways to ſeek for new employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
by which means the Coaſt of
<hi>Guiney</hi> ſcap'd a moſt deſperate ſcowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the <hi>African</hi> Company had a
very great deliverance. <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> and
<hi>Don Pedro,</hi> ſo lately <hi>Men,</hi> though now
but <hi>Mice,</hi> kept ſtill together Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in miſery, and coming to <hi>Dublin,</hi> by
the inſtigation of pure neceſſity, (a thing
which the moroſe Law never conſiders)
fell to their old Trade, which was to
counterfeit <hi>Guineys,</hi> and broad Pieces
of Gold. Which after they had done,
and carry'd on about two Months, ſome
as good and as expert at the ſport as
themſelves, not enduring interlopers to
their own prejudice, trac'd 'em out, and
found their Quarters. Where they gave
the <hi>Dons</hi> very courteouſly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56677:57"/>
that that ſmall City was already
too well ſtock'd with Gravers of the
Kings Image, and therefore deſir'd the
Right Worſhipful Copper-ſmiths to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
leſt worſe befel them. Upon which
kind advice the two <hi>Dons</hi> took ſhipping
for <hi>Bristol,</hi> a Place much more fit for
their purpoſe. There, being loth to draw
Bills, and break the bulk of their <hi>London</hi>
Stock, with a poor inconſiderable Bank
of thirty Shillings, of which fifteen were
Mill'd, they began again. Thoſe fifteen
Mill'd Shillings did the <hi>Two Dons</hi>
Knights Service; for being double guilt,
and in-laid with Scepters, they march'd
off currantly. Upon which Foundation
they wrought ſo long with eaſe and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
expence, till they had well lin'd their
Pockets, were well mounted, and in a
good condition to ramble.</p>
            <p>From thence, well knowing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of ſtaying too long in a place, they
rode to <hi>Glocester.</hi> Where after they had
made up near three hunder'd and fifty
of their own St. <hi>Martins</hi> Ware, they
were diſturb'd by an officious Rumor,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56677:57"/>
and forc'd to ride the Country. During
which Journey of pleaſure, in exchange
either for good Mony or Commodities,
they put out all their illegitimate Pieces
to Nurſe. After which, like a little run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Peſtilence, they went to infect the
City of <hi>Worceſter.</hi> There the Two <hi>Dons</hi>
met accidentally with four other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the ſame profeſſion; who being
purſu'd by the Country, were apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in their Company. At what time
one of the Strangers, to prevent the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
of a Search, convey'd under the
Table into <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s hands a certain Bag
both large and weighty. <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>
was with Child to know the Contents,
and therefore being got to his Lodging,
his dear <hi>Pylades</hi> and he made bold to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the Bag; in which they found ſix Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to as many Gentlemen in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Counties, a Note of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sum of Money left with an Inn-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
at <hi>Bridgenorth,</hi> and 220 falſe Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
moſt artificially and elaborately
order'd. The Letters they open'd, took
Copies, and ſeal'd up again; having found
by the Contents how Affairs ſtood with
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56677:58"/>
the Gentlemen to whom they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.
Thus fortunately provided <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> departed forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
and galloping tantivy to <hi>Bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north,</hi>
they receiv'd 337 <hi>l.</hi> from the Inn-keeper.
From thence they took their
Rounds to viſit the ſix Gentlemen, who
being all Perſons of valuable Eſtates,
and fearing to run the bloody hazard
of having their ſpotleſs Reputations
brought upon ſo dangerous a Stage, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the delivery of the Letters, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the misfortune that attended
the Perſons from whom they came, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
bled their fifty Pound apiece for
an obligation of Secrecy. The Two <hi>Dons</hi>
having thus made the beſt of their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
left the Gentlemen for that time, and
took a Ramble for <hi>Stourbridge,</hi> where
being forc'd to continue, by reaſon of an
Accident that befel <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s Horſe,
they liv'd to the height of their Eſtates.
During which demorage, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s
behaviour (always taking among the
tender Sex) had infus'd ſuch a paſſion
into the Heart of a Gentlewoman in the
Town, who wanted neither Wit nor
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56677:58"/>
Caution to manage her amorous Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
that partly out of gratitude,
partly for profit, (for he ſeldom lov'd
but for his advantage) partly for
pleaſure, his friend and he were forc'd
to encamp in that Place much longer
then they intended, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
for a <hi>German,</hi> and humouring
that pretence with broken <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
All that while <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> loſt no
time in improving the advantage of
his Amours, nor ſpar'd for any ſort of
Careſſes which he thought were proper
to entertain ſo kind and bountiful a
Lady. But that Poſt growing too hot,
through the jealouſies and ſuſpitions
conceiv'd of <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> and <hi>Don
Pedro,</hi> in regard of the high rate
they liv'd at, the two Sparks were
forc'd to remove; though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
taking leave of the young Lady;
who was ſo concern'd for the loſs of
her dear <hi>German</hi>'s ſociety, that the
magnetick Vertue of his Embraces had
almoſt engag'd her in a reſolution to
be the Companion of his Fortunes.
But <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> not deſiring to travel
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56677:59"/>
with the expenſive Moleſtations and
Inconveniences of Female Luggage,
diverted her affectionate humour with
ſuch powerful Arguments, that at
length they parted, though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome Briny Deluges that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow'd
the ſorrowful Ladies Roſie
Cheeks. <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> having thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingag'd
himſelf from the Labyrinths
of Love, after a prodigal waſt of his
Venerial Ammunition, ſet forward,
with his other ſelf <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
where they ranted with a profuſe
pomp and vain-glory for about half a
year, till finding their Exchequer grow
low, they began to think it time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit.
Neither was it for ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
high-ſoaring Guſmans as they
to play at ordinary Games; whoſe
prodigality was not to be ſupply'd by
the dipping of Country Squires, or the
little Cheats of <hi>high and low Fullums.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At that time the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>
were at Daggers drawing; and they
underſtanding that there was a Fleet
of <hi>Holland</hi> Merchant-men in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56677:59"/>
of <hi>Thames,</hi> very richly laden, to
the value of eight hunder'd thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pound, all outward bound, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Convoy of two Men of War,
of 40 Guns apiece, and very well
mann'd, concluded upon a deſign to
ſurprize theſe Ships and their Convoy,
and to make them Prize, by vertue of
a <hi>French</hi> Commiſſion, with which they
were already furniſh'd. Firſt then in
order to this attempt, by their acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with ſome of thoſe Sea-men,
who had been fellow-ſufferers with
them in their intended Voyage to the
Coaſt of <hi>Guiney,</hi> they rais'd a very
conſiderable number of Men, which
by the leave of the Captains of the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Men of War were to be put
aboard their Ships, under pretence of
being rais'd as Recruits by certain Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
employ'd from <hi>Holland</hi> for that
purpoſe. And it ſo happen'd that <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>'s
great diligence had found out a
parcel of ſuch Sons of Neceſſity, as
had not only <hi>Dutch</hi> Commiſſions, but
as good a Will to the Deſign as himſelf.
Theſe Perſons treated with the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56677:60"/>
Captains for the carrying over ſo
many Men for the Service of the States,
which the Captains were very willing
to undertake for the good of their
Country. So that in two days time,
the whole Fleet lying at <hi>Graveſend,</hi>
the Major part of the Men were ſent
aboard, in the Habit of new rais'd
Men, but all reſolute Sea-Tories, and
privately well arm'd with Poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards
and Piſtols. Theſe were to have
been the fatal Inſtruments of the grand
Surprize. For it being the cuſtom at
Sea to divide the Ships Company into
three parts, that make three Watches,
of which one is to be always upon the
Deck, it was ſo laid, that the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
in the dead of the Night, after they
had ſecur'd the Powder-Rooms, ſhould
run upon the Decks, ſhut down the
Hatches to keep down thoſe that were
below, and cut the Throats of all that
made reſiſtance above. By which
means having got the Command of the
Men of War, they might with eaſe
have commanded the Merchant-men,
and ſo have made for the <hi>French</hi> Ports,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56677:60"/>
where their Commiſſions would have
born them out.</p>
            <p>About two days after the Men were
thus diſpos'd of, the pretended <hi>Dutch</hi>
Officers ſent down about forty large
Trunks, of a prodigious weight, with
particular care to put them aboard in
the night, for fear of meeting with
the Searchers. All which Trunks were
fill'd only with Hey and Bricks, to
poſſeſs the People with a belief of ſome
conſiderable Treaſure, or ſome great
quantity of Arms that might be in
them, to avoid the ſuſpition of Men
whom they ſaw entruſted with ſuch a
ponderous Charge.</p>
            <p>By this time the Wind ſtood fair,
and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Officers were order'd
by the <hi>Dutch Captains</hi> to repair aboard
with the reſt of their Men; in order
whereunto they went all down to
<hi>Graveſend,</hi> where the Officers having
ſent their Men aboard, went themſelves
aſhoar, and in their company <hi>Don To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>
and <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> the Maſter-wheels
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56677:61"/>
of this confounded piece of
Miſchief, under the Notion of Servants
to one that paſs'd for a Lieutenant-Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel.
Thus far things went proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
on, and the Gale of Fortune
blew as fair, as the Wind then favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the Voyage. But the Devil's
i' that thing call'd <hi>Fond Love.</hi> Which
has made me think that the Poets did
ill to couple <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
conſidering how many brave Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Deſigns have prov'd abortive
through the open-heartedneſs of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
Folly. For to the total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of this <hi>Babel</hi>-like ſtructure
of two unwearied Brains, it happen'd
that one of the Men who went laſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
and was to have been a private
Sentinel, was marryed forſooth to a
<hi>Dutch-woman,</hi> who had ſo raviſh'd, or
rather infatuated him, upon the Leave-taking
Night, that, like the hair-brain'd
<hi>Curius,</hi> he could not conceal from his
charming <hi>Fulvia</hi> the great Deſign he
was going upon. Whereupon the
plaguy <hi>Dalilah,</hi> out of a pure affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for her Countrymen, went and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56677:61"/>
diſcover'd the grand Plot to the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Captains, who were at firſt ſtruck with
a ſtrange kind of Terror to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſo near the brink of danger;
but ſoon recollecting themſelves, they
kept their diſcovery cloſe, not making
it known to any but the Officers of the
Ships. After that, having prepar'd all
things for a cloſe Fight, they order'd all
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> which were above to go
under Deck upon pain of death, which
they did all but ſome reſolute Fellows,
who being over-power'd, were beaten,
wounded, and forc'd down. Which
petty Conqueſt being thus obtain'd, and
the fatal <hi>Sinons</hi> ſecur'd in the Bodies of
the two <hi>Trojan Sea-Horſes,</hi> one of the
Captains was ſent aſhoar to entreat the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Officers to come aboard, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the Fleet was ready to ſet Sail.
But thoſe Sons of Guilt and Jealouſie
reading ſomething more then ordinary
in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Captains face, one of them,
with a loud Oath, ſwore, they were
all undone, and was making an offer
to ſhift for himſelf; but the <hi>Dutch</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
rais'd the Town, had ſo beſet the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56677:62"/>
Houſes, that they were apprehended
every Mothers Son, and deliver'd up
to the Magiſtrates, with a general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
againſt them of the Crime,
and of the Deſign they had in hand,
but not a word in the leaſt of the
Men which they had ſecur'd in the two
Veſſels. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Captains having
thus eſcap'd a Danger ten times worſe
than that of <hi>Scylla</hi> or <hi>Charybdis,</hi> weigh
Anchor, and being ſafe arriv'd at their
intended Port, acquaint the Great
<hi>Minheirs</hi> what a Whirl-pool they had
ſo narrowly miſs'd, and deliver'd up all
their Pris'ners to the mercy of the
<hi>Hogen Mogens,</hi> who order'd them to
be ſent to the <hi>Indies</hi> for eight years,
while they that were ſeiz'd at <hi>Graveſend</hi>
were diſcharg'd for want of farther
proſecution, and ſo return'd to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
In which wide Place, neither
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> nor <hi>Don Pedro</hi> durſt
ſhew their Heads, as having not only
ſpent their own ill-got Bank, but run
in debt to defray the Charges, which
you may be ſure the Expences of ſuch
a Deſign would require. Such is the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56677:62"/>
Fate of Guſmanry, ſometimes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
and ſometimes to want Bread.
In which condition the two reduc'd
Projectors were forc'd for a while to
ſit and bite upon the Bridle: Till in
ſome ſhort time, having rais'd ſo much
Money as would pay for their Paſſage
to <hi>Harlem</hi> in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> they
embarqu'd for that Place, where the
two <hi>Dons</hi> prevail'd with a certain Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
to furniſh them with thirty
Pound, for the re-payment whereof
they drew a Bill upon another Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
of their own invention and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
at <hi>London.</hi> Thus ſet up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
they departed for <hi>Amsterdam,</hi>
where they poſſeſs'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with
ſo firm a belief of their being young
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Merchants, who had ſuffer'd Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack;
that they, compaſſionating their
condition, aſſiſted them with Money
and credit to the value of a hunder'd
Pound. Which good ſucceſs in thoſe
two Places made them reſolve to try
how high they could build upon this
ſame odly begun Foundation of the
Worlds opinion. Which is many times
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56677:63"/>
the beginning of a Trade that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
ſeveral to vaſt and real For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
In order to this Deſign, away
they go to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> where they
found an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
newly crept into the World,
ſtruck in with <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> and <hi>Don
Pedro,</hi> who pretended to be of the
ſame Profeſſion; and that they would
ſend for Goods out of <hi>Ireland</hi> with
the next opportunity. Upon which
ſcore the <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant furniſh'd
his two new Partners with Wines and
other Commodities to the value of
400 <hi>l.</hi> which were preſently ſhip'd off
for <hi>Flanders</hi> by the general conſent of
all the three.</p>
            <p>Into that Country the inſeperable
Couple follow'd their Game, and at
<hi>Bruges</hi> ſet up their Staff. There, for
a ſhort Apprentiſhip ſerv'd their turn,
they fell to trade with the Merchants
of the City, and barter'd their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
very fairly for <hi>Iriſh</hi> Goods,
and with good advantage. And
which was more, very honeſtly from
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56677:63"/>
time to time ſent the effects to their
Correſpondent at <hi>Rotterdam;</hi> who by
that Hocus of juſt dealing was ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
with the reality and good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of his two <hi>Iriſh</hi> Chapmen,
that they continu'd trading together
for above a year, in which time he had
furniſh'd them with Goods to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of 3457 <hi>l.</hi> for which the two <hi>Dons</hi>
return'd him ſtill moſt punctually Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
of equal value, to the great
content of the <hi>Rotterdamer,</hi> and the
great Reputation of the two <hi>Engliſh
Guſmans.</hi> Who in this time, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of their Commerce with the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
of <hi>Bruges,</hi> and the great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
which they gave them,
were grown to be as high in the credit
of the City-Merchants, as with their
Correſpondent at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> every
one courting their Cuſtom, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
how deeply they would truſt
'em for their farther encouragement.</p>
            <p>One would have thought this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel
and gainful way of living, the
kindneſs of Strangers, and their own
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56677:64"/>
gratitude, ſhould have oblig'd theſe
two <hi>Dons</hi> to have kept within the
bounds of Reaſon and common Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty.
But there is that Letchery in
ſome Men to triumph in their frauds,
and to be profuſe at the Expences of
other Peoples Purſes, that they cannot
be contented with other Gains then
thoſe that will ſatisfie their Prodigality;
and the toyl of keeping Accompts was
a labour too tedious to their Mercurial
Brains; and therefore they were now
for reaping the Harveſt which they ſaw
ripe for their Sickle. The Sun ſhin'd, and
they muſt make their Hey. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
had fairly promis'd, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to try how far they would be as
good as their words. <hi>Volenti non fit
injuria</hi> was a <hi>Matchiavillian</hi> Maxim
that very much prevail'd upon their
Conſciences, none of the tendereſt at
that time. Thereupon they took up
ſeveral parcels of Goods to the value of
2000 <hi>l.</hi> or upwards; which being ſhip'd
off for <hi>England,</hi> away march'd they
after their Prey; and taking <hi>Ostend,
Newport, Dunkirk, Calice,</hi> and indeed
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56677:64"/>
all the conſiderable Ports between that
and <hi>St. Malo</hi>'s, at the ſame Places, by
vertue of ſeveral counterfeit Bills from
ſeveral Parts, but more particularly from
<hi>Rotterdam</hi> and <hi>Bruges,</hi> they rais'd, all
expences born, an additional Stock of
ready Money, amounting to one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
five hunder'd and ſeven Pounds;
with which recruit they bore away to
the Port of <hi>Exeter,</hi> where the two <hi>Dons</hi>
thought to have found the Ship which
carry'd their Goods. But being arriv'd
there, they underſtood by a Merchant
concern'd in the ſame Ship, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
and ſome of the Company had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
the Veſſel and Goods to <hi>Bayon,</hi> and
had there expos'd them to ſale. Nor was
this all; for the ſame Merchant, keeping a
Correſpondence at <hi>Bruges,</hi> and by the
intelligence he had receiv'd from thence,
concluding <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> and <hi>Don Pedro</hi>
to be the two Perſons complain'd of for
the exploit they had there ſo lately
committed, caus'd them to be both ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
in the Names of his <hi>Flemſh</hi> friends,
to whom he ſent word of the Embargo
which he had laid upon their Perſons.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56677:65"/>
The <hi>Bruges</hi> Merchants had no ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the Information, but they ſent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a Perſon to treat with the two young
Sparks, who being unwilling to loſe time
by lying in Priſon, the worſt place in
nature for Men of their Profeſſion, came
to a ſeaſonable compoſition, and having
to their great grief refunded 1360 <hi>l.</hi>
were preſently diſcharg'd. Happily for
them; for they were no ſooner gone,
but freſh Orders came to the ſame Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
from ſeveral Perſons out of <hi>France</hi>
to detain them upon their accounts.
However, the Birds being flown, there
was an end of that proſecution. The
guilt of the two <hi>Dons</hi> made them wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
jealous of the diligence that would
be us'd to entrap them, and therefore
they made all the haſt they could to
<hi>London,</hi> where they lay ſtill a while,
till they thought the danger over.</p>
            <p>This Terror being paſt, the two <hi>Dons</hi>
fell to new Conſultations, and finding
the ill ſucceſs of Merchandizing, they
reſolv'd to ſet up the old trade of Coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
wherein they were more expert, as
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56677:65"/>
being more ſuitable to their <hi>Genius's.</hi>
In order to the better management of
which Affair, like Men of gravity and
prudence, they conſulted the Statutes
of the Kingdom, by which they found
the counterfeiting of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gold to
be the leaſt dangerous in point of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty.
And therefore having got their
Materials and Confederates, ſuch as bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Goldſmiths and Guilders all in a
readineſs, they fell ſo ſedulouſly to their
buſineſs, that in fourteen days time
they had made as many <hi>Doublons,</hi> and
double <hi>Doublons,</hi> as amounted to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of 3245 <hi>l.</hi> according to the price
of their Mint. Part of theſe Pieces
<hi>Don Pedro</hi> and <hi>Tomazo</hi> undertook to
put off, in the Weſt and Northweſt
Parts of <hi>England.</hi> To which purpoſe
they took their Progreſs well mounted,
genteelly clad, well attended with Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
beſides the travelling Grandeur
of led Horſes. However, they did
not always appear in this Splendor,
but at certain times, and for colour of
ſome great Deſigns; having for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56677:66"/>
of leſſer moment other diſguiſes
and pretences. Among the reſt they
had an eaſie excuſe for their ſtay at
Sea-port Towns, in expectation of
Ships from ſeveral Parts: During
which demorage, it was no difficult
thing to put off thirty or forty of
their Pieces, and then remove to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Place: Neither was <hi>Lyme</hi> in
<hi>Dorſetſhire</hi> the Scene of one of their
meaneſt Exploits.</p>
            <p>In that Place liv'd a Merchant
nearly related to their Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> upon whom they
had a Deſign of no leſs than three or
four hunder'd Pound thick. This
Man was a wary Perſon, and one
that having been often ſcalded, drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Fire; which made the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
much more difficult; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the Reſolution of the two
<hi>Dons</hi> was ſuch, that they reſolv'd
to attempt it, as they did in this
manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:56677:66"/>
               <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> and <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> with
their Servants and Horſes, in great ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
went to <hi>Lime,</hi> where they took up
all the chiefeſt Inns of the Town, <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> (and <hi>Don Proteus</hi> himſelf could
have done no more) having now Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphos'd
himſelf into the Shape of
a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Count, to whom he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the King of <hi>England,</hi> and ſeveral
of the Nobility, had given ſeveral Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and Liberty to buy more, and to
tranſport them at his pleaſure, for the
Service of his own Sovereign. In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of which Affair, he had been
in the adjacent Counties, and had
made ſeveral Purchaſes, which he daily
expected in that Town; and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
come to make Proviſion of Hay,
Corn and Stabling for their Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
till he could have the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
of Shipping them off; inſomuch
that the Country People that came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Market, were forc'd to ſet their
unregarded Beaſts in the Streets, to make
room for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Count's Horſes.
During the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Count's Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
at <hi>Lime,</hi> which was about four
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56677:67"/>
days, he ſends for the Merchant upon
whom he had fix'd his Deſign; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had amus'd him with a Noble
Entertainment, entred into a Diſcourſe
with him about his Horſes, and how
he intended to have them tranſported;
deſiring him, either to aſſiſt him with
his Advice, or elſe himſelf be pleas'd
to hire him ſome Veſſels for that purpoſe.
An Employment which the Merchant
readily undertook, and to that purpoſe,
brought four or five Maſters of Ships to
the Count, with whom his Lordſhip
ſoon agreed for the Paſſage of his nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Cavalry. The next day, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
being preſent, the Count receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an Account from one of his Servants,
who pretended he came from the Horſes,
that they were at ſuch a place; but
that his Agents had bought more Horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
then they had Money to pay for, and
therefore deſir'd the Money might be
ſent them. Preſently the Count, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for his Steward, bid him go, and
fetch as many pieces of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gold, as
would make up the Sum. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought as ſoon, the Count deſir'd
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56677:67"/>
the Merchant to exchange them for Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Which the Merchant undertaking
to do, went home, carries the Gold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with him: and ſending for three
more of his Friends, they all laid their
Heads together, to make tryal of the
pieces; which they did by all the uſual
ways of Touching, Cutting, Weighing,
and the like. But the Mettal was ſo
ſuperexcellently temper'd, that they
could make no other diſcovery, but
that it was abſolutely real; ſo that the
Merchant return'd with the full Change
in Silver, which the Count immediately
deliver'd to one of his Grooms, who
carri'd it away. The next day, the
former Meſſenger returns again to <hi>Lime,</hi>
and tells the Count, that all his Horſes
were ſeiz'd, in regard the Country
People had conſulted together, and
were of Opinion, that the Horſes were
to be tranſported contrary to an Act
of Parliament, and without the King's
leave. At which unexpected news, the
Count was ſeemingly ſtrangely allarm'd
and ſurpriz'd; and in a Paſſion, as
well counterfeited as his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gold,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56677:68"/>
commanded his Groom to make ready
his Horſes, pretending to go in perſon
to diſpute a buſineſs ſo prejudicial to
his grand Affairs. On the other ſide, for
the prevention of all diſturbance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay;
and to ſhew, that he came not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>England</hi> upon a Firſt of <hi>April</hi> Day's
Errant, being as it were come to himſelf,
he deſir'd the Favour of the Merchant,
to ride Poſt to <hi>London,</hi> to give the King
an account of the Abuſe and Scandal
he had ſuffer'd from the Countrey, and
to pray His Majeſties Warrant for the
Releaſe of his Horſes; and in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his trouble, allow'd him one
of his Servants to wait upon him, and
ten Piſtols to bear his Charges, with
aſſurance, that at his Return, he ſhould
find the Count at <hi>Lime.</hi> The Merchant,
as well to oblige a Perſon of ſo much
Honour as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Count, as to
ſerve his Neighbours, who were not a
little diſcompos'd at the loſs they ſhould
ſuſtain by the Count's being ſo rudely
diſappointed, ſet forward with more
then good ſpeed to ſolicit for the Count:
For upon his Arrival at <hi>London,</hi> the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56677:68"/>
Count's Gentleman, who had his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Inſtructions, to prevent the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
going to Court, ſent for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate,
that well underſtood his Lord's
Affairs, who preſently entred an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of 4000 <hi>l.</hi> againſt <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Count's
Embaſſador, and arreſted him as he
was going to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> with a crew of
pretended Officers of his own garbling.
In this Condition they hurry'd the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Merchant to Priſon, as they made
him believe; but indeed to one of their
own Private Haunts, a certain dark Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
Cellar, where they ſo roughly
entertain'd the terrifi'd Stranger, that
to free himſelf out of the Clutches of
ſuch a ſurly ſort of <hi>Rake-ſhames,</hi> he was
forc'd to draw Bills upon his Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondents
in ſeveral places; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
receiv'd, and due intelligence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Count of all Proceedings,
the poor Merchant of <hi>Lime,</hi> who had
by this means moulted a good part of
his gayeſt Feathers, was diſcharg'd out
of Captivity. As for the Count him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and his Retinue, they ſoon quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that Poſt, and having alter'd their
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56677:69"/>
Habits, and chang'd their Horſes, rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up farther up into the Country, not
deeming the Sea-ports proper to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited,
while ſuch Exploits as theſe were
freſh in Memory. So like are theſe
ſort of <hi>Guſmans</hi> to the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who,
when they have devoured the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
of one place, remove into freſh
Accommodation.</p>
            <p>But though they had chang'd their
Horſes, they did not alter their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of buying Horſes. To which
purpoſe, <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> now acting the
part of a Jocky, rather then a <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Count, made it his buſineſs to ride with
a Servant, up and down to Farmers
Houſes, having firſt enquir'd the names
of ſuch Gentlemen as liv'd neareſt
thereabouts, and alſo taken a Proſpect
as far as he could of their Qualities,
their Honours, and their Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>'Tis well known to be the Cuſtom in
many parts of the <hi>Weſt</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> for
many Farmers to breed up Horſes of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56677:69"/>
Fifty, or Sixty Pound a Pair, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of greater Value. Such Horſes
as theſe, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> would often chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
and ſometimes bargain for; but
when the Seller, and the Purchaſer
came to the Point, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> had no
Money which was paſſable, nor was it
his intent it ſhould be ſo; as knowing
well the Humour of thoſe ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which was to raiſe the Country
preſently, to make a thouſand Hubbubs,
and put all the World into Noiſe and
Uproar; whereas a Gentleman having
been ſmitten under the Fifth Rib, will
firſt conſider his own Reputation, and
hold a private Emparlance with his
own Reaſon; of which, ſome are ſo
highly conceited, that they would
not have the World believe, they could
be out-noddl'd, for the half of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.
They obſerve themſelves to be
the great Idols of Wit and Parts, to
which the People offer in the High Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Countrey; but ſhould it once
appear, that their Divinity-ſhips had
once been ſubject to the Frailty of
having been cully'd and cunny-catch'd
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56677:70"/>
by Mortal <hi>Guſmans,</hi> their Oracles would
be no more frequented among the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
and the ſmiles of the Gentry would
expoſe them to the Satyrical Extenſion
of the Fore-finger; which was a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of their unwary Folly, that
ſo over-aw'd their conſiderative <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,</hi>
that hardly one in twenty ever
divulg'd the Tricks that <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>
put upon them. And therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were beſt able to bear the
Loſs, moſt ready to put it up, and
moſt eaſie to be plaid upon, (as depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon their own Judgments) in
point of Morality, in point of Policy,
and to ſave trouble, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
dealt with any other then thoſe of
his own Rank, <hi>Gentlemen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having made this Digreſſion, for the
better Inſtruction of the Reader, we
ſhall clear the foregoing <hi>Axiom</hi> by the
following Demonſtration. For as has
been already hinted, when <hi>Don Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi>
had bargain'd with any Farmers, for
one or more Horſes, he ſtill told them
he had not currant Money to pay for
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56677:70"/>
his Markets; and therefore deſir'd
them to ſend one of their Servants to
ſuch a Gentleman's Houſe, where he
was certain to be furniſh'd with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Coyn; delivering himſelf in ſuch a
manner, as if he were moſt intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acquainted there. Thereupon the
Farmer would preſently order a Servant
to ride along with their Genteel Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who, by the way, never fail'd to
intoxicate the credulous <hi>Bumpkin</hi> with
the promiſe of ſome Gratuity for his
pains; and then to make him perfect in
his leſſon; which was, to give ſuch a ſhort
account of <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> as he himſelf
directed him. The Fellow being thus
prepar'd, and inſpir'd with expectation,
ſo ſoon as they came ſomewhat near
the Houſe, was ſent before, to enquire
whether the Gentleman were within? A
Queſtion which <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> could have
reſolv'd before; but done on purpoſe
to give the Gentleman opportunity to
enquire of the Servant, who the Perſon
was that was coming behind? For then
it was, that the Countrey Fellow gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
gave his Worſhip this Anſwer, That
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56677:71"/>
either he was a Perſon of Quality, and
of his Maſter's Acquaintance, who had
bought Horſes of one that liv'd in ſuch
a place; or elſe, that he was a near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to his Maſter, who had brought
Horſes of another of his Acquaintance:
Either of which Pretences ſo formal, and
ſo probable, were enough to prevail
with a Gentleman always ready to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
his Neighbours. So that by theſe
Artifices, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> ſeldom fail'd of
having his Gold chang'd, or Silver lent
upon it, with his promiſe of ſending
for it again in ſuch a time. But the
Fiſh being caught, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> had
no more buſineſs either with that Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
or his Servant; and therefore at
parting, he only gave the Fellow a
ſmall Reward, and bid him tell his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
That he was gone to ſuch a place,
quite contrary to that Corner of the
Wind, whither he was bound, and
would be with him in three or four
Hours, in which time he was got out
of reach to his next Conveniency. For
<hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> and his Brethren, always
ſo manag'd their Buſineſs, that they
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56677:71"/>
rode firſt about the Countrey to inform
themſelves of every thing material, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they made any attempt; ſo that
when they once began, two or three
days put an end to all ſuch Deſigns as
they had in thoſe Parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>During the time that theſe Pranks
were play'd, the <hi>Lime</hi> Merchant being
return'd home, full of Choler and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
had made a ſtrange hurly burly
in the Country; but could hear no Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of his Count. So that all things
being once more ſtill and quiet, <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> reſolv'd to take
the opportunity of the Calm, and to
favour their beloved, the Sea-ports,
with a freſh Viſit. Among the reſt, they
arrived at length at a place call'd <hi>Kings-Bridge</hi>
in <hi>Devonſhire.</hi> There coming in
upon a Market Day, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>
found divers Gentlemen, and ſeveral
of their number, in whoſe Faces he
could read a Chapter fit for his purpoſe,
better then ſome <hi>Aſtrologers.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Circumſtantial Accidents fell
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56677:72"/>
out ſo propitiouſly, that they ſeem'd,
as it were, to aſſure him of Succeſs.
For upon a ſuddain, not only about
the Town, but all the Country round,
there fell ſo deep a Snow, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Horſe nor Man could travail. By
which Confederacy of the Seaſon, <hi>Don
Tomazo,</hi> and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> came familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acquainted with ſeveral of the ſaid
Gentlemen, under the notion of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that were newly arriv'd from <hi>Spain.</hi>
This happy time of leiſure afforded
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> a kind Opportunity to
enter his new Acquaintance into Play,
(which is one of the laudable Exerciſes
that waſte our time in theſe parts of
<hi>Europe)</hi> at which ſport, he gave them
leave at firſt to win much of his <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Gold, which ſome of the Gameſters,
having been Travellers in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
pretended to underſtand, as well
as the loſing Stranger, who, to give
the better Colour to his Deſign, ſeem'd
not a little troubled at the loſs of his
<hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> the only true Friend
to a Traveller. But the fickle Diee,
y'faith, ſoon alter'd their Carier, and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56677:72"/>
ran ſo much on <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s ſide, that
in a ſhort time he had taken Captive
good ſtore of the Gentlemens Coin,
who were ſo fond of the Gold, that
rather then part with it, they borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Money in the Town to pay their
Loſſes. But this ſame ſport was too
hot to hold; ſo that the Gentlemen
weary at length of ill Luck, and tir'd
with the Inconveniencies of loſing, as
having taken their leaves (beſides the
ſatisfaction for <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s Gold,) of
near a hundred pounds of their own
Money, thought it high time to knock
off, and return to their ſeveral Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>At their ſeveral Departures, there
was one of the Company, that prevail'd
with <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> to
ride with him Home; where they were
not only receiv'd with a moſt hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Accommodation by the Gentleman
at his own, but by him alſo carry'd to
a Perſon of Qualitie's Houſe not far off,
where they were likewiſe entertain'd
with no leſs kindneſs then plenty. But
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56677:73"/>
ſuch is the ill nature of <hi>Guſmanry,</hi> that
it ſpares neither Friend nor Foe: For
of this very Perſon of Quality, who
had been ſo civil in his Entertainment,
did <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> very gratefully buy
two Horſes, for which he paid 147 Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolets,
and ſent them away by his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.
This Scene being over, they
were in haſte to be gone; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to avoid the ſour Sawce that might
happen to ſeaſon the ſweet Viands of
their Entertainment, they took their
leaves of the Civility of thoſe Places,
and ſet forward for <hi>Plimouth;</hi> but giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out that they intended for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the two <hi>Dons</hi> came to <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
e're they had time to alight,
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> was ſpy'd by a Perſon that
knew him, who inform'd him, that his
Maſter was in the Town. This News
was to <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> like Aloes and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
a ſtrange mixture of Sweet and
Bitter. For the Gentleman was his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
but one of the Perſons that
had won ſome of his Gold at <hi>Kings-Bridge;</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:56677:73"/>
ſo that <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> ſuſpecting
that the Gentleman was come thither
to make tryal of his Gold, thought it
not proper to ſtay there. Thereupon
the two <hi>Dons</hi> turn'd their Horſes Heads;
but as they rode by a Goldſmith's Shop,
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s counterfeit pieces began to
ferment in his Pocket: So that at their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation,
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> deeming it a foul
Shame, that he ſhould come into ſuch
a Town as <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and leave no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
of his Fame behind him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
at the Goldſmith's Shop, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
Silver for as much Gold as amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to 14 <hi>l. 10 s. 9 d.</hi> The Goldſmith
ſatisfi'd with the Tryal he made, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
the Silver demanded; and ſo the two
<hi>Dons,</hi> having given that great Town
a ſmall Taſte of their Ingenuity,
ſteer'd directly for the Country of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal,</hi>
where they found great Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of Buſineſs, play'd ſeveral Pranks,
and among the reſt, this in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> having taken up his
Quarters at a Town call'd <hi>Penſanſe,</hi> and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56677:74"/>
               <hi>Don Pedro</hi> at another call'd St. <hi>Ives,</hi>
both Sea-ports; lay there, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the leaſt Cognizance of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
They had been ſuch ſtrangers
one to another for ſome Weeks, that
the one had not been in the others
Company but once, and that, as it
were by an Accidental Meeting. So that
it was impoſſible for the Country to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin
or ſuſpect any ſuch thing as an
Intimacy between them; which was the
Foundation upon which many Deſigns
were laid, and brought to perfection.</p>
            <p>One time among the reſt, it hapn'd,
that <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> being at Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Sunday, paying his Devotions to
ſomething or other; <hi>Cupid</hi> finding him
at a loſs for an Object of his Zeal, fix'd
his Eyes upon a very pretty Lady, whoſe
Beauty made no ſlight Impreſſion in <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>'s
Heart. The inflam'd Lover,
whoſe buſineſs it was, always to uſe the
ſwifteſt Expedition in his Affairs, now
more violently haſtn'd by his amorous
Impatience, returns to his Quarters,
and makes all thoſe diligent Enquiries
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56677:74"/>
after the Lady that Lovers are wont to
do; which concluding with ſuch a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
Joy, that all their Anſwers ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd
his Expectations, the People
eaſily from thence drew their wonted
Conjectures, and preſently reported,
that <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> who paſt for the Son
of a Perſon of great Quality in the
<hi>North,</hi> was deeply in Love with ſuch
a Lady. This Report flew like Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and was preſently bandy'd from
one Tittle-tattle to another, till it came
to the Father's Ear, with all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhments
of Multiplication, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the Behaviour and Gallantry
of the Enamour'd Eſquire. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was tickl'd at the Tidings, and as
it is the faſhion of the Unwary, to look
upon diſtant Proſpects with a Magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fancy, thought it but an act of Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Affection to advance his Daughters
Fortune; and the Daughter her ſelf,
proud of the Conqueſt of her Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Beauty, already imagin'd her ſelf
riding in her Coach and Six Horſes, the
ador'd Miſtreſs of many Tenants, and
the charming Wife of a brisk, bonny,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56677:75"/>
and wealthy Heir. Thereupon the
Juſtice comes thundring to <hi>Penſanſe,</hi>
to take view of his Son-in-Law, and
having found him out, took an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to fall into a ſifting Diſcourſe with
<hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> who had all his Story ſo
Geometrically fram'd, and deliver'd it
with ſuch a careleſs Exactneſs, without
the leaſt Heſitation, that the <hi>Corniſh
Chough,</hi> was not only taken with his
Perſon and Behaviour, but ſo intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
with his Narrative, that he invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him over to his Houſe. <hi>Don To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>
kindly accepted his Invitation,
and accordingly gave him the Honour
of his Company home; where he had
leiſure enough to unboſom his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Young <hi>Iſabella,</hi> the Name
by which hence forward ſhe ſhall be
known.</p>
            <p>Some time after, the Juſtice, his Wife,
and his Daughter, went to viſit a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of their Acquaintance, that liv'd
not far from St. <hi>Ives,</hi> who after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
inform'd the Juſtice of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that quarter'd at St. <hi>Ives,</hi> that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56677:75"/>
was certainly the beſt Company that
ever he met with; withal, That he was
a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> whoſe Curioſity had brought
him thither to view the Country. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which rare Character of an intimate
Friend, the Juſtice deſir'd he might be
ſent for, as he was, with all ſpeed. But
when he came, the Country Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who only thought to compleat
his Paſtime with the mirth of ſome Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Droll, was ſtrangely out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and in a Surprize, believing his
Old Acquaintance had put ſome Trick
upon him. For ſuch was <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s
Air and Deportment, that the Juſtice
took him for no leſs then ſome Perſon
of High Quality; which was no ſmall
trouble to the Juſtice, to be put out
of the road of his Rural Addreſſes, and
Country Complements; and forc'd on
a ſuddain to recollect the Exerciſes of
his Youth at the Dancing-School, for
new Congies, and Refin'd Expreſſions.
For indeed, <hi>Don Pedro</hi> might well
have paſt for ſuch a one as the Juſtice
took him to be, in any part of the
World. He was a Perſon ſo comely,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56677:76"/>
that few <hi>Spaniards</hi> were like him, very
Fair, full Ey'd, with a lovely Head of
Long Hair, as black as a Raven's
Wing, and a Body moſt curiouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd;
to which his Graceful Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
his affable, ſweet, and complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Humour, his fluencie of Speech,
and his Noble Equipage, were ſuch
charming Additions, that it was no
wonder <hi>Cupid</hi> took his Stand in ſuch a
Face, and bent his Bow to kill two
Birds with one Stone. I ſay <hi>bent,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
at that time, I believe the God of
Love made uſe of a Croſ-bow, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the Croſsneſs of the Shot. In
ſhort, the Mother and the Daughter
were both ſhot Plumb-dead at the ſame
time, inſomuch, that there was no Peace
or Quiet in either of their Boſoms, till
they had prevail'd with the Juſtice,
(who could hardly think his Manſion
worthy ſuch a Gueſt) to invite <hi>Don
Pedro</hi> to his Houſe. But at laſt, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by their Importunity, and his
own Ambition, he took the Confidence
to give him a Solemn, and Cardinal-like
Invitation, which <hi>Don Pedro</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56677:76"/>
accepted. You may be ſure, the
Entertainment could not chuſe but be
ſplendid, where the Maſter conſulted
his Honour, the Miſtreſs her deep Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
and no queſtion but the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſate up late, and had a Finger in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Pye, and every Tart. Nor was the
Female diligence of thoſe two Love-ſhot
Ladies, leſs, to dreſs, and trim, and trick
and adorn themſelves, with all the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
their Trunks and Cabinets could
afford. What Fairs and Chriſtnings ſaw
but ſeldom and in Parcels, that <hi>D. Pedro</hi>
ſaw at once, and every day diſplay'd;
while the Mother ſtrove to renew the
Youth of her paſt Beauty, the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to beautifie her preſent Youth.</p>
            <p>All this <hi>Don Pedro</hi> contentedly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd;
and as he was extremely acute
in his Obſervations, after Dinner, he
gave Madam <hi>Iſabella</hi> an occaſion to
convey a little Billet into his hand; at
what time the Mother took an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to ſlip another into his Pocket,
ignorant of what her Rival Daughter
had done. Neither indeed, was <hi>Don
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56677:77"/>
Pedro</hi> aware of the Mothers contrivance.
So ambitious they were, which of the
two ſhould make the firſt and deepeſt
Impreſſion in <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Heart. The
two Ladies having thus diſburthen'd
their Affections, the one into his Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
the other into his Hand; <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro,</hi>
after a powre of Complements and
Kindneſs, took his Leave, and being
return'd to his Quarters, drew forth
the Billet which he had receiv'd from
Mrs. <hi>Iſabella,</hi> wherein he read theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Lines.</p>

theſe ſhort Ejaculations of a wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Deſign would be moſt likely to ſucceed
among People that had laid themſelves
ſo fairly at the Feet of their mercy, and
as it were, put their Lilly white hands
into the Lion's Mouth. Withal, he
caution'd <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> for the future,
to avoid ſuſpicion, to write his Mind,
and ſend his Servant with it, to be left
in a hole of a certain Rock half way
between <hi>Penſanſe</hi> and St. <hi>Ives,</hi> which

<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> came to read the Billet
which <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had inform'd him
came from the Juſtices Daughter, he
was in a ſtrange Quandary: for he lov'd
her himſelf, even beyond the pleaſures

dreaming the Young Lady had been
ſuch an early <hi>May-cherry,</hi> ſo ſoon to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
the Gatherer's Hand; of whom, he
then himſelf had no other hopes, but
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56677:78"/>
as the Paternal Heat of her Father's
Care, mellow'd her for his Embraces:
Of his Approbation Good Will,
and Favour, he thought himſelf Cock-ſure,
as well for that they had been
more intimate together, as in regard
the Deportment, and Natural Parts of
<hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> were not much inferiour
to thoſe acquir'd Endowments of <hi>Don

were thus Tenniſ-ball'd between Love

him a Cordial, that ſoon compos'd this

At the receit of this Letter, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
was ſo tranſported, that for that
day all the Gayety and Pleaſure ſhe
had ever ſhow'n, or enjoy'd in her
whole Life, ſeem'd to be recollected,
and rendevouz'd in her Countenance.
She thought of nothing but of reinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
her amorous Heat, that ſhe might
be able to meet her Dear Don <hi>Pedro</hi>'s
Fires, with equal Flames. Her Heart
danc'd the <hi>Canaries</hi> in her Boſom for
joy that ſhe ſhould ſo ſoon be happy in
the Embraces of her Beloved <hi>Spaniard;</hi>
and the continual meditations of her
Brain upon theſe voluptuous felicities
did ſo employ her thoughts, that her
Daughter might have had the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to have loſt more <hi>Maiden-heads</hi>
then <hi>Hercules</hi> got in one night,
for any enquiry her Mother made after
her. Thus was the Mothers ſecurity
the Daughters ſafety, who by this time
had loſt her troubleſome Virginity in
thoſe Embraces, to which the other
was the next day to reſign the Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Loyalty of many years. So little
does the continual ſight of a Gold
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56677:81"/>
Thumb-Ring controul the temptations
of a wanton Appetite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſabella</hi> having by this means obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a full ſatisfaction from <hi>Don Pedro,</hi>
and now become as wiſe in the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Philoſophy of Love as her Mother,
left her Inſtructor a thouſand ſweet
kiſſes in pawn for an aſſurance of her
farther Society, and with the modeſty
of a Nun, return'd home to laugh in
her ſleeve at the Cheat ſhe had put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the vigilance of her Mother, and all
her Female Guardians. But before <hi>Don
Pedro</hi> and ſhe parted, there was an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
made, that whenever D. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi>
came to the Juſtices Houſe, it ſhould
be under pretence of making Love to
her, who had already given him the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
pledge of her affection. For, under
that colour D. <hi>Pedro</hi> being now to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
the Intrigue between the Mother
and him, where lay the ſtreſs both of
his and D. <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s deſign, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of their gain, it was neceſſary to
uphold the amorous correſpondence
which he and <hi>Iſabella</hi> had begun.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:56677:82"/>
And now the happy Hour was come,
<hi>D. Pedro</hi> and the enamour'd Mother
met; and he that had ſo deliciouſly
fed the Young Kitlin, was now to <hi>purr</hi>
it with <hi>Grey-maulkin</hi> the Elder; whom
he entertain'd with ſuch variety of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces,
that ſhe proteſted, all the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
<hi>Corniſh Huggs</hi> were but Bavin-bands
to 'em. Which gave her ſuch
an intrinſick Satisfaction, that ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
<hi>D. Pedro</hi> to ſtay in thoſe Parts
a Month longer; and indeed, till thoſe
Quarters were grown almoſt too hot
to hold either him or his Company.
In order whereunto, ſhe had contriv'd
a way for his coming to the Juſtices
Houſe. But <hi>D. Pedro</hi> not deeming her
way ſo commodious as his own, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
the Mother with his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to her Daughter; who thereupon
approv'd of his Intentions, and having
reſolv'd to act conformably to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign;
they parted for that time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Pedro</hi> being return'd home,
wrote a Letter to be left at the Rock
for <hi>D. Tomazo,</hi> wherein he gave him
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56677:82"/>
an exact account of what had paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and the two Ladies; and
farther deſir'd D. <hi>Tomazo</hi> with all ſpeed
to get himſelf introduc'd into <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s
Company, and to make his Addreſſes
to her, wherein he promis'd to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting,
ſo ſoon as there appear'd any
publick Acquaintance between them.</p>
            <p>This Letter, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> read, with
great regret, curſing <hi>Pedro</hi>'s happineſs,
and his own ill Conduct, not ſo much
for the Love he bore the diſſembling
<hi>Iſabella,</hi> as for that he had not made
the ſame Improvement of his Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had done; but
finding it was now <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to carry on the Common Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and that the Deſign began to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
he eaſily rid his Head of thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
Imaginations, and two days
after gave a Viſit to the Juſtice, who
being at home, entertain'd him with
great Reſpect; and among the reſt of
the Diſcourſe, knowing <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>
was well skill'd in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue,
inform'd him of a Famous <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
that was in thoſe Parts, well
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56677:83"/>
worth his Acquaintance. Of which
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> ſeemingly made ſlight,
telling the Juſtice, that he was a Young
Man, and did not know what Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
the Knowledge of that
Gentleman might produce. But the
more <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> ſlighted it, the more
earneſt the Juſtice was to ſend for <hi>Don
Pedro.</hi> So that <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> unwilling
to diſoblige the Juſtice by his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy,
ſuffer'd himſelf to be over-rul'd.
As ſoon as <hi>Don Pedro</hi> came, <hi>Don Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi>
entertain'd him with all the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
according to the Gravity of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and afterwards diſcours'd him
in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Language, which fell out
luckily for their Buſineſs, in regard that
none of the Juſtices Family underſtood
what they ſaid.</p>
            <p>This Interview between the two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Strangers, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> and <hi>Don
Pedro,</hi> firſt begat a Familiarity, then
frequent Meetings; and at length, by
the Juſtices Conſent, his Houſe became
the General Rendevouz. During
which time, <hi>Don Pedro</hi> having had the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56677:83"/>
frequent ſight and handling of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amour'd
Miſtreſs's Jewels, had got ſuch
a perfect <hi>Idea</hi> of the ſhape, form, and
bigneſs of the Pearls and Stones, and
afterwards drawn them ſo exactly in
Paper, that there was no queſtion of
the Succeſs of the Deſign. Thereupon
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> diſpatch'd away his Man
to <hi>Exeter,</hi> who there bought up ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Pendants of counterfeit Pearl, and
<hi>Briſtow</hi>-ſtones, ſo well match'd, that
they were hardly to be diſtinguiſh'd
from the Originals. Which being
brought to <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> he deliver'd
them to <hi>Don Pedro;</hi> who watching his
opportunity, which the fond Dotage of
<hi>Iſſabella</hi>'s Mother often gave him, by
opening her Cabinet, and diſplaying
her Wealth, to dazle his Eyes, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
him to the ſatisfaction of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
took an honeſt occaſion to pay
himſelf for his Drudgery, by taking out
the real Subſtances, and conveying the
Counterfeit Shadows in their places.
Which being done, for about three
days after, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> and Don <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi>
drank the Juſtice very hard; and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56677:84"/>
indeed, made it their buſineſs to keep
him elevated for the moſt part of their
Stay, after the moral Exchange which
<hi>Don Pedro</hi> had made with his Wife.
During which time, one Evening, the
Juſtice being bowſie, they took an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to make a Repetition of the
great Favours he had ſhewn them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
thoſe Returns, which they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
durſt, nor ever intended to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
In the Concluſion of which moſt
lofty Complements, ſome Diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing
about Mrs. <hi>Iſabella,</hi> D. <hi>Pedro</hi>
catch'd at it, and ſpar'd not to ſay, that
he lov'd her beyond meaſure, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
leſs then his Life; but he came ſhort
of D. <hi>Tomazo,</hi> who ſwore by way of
Reply, that ſhe was more dear to him
then Life it ſelf; and in purſuit of his
Zeal for the Lady, requeſted the Juſtice
to declare, if it were his Intention to
diſpoſe of his Daughter in Marriage,
and if it were poſſible for her to love
<hi>Tomazo</hi> and <hi>Pedro</hi> both alike, on which
of the two he would ſooneſt beſtow
her? The Juſtice being raviſh'd to hear
ſuch a brisk Conteſt about his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56677:84"/>
between two ſuch great Perſons of
Quality, was at firſt in a <hi>Dilemma;</hi> but
at length, heightn'd by the t'other
Round, and the more generous Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
of D. <hi>Tomazo,</hi> frankly declar'd
in favour of him. At which D. <hi>Pedro</hi>
ſeem'd to take Snuff, but carry'd it off
for the preſent; and ſo they drank on
all three, till the Ladies were gone to
Bed; but then D. <hi>Pedro</hi> and D. <hi>Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi>
took an occaſion to ſlip out of the
Room, leaving the Juſtice alone, who
perceiving they did not immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
preſently began to reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the diſcourſe that had paſt between
'em. With that he ran to the Garden
door, at which they went out; where
he had not ſtood long, before he heard
the claſhing of Swords. Which ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd
his Worſhip, that in a trice, the
whole Family was allarm'd, and the
Juſtice with ſome of his Servants, came
in great haſte to part them. In this
counterfeit Fray, D. <hi>Pedro</hi> had prickt
D. <hi>Tomazo</hi> in the Arm, more like a
Surgeon then an Enemy, which,
with another green Hurt that <hi>Tomazo</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:56677:85"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:56677:86"/>
had receiv'd but a little before, paſt for
two great Wounds. The Juſtice caus'd
his Servants to take D. <hi>Tomazo</hi> into the
Houſe, while he labour'd to appeaſe <hi>Don
Pedro,</hi> who ſeemingly, would fain have
had the t'other Touch with <hi>D. Tomazo.</hi>
But his violent Paſſion, at length ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to the Juſtices Mediation, he
was prevail'd with to go to Bed. The
Scuffle being thus over, and the great
Miſchief prevented, the Juſtice viſited
<hi>Tomazo,</hi> who all in a boyling Choler,
lay ſwearing, he would make <hi>D. Pedro</hi>
ſmoak for the injury he had done him,
and what he would make him pay for
Damages. The Old Gentleman gave
him all the Sugar words he could think
of, and ſent for a Surgeon, whoſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
D. <hi>Tomazo</hi> eaſily tempted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
the Cure, to enhance the Bill of
Coſts. After that time, the two Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
never met, <hi>D. Tomazo</hi> returning
to his Quarters; and the Juſtice for his
own Reputation, ſo ordered it, that
there was no noiſe made of the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Duel. Nevertheleſs, D. <hi>Pedro,</hi>
who all this while, lay at Rack and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56677:86"/>
Manger in the Juſtices Houſe, and took
that care of his wife, to find her other
ſport then viſiting her Cabinets, ſeem'd
to be not a little afraid of his Rival, and
therefore perſwaded the Juſtice to give
D. <hi>Tomazo</hi> a Viſit, and withal, to pump
him in reference to his demands for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
To whom D. <hi>Tomazo</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted,
that 500 <hi>l.</hi> ſhould not recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
'em. But the Cure being over, D.
<hi>Tomazo</hi> was perſwaded by the Juſtice,
(whom they found very much pleas'd
with his Office of Mediation) to treat
with D. <hi>Pedro,</hi> who was willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
himſelf to D. <hi>Tomazo,</hi> as not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it convenient to incumber himſelf
with the Laws of the Nation, to which
he was a Stranger. So that at length,
D. <hi>Tomazo</hi> was over-rul'd by the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
to take 225 <hi>l.</hi> Accordingly <hi>Don
Pedro</hi> laid down the Money in <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Gold, which <hi>D. Tomazo</hi> refus'd, as not
being the Coin of <hi>England.</hi> Thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>D. Pedro,</hi> mainly deſirous to be rid
of Trouble, requeſted the Juſtice to
take the Gold, and furniſh him with
ſo much Money, which he not having
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56677:87"/>
in the houſe, courteouſly ſent to <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanſe</hi>
for, and deliver'd it to <hi>Pedro,</hi> who
upon the Payment thereof to <hi>Don To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo,</hi>
receiv'd a full and ample diſcharge,
but refus'd to have any more to do with
ſuch a litigious Gentleman.</p>
            <p>By this time having ſtock't all that
Countrey with their precious Metal,
by a Letter from the rock, they agreed
to be gone, as they did in a moſt ſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
manner. For without taking
leave of the Juſtice, who was ſo cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
or his Wife, who had been ſo
kind, or the Daughter, who had been
ſo tenderly loving, they took horſe of
a ſudden, and vaniſh'd out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
leaving nothing behind 'em but
the Remarques of an old muſty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
<hi>Happy are they that beware by other
mens harms.</hi> Neither were they very
ſcrutinous to know what Curſes or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations
follow'd 'em from the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
Houſe, who they knew had no
great reaſon to be over-zealous in their
purſuit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:56677:87"/>
During this pleaſant Ramble, the
two Brethren in Evil had return'd ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
conſiderable Sums to <hi>London,</hi> and
diſpos'd of all their counterfeit <hi>Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians.</hi>
And now, coming to a certain
Market-Town beyond <hi>Exeter,</hi> the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
God, with a muffler about his Eyes,
found a way to ſhoot a new Paſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s heart. He that had ſo
long defi'd the yoke of Wedlock, was
now altogether for the Bonds of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony.
He had met with an Object
beautiful and rich, that had enſlav'd
him even to a ſenſe of Honour, as if
the ſickneſs of his Love had caus'd a
qualm of Honeſty in his mind. So that
having ſucceeded in his Courtſhip, he
reſolv'd to be faithful to one he entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lov'd. And now all things being
concluded, and nothing wanting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
conſummation but the Ceremony
of the Church, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> rides back
to <hi>Exeter</hi> to provide the Nuptial Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
By the way, at another Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-Town,
he met with ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the Country, who perſwaded
him to dine with 'em at an Inn;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56677:88"/>
Where, after they had drank pretty
hard, one of the Company (who was
Maſter of the Inn where <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>
quarter'd at <hi>Lime)</hi> began to relate the
whole Story of a certain Exploit that
was done at his Town by a pretended
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Count; and at the concluſion
of his Story pointed to <hi>Tomazo,</hi> ſaying,
that the Count was as like him, as ever he
ſaw any man in his Life, only that the
Count wore a Perruke, and <hi>Don Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi>
his own Hair. This Narrative did
not a little diſorder <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations;
but he who had the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to out-brazen the ſtern looks of
ſo many Dangers, ſcorn'd to betray his
fear of ſuch a ſcare-crow as this: and
ſo, putting a good face upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
with a Story of the ſame nature with
his own Concern, which led to others
quite different, he lull'd the <hi>Lime</hi>-man's
Relation aſleep; and for fear it ſhould
wake again, he kept the Company ſo
well ſoder'd together with pleaſing
Healths, that all manner of Stories were
forgot, there being not one in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
but what was carry'd to bed.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56677:88"/>
Onely <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> having been more
careful of himſelf, rode to <hi>Exeter</hi> that
night, to meet a more unlucky Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
For early the next morning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he came thither, the Oſtler of the
Inn where his Horſes ſtood, taking one
of them to the Farriers, upon ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
or other, a certain Perſon caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Eye upon the Beaſt, demanded
of the Oſtler whoſe it was? who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
He knew not. Thereupon the
Perſon who ask'd the Queſtion waited
till the Horſe was led back, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to the Stable, there found the
very Horſe on which <hi>Tomazo</hi> rode when
he chang'd his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> pieces with him
at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> for 14 <hi>l.</hi> odd money; for
ſo it fell out, that this was the very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
Goldſmith that had been nick't
in that manner. Who thereupon went
to <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s Lodging, and caus'd
him to be apprehended. A ſad Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe
to a Perſon that dream't of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Epithalamiums and Hymenaeal
<hi>Flambeau's.</hi> Preſently he was carry'd
before a Magiſtrate, by whom, upon
the Juſtices Information, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56677:89"/>
but left Bailable. <hi>Don Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi>
being thus in the Climm, and well
knowing that the report of his being
in Priſon would muſter a wicked Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion
of the ſame Crimes to his deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
to prevent the threats of his
hard Fate, writes away a Letter to a
Gentleman who was a Juſtice of the
Peace in the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> whoſe
Sirname he then aſſum'd to himſelf;
wherein he gave him to underſtand his
Condition, and that he was a perſon
nearly related to him; and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
his Worſhip (for nothing leſs
then a Juſtice of Peace of the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
would ſerve) to favour an innocent
Stranger, ſo far as to ſtand for one of
his Bail; pretending, as well he might
do, that his Impriſonment would be his
Ruine; as being a perſon that came not
into the Country to utter falſe Money,
but to court a young Lady, that liv'd
not far from him; of which he would
give his Worſhip a farther Account, if
his Requeſt were granted. <hi>Don Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi>'s
Letter was well conſider'd and
ſcann'd by the Juſtice, before he ſent
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56677:89"/>
an Anſwer; and enquiry was alſo made
by his Order, after this new diſcover'd
Kinſman; by which the Juſtice finding
many of the Circumſtances to be true,
as <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> had expreſt, believ'd the
reſt, and wrote him word, that though
he knew him not perſonally, he was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd
that he had ſuch a Kinſman in
the World, and believ'd him ſo to be;
and therefore rather then ſuffer a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to lie under ſuch a Scandal, he
promis'd to bail him off, which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
done by himſelf and another
Juſtice of the Peace, whom he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
to ſtand with him. With this
new Relation <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> went home,
where he was civilly entertain'd till the
time of his Appearance at the Seſſions.
During which Interval, being brought
acquainted by his Couſin, with the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
of the Peace of the County, he
had ſo inſinuated himſelf into their
Favour, that ſeveral of them had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
themſelves by Promiſe to be his
Friends, which made him reſolv'd to
ſtand his Tryal. When the time came,
the Goldſmith exhibited his Indictment
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56677:90"/>
againſt <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> wherein he charg'd
him with having exchang'd at his Shop,
a certain weight of Mettal for ſo much
real-money; but that when he went
to melt it down in his Forge, the whole
matter by putting a ſmart Fire under it,
evaporated with that Violence, that his
Servant ſtanding on the other ſide of
the Forge, having receiv'd ſome of the
Vapour into his Noſtrils, ſwonded away
to the great wonder of his Maſter.
Upon this Indictment <hi>D. Tomazo</hi> was
found guilty of a high Misdemeanour,
and fin'd 45 <hi>l.</hi> which was afterwards
brought down to 40 <hi>s.</hi> and preſently
pay'd with great Joy. For upon Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his fine, no other charge coming
againſt him, he was acquitted by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D. Tomazo</hi> having thus eſcap'd the
Goldſmith's Tongues, almoſt as bad as
St. <hi>Dunſtan</hi>'s, and made all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
he could, to render his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
to the Gentleman he
was ſo much oblig'd to, made as much
haſte out of the Countrey, and with
his other ſelf <hi>D. Pedro</hi> ſet forward for
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56677:90"/>
               <hi>London,</hi> no more regarding his intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Marriage; which indeed had been
to little purpoſe. For his Miſtreſs's
Relations having heard of his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
and that he had been no Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
for his Religion, took that Paternal
care, as to ſend their Kinſwoman far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
out of his reach. When the two
Travellers arriv'd at <hi>London,</hi> and had
caſt up their Accounts, it appear'd by
their Books, that they and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
had utter'd in this Kingdom
4050 Pieces of their ſorts of <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Gold, amounting to near 5000 <hi>l.</hi> Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
Of which, being divided 1700 <hi>l.</hi>
came to <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s and <hi>D. Pedro</hi>'s
Share; all which, together with the ſtock
they had before, and the Jewels which
they had borrow'd of the Juſtice's Lady
(clear booty to them two) roſe to a very
conſiderable Value; and yet no ſuch vaſt
Sum neither, for thoſe that had been ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and reaping all over <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now you will ſay, What became of
all this Money? Oh! never fear it, you
ſhall have a faithful Account of it by
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56677:91"/>
and by. You'l be impertinently que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning
too, Why did not theſe two
Dons put themſelves in <hi>a Way?</hi> So they
did, and that in as fair a way to be
hang'd as ever they did in all their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes
through all the ways of <hi>Great
Britain.</hi> Now looſing, and ventring
Life and Limbs to impoſe upon Princes
and Generals, as they did before to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
Goldſmiths and Countrey Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
But how you will approve of
their ways, is not for them to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
            <p>For to tell you the truth, the two
Dons finding <hi>London</hi> the cooleſt place
in <hi>England</hi> for men of their Profeſſion,
now grown by continual Perſecutions,
rather like the Stoves i'the new <hi>Bagno,</hi>
then like a gentle <hi>Egyptian</hi> Oven to hatch
more miſchief in, reſolv'd to paſs over
into <hi>Holland,</hi> with a Reſolution to ſerve
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and ſo they did
more tricks then ever he thought they
deſerv'd thanks for. To which intent,
they took their Leaves of their Native
Soil, like two Philoſophers, carrying
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56677:91"/>
all they had along with them: though
it were a hard thing to judge whether
their Country were not as glad to be
rid of them, as they were to be rid of
their Country. But let it be as it will,
they were no ſooner entred upon the
Stage of <hi>Holland,</hi> but they were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to kiſs the Princes Hands. Such an
Aſcendant has the dazle of Garb and
Behaviour over all Mankind, and all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Body of Man is not as tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
as it is brittle. Soon after they
had perform'd this Ceremony, they
had leave to enter themſelves as Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers;
for there were no Commiſſions
to be had for Money, it being then at
the beginning of the <hi>Campaign.</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all which time of Military Duty,
and the Winter following, the two <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Sparks, not conſidering that their
Bank was to be fadom'd, or rather,
building upon the fair Promiſes made
them of Employments, that would
ſoon repleniſh the <hi>Vacuums</hi> of their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty
Bags, what with <hi>Item</hi> for exceſſive
Eexpences; <hi>Item</hi> for Gaming, that bane
of <hi>Plethorie</hi> Pockets, were brought to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56677:92"/>
ſing <hi>Lachrymae</hi> over the laſt penny. So
that, for want of foreſight, ſeldom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
by the great Maſters of Art in
<hi>Guſmanry,</hi> having diſpos'd of all their
Equipage and Bravery, for it came to
that at length, they were reſolv'd how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
not to ſtarve. And therefore to
prevent that miſerable pining Death,
<hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> who had ſome knowledge
in the Art of Fortification, as being one
that had often built Sconces, took the
boldneſs to wait upon the Prince, to
whom he expreſt the great deſire he had
to ſerve his Highneſs to the utmoſt of
what he was capable. Then, for <hi>Don To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>
was always one that kept cloſe to
his Text, he made known to the Prince
the neceſſity he was in, not forgetting
to mind him of the good Services he
and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had done at ſeveral places,
and more particularly the Siege of
<hi>Grave,</hi> which were not unknown to
the Prince. Who thereupon bid <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>
look about, and find out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
within his Highneſs's diſpoſal,
and that then both he and his Friend
ſhould not fail to ſee the Effects of his
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56677:92"/>
Highneſs's Favour anſwerable to their
Expectations. But <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> not to
be baulk'd by thoſe plauſible Evaſions
of Courtſhip, came cloſe to the Point, for
it was money he wanted, and thereupon
he acquainted the Prince, That if he
would order him a hundred pound, he
would undertake to ſerve him as a Spye
in the <hi>French</hi> Army. This the Prince
deſir'd Time to conſider of, and in a
ſhort time communicated the Secret to
ſome of his Council; who being as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſenſible as himſelf of the great want
of Intelligence among the <hi>Dutch,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
the Prince to employ <hi>Don To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo,</hi>
ſince 'twas his own Voluntary
offer. In purſuit of this Advice, the
Prince ſent for <hi>D. Tomazo,</hi> and told him,
provided his Friend <hi>D. Pedro</hi> would
condeſcend to be left as a Pledg, he
ſhould have a hundred pounds to put
him into an Equipage fit for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of his Propoſals. For the Prince
had had ſeveral tricks put upon him
by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> before, which made him
the more cautious. Upon this, <hi>Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi>
adviſes with his Friend <hi>D. Pedro;</hi>
and as they two were not wont to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56677:93"/>
               <hi>Spaniolize</hi> in their Conſultations, the
matter was ſo order'd to the Princes Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
likewiſe, that <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> as
much to his Satisfaction likewiſe, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the hundred pound. Upon the
receipt whereof, away went <hi>Don To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>
for <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> alter'd all his Habits,
and in the diſguiſe of a Boor of that
Countrey, trudg'd to the <hi>French</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
that then lay encamp'd near <hi>Sog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
under the Command of the Prince
of <hi>Conde.</hi> There <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> got a
full view of all their Standards, Cannon,
and the manner of their Encamping;
as alſo, a very near account of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of their Men, both Horſe and Foot.
With this Diſcovery <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>
return'd to <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> where he put
all things into a formal draught,
exactly repreſenting the whole Camp;
which being ſhew'd to the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> he compar'd it with one which
he had receiv'd before from another
perſon of the ſame Occupation. By
which Compariſon, the Prince found
<hi>D. Tomazo</hi> to be a very fit Perſon for his
Employment; and therefore encourag'd
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56677:93"/>
him, and promis'd him, that ſo long as
he could furniſh them with good Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
he ſhould want neither for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
nor Advance. Thereupon <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> returns to <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> where find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeveral of the Country People,
whoſe Houſes had been plunder'd, and
themſelves ſtript by the <hi>French,</hi> ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably
poor, that they wanted Bread:
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> pick't up one of theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn
Creatures, which by Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he found moſt acute, with whom
he prevail'd to undertake ſuch Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes
as he ſhould put him upon, and
to follow his directions; for which he
promis'd him half a Crown <hi>Engliſh</hi> a
day. The <hi>Boor</hi> taking <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>
for an Angel ſent from Heaven to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
his Miſery, embrac'd his Offer
with all the readineſs imaginable. So
that <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> having giv'n him full
Inſtructions, ſent him about his buſineſs.
Upon his Return, the Boor gave a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good Account of things, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put into Form, together with ſuch
other Diſcoveries which <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>
had made (unknown to the Boor) he
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56677:94"/>
preſented them to the Prince, who ſtill
receiv'd more and more Satisfaction from
the Labours of his new ſpy.</p>
            <p>Sometime after, <hi>D. Tomazo</hi> had by
the Diligence of his new acquir'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate,
prevail'd with ten or a dozen
more of the ſame ſtamp, and in the ſame
Condition to liſt themſelves in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
for the ſame Pay. By this Increaſe
of Number, his Intelligence notably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſt,
inſomuch that his double Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
had highly advanc'd him in the
Favour of the Prince, who believ'd that
whatever <hi>Tomazo</hi> brought him, was
clearly gotten by his own Hazard and
Induſtry, as indeed the beſt part of it
was; for you muſt always allow the
Maſter to outdoe the Servants.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſmaller Attempts ſo well ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
<hi>D. Tomazo</hi> was deſir'd by the
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to uſe all his art to
inſinuate himſelf into an Acquaintance
with ſome of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
or Attendents, promiſing that if it
could be accompliſh'd and any Service
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56677:94"/>
accrue from thence, no Sum of Money
ſhould be wanting for Gratification, or
Reward, or Remuneration, or whatever
ye pleaſe to call it. <hi>D. Tomazo</hi> thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after Fame and Money, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that having ſo many Irons in the
Fire it would not be long e're ſome
of them prov'd hot enough to ſtrike,
readily undertakes the Affair; to which
purpoſe he provides a Frock of Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath,
a pair of wooden Shooes, (for
ſuch is the Habit of the Boors in thoſe
parts) a Rundlet of Brandy, and a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of <hi>Tobacco.</hi> This Rundlet had two
Diviſions, the one for the Souldiers Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
of Life, and the other for black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead
Pencils, and Parchment, and ſuch
other neceſſary materials. In this Garb,
who the Devil could know ſo great a
Perſon as <hi>Don Tomazo?</hi> So that under
this diſguiſe, he walk'd about the <hi>French</hi>
Camp, grateful to the Souldiers for the
ſake of his Tobacco and Brandy; and
watching his Opportunies, took ſeveral
Memorandums very conſiderable. But
loytring one day careleſsly about the
Quarters of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> one of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56677:95"/>
the Captains of the Guard call'd to <hi>Don
Tomazo,</hi> who believing him not worſe
then <hi>Cerberus,</hi> and in hopes that a Sop
would have ſtopp'd his Mouth, proffer'd
him a Taſt of his Cordial Liquor. But
the Captain ſuſpecting him to be what
he was, order'd him to be ſearch'd, and
kept him upon the Guard four whole
hours. This was an Accident that ſet
all the Pulſes of <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s Brain at
work; and all little enough to hammer
out new Spirits to ſupply the want of
thoſe which he had loſt in the Fright.
But thoſe little Vulcans ſoon recruited
his Arteries, and the Devil too, the
Father of Lyes, unwilling to looſe a
Servant, gave him a Liſt with a caſt of
his Favour. For after ſomething of a
ſerious Study upon ſuch a tickliſh point
of Life or Death, <hi>D. Tomazo</hi> call'd for
the Captain, and deſir'd he might be
carry'd to the Prince of <hi>Conde;</hi> at
which the Captain laught and ſaluted
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s Poſteriors with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
Kick or two; asking in great
Deriſion, What Buſineſs ſuch a Beaſt as
he could have with the Prince? So
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56677:95"/>
ſtrangely may a Captain be miſtaken.
But <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> urg'd his Importunity
ſo home, that Mareſchal <hi>D' Humieres</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
by, and hearing the brandy man ſo
boldly demand to ſpeak with the Prince
of <hi>Conde</hi> about Buſineſs of Importance,
came up to him and ask'd him What
it was? To whom <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> made a
ſubmiſſive Anſwer, That it was of that
high Conſequence, that for his Life he
durſt not impart it to any but the
Prince himſelf. Away went the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal,
little thinking, that <hi>Satan</hi> had
ſent him of an Errand, and gave No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
to the Prince of D. <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity;
who thereupon ſent for the
Brandy-Merchant, not to buy any of
his Ware, but to underſtand his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Then it was, that <hi>D. Tomazo,</hi>
with a reſpective Bow, not like that of
a Strong-water-man, deſir'd Privacy
with his Highneſs, as not daring to
give any Account of his Buſineſs to any
perſon living but himſelf. Thereupon,
the Prince conſidering there were ſuch
things as Diſguiſes in the World, and
frequently made uſe of, and that it
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56677:96"/>
was in his Power, with one puff of a
<hi>Mort-bleu,</hi> as well to hang a Varlet,
as to reward an Inſtrument, order'd
all People to withdraw: which being
done, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> opening his Mouth
without Fear or Trembling, thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</p>
            <p>Sir, it is intended by the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> that his whole Army ſhall march
to <hi>Oudenard</hi> about four days hence; in
order to which, all things are in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration:
thirty Battering Cannon are
to be ſent from <hi>Gaunt</hi> to meet them;
the Prince being reſolv'd to beſiege the
Town with all the Vigour imaginable;
and to render the Enterprize more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
four Engineers are to be ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Garriſon to morrow, to diſmount
the Cannon, which is to be done with
the conſent of ſome of the Gunners al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
tamper'd with, and made for
their Purpoſe. Farther, when the <hi>Dutch</hi>
are ready to open their Trenches, the
great Water Damm in the middle of
the Town is to be ſprung by another
Engineer, by the conſent of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56677:96"/>
there concern'd, of whom they
are already aſſur'd. Which being
done, and the Water fallen, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
intends to attacque the Town on
that ſide. Now if your Highneſs think
fit, I will return to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Army,
and make farther enquiry into the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of this deſign, which when I
have done, I ſhall be ready to go to
<hi>Oudenard,</hi> and diſcover to the Perſons
your Highneſs ſhall appoint, the very
Engineers, and their Accomplices them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
The Prince hearing ſuch a
Formal Story from ſuch an <hi>Anniſ-ſeed-water</hi>-Robin,
as he took <hi>Tomazo</hi> to be,
was not a little ſurpris'd, which caus'd
him, as any General of reaſon would
have done, to ask <hi>Tomazo</hi> what he was?
how he had liv'd? what had induc'd
him to make this Diſcovery? and how
he came to be privy to ſuch a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Secret? Adding withal, that he
could not believe the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
would ever communicate a Deſign of
ſuch Importance, to a Perſon of his
Low Degree.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:56677:97"/>
To this <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> not thinking it
neceſſary to run through the whole
Courſe of his Life, reply'd in ſhort,
That he was a Captain in the Prince
of <hi>Orange's</hi> Army, that he was intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acquainted with all the Chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers;
that he had been divers times at
their Councils of War; and often had
had the Honour privately to diſcourſe
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Princes of
<hi>Curland, Naſſau,</hi> and <hi>Friezeland;</hi> by
which he made it out, that there was
probability enough, that he might be
acquainted with part, though not with
all their Deſigns. And laſtly, that as
to his Inducement, to make the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
it proceeded meerly from the
great Honour and Eſteem he had for
His Majeſty of <hi>France,</hi> whom he was
moſt ambitious to ſerve.</p>
            <p>The Prince, having thus duly weigh'd
the Circumſtances of the Story, and
finding nothing but what was very
likely to be true, ſurrender'd his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
to D. <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s ſmooth Tale; and
the more to oblige him, order'd his <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56677:97"/>
du Chambre</hi> to preſent him with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>Quadruples,</hi> to the value of 160 <hi>l.</hi>
Sterling; which pleas'd D. <hi>Tomazo</hi>
much better then the Kicks o'the
Breech which the Surly Captain gave
him. Which being done, the Prince
gave him farther hopes of his Favour,
even to high Advancement, if he made
out the diſcovery as he had begun;
and ſo, having enjoyn'd him to return
with all poſſible ſpeed, in order to his
going to <hi>Oudenard</hi> for the Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s Traytors in the
Moon, he diſmiſs'd the well ſatisfi'd
<hi>Mundungus</hi>-merchant from a moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Agony, with the ſweet Conſolation
of Fidler's Fare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> having thus by dint of
Wit, deliver'd himſelf out of the Lion's
Den, and finding that he was able to
deal with two Princes at one time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to play his Game out. To this
Intent, away he goes directly to the
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and to him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Concealment, relates all that
had paſt between the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:56677:98"/>
and himſelf. A Story which very much
pleas'd the Prince, and caus'd him to
laugh heartily. At the Concluſion of
his Narrative, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Prince, to return at the
time appointed; which he did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
and found immediate Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> to whom
he told the ſame Story as before, only
with ſome Alterations and Additions.
Which ſo convinc'd the Great General
of the Truth of the Fable, not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that though a man had counterfeited
once, he would ever be ſuch a Fool to
venture again with the ſame Lye in his
Mouth, that he order'd <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> to
go directly by ſuch a Token to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<hi>de Chamilly,</hi> then Governour of
<hi>Oudenard,</hi> and give him an Account of
the whole matter, as from the Prince.
All which <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> exactly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd;
but then pretending to the
Marquis, that the Perſons were not
yet come, and that it behov'd him
therefore to ſtay till they came; that
Liberty was ſoon allow'd him. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which time, he made it his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to walk and view all the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56677:98"/>
as well Private as Publick; as
alſo, to take ſeveral Memoirs of what
he thought proper for his Purpoſe. And
though it was not to be expected, that
the Marqueſs ſhould be ſo liberal as the
Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> yet did <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>
ſo well order his Governourſhip, that
he <hi>Chamilly'd</hi> him out of forty Piſtols;
and ſo having model'd all his draughts &amp;
Obſervations, he watch'd his Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and ſtole out of the Town, though
with no ſmall hazzard; the <hi>French</hi> being
the moſt careful in the World how they
let any perſons paſs in or out at their
Garriſons without a ſtrict Examination.</p>
            <p>By this time the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had
receiv'd an account from ſome Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent
of his in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Army, that
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had ſent an Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer
to <hi>Oudenard,</hi> and that he did intend
to beleaguer it. Which piece of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Intelligence from a known Friend,
agreeing with <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s Story, ſo
ſtartl'd the Prince, that he now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
every word <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> had
ſaid. And thereupon, raiſes his Camp
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56677:99"/>
from <hi>Charleroy,</hi> and marches quite croſs
the Country to cover <hi>Oudenard;</hi> into
which he put three thouſand freſh men
with Proviſions, continuing his Camp
upon the Downs, in expectation of the
Prince of <hi>Orang</hi>'s Coming. Of whom
in four days after he heard another Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
for the <hi>Dutch</hi> taking the Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the diſcamping and long march of
the <hi>French,</hi> preſently ſurrounded <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroy,</hi>
the place they had all along had
their Deſign upon; which forc'd the
Prince after a tedious March to <hi>Oudenard</hi>
for the Apprehenſion of <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s
inviſible Ingineers, to hurry back again
to the Relief of <hi>Charlery,</hi> where he had
no ſmall Trouble to raiſe the Beſiegers,
not daring to give them Battel, though
he had much the Advantage: And it
may be truly ſaid, that this invented
Chimaera of <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s, the product
of a meer Accident, had ſo diſorder'd
the Meaſures of the <hi>French</hi> Counſels, by
ſending their General from poſt to pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
that they could not recover their
Senſes all that Summer. From ſuch
ſmall Beginnings oft times ariſe the moſt
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56677:99"/>
fatal Revolutions in the World.</p>
            <p>For, to ſay Truth, the Siege of <hi>Ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denard</hi>
was never dreamt of, till <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi>'s Return from thence with the
Marquis's Piſtols, and his preſenting
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> with the Draughts
and Obſervations he had made. But
then the Prince conſulted all his Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers,
and divers Councils of War
were held upon the occaſion of <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi>'s diſcoveries; which were found
to be of that Conſequence, that the
<hi>Dutch</hi> fell in good earneſt to the Siege
of <hi>Oudenard;</hi> which put the Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> to another Dance of Attendance
upon their Maſterſhips, to rouze 'em
from that haunt. Which hapn'd very
much to the loſs of the Beſiegers, and
more for the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s honour,
though <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> had put him
to trot hard for it. However, there
were ſome Commanders of great Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
among the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who were of
Opinion, that had the directions which
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> gave them, been rightly
manag'd and kept private, the Succeſs
of the Enterpriſe could not have fail'd.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56677:100"/>
But that which occaſion'd the ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> I mean not only
in this particular, but at other times,
was firſt their ill Conduct in not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
the good Services, nor indeed
the names of the perſons of thoſe they
put upon ſuch Employments as theſe,
and then, ſo often communicating their
Deſigns to ſuch as gave immediate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
to the <hi>French;</hi> by whoſe Advices,
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Spies were ſo often diſcover'd
and hang'd, that others being diſcover'd,
their Intelligence was very inſignificant,
till <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> undertook the buſineſs,
who ſo order'd it, that he had ſeveral
Emiſſaries up and down in the <hi>French</hi>
Army, and ſome that waited even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſome of the Principal Officers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which he had in daily pay; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
others that continually trotted
between them in the Army and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
who with <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> ſtill kept
his Quarters in ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſon
neareſt his Buſineſs, modelling collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
deſigns of another nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:56677:100"/>
The next Summer, the face of Affairs
was ſomewhat alter'd, the Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> being remov'd into <hi>Alſatia,</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> made
General of the Army in <hi>Flanders;</hi>
which clearly diſorder'd <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Settlement: So that he was forc'd
to go himſelf to new model his Affairs,
which he effectually perform'd. For
he got <hi>Don Pedro</hi> to be a <hi>Valet du
Chambre</hi> to the Duke himſelf; by which
means, <hi>Don Pedro</hi> became very Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to him. His Correſpondence
being thus ſetled, and carri'd on for
near four Months, D. <hi>Tomazo</hi> found,
that ſome of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Governours
were not ſo kind to him as he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and therefore he made his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who
ſoon after, procur'd Letters of Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
from the Duke <hi>de Villa Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſa,</hi>
not only to thoſe, but to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> had occaſion
to viſit. A certain ſort of Utenſils,
which he knew how to make uſe
of.</p>

               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:56677:102"/>
Some time after, there hapn'd certain
diſorders among the Confederate Spies,
which could not be well ſettl'd, unleſs
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> appear'd among them in
Perſon, and as it fell out, no other
place would ſerve but the Duke
of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi>'s Quarters themſelves.
In order to this difficult Journey, <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> puts on the Habit of a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
gets as many Paſs-ports as were
requiſite for a Man under ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
to travel with, and ſo ſets for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
on Foot towards the <hi>French</hi>
Camp. By the way, he narrowly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap'd
the purſuit of ſeveral Boors in
the Province of <hi>Artois,</hi> who would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
have ſtript, if not murther'd
him, had he not ſhew'd them a good
pair of Heels; the uſe of which he well
underſtood: For it was common with
him to travel fifty miles a day in that
Country. He had no ſooner got clear
of this curſed Crew, but he met with
another party, about half a Mile off,
as bad as themſelves. Through theſe he
had no other means to eſcape, but by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his way by main force. Which ſo
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56677:102"/>
provok'd thoſe Bloody Varlets, that
ſome of them let fly ſeveral ſhot at him
from their Fuzees, while others ſet a
running after him, thinking to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken
him; and perhaps they might
have won the Race to the loſs of his
Life, had he not met with ſome of the
Horſe Guards of <hi>Liſle,</hi> then ſcouting
abroad, who, obſerving what had paſt
between the Boors and him, preſently
ſeiz'd him, and ſent him away to the
Garriſon. Where he was detain'd by
the Captain of the Guard, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that he ſhew'd him his Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports;
who told <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> that he
was a Spie, and only forc'd in by a
party of their Men, who were gone
out but a little before, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſhould ſtay till the Party re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd.
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> vex'd at this ſtop,
acquainted the Captain with the real
occaſion of his travelling that way,
which was to wait upon the Duke of
<hi>Luxemburgh;</hi> but nothing would ſerve,
till at length the Souldiers coming back,
and giving the Captain an Account,
how he had been purſu'd by the Boors,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56677:103"/>
and how they had ſeiz'd him, to ſecure
him out of their Clutches; he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
diſcharg'd; but order'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the Governour, who was deſirous
to ſee him, having heard of his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
out of the hands of the Sons of
<hi>Belial.</hi> The Governour lik'd <hi>Don To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>
ſo well, that he would fain have
entertain'd him in his Houſe, as being
unwilling to part with him, always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
the great Obligations the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> had laid upon him in his Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
in remembrance whereof, he
thought himſelf engag'd to be kind to
<hi>Don Tomazo.</hi> But he, knowing the
urgency of his own Affairs far better
then the Governour, pretended that his
Errand was to the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi>
and then told him ſo much of his buſineſs
as concern'd the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Governour, ſorry that he had
detain'd <hi>D. Tomazo</hi> ſo long, to make him
amends, by expediting his Journey,
caus'd his Groom to ſaddle two very
good Horſes, and to attend <hi>D. Tomazo,</hi>
till he ſaw him with the Duke. This
kindneſs of the Governour <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:56677:103"/>
could very well have born with, had
not the Groom been order'd to ſee him
with the Duke. For <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reſolv'd to make the Governour,
who had given him nothing but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of good words, pay for his loſs of
time, had already deſign'd to take the
Horſes in Execution for his Debt. All
the matter was how to get rid of this
impertinent Groom: Which put <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> upon his Invention that ſeldom
fail'd; and at this time prov'd moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to him, for as he was riding before
by a piece of enclos'd Ground, upon a
Pretence that he had ſeen a Hare, he
had flung his Cane over the Hedge;
and therefore pray'd the Groom to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and fetch it him again, while he
held his Horſe. <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> finding
this the only time to prevent his being
brought before the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi>
left his Conductor to return home a
foot, and rode clear away with the
Horſes to <hi>Mons,</hi> a Garriſon of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</hi>
Upon his Arrival there, he was
preſently carry'd by two files of Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers
to the Governour, then the Duke
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56677:104"/>
of <hi>Areſcot,</hi> who had had Letters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
in the Behalf of <hi>Don To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>
from the Duke of <hi>Villa Hermoſa</hi>
before. To the Duke <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> told
the whole Story of his Travels, and
how he had ſerv'd the Governour of
<hi>Liſle</hi> for detaining him from his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Thereupon the Duke caus'd the
horſes to be ſold by beat of Drum, upon
the ſale of which <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> receiv'd ſix
and forty pound, which he put up in his
Pocket to drink the Governour of <hi>Liſle</hi>
and his Grooms Health.</p>
            <p>Two days after, the Duke ſent a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy
of 800 Dragoons to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> for
Proviſions. Thither with them went
<hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> and there conſidering the
preſſing want of his Appearance among
his Confederates in the <hi>French</hi> Army,
he reſolv'd to adventure once more.
To which purpoſe he dreſt himſelf up
in a poor Habit like a Woman; and ſo
ſetting forward, the next day made his
private Entry into the <hi>French</hi> Camp.
Where after he had ſetled all his Affairs,
ſcowr'd and oyl'd all his Wheels, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56677:104"/>
ſet 'em at work again; as he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away, it being in the Evening, a
certain laſcivious Horſe Officer mad to
be riding a freſh Country Wench, would
needs have been forcing up <hi>D. Tomazo</hi>'s
Coats; ſo that the young <hi>Amazon,</hi> not
willing to be diſcover'd, was forc'd to
uſe her utmoſt Strength to keep the
boyſtrous Officer honeſt. Thereupon,
as all Repulſes in Love beget Revenge,
the diſappointed Cavalier not believing
ſo much Strength in that Sex, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
to be ſo ſlighted by a bump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinly
Trull, commanded ſome of his
Souldiers to ſearch <hi>Tomazo,</hi> which when
thoſe rugged men-mid-wives had done,
and made the true Diſcovery, th' enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Hotſpur caus'd <hi>D. Tomazo</hi> to be ty'd
neck and heels, and ſecur'd as a Spy. Now
was <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> in a buſhel of Troubles,
and one would think paſt all Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but give a man Luck and coyt him
into the Sea. In this Condition therefore,
<hi>D. Tomazo</hi> arming himſelf with his wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Confidence, ſends to ſpeak in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
with his amorous Officer, which
being condeſcended to, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>
gave him ſuch a parcel of Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56677:105"/>
ſo ſatisfactory to a Fellow that had
more Treachery then Wit, that he not
only order'd no more noiſe to be made
of the Buſineſs, but at the Requeſt of
<hi>D. Tomazo,</hi> went himſelf to tell the
Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> that there was a
perſon ſtolen out of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
his Army in Womans Apparel, to make
ſome Diſcovery to his <hi>Excellency,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Duke ſent for <hi>Don Tomazo.</hi>
But having heard how the Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> had been trout-tickl'd, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that no Body ſhould make a Gudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eon
of him, ſo ſoon as <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> was
brought before him, ſent for ſeveral
Officers who had ſerv'd in the Army
when the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> commanded,
to come and view <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> but it
ſo happened, that now there was not
one that could remember him, upon
which Aſſurance the Duke was willing
to hear what <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> had to ſay;
which was to this Effect, as cloſe as all
the Wit he had could prompt him to lay
it; That an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonel in the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Army had a great Inclination to
ſerve the King of <hi>France,</hi> and to that
purpoſe, would ſo order his Buſineſs,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56677:105"/>
that all his Men and Officers ſhould
privately convey themſelves into the
<hi>French</hi> Camp, provided the Duke would
aſſure them of the ſame Employments
in his Service, as they had under the
Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> And farther, that
the ſaid Colonel had employ'd him,
who was one of his Corporals, to treat
with his Excellency about it. This Tale
of a roſted Horſe ſeem'd very probable
to the Duke, by reaſon of the frequent
Revolts of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> in
regard of their better Pay and Uſage.
Thereupon the Duke oblig'd <hi>Don To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>
to aſſure the Officers, that they
ſhould not only have the ſame Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
but alſo Conſiderations of
greater Value; and to give <hi>Don Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi>
an occaſion to applaud his Bounty,
with his own hand, put into D. <hi>Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi>'s
Paum, ten Piſtols for a Taſte; for
which, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> having made a
Scrape or a Court'ſie, he cannot well
remember, with a moſt chearful Heart
withdrew: and being now from a
Mouſe in a Trap, advanced to be a
Man at full Liberty, repairs to the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56677:106"/>
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to whom he related the
and bad Fortune that had befall'n good
him, ſince the laſt time that he had waited
upon his Highneſs: which ſo well
pleas'd the Prince, that he remembring
the Proverb of the Pitcher, kindly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> not to venture any
more, as indeed he did not intend; but
ſeemingly refus'd to give over, keeping
his private Correſpondence ſtill with his
Agents in Pay, though that knack of
his were unknown to the Prince.</p>
            <p>But by this time the Winter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd,
and the Rivulets of Money
not flowing ſo freely from the Prince's
Springs, as if there were no need of
Intelligence in the Winter; <hi>Don To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo,</hi>
who thought he deſerv'd as much
in the Winter as in the Summer, and
therefore apprehended himſelf to be
ſlighted, ſent for <hi>Don Pedro</hi> out of
the <hi>French</hi> Army, and reſolves to ſet
ſome Engine at work. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> taking <hi>Don Pedro</hi>
along with him, went to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> with whom he was
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56677:106"/>
ſure there lay perdue a Letter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
from the Duke of <hi>Villa
Hermoſa</hi> in his behalf, as there did
with all the reſt of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.
To this ſame great Man of Truſt,
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> pretended, that <hi>D. Pedro</hi>
was going upon particular and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Service into the <hi>French</hi> Camp;
but wanted Money to defray the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Expences of the Deſign. Upon
which Aſſertion of ſuch a known Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
among them as <hi>Don Tomazo, Don
Pedro</hi> was preſently furniſh'd with
<hi>30. l.</hi> With which Pretence, they viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all the moſt conſiderable Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſons, which
produc'd a notable Heap; for they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
got leſs than Twenty pound at a
place.</p>
            <p>At length, having no more but one
to viſit, who was a great Grandee,
they reſolv'd to ſtrike him home. To
which intent, they took up their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in <hi>Antwerp;</hi> and as they never
wanted Tools (for <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> had
provided himſelf of a Signet with the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56677:107"/>
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Arms; they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited
a Letter from the Prince to
Count <hi>Salazar</hi> then Governour of <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi>
Caſtle, in theſe very Words.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

            </floatingText>
            <p>This Letter was carri'd by <hi>Don To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo,</hi>
alone; and being ſhew'd to the
Count, who had not the leaſt ſuſpicion
that it was written at <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s
Quarters in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> order'd the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
forthwith to be paid, and the
Horſes to be deliver'd; which you may
be ſure were none of the worſt. For
the Count was ſo civil to the Prince,
as to give <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> the Liberty to
go into his Stable, and make Choice
of ſuch as he ſhould think moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for his purpoſe. And for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the bad Effects of Second
thoughts, as well as for their own eaſe,
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> requeſted the Count,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56677:107"/>
that he would permit one of his Grooms
to ride along with him. A requeſt
ſoon granted to the Spy-maſter Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of <hi>Holland.</hi> Having thus done all
their buſineſs with ſucceſs, <hi>Don Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi>
and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> rode directly like
<hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> to <hi>Dunkirk;</hi> where
being ſtopt by the Out-guards, <hi>Don
Tomazo,</hi> with a kind of impatient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of Buſineſs, deſir'd to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri'd
forthwith before the Governour;
to whom, ſo ſoon as he had the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a private Audience, he related in
part what he had done to the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the <hi>French;</hi> that his coming
to that Garriſon, was to ſerve the King
his Maſter, and as ſuch a one deſir'd to
to be entertain'd. Upon this the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
receiv'd both <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> and
<hi>Don Pedro</hi> with great Civility, giving
them Permiſſion to diſpoſe of their Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> being willing to
lay ſome kind of Obligation upon the
Governour, for the Proverb tells ye,
there is daubing in all Trades, as an
Acknowledgment of his Favour, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
him with two of the beſt; the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56677:108"/>
other two they put i'their Pockets, and
having giv'n the Groom a ſmall Gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for his Attendance, and money to
bear his Expences, they diſmiſs'd him
with as ponderous a Complement to his
Maſter, as they thought his Memory
was able to bear, which by that time
was as welcome to the Count as the
ſound of his Paſſing-bell. For before
the Return of the Groom with his <hi>voſtre
tres humble</hi>'s, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
through <hi>Antwerp</hi> in his way to the
<hi>Hague</hi> (the Campaigne being then
broke up) the Spaniſh Count believing
he had laid a great Obligation upon the
Prince never to be forgotten, gave him
to underſtand, how ready he had been
to obſerve his Highneſs's Commands, in
furniſhing <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> according to his
Requeſt, expecting ſome mountainous
Complement for his great Care. But
the Prince not knowing what the
Count meant, inſtead of applauding his
Sedulity, fell a laughing, adding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
that it was a Trick, and that he muſt
pay for his Learning. No not ſo, reply'd
the Count, for I have your Highneſs's
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56677:108"/>
hand to ſhew for what I have done:
and preſently drew the Note out of
his Pocket. The Prince read it, and
ſhew'd it to all the Chief Perſonages
about him, who could not gainſay, but
that it was the Prince's Subſcription,
and his Secretaries Writing. However,
in regard the Prince could not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
either the Time or the Occaſion of
ſuch a bountiful piece of Writing, it
was by all condemn'd for a Cheat, and
ſo the Count loſt his Cauſe. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
the Prince more ſenſible then
the reſt, of the Motives that had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
D. <hi>Tomazo</hi> to make ſuch an ill
uſe of his Ingenuity, proteſted, that
if <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> were with him again, he
ſhould not be ſo ſlighted as he had been,
for that he had done him very great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices;
and therefore could not well be
blam'd for carving for himſelf, what
ought to have been with more Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
allow'd him.</p>
            <p>Weary now of the Land Service, for
a while, they reſolv'd to commit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the Mercy of the Ocean; and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56677:109"/>
to venture the Hazards of three unruly
Elements, Fire, Air, and Water all at
once. In order to which Reſolution, the
two bold Sparks, fluſh with the Spoils
of the Flandrian Governours, make a
League with a Privateer at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi>
and ſo hoiſting ſail, they ſteer away for
the North-Eaſt Sea; Where after they
had taken ſeveral Prizes, <hi>D. Tomazo</hi>
was order'd by the Captain to officiate
in one of the beſt, as his Lieutenant.
Now would it not vex a man of Senſe
to be in Poſſeſſion of a Peruvian Mine,
and in a moment to looſe it again
through the Folly or rather Madneſs of a
company of unruly beaſts? For this ſome
prize wherein <hi>Tomazo</hi> was, being well
ſtor'd with Wine, as well as other rich
Commodities, had given the Seaman ſuch
a fatal Opportunity to ſteep themſelves in
the Juice of the Grape, that while their
heads ſwam, the Ship run aground upon
the Iſle of <hi>Amelandt;</hi> in which condition
D. <hi>Tomazo</hi> and the reſt of the Seamen ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
pillag'd her of the beſt of her lading,
left her to the mercy of the next Tide, and
got a ſhore, which being diſcover'd by
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56677:109"/>
two <hi>Dutch</hi>-men that belong'd to the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
before ſhe was made Prize, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
roſe upon the miſerable ſons of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
took them every Mothers-ſon
Priſoners, and carry'd them to <hi>Harling</hi> in
<hi>Friezland,</hi> where after they had ſtript
them, and eas'd them of their rich plunder
which in Gold, Jewels, Neck-laces of
Pearl and other Commodities of the
higheſt Value found upon no more then
13 men, amounted to no leſs then 15000.
<hi>l. Sterling;</hi> they were ſo charitable as to
deliver them ſome of their Seamens old
Cloaths, to cover their Nakedneſs, and
ſo with five Shillings apiece to bear their
Expences, turn'd 'em like a ſort of
Chriſtian Dogs out of the Town, to
enquire their way home to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi>
which is near a hundred Leagues; So
little Compaſſion do Malefactors find
among the wicked themſelves.</p>
            <p>In their way, the chiefeſt place of
Note was <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where D. <hi>Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi>
having entred into a Confederacy
with two of the ſtouteſt and acuteſt of
the diſtreſſed Gang, reſolv'd to make a
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56677:110"/>
full ſtop; leaving the reſt to take their
own Courſe. Here <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inſtigated by his late Sufferings and
Loſſes freſh in Memory, thinking no
Injury he could do ſo mercileſs an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
could equalize the Miſeries which
they had caus'd him to endure, ſought
all Opportunities to ſatisfie his importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Revenge. Nor needed he long to
wait, for thoſe Occaſions are always at
the Elbow of thoſe that dare adventure
to attempt. And ſo it now hapn'd,
for at that time, ſeveral <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Ships,
being newly return'd home, lay below
a certain place call'd the <hi>Pampus,</hi> not
being able to get over the Sands, till
they had lighten'd themſelves by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loading
ſome part of their Freight. To
which purpoſe, ſeveral ſmall Veſſels of
thirty and forty Tun apiece, were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
to carry the Goods ſo unladen
up the River to <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> all which
D. <hi>Tomazo</hi> and his Comrades with
Teeth watring, and Fingers itching
well obſerv'd. And therefore knowing
their Condition to be deſperate, and
that if their Courage did not put an
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56677:110"/>
end to their Miſery, their Neceſſity
would ſoon ſend them for another
World, for which they were not yet
ready; they reſolv'd to play at Hazard
and venter Neck or nothing. With
which Reſolution, they made bold to
borrow a ſmall Boat from <hi>Amſterdam,</hi>
and to ſet ſail toward the <hi>Pampus</hi> upon
the Tryal of their Fortune. By the
way they met with a Veſſel of forty
Tuns laden with <hi>Indian</hi> Goods, which
in the height of their indigent Fury,
they preſently took, though guarded
by nine men, whom they made Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
With this Prize, the three daring Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers
ſail'd cloſe by the Ship from
whence the Goods were taken, whoſe
Company well knowing that was not
the way to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> let fly ſeveral
Shot at <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s Prize, however
all to no purpoſe, they had as good ha'
thrown their Caps at it, for the Veſſel
running right before the Wind, got
preſently out of their Reach. But
coming up with the Texel at the Mouth
of the River, the Gunner of that Fort
having obſerv'd the Shot which the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56677:111"/>
               <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Gyant had made at <hi>Tomazo</hi>'s
Pigmee, ſent his Iron round <hi>Robins</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him too, which made ſeveral Loop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes
in the Sails, and ſome few in the
Hull of the Veſſel, but all to little or no
effect, ſo that now being quite out of
their Reach, and as they thought, out
of Danger, they put boldly to Sea, and
ſteer'd their Courſe directly for <hi>Dunkirk.</hi>
But when Fortune has a mind to play
her <hi>Chriſtmas Gambols,</hi> the Devil's in
her, ſhe's as wanton as a Kitten; no
body knows where to have her, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſhe's as kind as an <hi>Inn-keeper</hi>'s
Daughter, ſometimes as froppiſh as a
Quakers wife; ſometimes as ſweet as a
Whore in Drink, ſometimes as teſty as
a looſing Gameſter. As for Example,
you ſhall ſee how ſhe dealt hith poor
<hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> before ſhe harbour'd him
in his deſired Port. For no ſooner
were he and his two Comrades with
their Prize upon the wide Ocean ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
for <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> but they were kenn'd
by a <hi>Rotterdam</hi> Man of War, whoſe Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
it was, to cruiſe about and clear
the Coaſt; who judging by their courſe
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56677:111"/>
that they were no Friends of his, gave
them Chaſe, and about an hour after,
coming up with them, took the Veſſel.
Upon his firſt Examination, he found
the <hi>Indian</hi> Commodities; and upon a
farther Search, the Skipper whom <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> had ſtow'd in a little hole in
the Hold, who gave the Captain a full
Accompt of the whole Tranſaction.
Whereupon the Captain ſent away the
Veſſel for <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> but kept <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> and his Aſſociates in Affliction
on board his own Ship, which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
at Sea a Month longer, by Order
from the <hi>States General.</hi> Thus much
for <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> whom Fortune had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
of the Profit of all his fair Hazard
and confin'd to an abſtemious poor-<hi>John</hi>
Diet; Now you ſhall ſee how ſhe
bob'd the Captain of the Man of War.
For about a Week after, certain Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers
hap'ning to paſs the Channel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
three in number, the Captain made
all his Sail, and coming up with one of
their Prizes, retook her, and after that
another, which the three Pickaroons
obſerving, and well knowing their
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56677:112"/>
ſtrength, for they had eight or ten
Guns, and a hundred Men a piece, two
of them reſolv'd to attacque the Man
of War, while the other was ſent to
retake their Prizes, which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd,
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Man of War was board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and after a ſmart Fight, compel'd
to yield. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Captain thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaded,
and his Ship ſecur'd, <hi>Don To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>
appear'd in his Likeneſs, and gave
the <hi>French</hi> an account of his Exploits,
which ſo well pleas'd the Privateers,
that they highly applauded him. But
<hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> full of Revenge for the
good Booty he had loſt, requeſted the
Captains to ſpare him a little Money,
and ſix men beſides his two Comrades;
for that he was reſolv'd once more to
try his Fortune upon the ſame Coaſt;
which Requeſt of his was not only
granted, but one of the <hi>French</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
mainly pleas'd, both with <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> and his Propoſals, reſolv'd to
make one of the Company, and for his
ſecurity, took his Commiſſion with
him, which was for both Land and
Sea. By this time, the other Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56677:112"/>
had retaken the two loſt Prizes,
and ſo they all ſteer'd directly for <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi>
taking the Valiant Defender of
his Country along with them, to feed
upon the ſame Bread of Affliction
which he had intended for <hi>Don Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo.</hi>
So various are the Chances of
whimſical War. At the ſame time, <hi>D.
Tomazo,</hi> the Captain and his Crew,
took a ſmall Boat, and made for the
Land; and being got aſhore, parted
Company, and went by couples dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
to <hi>Rotterdam.</hi> Where, after they
had continued four days, they found
probability enough of good ſtore of
Purchaſe, though not ſo rich as what
<hi>Tomazo</hi> had already loſt. But the main
Booty they had fix'd their Eyes upon,
was a great Fly-boat, which lay in the
Road before <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> but that day
return'd from <hi>Cadiz,</hi> very richly La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
having in her a Months Proviſion,
twenty four Guns mounted, all her Sails
furl'd to the Yard, and above half her
Men gone aſhore. This Veſſel <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> and his Crew reſolv'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque
in the Night. And for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56677:113"/>
carrying on of their Enterpriſe, D.
<hi>Tomazo</hi> with the Company, went to a
Village call'd <hi>Lyren Damm,</hi> and ſet it
a fire; to the end, that while the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were buſi'd for their own Security,
they might with more freedom do their
own Work. Which fell out very lucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for the Fire had conſum'd ſix Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and four Ships. During which time,
<hi>D. Tomazo</hi> and his Company had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Fly-boat from ſeventeen Men
that guarded it. Who being ſecur'd
without any Noiſe, they cut the Cables,
and let the Veſſel drive with the Tide,
before they loos'd ſo much as one Sail:
till being almoſt out of ſight, they
ſpread their Canvaſs Wings, and made
all the way they could. So kindly
does one Miſchief aſſiſt another.</p>
            <p>Being now got below the <hi>Brill,</hi> they
ſpi'd a very gay Pleaſure-Boat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Sail, and bound for <hi>Rotterdam.</hi>
At the ſight of which they brought
their Ship to an Anchor, man'd out
their Long-boat, and Boarded the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Yacht with the uſual Fury that the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56677:113"/>
hope of Purchaſe inſpires, that they
ſoon made themſelves Maſters of her,
four great <hi>Minheirs,</hi> and their Wives, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with nine men more, and four
Seamen. Theſe fine Folks had been
taking their Pleaſure all the day before
at Sea; but <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
got the Profit of their Voyage at
Night, which conſiſted of ſeveral good
Watches, Jewels, Necklaces of Pearl,
and Chains of Gold, to a conſiderable
Value. The Pleaſure-Boat they ſunk,
and then carri'd all their Pris'ners aboard
their great Veſſel, who being diſpos'd
of, they weigh'd Anchor, and ſet Sail,
till they were clear out at Sea. At
what time, they put the <hi>Minheirs</hi> and
their Company into the two Shallops,
which they had made uſe of for
the Conqueſt of their Prize, and ſent
them home to bewail their Loſſes, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
above a League to the Shore.
While the <hi>Minheirs</hi> and their Wives
were lamenting the ſowre Sawce to
their ſweet Jollity, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> and
his Crew divided the Spoil, and being
aſſiſted with a thumping Gale at <hi>Nore
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56677:114"/>
Nore-Eaſt,</hi> in a ſhort time arriv'd in
<hi>Oſtend</hi> Road; where, being ſpi'd by
a Privateer belonging to the Town,
who gueſs'd her to be a Prize taken
by the <hi>French,</hi> he gave her Chaſe, and
in two Hours reach'd her. <hi>Don To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo,</hi>
and the Captain his Comrade,
would not fire ſo much as one Gun,
till the <hi>Oſtender</hi> was come within half
Shot; but then bringing four Guns
double laden, to bear upon him all at a
time, they ſo rak'd his Sides, that not
liking his Entertainment, he ſprung his
Luff, and lay by to repair his dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
while <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> kept on his
Courſe, and in twelve or fourteen
hours after, arrived ſafe in the <hi>Splin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Arrival of <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> with this
Prize, was more welcome to his own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
then Summer to the Swallow.
Who, after they had highly careſs'd and
entertain'd him, expos'd the Ship
and Goods to Sale; and upon Receipt
of their Money, gave <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> and
his Fellow Captain 4600 <hi>l.</hi> for their
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56677:114"/>
Shares, the Ship and Cargo being
worth eight times as much, conſidering
that there was found at the Bottom of
the Veſſel, a great Cheſt, crouded with
<hi>Pieces of Eight,</hi> not leſs worth then
two thirds of the Purchaſe. <hi>Don To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>
and the Captain thus contented
and ſatisfi'd, generouſly rewarded the
Seamen with 300 <hi>l.</hi> a man, and gave
the Priſoners which they had brought
along with them twenty Crowns a
piece to bear their Expences home.
Wherein they ſhew'd nineteen times
more full Ounces of Charity, then
the <hi>Dutch</hi> had ſhewn them before
at <hi>Harling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> being now at ſome lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
began to enquire after his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Friend <hi>Don Pedro;</hi> concerning
whom he had this Account, That
<hi>Don Pedro</hi> had been alſo put into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Prize, and that they fear'd he
had undergone the ſame Misfortune
which <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> had ſuffer'd upon
the Coaſt of <hi>Amelandt.</hi> Soon after,
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> receiv'd a Letter from
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56677:115"/>
               <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> that the Ship with which
he had been intruſted, was caſt away:
which Letter was writ, not for any
Truth that it contain'd, but only for
the cold Comfort and Satisfaction of
the Owners. For indeed the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
had agreed with <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> to
run the Ship to <hi>Leith,</hi> and there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
her to Sale. But the <hi>Scots</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too cunning for them, laid up
the Veſſel, and only gave <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi>
and his Mates enough to bear
their Charges to <hi>Dunkirk;</hi> ſo that
upon their Return, they were forc'd
to make good the Truth of <hi>Don
Pedro</hi>'s Letter, by affirming the Loſs
of the Prize; which was too true to
their Coſt.</p>
            <p>The two <hi>Dons</hi> being thus reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and having drown'd in the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the land the Memory of their
Salt-water Afflictions, and purg'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the ſcorbutic Humours of
hung Beef, and <hi>Groynland</hi> Fiſh, reſolv'd
to try their Talents once more upon the
<hi>Terra Firma.</hi> In Purſuit of which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56677:115"/>
away they went to the
Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi>'s Army then
encamped not far from <hi>Mons.</hi> So
ſoon as they came thither, upon
their Addreſſes to the Duke, they
were both admitted Voluntiers in
his own Regiment of Foot, and
ſoon after advanced, D. <hi>Pedro</hi> to
be youngeſt Lieutenant, and <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> to be youngeſt Enſign in
the ſame Regiment; the Duke not
ſuſpecting in the leaſt, that one of
theſe two was the Perſon that had
put ſo many Furberies upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> his
Predeceſſor. About half a year
had theſe two Dons enjoy'd their
Commiſſions, at what time the
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Armies met at
<hi>Cenneff,</hi> which occaſion'd a moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Fight, wherein to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
Grief of <hi>Don Tomazo, Don
Pedro</hi> was ſlain, and <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>
himſelf taken Priſoner, and which
was worſt of all, by a Party of
Horſe, that belong'd to <hi>Salazar</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:56677:116"/>
of <hi>Antwerp</hi> Caſtle, of whom
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> had borrow'd the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
and Horſes in the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi>'s Name. Theſe needy <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
having uncas'd <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi>
found in his Pockets ſeveral rough
Draughts of <hi>Antwerp, Mechlen, Ipre,
Lovain, Gant,</hi> and ſeveral other
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſons; upon which they
conjectur'd him to be a Spy, and
ſo publickly declar'd him to be.
The Noiſe of a Spy's being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in time of Fight, and by his
own men, made the old Count
eagerly deſirous to ſee this ſame
Thief of Intelligence; But no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
did <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> appear in his
Sight, but the Cunning Governour
at firſt View without Spectacles,
knew him to be the Perſon that he
had furniſh'd with the Money and
Horſes, as already has been related.
So that without any farther Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> was commited
cloſe Priſoner to <hi>Antwerp</hi> Caſtle,
and by the Counts Order, guarded
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56677:116"/>
day and night by four Sentinels, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
any Diſcourſe, or Conveyance of
Letters. This ſevere Confinement laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about four Months. In which time
the Misfortunes of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
had entred the Colledge of <hi>Jeſuits</hi>
at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and was more particularly
taken notice of by one Father <hi>Worſeley,</hi>
who was the only man among them
that made it his buſineſs to gain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes.
He therefore, at the Inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Zeal prevail'd with the
Count, to diſcourſe <hi>Don Tomazo:</hi> A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
eaſily obtain'd by one of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Function. When Father <hi>Worſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
came to diſcourſe <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
Heavens, what a Refreſhing it was
to him! For he had not ſpoken to any
Perſon whatever in ten Weeks before.
Preſently <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> beſought the Old
Father to take his Confeſſion, (for <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> ſhrewdly gueſſing at the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of his Charitable Viſit, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to prevent him of the Trouble
of a Converſion) which he did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
and therein, as <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> had
order'd it, had ſome ſort of Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56677:117"/>
of <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s Caſe. From
thence forward, the Old Father lookt
upon him as his Pupil, procur'd him a
better Proviſion of Diet and Lodging,
and came often to viſit him, as well to
confirm him in his Faith, as to fathom
the Bottom of his Crime. And at
length, the Father's good Opinion of
his Penitent, mov'd him to ſo much
Compaſſion, that having throughly
ſifted his Caſe, and underſtanding, that
the Draughts which the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
found in his Pockets, were the Effects
of his Employment under the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> and that the Prince had been
preſented with all the Copies of them,
he reſolv'd to take a Journey to the
Prince to know the Truth of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which he ſoon found to be real;
and that the Prince was ſorry for <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>'s
Misfortune.</p>
            <p>During theſe Negotiations of the
Old Father, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> was brought
before a Court Marſhal, convicted for
a Spie, and ſentenc'd to be ſhot to
Death by two Files of Muſqueteers;
but upon <hi>Don Tomazo</hi>'s Application, he
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:56677:117"/>
was allow'd five Days Time for him to
prepare himſelf for another World, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he knowing of the Father's Journey,
nor the Father of his Condition. But it
luckily fell out, that the Old Father
return'd before two of the five Days
were expir'd, and brought along with
him a Letter from the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
to the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
the great deſire he had that
<hi>Don Tomazo</hi> ſhould be diſcharg'd. But
the Old Father, having all the Count's
Revenge, and Intereſt at Court to deal
with, found it hard to get the Prince's
Letter allow'd: ſo that all he could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
for the preſent, was a Reprieve for
fourteen days longer. In that time
the Father made another Journey to
the Prince, and then return'd with
two Letters, one to the Duke, and
another to the Count, which gave
them both ſuch Satisfaction, that <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> was order'd to be diſcharg'd.
But the Old Father deſirous to try
whether <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> were a true Son
of the Church or no, kept him ſtill
in ignorance of his Proceedings; and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56677:118"/>
ſtill admoniſh'd him to prepare for
Death, as <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> did according to
all the ceremonies of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church,
as being indifferent to him ſince he
muſt die of what Religion he died. So
that now the time prefixt being quite
expir'd, <hi>Tomazo</hi> was brought to the
Tree, bound faſt, the Souldiers in
his ſight ready preſented, the Old
Man on his Right Hand, the few Eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
he had were ſpent, and he
ready to give the Sign, when the Old
Father ſeeing the Conſtancy of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Son, unbound him, and with
Tears embrac'd him (an odd kind of
Ambition in thoſe People to heighten
the Merits of their Obligations) crying
out, <hi>My Son, thou ſhalt not die, for
God has intended thee for ſome good and
Pious Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> thus diſcharg'd was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the old Father to the Jeſuits
Colledge, where the Members of the
Order, rais'd him a Collection of thirty
ſeven pound, which put him into an
Equipage to return to the <hi>French</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
where he was no ſooner arrived,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56677:118"/>
but he was inform'd by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was ſlain, that all
their Equipage and Money was ſeiz'd,
for that the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> had
underſtood, as indeed their Papers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
no leſs, that his Lieutenant
and Enſign, had been both Spies for
the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> It was a hard caſe
for a man to loſe all the Treaſure and
ſweet Booty, for which he had ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ventur'd his Life; but <hi>Don Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi>
rather choſe to abandon all, then
ſtand to the Mercy of the Duke of
<hi>Luxemburgh;</hi> and ſo with a heavy and
diſconſolate Heart, he took his way
for <hi>Calice,</hi> from thence he croſs'd over
to <hi>Dover,</hi> and ſo came directly to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being come to <hi>London,</hi> his firſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
was to find out an Aſſociate
fit for his Turn, of which he could not
well miſs among ſo much Variety. So
that having leagu'd himſelf with one
(as he thought) according to his heart's
deſire, and rais'd a ſmall Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
they two fell to the Old Trade of
Counterfeiting Gold. So that in a ſhort
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56677:119"/>
time, they had made and utter'd a
conſiderable quantity, preſuming to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
ſeveral Parts wherein <hi>Don Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi>
had been before. Which bold
Attempt prov'd very unſucceſsful. For
having diſpers'd ſeveral of their Illegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
Guineys in <hi>Wiliſhire, Dorſet</hi> and
<hi>Hampſhire,</hi> they were purſu'd and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> and both upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
committed to <hi>Dorcheſter</hi>
Priſon.</p>
            <p>Some time after, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> was
remov'd to <hi>Sarum,</hi> there to be try'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law for his Offences
committed in thoſe Parts. A thing that
could not be avoided; ſo that he was
convicted, and ſuffer'd the penalty of
his Sentence: and which added to his
Affliction, he had no fair Proſpect of
his Releaſe, as not having wherewithal
to ſatisfie the irreſiſtable Demands of
the Jaylor. But Fortune, ſometimes his
Friend, as well as ſometimes his Foe,
ſoon found out a way to bring him out
of this Labyrinth. For in a ſhort time
after, one of the tender Sex, among
whom he had always a Friend in a
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56677:119"/>
Corner, came and made him a viſit ſo
full handed, that <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> ſoon pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd
the Liberty of his Heels. Which
being obtain'd, away he comes for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi>
where he firſt ſought out, and
ſoon found a Companion. For Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſeldom proſpers without Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.
This Companion of his lent him
his helping hand to the Old Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for they knew that the readieſt
way to have Money, was to make it
themſelves. And therefore, after they
had ſtor'd themſelves with a ſufficient
parcel of their own Manufacture, and
were able to ſet up for themſelves, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
they gallop to <hi>Newmarket,</hi> where
it was their courſe to bett high, but
never both of the ſame ſide. So that if
the one loſt, the other was ſure to win:
and the Gains of the one, eaſily made
good the others Loſſes: for the loſs of
near a hundred Guineys of <hi>Don To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo</hi>'s
quaint ſort of Metal, did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to above Seven pound. This
Trade continu'd for ſome time with
good Succeſs; there being hardly a
Horſe-race, or a Cock-match that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap'd
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56677:120"/>
the two Guiney-merchants. But
that trade failing at length, <hi>D. Tom.</hi> and
his Companion turn'd Graziers, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting
the Fairs and Markets up and
down the Country, bought ſeveral Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
of Cattel with their unlawful Coin;
for which, when they had driven them
off to another place, they ſoon found
Chapmen, as being Perſons that could
eaſily afford good Peniworths. But
the Cries of the Country Farmers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be ſo loud, when they found
what a bad Exchange they had made,
that <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> and his Companion
not able to endure the Noiſe, were
forc'd, after a Trade of four Months
continuance, to quit a Calling ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to all the Landlords and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
in the Country. So true is the
Proverb, <hi>That nothing violent is of long
Continuance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, no where ſafe, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
lying under the Curſe of waſting
perpetually what was ill got, the two
Knights of the Order of Induſtry, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to take their Pleaſure at Sea.
To which purpoſe they bought them
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56677:120"/>
a Veſſel of about Forty Tuns, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
man'd her with perſons fit for their
purpoſe, they lay perdue, ſometimes
in the River's Mouth, ſometimes in
the Chanel, to meet with Merchants
Veſſels that were homeward bound.
Out of which, <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> and his
Friend bought ſeveral good Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths
of the Seamen with their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Gold, till they had almoſt load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Veſſel. Which done, away
they made for ſome convenient Port,
and expos'd their Goods to Sale for
good Money. This was a way leſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous,
but very expenſive, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not anſwering expectation, was
ſoon laid aſide.</p>
            <p>The Sea Trade failing for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and the two Merchants near broke,
D. <hi>Tomazo</hi> and his Comrade parted,
after which D. <hi>Tomazo</hi> taking a Journey
into <hi>Berkſhire,</hi> to ſow his Yellow Grain
in that Soyle, was apprehended, and
committed to Priſon for endeavouring
to enrich that County with his pretious
Wealth. There he was kept half a year
in Durance, and ſorely threatn'd
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56677:121"/>
to be ſent to Heaven in a String; but
not liking that way of travelling to
Bliſs, he ſo order'd his Affairs, that he
was diſcharg'd without any Tryal,
though cruelly grip'd with the pangs
of Poverty. For when the Priſon
Doors were open'd to him, all his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
was but three ſhillings. But In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
ſoon increaſt it. For out of
that ſmall Sum, one being a Mill'd ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
he preſently made a Counterfeit
Guiney, and paſt it off with a <hi>Certio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari</hi>
for good. Which fruitful Return,
ſoon produc'd a new Recruit; ſo that
in a ſhort time, he ſaw himſelf the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of two goodly Twins, or Bags
of a hundred pound a piece, begot by
his own labour. This round Sum
warm'd his Invention, and put him in
an Equipage to go on with a New Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
In order to which, away he returns
for <hi>London,</hi> hires ſeveral Servants fit
for his purpoſe, according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of <hi>Trim-tram,</hi> and takes at leaſt
fourteen or fifteen Lodgings of good
Note in the City. Which Lodgings
were generally near the Shop-keeper,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56677:121"/>
or the Merchant that was to ſuffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Contrivance. Theſe Boroughs
of his, he would viſit ſeveral times in
a day, lying ſometimes at one and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
at another, till he had lain a
night a piece in each; which being, as
he thought, long enough, he began
his Frolick as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> ſtaid in his Lodging,
and ſent a Servant, as it might be, croſs
the way to a Goldſmith, to bring him
ſuch and ſuch Parcels of Rings and
Jewels of ſuch a ſort to ſhew them his
Maſter. Preſently either the Goldſmith
or his Man came along with the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
in hopes of ſome great Cuſtomer.
But when <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> had fix'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch Jewels and Rings which he
ſeem'd to like beſt, and agree'd upon
the Price, the Goldſmith having left
the main Purchaſe with <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi>
was deſir'd to walk up another pair of
Stairs with his Servant, if the Houſe
admitted of ſuch a Conveniency, there
to receive his Money. But no ſooner
was the Goldſmith in the Trap, but
the Servant, who you may be ſure was
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56677:122"/>
a ſpecial Trout, lock'd the Door up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the poor Mouſe, and preſently both
Maſter and Man ſlipt away together.
At another place, having bought ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parcel of the ſame Commodities at
the ſame Rate, he would ſend his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
with the owner of the Goods to
ſome Caſhier or Banker of Note, to be
there paid for his coſtly Ware, and
while his Truſty Servant and the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith
were trotting to the Receipt of
of Cuſtom, away tript D. <hi>Tomazo</hi> to
another Lodging, leaving his Servant
to make his Eſcape and ſhift for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
as well as he could. And of ſuch an
Exploit as this, a certain Goldſmith in
<hi>Lumbard Street</hi> had the Misfortune to
have the woful Experience to the loſs
of 275 <hi>l. 17 s. 6 d.</hi> Now you are to
underſtand, that when D. <hi>Tomazo</hi> had
once begun his Diabolical Progreſs, he
us'd all the Expedition imaginable in
his diſpatches, and removals from place
to place, in regard it behov'd him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to leave off till he had made an
effectual Viſit at all his particular A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodes;
which was done to all Intents
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56677:122"/>
and Purpoſes in the ſpace of nine hours,
by which he got more then the beſt
Day-labourer that works at <hi>Pauls:</hi>
the reward of thoſe few Hours pains,
amounting to no leſs then 1625 <hi>l.</hi> For
he look'd upon it as a Calling too mean
for one of his Quality to make Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
Shoes.</p>
            <p>But this Trick made too great a noiſe
to be plaid over again. So that <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> was resolv'd to knock off, and
live for ſome time upon the Spoil. In
order whereunto, like an honeſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
he firſt diſcharg'd all his Servants,
to whom he gave 35 <hi>l.</hi> a piece, which
amounted to 525 <hi>l.</hi> there being fifteen
in all; and then retir'd into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
But neither could he there reſt
long; for though he went under the
moſt abſolute diſguiſe imaginable, yet it
would ſo happen, that ſome or other
ſtill knew him. So that in ſhort, by
removing from place to place, and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the rate of a Lord, his maſſie
Sum in two years, was reduc'd to an
hundred and fifty pound, with which
D. <hi>Tomazo</hi> ſet forward again for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:56677:123"/>
the only Stage proper for a <hi>Guſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
to act his parts upon, in order to
the projecting ſome new Enterprize.
But no ſooner was he come to Town,
but a Gentleman of <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> with
whom D. <hi>Tomazo</hi> had been traffiquing
by way of Exchange, to the value of
170 <hi>l.</hi> met him in the Street, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to make a Noiſe, which D. <hi>Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi>
finding no way convenient for his
Intereſt, whiſper'd the Gentleman in
the Ear. Which gentle motion of <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi>'s Lips, having conveigh'd to
his irritated Senſes, a ſhort promiſe of
Satisfaction, ſtopt the violent motion
of the Gentleman's Tongue. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
away they went to the Tavern,
where <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> would fain have
been rid of his troubleſome Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but he ſtuck ſo cloſe to him, and
kept him ſo charily within the reach
of his Eye, that <hi>Don Tomazo,</hi> to his
unſpeakable Grief, was forc'd to come
to Compoſition, and to pay the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
120 <hi>l.</hi> This forc'd Putt of Moral
Satisfaction brought <hi>Don Tomazo</hi> very
low. Hating therefore that Want
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56677:123"/>
ſhould be his Maſter, he reſolv'd to have one
ſtroak more with his Hammer, and ſo fell to the
old Trade of Coining. Which work, by the help
of two more Aſſiſtants, being compleated, and a
good ſtock of Pieces being made, they had laid their
Deſign to take a Ramble into <hi>Eſſex</hi> to diſpoſe of
their Gold, that made others poor and themſelves
rich. Being upon their Journey, they took <hi>Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
in their way, where one of the Sparks, having
his Pockets full of Gold, would needs have the
World to take notice of it; and to that end, at a
place where he and his Companions had call'd to
drink a Bottle of Wine, pull'd out his Gold by
handfuls, and exchang'd one of his counterfeit
<hi>Guineys</hi> to pay the Reckoning. The King's Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
dazl'd the Vintner's Eyes at firſt; but they
were no ſooner gone, but, happily for <hi>Eſsex,</hi> the
Cheat was diſcover'd, which put the whole Town
upon a ſwift purſuit, and ſuch a one as prov'd
indeed ſo very ſwift, that the whole knot of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-changers
was quite unti'd, all of them taken
and carri'd over the Fields to a Juſtice of the
Peace. By which means <hi>D. Tomazo</hi> took the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to diſpoſe of his <hi>Guineys</hi> in the long graſs.
Nevertheleſs, that poor ſhift would not do, <hi>Don
Tomazo</hi> was ſent to <hi>Newgate</hi> for Company, try'd
at the <hi>Old Baily</hi> for Company, and fin'd 50 <hi>l.</hi> for
Company, and ſo was remanded to <hi>Newgate</hi> for
Company, where he lay a whole year, not able to
pay his Fine; and at length obtain'd His Majeſties
Moſt Gracious Pardon, by which he was diſcharg'd.</p>
            <p>Having this ill luck in Company, he fell to the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:56677:124"/>
old Trade alone, with the aſſiſtance only of one
Servant. But whether Fortune had taken a peek a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaid
Coiners, or whether <hi>Mercury</hi> were turn'd ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
and had diſpos'd of his Influencies another
way, ſo it hapn'd, that <hi>D. Tomazo</hi> having ſent his
Boy to the Silver Market one Evening in the ſhape
of a Vintner's Servant, to exchange ſome few coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Guineys, the raw Meſſenger was taken,
carri'd before a Magiſtrate, examin'd, and upon
his Examination diſcover'd his Maſter. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>D. Tomazo</hi> was as ſoon apprehended, and ſent
to wait upon his Man to <hi>Newgate.</hi> 'Twas an ill
jobb for one Misfortune ſo ſoon to fall upon the
neck of one another; But there was no avoiding
theſe home-thruſts of Fate. And therefore <hi>D. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazo,</hi>
to make the beſt of a bad Market, made all
his Applications to his Servant, and ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
upon his good Nature, to recant his Charge
againſt his Maſter, and take the whole buſineſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himſelf; which he did, with that exactneſs and
fidelity, that <hi>D. Tomazo</hi> being try'd firſt, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted.
But being forc'd to lie a good while before
he could purchaſe his Liberty, as being charg'd
with Actions to a great value; then it was that Mrs.
<hi>Cellier,</hi> having heard of <hi>D. Tomazo</hi>'s Fame, and
believing him brisk for her turn, gave him her firſt
Viſits, which produc'd thoſe Tranſactions between
them, that have lately made ſo great a Noiſe in
the World. For an account whereof, the Reader
is refer'd to the Narratives themſelves.</p>
