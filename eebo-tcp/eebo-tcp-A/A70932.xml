            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The <hi>Assertion,</hi> That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever will come after Christ must <hi>take up his crosse, and deny himself</hi> v. 24. The <hi>Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> from three great <hi>scandals</hi> which this severe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Crosse was attended withall. 1. <hi>Death</hi> and this taken away, <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will save his life shall lose it, and whosoever wil loose his life for my sake, shall finde it.</hi> The way to attain <hi>life eternal,</hi> is to lay down a <hi>mortal life,</hi> when the glory of Christ and his service cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us thereunto: 2. Another great <hi>scandall</hi> of the Cross is, that it strips us of the <hi>world,</hi> and the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55399:5"/>
comforts and delights thereof, this is removed, <hi>v.</hi> 26. Admit a man could not onely escape the <hi>Cross</hi> by forsaking Christ, but exchange him away for <hi>all the world,</hi> and make himself master of all the comforts which a confluence of all worldy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions could pour into his bosome, yet if after all this he must die, and lose his soul, and that for ever without possibility of recovery, he would in the issue finde it but an unprofitable bargain. 3 .The last <hi>scandal</hi> of the Cross is the <hi>Ignominy,</hi> and <hi>shame</hi> of it. In which respect Christ is said to have taken unto him the <hi>form of a servant, Phil.</hi> 2.7. (because the death of the Cross was <hi>servile supplicium,</hi>

            <p>The words of the Text contain the removal of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55399:5"/>
the second great <hi>scandal,</hi> which the Disciples might be apt to take at this doctrine of <hi>selfe deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</hi> They hoped, as it may seem, to be great men in the world, and to enjoy the liberties and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours thereof; and now they are told that they must <hi>leave all</hi> to follow Christ. And least they should be offended, he assures them that if they should do otherwise, and for love of the world should forsake him, 1. They would lose their <hi>souls,</hi> which is better to them then all the rest of the world: 2.

            <p>The words are set down by way of <hi>Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> intimating a more vehement Negation, <hi>What shall it profit</hi>? That is, It shall not at all profit. It carrieth a kinde of <hi>universal concession,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable truth in it, which no man can deny. Even they themselves who cast away their souls to gaine the world, cannot, themselves being Judges, but confess, that it is an absurd thing to expect profit from any thing when the soul is lost, or to prefer all the world above a mans own eternal happiness. When a thing is exceeding manifest, the Scripture useth io make <hi>men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> whom it would thereby reprove, the <hi>Iudges</hi> of it. <hi>Iudge in your selves,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13. and the Lord in the Prophet, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.3.4. <hi>O inhabitants of Judah, Judge I pray you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and my vineyard.</hi> And elsewhere, <hi>Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel, saith the

It is dangerous venturing on such an Error, <hi>in quo non licet bis peccare,</hi> in which being once involved, a man can never get out again.

            <p>The words have many particulars couched in them by way both of <hi>Supposition, and of Position.</hi> I shal reduce all unto this one Proposition; As Christ doth allow his servants to be moved by Considerations of <hi>gain</hi> in his service, so he doth withall assure us, That this <hi>gaine</hi> doth not stand in winning of the <hi>world,</hi> but in saving of the <hi>soule</hi> That the <hi>soul</hi> being infinitly more precious then

               </gap>ll the <hi>world,</hi> therefore the <hi>gaining</hi> of the world is nothing but <hi>losse,</hi> where the <hi>loss</hi> of the soul is the purchase of that <hi>gain</hi>; in asmuch as the <hi>world</hi> being gained, cannot be kept; and the <hi>soul</hi> being lost, can never be recovered. All men have a <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise</hi> and trade to drive in this world, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth depend the issue of their profit, or damage; therein their principal wisdome is to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and poise their <hi>gains and losses</hi> so as that they may thrive and prosper in this their trade; <hi>wordly love</hi> is a great obstruction unto the true <hi>gain</hi> which a wise Christian should pursue. They who for preserving that, do take offence at the crosse of Christ, will suffer damage in their <hi>souls</hi>; the love of the <hi>world</hi> and the love of the <hi>soul</hi> being inconsistent: Since therefore both will not stand together; and of the two, the <hi>soul</hi> is much more precious and excellent then the <hi>world,</hi> therefore a wise Christian should have his trade heavenward for the inriching of his <hi>soul,</hi> rather then downward for the possession of the <hi>world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The branches then to be touched are three:</p>
            <p>1 The lawfulness of a Christians looking after true <hi>gain.</hi> 2. The inordinateness of <hi>worldly love,</hi> and inconsistency thereof with true Christian <hi>gain.</hi> 3. The preciousness of the <hi>soul</hi> of man; in saving, advancing and inriching whereof, this true <hi>gain</hi> doth consist.</p>

            <p>We see Christ allows us to eye our own profit in his service. In what sense we may, or may not this do, may be briefly thus resolved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We may not respect <hi>profit</hi> or advantage as the <hi>ultimate end</hi> of our obedience. Gods <hi>glory</hi> being simply the <hi>supream</hi> of Ends in it self, should accordingly be so unto us.<note place="margin">

            <p n="2">2. We must not respect <hi>profit</hi> and reward as the <hi>onely reason</hi> of our obedience, without which we would not do God any service at all, for this would be a meer <hi>mercenary</hi> and <hi>servile</hi> considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The chief <hi>reasons</hi> of obedience are, our <hi>subjection</hi> to Gods authority over us, because he is the Lord; our <hi>faith, love,</hi> and <hi>thankfulness</hi> for his Covenant of grace, because he is our God.

What an unnatural and <hi>incongruous</hi> thing would it be for <hi>Angels</hi> to turn <hi>worldlings,</hi> and reasonable <hi>souls</hi> have the self-same

blessedness to look after as <hi>Angels</hi> have.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is <hi>unnecessary.</hi> for had one man <hi>all the world,</hi> he could have no more out of it himself, then one <hi>back,</hi> and one <hi>belly,</hi> and the exigences of one <hi>person</hi> did require; whatever is more, he doth <hi>but behold with his eyes,</hi> Ecles. 5.11. God is said to give us <hi>all things richly to enjoy,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.8, 17. He that hath sufficient to answer the <hi>necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>decency</hi> of his <hi>estate,</hi> is therefore said to have <hi>all</hi> because he hath as full a supply, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those purposes all the world could make him. A <hi>little which the righteous hath, is better then the riches of many wicked,</hi> Psal. 37.16. <hi>Iacob</hi> was not so wealthy a man as <hi>Esau,</hi> yet <hi>Iacob</hi> said, <hi>I have all, Esau</hi> said, <hi>I have much.</hi> Jacobs <hi>little</hi> was <hi>all</hi>; Esaus <hi>more,</hi> was but <hi>much.</hi> Gen. 33.9.11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a <hi>disquieting</hi> thing. <hi>Disquiets</hi> in the <hi>possessing.</hi> Riches are compared to thorns, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.21. a man cannot hug them without being <hi>pierced</hi> by them, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 6.10. <hi>Disquiets</hi> in the <hi>parting</hi>; there is <hi>sorrow and wrath in his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Eccles.</hi> 5.17. What a torment is it to <hi>flay</hi> off the skin of a man alive? Now the soul by <hi>inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate love</hi> doth cleave closer to the <hi>world,</hi> then the <hi>skin</hi> to the flesh, and therfore is not torn from it without great paine. It is the saddest sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in the world to a rich fool, Thou hast heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up for many years, but within a few houres the cold armes of death shall graspe thee, and carry thee to Gods tribunal. O what can <hi>riches</hi> or multitudes of <hi>riches do a man good in that day of

wrath?</hi> If a Prince had a <hi>stone</hi> in his <hi>bladder</hi> too big to be removed, all the Jewels of his crown could not purchase him a recovery. What then can treasures avail against <hi>worm</hi> gnawing in the <hi>Conscience?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall conclude this Point with these limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</p>
            <p n="1">1. We may <hi>use</hi> the world, and with diligent labour procure the things which we need, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We may imploy our <hi>heads,</hi> as well as our <hi>hands,</hi> for <hi>labour</hi> without <hi>wisdome</hi> to guide it, is but a <hi>weary idleness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We may receive the things of this world from God in Christ as a fruit of his <hi>gracious Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We may lay up and <hi>provide</hi> for our selves, and those that belong unto us so far as the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities</hi> of life, and <hi>decency</hi> of our particular state and condition do admit. Christ himself had a <hi>bag</hi> in his family, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.29. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. But we may not <hi>love,</hi> nor <hi>set our hearts</hi> upon the world: <hi>When riches increase, set not your heart upon them.</hi> The <hi>world</hi> is for the <hi>back</hi> and the <hi>belly,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> onely is for the <hi>heart.</hi> Though we may eye our own <hi>gain,</hi> yet the <hi>gain</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> is not that <hi>gain</hi> which we are chiefly to eye. The <hi>soul</hi> being the most precious thing which a man hath, the saving, and inriching thereof, is the <hi>only true Christian gain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, Take the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> here for <hi>life,</hi> and even so the truth of the Text will hold; what gain is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55399:14"/>
it to get the world, and to lose the life, <hi>Is not the life more then meat, and the body then raiment?</hi> Luke 12.23.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All the <hi>world</hi> cannot hold or lengthen life beyond the <hi>period</hi> set it by God. <hi>Our times are in his hand, Psal.</hi> 31.15. the <hi>efficacy</hi> of all second causes is suspended upon his <hi>blessing,</hi> man liveth not by bread alone, <hi>but by every word which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth out of the mouth of God,</hi> Mat. 4.4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Life is necessary to the enjoyment of the world, what good doth <hi>light, without</hi> an <hi>eye</hi> to see it? Or <hi>musick,</hi> with out an <hi>ear</hi> to hear it? what good do <hi>dainties,</hi> without a <hi>mouth</hi> to tast them? Or <hi>Crowns,</hi> without an <hi>Head</hi> to wear them? Nay, a man may have his life so clog'd with sickness, sorrow, discontent of mind, distress of conscience, that all the world shall not suffice to revive and comfort him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When <hi>life</hi> is lost, the <hi>world</hi> is all lost with it, a <hi>living porter,</hi> is richer then a <hi>dead Prince</hi>; death translates properties. If a man purchase land to <hi>himself</hi> for <hi>ever,</hi> that <hi>ever</hi> is no longer then his <hi>own life,</hi> if he will have the purchase extend fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he must put in his <hi>heirs</hi> with himself.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Take the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for the <hi>soul,</hi> as <hi>Luke:</hi> 12.19, 20. and then the truth holds much more. For 1. If a man could keepe his <hi>soul</hi> and the <hi>world</hi> together, there is so vast a <hi>dis-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi> between them, that the one could never <hi>replenish</hi> the other, 2. If it could satisfie it for a time, yet it would cloy and <hi>satiate</hi> it at the last; there is <hi>excesse</hi> in wordly enioyments, and all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55399:14"/>
               <hi>excess</hi> is nauseous and painful. 3. If they could replenish and not cloy, that there were a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurateness between them, yet there is not an equality of <hi>duration. One generation,</hi> saith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, passeth away, and another cometh, but the earth abideth, Eccles.</hi> 1.4. If when a man goes away, the earth did go with him, happily the same content which he found in it here, he would find in it elsewhere, but when he goes, and that stayes behinde him, all the content which he had in the <hi>fruition,</hi> doth vanish in the <hi>separation.</hi> 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parted the <hi>soul</hi> must be <hi>for ever,</hi> as long as God is merciful to save, or just to punish, and what comfort is it, think we <hi>in hell,</hi> for a man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the <hi>pleasures</hi> of a short life; of which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing there remains but the <hi>worm</hi> and the <hi>sting?</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alexis apud Athenaeum. l.</hi> 10.</note> The Poet could say, <hi>If the headach did come first, no man would be drunk.</hi> If men could feel but a little of <hi>hell,</hi> before they sin, they would easily by that understand how empty and vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pleasures of lust are, and how easily extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished in a tormented Conscience, as a <hi>drop</hi> of <hi>wine</hi> loseth all its sweetness in a <hi>barrel of water.</hi> Again, what addition is it to the joyes of <hi>heaven,</hi> for a man to recount the comforts of a perishing <hi>world?</hi> What content takes a grave wealthy learned man, in remembring the joy which in his childhood he was wont to take in his top, and counters? 5. The nature of the soul is <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi> and must have <hi>spiritual objects</hi> to converse about. <hi>Sensitive</hi> faculties may be delighted with <hi>material</hi> objects: Meer <hi>natural reason</hi> may

gaze with some content upon the beauty, order, contexture, concatenation of <hi>natural causes</hi> and effects. But the <hi>supream spiritual</hi> part of the soul is of a more high and noble extraction, then ultimately to delight it self in any thing but in <hi>God</hi> from whom it was breathed. It is capable of the <hi>knowledg of God,</hi> whom to know is perfect wisdome and eternal life. It is capable of the <hi>image and grace of God,</hi> of righteousness and true holiness to beautifie, and renew it: Capable of the <hi>peace</hi> of God, of the <hi>joy</hi> of his salvation, of the <hi>earnest,</hi> the <hi>seed,</hi> the <hi>seal,</hi> the <hi>witness</hi> of his Spirit, of the sense of his <hi>love</hi> in Christ, which is <hi>unspeakable</hi> and <hi>glorious.</hi> Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of that <hi>fulness of joy</hi> which is in his presence and of those everlasting pleasures, and rivers of comfort which are at his <hi>right hand.</hi> Capable of the heavy <hi>wrath</hi> of God, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>fear</hi> or the <hi>fancy</hi> of man to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. As the <hi>goodness</hi> of God exceeds our <hi>faith,</hi> so the <hi>anger</hi> of God exceeds our <hi>feare</hi> 6. The dignity of the soul appears by the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual enemies</hi> which war against it: Of whom we may say as the Prophet of the <hi>Medes,</hi> Isai. 13.17. that they <hi>regard not silver or gold,</hi> they fight neither aganst house, nor land, but against the soul only: Satan saies as the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> unto <hi>Abram, Gen.</hi> 14.21. <hi>Give me the souls, and take the goods to thy self.</hi> 7. By the <hi>guard of Angels</hi> which God hath appointed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect it, And convey it to heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.22.8.

the <hi>wells of salvation,</hi> the bread of life, the feast of marrow, and fatted things, which the Lord in his Word and Ordinances hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to see it; one sentence and period where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is more worth in an hour of Temptation, then rocks of Diamonds, ot mountains of Gold. 9. And above all the dignity of the soul appears by the <hi>price</hi> which was laid downe to redeem it. <hi>We were not redeemed by silver and gold, but by the blood of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.19. If silver and gold could have <hi>bought</hi> the soul, silver and gold hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might have <hi>blessed</hi> it, but since no price can purchase it, but the <hi>blood</hi> of God, no treasure can enrich it, but the <hi>fruition</hi> of God. <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance.</hi> Psal. 16.5.</p>
            <p>Very many Uses might be made of this most important doctrine: As. 1. To adore the infinite <hi>love</hi> of God towards the <hi>souls</hi> of poor sinfull men in finding out of his own unsearchable wisdom, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient which neither men nor angels could ever have discovered, for the <hi>punishing</hi> of the <hi>sin,</hi> and <hi>sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the <hi>soul</hi> that sinned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The infinite <hi>love of Christ,</hi> who so loved us, as to <hi>give himself</hi> for us, to make <hi>his soule an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for sin,</hi> that our souls might not be undone by it. A <hi>Son</hi> to die for <hi>servants,</hi> an <hi>holy,</hi> an onely and <hi>beloved</hi> son for <hi>rebellious</hi> servants, a Judge for malefactors, to come not only to <hi>save</hi> but to <hi>seek,</hi> those that sought not, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not after him: as there was <hi>never sorrow like his sorrow</hi> so there was never <hi>love</hi> like his <hi>love.</hi>

else where the <hi>Virgins</hi> are distinguished into <hi>wise, and foolish</hi>: So may we distinguish those <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi> who trade heavenward. For as he said, <hi>Mala emptio exprobrat stultitiam</hi>:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plin. Epist.</hi>
               </note> It is a note of folly to make an ill bargain.</p>
            <p>Now there are several things wherein the wisdome of a Merchant doth shew it self:</p>
            <p n="1">1. He considers <hi>where</hi> the best and <hi>most sure commodities</hi> are where he is certaine to make a good return, as it is noted of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 10.11.22, 28. and of <hi>Tyrus, Ezek.</hi> 27. So our <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian merchant</hi> knowing that the best commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties come from <hi>heaven,</hi> hath his thoughts and affections most there, And as those that trade to <hi>China,</hi> though they cannot travell far up into the Country are admitted to some skirts and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritine Harbour to receive the commodities of the Country; so our Merchant though he cannot go to <hi>heaven</hi> it self, yet he hath access, as it were to the <hi>out borders</hi> of heaven, the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> calld frequently in the Epistle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Heavenly things.</hi> Here then they <hi>watch</hi> at the gates of wisdomes house, here they <hi>search, dig, hide,</hi> and lay up, that the Word may <hi>dwell in them richly,</hi> and that they may be <hi>rich in knowledg,</hi> Prov. 8.34. Col. 3.16. 1 Cor. 1.5.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A wise <hi>merchant</hi> considers where is the <hi>easiest</hi> purchase of those commodities. It is true, <hi>heavenly</hi> things are in their own nature the <hi>most precious,</hi> and do indeed cost the most excellent price. The <hi>Redemption of a soule is precious,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55399:18"/>
Psal.</hi> 49.8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. yet because this precious price was none of ours: we are said to be <hi>saved free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Eph. 2.8. <hi>to buy milk and wine without money and without price, Isai.</hi> 55.1. for though we must <hi>sell all</hi> for this Jewel, if not actually, yet <hi>in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratione animae,</hi> yet it is all no <hi>reall</hi> or <hi>valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> estimation in such a bargain, but like the <hi>glass beads,</hi> and such like trifles which we give unto <hi>Indians</hi> for their <hi>silver</hi> and <hi>gold</hi>; like the <hi>sweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> out of <hi>dust</hi> and <hi>rags</hi> out of an house when it is to be inhabited; Christ will not take posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the soul, till vile lusts, and worthless af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are purged out, not by way of <hi>purchase</hi> of him, but by way of <hi>preparation</hi> for him. And this is one of the easiest purchases in the world, to let go <hi>dirt,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and to receive <hi>gold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A wise <hi>merchant,</hi> though he will make his purchase as easie as he can, will yet in a rare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity <hi>bid home,</hi> and not stick at a finall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; and so doth a wise Christian knowing the <hi>unsearchable riches of Christ,</hi> never sticks at any <hi>abatement.</hi> Many men bid much, proceed far, <hi>Herod</hi> doth <hi>many things; Agrippa</hi> is <hi>almost a Christian,</hi> hypocrites will part <hi>with thousands of rams, rivers of oil, there first borne,</hi> Mic. 6.7. but when the child comes to the very birth, <hi>they stay in the place of the breaking forth of children Hos.</hi> 13.13. when it comes to this issue, they must shake hands for ever with their darling and <hi>belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved lust, Herod</hi> with <hi>Herodias,</hi> the <hi>young man</hi> with his worldly love, the <hi>Iew</hi> with his legal righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55399:18"/>
the <hi>Greek</hi> with his carnal wisdome; nay, saith the hypocrite be the <hi>Iewel</hi> never so rich, I resolve to keep this <hi>green glasse,</hi> or this <hi>wooden platter,</hi> something of mine own: here Christ and the soul part, and they who <hi>came running</hi> unto him, go <hi>sorrowing</hi> from him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as wise Christians <hi>consult not with flesh and blood,</hi> but go through with the bargain: Let me haue Christ though I have nothing but him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A wise <hi>Merchant</hi> doth husband time and opportunity for his best advantage, takes the right <hi>season</hi> for his voyage and commodity; that he may returne with the more speed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. As tis observed of the Philosopher,<note place="margin">

It is noted as an excellent part of wisdom to <hi>know</hi> and to manage <hi>time, Cujus unius avaritia hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta est,</hi> as <hi>Seneca</hi> speaks. <hi>Esther</hi> 1.13. 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 12.32. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.15, 17.

            <p n="5">5. In a great City one <hi>merchant</hi> having one commodity, and another another, they do <hi>mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally interchange</hi> them for the inriching of one another: So in the City of God, one hath the spirit of <hi>wisdom,</hi> another of <hi>knowledge,</hi> one excelent at opening <hi>scripture,</hi> another at stating <hi>questions,</hi> another at resolving <hi>cases,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at exhortation, and Christian <hi>conference,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:55399:19"/>
and wise Christians should improve all advantages of this kinde unto their mutual enrichment.</p>
            <p n="6">6. A wise <hi>merchant</hi> hath constant <hi>intelligence</hi> and <hi>returns</hi> to and from the Country where his trade lies, is not without a <hi>factor</hi> there to manage his affairs; so should the <hi>christian marchant</hi>; his <hi>trade is in heaven, phil.</hi> 3.20. thither should he continually send, and return the commodities of that kingdome. The <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> is the <hi>Agent</hi> of his Church there, to transact their affairs for them; we should keep constant intelligence with him, pour out our desires into his bosome, and wait for the answer which he will send. <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>praises</hi> are the <hi>Vessels</hi> in which we send to <hi>heaven: faith, meditation, study</hi> of the Scriptures, attendance of the <hi>Ministry, vessels</hi> by which we hear from <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, He shall receive of mine,</hi> saith our Saviour of the holy Spirit, <hi>and shall shew it unto you,</hi> Joh. 16, 14. This intercourse we must keep continually open and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obstructed, that Christ may daily hear from us, and we daily receive from him, that so we may be filled with all the fulness of God, and may have all the storehouses of the soul replenished from heaven with all abundance of necessary graces &amp; comforts.</p>
            <p n="7">7 A wise <hi>merchant</hi> doth provide for <hi>losses,</hi> and yet though he venture much, will assure the main; so should we resolve before hand upon many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in the way to heaven, sit down and <hi>consider the cost</hi> of our holy profession, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26, 28. the <hi>ship</hi> wherein Christ is, is not secured from a <hi>storm.</hi> His crown of <hi>thorns,</hi> went before his crown of <hi>glory,</hi> and so must ours; there is a <hi>sea</hi> and a <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness</hi> between <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Canaan,</hi> through <hi>many
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55399:20"/>
tribulations</hi> we must enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. But this is our comfort, That there is an <hi>assurance-office,</hi> wherein all our losses will be repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an hundred fold, and that upon Gods own secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, whereof we have a record, <hi>Marck</hi> 10.29, 30. <hi>Verily, I say unto you, there is no man that hath left house, or brethren or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the Gospels; but he shall receive an hundred fold now in this life, house, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecution,</hi> (as comforts, supports, incouragements in the midst of his persecutions) <hi>and in the world to come eternal life.</hi> There is no aged Christian but will love us in such a case with the love of a <hi>father,</hi> no young Christian but will reverence us with the love of a <hi>son,</hi> no fellow Christian but will tender us with the love of a <hi>brother,</hi> every good mans <hi>house,</hi> and <hi>heart</hi> shall be open unto us. <hi>Who so ever doth the will of God, will be our brother, and sister and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> as our Saviour speaks, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.50.</p>
            <p n="8">8.

He takes upon <hi>trust</hi>; receives from God many <hi>talents</hi> of time, health, wealth, power, wisdome, learning, grace, precepts, and improves them to his Masters ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.16, 17. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.20.2. He gives upon <hi>Trust,</hi> lends to the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.17. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates his merchandise to the Lord, <hi>Isai.</hi> 23.18. Trusts God with his <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Innocency,</hi> as <hi>Ioseph</hi> did, as Christ did, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.23. with his <hi>life</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 31.3: 15. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. with his children, as <hi>Iacob,</hi> did <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.13, 14. with his <hi>soul,</hi> as Paul did, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. He is not anxiously solicitous how to escape this <hi>danger</hi>; how to repaire this <hi>losse</hi>; how to advance this <hi>gain</hi>; how to recover the <hi>hundred Talents</hi>; he knowes that God is a <hi>Father</hi> full of <hi>love,</hi> an heavenly <hi>Father</hi> full of <hi>power,</hi> an <hi>omniscient Father</hi> full of <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>; if his <hi>eye</hi> see our wants, and his <hi>heart</hi> pitty them, and his treasures abound towards them, how can his <hi>hand</hi> forbear to supply them?</p>
            <p>Lastly, a wise Merchant is very exact in his Books of <hi>account,</hi> Preserving a distinct knowledge of his gains and losses; his improvements, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes. Such is the care of a wise Christian to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint himself with his spiritual estate, to make his <hi>calling</hi> and <hi>election sure,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. to prove whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he <hi>be in the faith,</hi> 1 Cor. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To conclude all, The life of a <hi>merchant</hi> in order unto <hi>gain</hi> stands in these four things. In <hi>wisdome,</hi> and forecast to contrive; in <hi>labour</hi> to transact busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; in <hi>patience,</hi> to wait; and in <hi>thriftiness</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve what his labours gain: So our Christian <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant</hi> labours, 1. For that <hi>wisdome</hi> which is unto salvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. which is the foundation of all duties, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.9, 10, <hi>considers</hi> the field wherein the treasure is, and buyes it, <hi>Prov</hi> 31.16.2. He prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes the dictates of spiritual wisdom, with a <hi>work of faith,</hi> and <hi>labour of love.</hi> It is not empty wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and velleities, yawning &amp; drowsie desires that can make a merchant or a christian rich; much pains must be taken with an evill heart, with a sluggish spirit, with a stubborn will, with impotent passions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with strong lusts, with active enemies. 3. He endures with <hi>patince,</hi> gives not over the trade of Piety, if his expectations be not presently answered, but by <hi>patient continuance in well doing,</hi> comes to glory and honour at the last, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.37.4. He hides the word in his heart, <hi>stores up</hi> precepts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, examples, experiments; what with wisdome, labor, and patience he hath <hi>gotten,</hi> he doth with all care and diligence <hi>preserve,</hi> that he may go forward, and not backward, in his holy Profession.</p>
