            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To the Honourable and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Dr. George Morley, late Lord

Lord Biſhop of Ely.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now about eighteen years
ſince you and many others were
appointed by his Majeſties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
with divers of us who
deſired ſome Reformation of the
Church Diſcipline and worſhip, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what <hi>Alterations of the Liturgy</hi> were <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb facs="tcp:55406:3"/>
and expedient</hi> for the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
conſciences,</hi> and the <hi>reſtoring</hi> and <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
of <hi>peace and Vnity to the Churches under</hi>
his Majeſties <hi>protection</hi> and <hi>government.</hi> His
<hi>Majeſties Gracious Declaration about Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Affairs,</hi> had before ſhewed ſo much of
his Wiſdome and care to attain this Unity,
as we thought had almoſt done the cure; the
differences about Church Government and
moſt of the reſt being thereby as we hoped
fairly ended: As (with the help of the
Reverend Dr. <hi>Sparrow</hi> now Biſhop of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Pierſon</hi> now Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi>)
you maintained that no <hi>Alteration was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to theſe ends,</hi> ſo I with others endeavoured
to prove the contrary: But ſince, the ſaid
Declaration being dead, ſuch <hi>Alterations</hi>
were made as greatly increaſed our <hi>Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of Conforming:</hi> we never treated with
you for <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government, or <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>
but for <hi>Vnity and peace;</hi> Nor did we
herein offer you any worſe than <hi>Arch-biſhop
Vſhers Form</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Epiſcopal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
(which I had declared my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of before in print); And I never heard
of the name of Epiſcopal Presbyterians, or
Presbyterian Archbiſhops till of late. And
we thankfully accepted <hi>much leſs than that
Form,</hi> as granted in his Majeſties foreſaid
Declaration. As I doubt not but you ſtill
<pb facs="tcp:55406:3"/>
think that your way was beſt for the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Church and Land; ſo I know
that I have greatly incurred both your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſures
for what I have ſaid and done
againſt your way. One of you ſhewed it
in a Printed Letter long ago, which when
I had anſwered I caſt that aſide for Peace,
(believing that the opening of ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes
in matter of fact, would not be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
born:) The other of you ſince told
me, that <hi>he would Petition authority that we
might be compelled to give our Reaſons;</hi> as
if we kept up a Schiſm and would not tell
why! I rejoiced at the motion, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to beg leave on my knees to do it. Since
then your Mr. <hi>Walton</hi> in his Life of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<hi>Sanderſon</hi> hath called me by name to
remember our debate aforeſaid. I know
not of any two men living, that I am
now more obliged to give an account to
of my continued diſſent, than unto you.
My judgement is not in my own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
nor in yours. Many are dead who
were in that conſultation: You and I by
Gods great mercy are yet alive, and may
review our actions before we come to the
Bar of God, which is like to be ſpeedily
to me, and to you it cannot be far off, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to the elder of you; ſo that I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that all three of us are really beyond
<pb facs="tcp:55406:4"/>
the motives of any perſonal worldly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt:
what is this world to us who are
taking our farewel of it for ever? All the
doubt then remaining is, <hi>whether your terms
or thoſe deſired by us, are the true way of
Love and Concord?</hi> and which are the true
cauſes of Schiſms, and the attendant
evils.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but you ſtill think that the
<hi>good which you have done</hi> doth far weigh
down all the direct and accidental hurt.
What that Good is, you know better than
I: Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> in the Life of Arch-Biſhop
<hi>Laud</hi> tells us what ſome accounted then moſt
deſirable; And how much more deſirable
it is to open the Church doors ſo wide as
that moderate Loyal Romaniſts may come
in, as they did in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> firſt
years, and to reconcile them by nearer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
or conceſſions, rather than to go
further from them to unite with a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
Puritans, whoſe principles are
againſt the Power and Wealth of the
Church, we have often heard from others:
As alſo that the ejection of the near two
thouſand non-conforming Miniſters, was the
Churches deliverance from them that would
have done more hurt within, than they can
do without. The converted Prieſt Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi>
in his Narrative of the Popiſh Plot, dedicated
<pb facs="tcp:55406:4"/>
to the King, nameth more reaſons, which
I will not name, which ſome were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by.</p>
            <p>For my part, as with fear I foreſaw, ſo
with grief I ſee, ſo many hundred Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
under the reſtraints and penalties which
you know of, of whom I have better
thoughts than you have: believing from
my heart, by the acquaintance which I
have had with very many, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the faulty former actions of
ſome few of them, and the unjuſtifiable
ſcruples of others, you cannot name that
Nation under heaven out of our Kings Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
which hath this day ſo many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
more ſound in doctrine, heart and
life, and liker to further mens ſalvation,
than thoſe that in <hi>England</hi> have been ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and caſt out. Name that countrey if
you can! And I believe that Chriſt hath
given us no ſupernumeraries of ſuch uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
men; but if all faithful Miniſters Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
and Non-conformiſts were employed
and encouraged, they would be ſtill too
few to do the work upon the ignorant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
and vicious which is to be done.
And conſidering how many ſouls a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Miniſter may hope to edifie and ſave,
I conſider then how many thouſands are
like to be loſers where ſuch are loſt and
<pb facs="tcp:55406:5"/>
wanting. It grieveth my ſoul to ſee what
advantage Satan hath got in <hi>England,</hi> againſt
that Chriſtian Love which is the life and
character of Chriſts diſciples, and to cauſe
wrath, envy, hatred and ſtrife, when God
ſaith, <hi>He that hateth his brother is a murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
and no murderer hath eternal life in him,</hi>
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 15. It grieveth me to ſee preachers
againſt preachers, and Churches againſt
Churches, and in Preſs and Pulpit, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Oratory imployed to render bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
odious, and keep up a heart war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
each other, and all this (O fearful)
as in the name of Chriſt, and as for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Church and Kingdome. To ſee
families againſt families, and father againſt
ſon, and as <hi>Guelphes</hi> and <hi>Gibelines</hi> Cities and
Countreys in their ordinary diſcourſes (at
the leaſt) accuſing, contemning, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
one another! It grieveth me to
think how much firſt the honour, and then
the ſucceſs of the Miniſtry on both ſides is
hereby hindered, and what temptations
ſome have to further injuries which I am
loth to name: And how by all this the
wicked and Infidels are hardened, the weak
are ſcandalized, the Papiſts are encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to deſpiſe us all, and many turn to them,
ſcandalized by our diſcord, ſects are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged,
the Church and Kingdome by divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb facs="tcp:55406:5"/>
weakened, and the King denyed the
comfort which he might have in a loving,
united and concordant people.</p>
            <p>I believe that you diſlike all this as well
as I: All the queſtion hath been and ſtill
is, <hi>which is the true way of Cure.</hi> And one
would think that 1. the nature of the thing,
and 2. the experience of all the Chriſtian
world, 3. and our own new experience
theſe ſeventeen or eighteen years, might
reſolve men of lower parts than ours! Is
there no better way to the Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
than that which muſt caſt out either
ſuch men as <hi>you</hi> or <hi>I,</hi> and that ſo many?
Can a wiſe Phyſicion (a true Peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker)
find out no remedy which may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
avoid the foreſaid evils? O what a loſs
had <hi>England</hi> in the removal of ſuch heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men, as Biſhop <hi>Vſher, Hall, Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
Brownrig, &amp;c.</hi> Far was I and am I
from liking any former injury to ſuch men,
by Covenant or abuſe. But it hath been
ever the juſt miſery of the perſecutors of
worthy men, to have the ſtone fly back on
their own heads, and to be themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
by ſtriving to undo others, while they
firſt make, and then ſtir up a multitude of
enemies for their own defence, who elſe
would be friends and live in peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55406:6"/>
I am fully perſwaded that in this book
I have told you a righter way of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Church concord; more divine, ſure,
harmleſs, and comprehenſive, fitted by
Chriſt himſelf, to the intereſt of all good
men, yea of the Church and all the world.
I offer it firſt to you, that you and poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
may ſee what it was that I deſired;
and that if I here err you will faithfully
detect my errour, that I may repent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I die, and may leave behind me the
recantation of this and all my other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes
and miſcarriages, as I intend to do
upon juſt conviction. But do it quickly or
elſe I am not like to ſee it: And I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
not to provoke you by any confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but to improve your evidence for my
ſelf.</p>
            <p>And to anſwer the earneſt demand of our
Reaſons by you the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Eli,</hi> I
have alſo publiſhed an Hiſtorical Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of our caſe and judgement in another
Book called, <hi>The Non-conformiſts Plea for
Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If (much contrary to my expectation)
you ſhould be convinced that <hi>Theſe Terms
of Vnity and Concord,</hi> are righter than thoſe
which you (above all men that I know)
have effectually helpt to bring us under,
I humbly crave that you will uſe as much
<pb facs="tcp:55406:6"/>
earneſtneſs and diligence to procure the
Churches concord by promoting them, as you
did for that which you then thought righter.
I have here opened thoſe reaſons which made
me believe that the fourteenth and fifteenth
Chapter to the <hi>Romans</hi> decideth our contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie;
and is to be underſtood as I then
maintained.</p>
            <p>If it prove the neceſſary Truth which is
here offered you, I beſeech you ſee that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
reſiſt it not. It would be a happy
work could we procure the reviving of
Chriſtian Love, Unity and Concord, that
all Chriſts ſervants might ſtrive together
for the <hi>hallowing of Gods name,</hi> the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of his <hi>Kingdome</hi> and the <hi>doing of his will</hi>
with Love and Concord as <hi>it is done in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
And when inſtead of worldly wealth
and grandure we are contented with our
<hi>daily bread,</hi> and inſtead of cruelty to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
or weak, we bewail our <hi>own ſins,</hi>
and forbear and forgive one another, and
inſtead of <hi>tempting men</hi> to the <hi>evil</hi> of wrath,
and making battering Cannons and tearing
engines of Schiſm, we ceaſe to be over-wiſe
in our own conceits, and to judge, deſpiſe
and ruine others, then we ſhall be in a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
way to this: we ſhall then receive him
that is weak even in the faith, (much
more about our leſſer matters) even as
<pb facs="tcp:55406:7"/>
Chriſt received us, and not to doubtful
diſputations; and he that pleaſeth God by
that in which his Kingdome doth conſiſt,
will be alſo approved by us; and we ſhall
better learn what that meaneth, I will
have mercy and not ſacrifice, and that
none of our Church power is given for
deſtruction but for edification; and ſo we
ſhall not condemn the guiltleſs, nor ſmite
the Shepherds and ſcatter the flocks, and
then hunt them about as Schiſmaticks, and
ſee the mote of diſſent from a formality, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
or word, in their eye, while we
ſee not this great beam in our own. How
joyfully ſhould we die, might we leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
us by our endeavours a healed Church
and Nation, and ſee firſt this deſired unity,
which would be the ſtrength, eaſe and joy of
Miniſters and people, King and Subjects, and
a hopeful pattern to the divided Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
to imitate. If you will not contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
your help hereto, thoſe will who ſhall
have the honour and comfort of being the
bleſſed inſtruments of our concord, if God
have ſo much mercy for us.</p>

            <head>A
Premonition.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>UPon the review of this book I find
ſome things, which may be to ſome an
occaſion of offence, if this premoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
prevent it not.</p>
            <p>I. Some may think when I ſay [Dioceſan
Prelacy, Arch-Biſhops and Patriarchs <hi>are not
to be made neceſſary to Univerſal,</hi> or ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
Church Concord, as being uncapable terms
or means thereof] that I ſpeak againſt the
<hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of all Epiſcopacy, when I ſpeak but
againſt ſuch neceſſity of that ſort. Know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
1. that I meddle not with the queſtion,
Whether every particular Church (of Paſtor,
and people aſſociate for perſonal Church Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
ſuch as <hi>Ignatius</hi> deſcribeth) ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:55406:9"/>
have a Biſhop with his Presbyters and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.</p>
            <p>2. Nor with the queſtion whether theſe ſhould
have Arch-Biſhops over them, as ſucceſſours to
the Apoſtolical and other general Overſeers of the
firſt age, in the ordinary continued parts of their
office.</p>
            <p>3. Nor whether Patriarchs, Dioceſans and
Lay Chancellours as officers of the King, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing
under him ſuch Government of the
Church as belongeth to Kings (according to our
Oath of Supremacy) be lawful, to which in ſuch
exerciſe all ſubjects muſt for Conſcience ſake
ſubmit.</p>
            <p>4. Nor whether it was well done (or of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
appointment) that about temporal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
as well as Church Controverſies, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
were choſen arbitrators by the ancient
Chriſtians, and ſo did that which Chriſtian
Magiſtrates now muſt do, till upon the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Princes and States the ſaid Power of
externals <hi>circa ſacra</hi> fell into their hands.</p>
            <p>5. Nor yet if Dioceſans become the ſole Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
(<hi>infimi ordinis</hi>) over many hundred
Pariſhes, all the Biſhops and Pariſh Churches
under them being put down, and turned into
Curates and Chapels (<hi>partes eccleſiae infimae
ſpeciei</hi>), whether a Miniſter and every Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
ought yet to live quietly and peaceably under
them. It is none of theſe that are the queſtions
which I decide.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55406:9"/>
II. In my confutation of Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi>
ſome may miſtake me, as if I denied that our
Religion had come down to us by a continued
ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles, or that the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
office <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> or that the Vniverſal
Church had ever been without a true Miniſtry
or Religion: I have proved <hi>where our Church
was in all ages before</hi> Luther, in my ſecond
book againſt <hi>Johnſon</hi> alias <hi>Terret:</hi> Nor do I
ſay what I do, to avoid deriving our Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
ſucceſſion from <hi>Rome:</hi> For Hiſtory puts me
out of doubt, that the multitude of uncapable
Popes and Schiſms will prove a far greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption
of Canonical and Legitimate ſucceſſion
at <hi>Rome,</hi> than can be proved of <hi>England,</hi> and
perhaps than hath happened to almoſt any other
Church in the world. And I am fully ſatisfied
that the preſent Church of <hi>England</hi> as Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
deriveth its ſucceſſion from the ancient
Brittiſh and Scottiſh Church, and not from
<hi>Rome;</hi> and that Chriſtianity was the Religion
of <hi>England</hi> long before <hi>Gregory,</hi> or <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>
the Monks days; and that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Gildas</hi> his ſmart reproofs, when the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
and Scottiſh Clergy and people diſclaimed
all obedience to the Pope, and would not ſo
much as eat or lodge in the ſame houſe with
<hi>Gregory</hi>'s Clergy, the perſons were better, or
at leaſt their doctrine and Religion more ſound,
<pb facs="tcp:55406:10"/>
than that which <hi>Rome</hi> did afterwards obtrude.
And as the blood of this nation though called
Engliſh, will upon juſt conſideration be found to
be twenty, if not an hundred fold, more <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi>
than either <hi>Roman, Saxon</hi> or <hi>Norman,</hi>
ſo the Ordination of the Biſhops is derived ſo
much more from the <hi>Brittains</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> than
from <hi>Rome,</hi> as that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monks ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours
were afterward almoſt quite extinct, only
one <hi>Wini</hi> a <hi>Simoniſt</hi> being left in <hi>anno</hi> 668.
the reſt of the Biſhops being all of Brittiſh ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
All which with much more of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
is ſo fully proved (after <hi>Uſher</hi>) by M. <hi>T.
Jones</hi> of <hi>Oſweſtree</hi> late Chaplain to the Duke of
<hi>York,</hi> in an excellent Hiſtorical Treatiſe hereof,
called [<hi>Of the Heart and its right Soveraign</hi>]
that I am ſorry that book is no more commonly
bought and read.</p>
            <p>But withal I muſt ſay that this our certain
ſucceſſion diſproveth the Papiſts and Mr. <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells</hi>
plea, for the neceſſity of their ſort of
Epiſcopal Canonical uninterrupted ſucceſſion:
For (as the Biſhops of <hi>Denmark</hi> have their
ſucceſſion but from <hi>Bugenhagius Pomeranus</hi>
a Presbyter his ordination, ſo) <hi>Aidan</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi>
that came from <hi>Scotland</hi> out of <hi>Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus</hi>
Monaſtery, were no Biſhops as <hi>Beda</hi> and
others fully teſtifie: And after <hi>Beda</hi> and others,
Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> hath cleared it, that it was not only
the Northern Biſhops that were ordained by <hi>Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55406:10"/>
and <hi>Finan</hi> and <hi>Dhuma,</hi> but that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of the whole land had their ordination de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from them and ſuch as they, and thoſe
whom they ordained: ſo that the denying of
the Validity of the Ordination by Presbyters,
ſhaketh the ſucceſſion of the Epiſcopal Church of
<hi>England;</hi> and proveth it on that ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
interrupted: And if they derive it from
<hi>Rome, it</hi> will be as much ſhaken.</p>
            <p>III. In peruſal I find that I have more than
once mentioned ſome things in this treatiſe, and
the repetition may be an offenſe to ſome. To
which I ſay, 1. That this is uſual in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
where ſeveral objections and occaſions call
for the ſame material anſwer. 2. But I confeſs
it is the effect of my <hi>haſt</hi> and <hi>weakneſs:</hi> And
it is my judgement while I think that I write no
needleſs books, that I ſhould rather write any
one that is truly uſeful with ſuch imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of manner and ſtyle as only ſo far diſgrace
the author, than for want of time, to leave it
undone, to the loſs of others: But if it be <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi>
it is a greater fault to write it, than to
write it no more accurately.</p>
            <p>My dear friend, and judicious brother
Mr. <hi>John Corbett</hi> hath newly publiſhed a ſmall
book to the ſame purpoſe with this, of the <hi>true
ſtate of Religion</hi> and <hi>Intereſt of the Church,</hi>
with a <hi>diſcourſe of Schiſm,</hi> which I commend
<pb facs="tcp:55406:11"/>
to the Reader as much worthy of his peruſal,
and which if written on the hearts of Rulers,
and Teachers and people according to its certain
truth and weight, would heal us all. The Lord
forgive our heinous ſins which deſerve that he
ſhould excommunicate and forſake us; and ſave
<hi>England</hi> from Engliſh men, and ſave us all
from our ſelves, our moſt dangerous enemies, and
Chriſtians and Paſtors and friends from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For as Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> his Welſh Proverb ſaith,
<hi>Though thy dog be thy own, truſt him not
when he is mad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>IV. I hear ſome ſay of my book that cometh
out with this (of the caſe of the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts)
and may ſay of this, that</hi> 1. It is unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to mention our own differences
when we are called to unite againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts:
2. And that too hard-accuſations of
conformity are intimated.</p>
            <p>I anſwer to the firſt, 1. That it is never
more ſeaſonable to write for Vnity than when we
are moſt obliged to unite: Though indeed it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be unſeaſonable. And to take Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
for heinous Schiſmaticks and call on Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
to ſilence and impriſon and ruine them,
is not the way to unity; nor conſiſteut with it;
and therefore to deprecate ſuch unpeaceable
ways, is the neceſſary work of a Peacemaker.
2. I have waited in vain theſe ſeventeen years
<pb facs="tcp:55406:11"/>
for a fit ſeaſon; And with me in likelyhood it
muſt be Now or Never: for there is no doing
it in the grave; and I dare not die, and leave
it undone on pretence that it was not ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond I ſay 1. I have profeſſed that
I write not to accuſe Conformiſts; but if men
<hi>accuſe us</hi> as enemies to <hi>order, obedience</hi> and
<hi>peace,</hi> and as fit for <hi>ſilencing</hi> and <hi>utter ruine,</hi>
and tell the world falſly that it is but <hi>Things
Indifferent</hi> that we deny obedience to, and call
on us to tell them <hi>what it is that we fear if
we conform;</hi> and when we tell them, they
make this alſo our crime becauſe they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
accuſed, what remedy have we againſt ſuch
men? 2. I love and honour all good and pious
men that Conform; For I conſider how variouſly
the ſame thing is repreſented to and apprehended
by men of various educations, converſe, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages;
ſo that the <hi>ſame ſin materially heinous</hi>
may <hi>formally</hi> be <hi>much leſs</hi> in ſome than in
others; As was <hi>Paul</hi>'s ignorant unbelief and
perſecution: Or elſe, ſaith the <hi>Papiſt Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of the three books for the Jeſuites Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,</hi>
Moſt Princes muſt be moſt heinous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
that make wars againſt each other, in which
multitudes are killed, when both ſides cannot
have a juſt cauſe, unleſs the ſuppoſition that
their cauſe was good by miſtake, excuſe them.</p>

               <p>HAD not the diſtempers of the minds even
of Religious perſons, and the long and
ſad diviſions and diſtractions of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
aſſured me that this Text is not
commonly underſtood and regarded, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
vehement Exhortation, and the importance and
reaſon of the matter do beſpeak; yea had not the long
bleeding wounds of the Church, made by its Paſtors
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55406:17"/>
and moſt zealous members, ſtill cryed out aloud
for pity and help, I had not choſen this ſubject at
this time. But after the complaints, and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and tears of the wiſeſt and beſt men ſince the
days of Chriſt, after the long miſeries of the Church
and the long and coſtly experience of all ages, the
deſtroying <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>diviſion</hi> ſtill poſſeſſeth the moſt, and
maketh ſome of the poſſeſſed to rage and foam &amp; tear
themſelves and all that are in their power; it haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the holy aſſemblies and diſquieteth the lovers of
unity and peace, and by the ſcandals which it raiſeth it
frighteneth children and unſtable perſons out of
their religion and their wits. And therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the many books which I have written for <hi>Vnity,
Love</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and the many years preaching
and praying to that end, I find it yet as neceſſary
as ever to Preach on the ſame Subject, and to recite
the ſame things, and while I am in this Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
which I muſt ſhortly put off, to ſtir you up,
that after my deceaſe you may have it in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
(2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12, 13, 14.) And could I perſuade
the Churches of Chriſt to ſeek by faſting and fervent
prayer, the diſpoſſeſſing of this diſtracting Spirit, (by
which only this evil kind goeth out) our languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>If <hi>Paul</hi> found it neceſſary to cry down diviſion,

&amp;c. which had been founded by the means of
miracles, and had ſo much of the ſpirit of Unity
and Community, and had Apoſtles among them to
preſerve their peace: what wonder if we that are
much ignorant of the Apoſtles minds, and of the
Primitive pattern, and have leſs of the Spirit,
have need to be ſtill called upon to <hi>ſtudy to keep the

Twenty or an hundred Sermons for <hi>Purity,</hi> and

A humble ſoul that can be content to follow a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
Chriſt, and to be made of no reputation
(<hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3.) and to be a ſervant
to all, and a Lord of none, and can yield and ſtoop
and be deſpiſed, when ever the ends of his office do
require it, is a Chriſtian indeed and fit to be a healer.</p>

Chriſtian worthineſs, <hi>and</hi> a neceſſary cauſe <hi>of</hi> Vnity <hi>and</hi>
Peace.</p>
               <p>Though in ſome this hath extraordinary advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
or diſadvantage in the temperature of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
yet it is that which perſons of all tempers may
be brought to by grace. A boiſterous, furious or wild
kind of diſpoſition, is not the Chriſtian healing ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
If paſſion be apt to ſtir, wiſdom and grace
muſt repreſs it, and Lenity muſt be our ordinary
temper: we muſt be like tame creatures, that fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
come to a mans hand, and not like wild things
that flye from us as untractable: otherwiſe how
will ſuch in Love and peace and ſociable concord,
ever carry on the work of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Doct. 6. <hi>Love to each other is a great part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
worthineſs,</hi> and a <hi>moſt neceſſary cauſe of Vnity
and peace.</hi> Of which I hope to ſay ſo much by it ſelf

chiefly ſignifieth here and elſewhere in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles,
that <hi>deliberate ſlowneſs and calmneſs of mind which is
contrary to paſſionate haſte and raſhneſs:</hi> When a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate

another ſpeak for himſelf nor to deliberate of the
matter and ſearch out the truth, nor forbear revenge
while he thinketh whether it will do good or harm,

<hi>Longanimity</hi> will ſtay men and compoſe their minds,

men into thoſe <hi>conceptions, words</hi> and <hi>deeds,</hi> which they

raſhneſs in <hi>judging and doing,</hi> for want of the patience

errors, <hi>Hereſies</hi> and <hi>diviſions,</hi> and of abundance of ſin
and miſery in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 8. Bearing, ſupporting and forbearing one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
in Love, is another part of Goſpel worthineſs, and
needful means of Vnity and peace.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs to forbear each other patiently under

ſignifieth ſomething more. While we are imperfect
ſinful men, we ſhall have need of mutual ſupport
and help, yea we ſhall be injurious, provoking and
troubleſome to each other: And when Chriſtians
(yea Church Paſtors) are ſo far from ſupporting
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55406:20"/>
and ſuſtaining the weak, that they cannot ſo much as
patiently bear their cenſures, neglects, or other effects

opened.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. WHat UNITY in General is, and what
<hi>This Vnity of the ſpirit</hi> in ſpecial, I ſhall
open in theſe following connexed propoſitions.</p>
               <p>1. I muſt neither here confound the ordinary Reader
by the many Metaphyſical difficulties about UNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY;
nor yet wholly paſs them by, leſt I confound
him for want of neceſſary diſtinction.</p>
               <p>2. UNITY is ſometimes the attribute of an
<hi>Vniverſal,</hi> which is but <hi>Ens rationis,</hi> or a <hi>General
Inadequate</hi> partial conception of an exiſtent ſingular
being: and ſo <hi>All men</hi> are ONE as to the ſpecies of
Humanity; And all <hi>Living</hi> things are <hi>One</hi> in the
<hi>Genus of Vitality:</hi> And ſo of <hi>Bodies, Subſtances, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
&amp;c.</hi>
It is much more than this that we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us.</p>
               <p>2. Some think that the word [ONE] or
[UNITY] ſigni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ieth only <hi>Negatively an Vndi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videdneſs
in the thing</hi> it ſelf: But this conception is
more than Negative, and taketh in firſt in <hi>Compounds</hi>
that <hi>peculiar Connexion of parts</hi> by one <hi>form,</hi> and in
<hi>ſimple ſpiritual beings,</hi> that more excellent <hi>indiviſible
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55406:21"/>
eſſentiality</hi> and <hi>exiſtence,</hi> whence the Being is intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as ſuch a <hi>ſubſiſtence</hi> as is not only <hi>undivided in it
ſelf,</hi> but <hi>diviſible</hi> or <hi>differenceable</hi> from all other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent
or poſſible beings, ſo far as it is one.</p>
               <p>4. Paſſing by the diſtinction of <hi>Vnum per ſe &amp; per
accidens,</hi> and ſome ſuch other, I ſhall only further
diſtinguiſh of <hi>Vnity</hi> according to the differences of
the <hi>Entities</hi> that are called <hi>One:</hi> Where indeed the
difference of <hi>Things,</hi> maketh the word <hi>ONE</hi> of
very different ſignifications.</p>
               <p>5. GOD is <hi>Supereminently</hi> and moſt <hi>perfectly ONE,</hi>
as he is ENS, BEING: No Creature hath <hi>Vnity</hi>
in the ſame perfect ſort and ſenſe as GOD is One.
He is ſo ONE as that he is perfectly ſimple and
indiviſible: and ſo as that he cannot be properly a
<hi>Part,</hi> in any compoſition.</p>
               <p>6. Therefore GOD and the World, or any
Creature are not compounding parts; for a part is
leſs than the whole: And that which is leſs is not
Infinite.</p>
               <p>7. Yet <hi>God</hi> is more <hi>Intimate</hi> to every creature than
any of its own Parts are: no form is more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
to the matter, no ſoul to the body, no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
vertue to a ſpirit, than God is to all and every
being: But his <hi>Perfection and the Creatures Imperfection</hi>
is ſuch, as that creatures can be no addition to God,
nor compounding parts, but like to Accidents.</p>
               <p>8. The ſame muſt be ſaid therefore of Chriſts
<hi>Divine and humane natures.</hi> The Schoolmen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſay that Chriſts <hi>ſoul and body are Parts</hi> of his
humane nature: but his <hi>Godhead</hi> and <hi>manhood</hi> are
not to be called <hi>Parts of Chriſt:</hi> Becauſe the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
can be no <hi>Part</hi> of any thing.</p>
               <p>9. When <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that God is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
All in All things, he meaneth not that he is <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
all things themſelves;</hi> But yet not that he is leſs,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55406:22"/>
or is more diſtant from them than the <hi>form;</hi> but is
eminently ſo much <hi>more,</hi> as that the title is <hi>below</hi>
him: ſo he is ſaid here, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>To be</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>]
the Father of all, above all, and through all, and
in us all: And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 16. it is ſaid that the <hi>ſame
God worketh all in all,</hi> as to the <hi>diverſity of operations:</hi>
He is the moſt intimate prime Agent in all that
acteth (though he hath enabled free Agents to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
their own acts morally to <hi>this</hi> or that, <hi>hic
&amp; nunc,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>For in Him we live and move and have
our Being;</hi> for we are his offspring, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>10. Somewhat like this muſt be ſaid of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Union of Chriſt and all true believers: As to
his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> (and ſo the Holy Ghoſt) he is as
the Father, <hi>Intimately in all, but more than the form
of all</hi> or any: But he is ſpecially by <hi>Relation and
Inoperation</hi> in his members, as he is not in any others:
So <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 11. Chriſt is ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>All in
All,</hi> that is to the Church: And ſo I conceive that it
is in a <hi>Paſſive or Receptive</hi> ſenſe that the Church is ſaid
to be the <hi>fulneſs of him that filleth all in all, Eph.</hi>
1. 23. Whether it be ſpoken of Chriſts Godhead
only, or of his humane ſoul alſo, as being to the
Redeemed world what the <hi>Sun</hi> is to the <hi>Natural il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated
world,</hi> I determine not: But which ever
it is, Chriſt filling <hi>all in all,</hi> the Church is called
his <hi>fulneſs</hi> as being eminently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>poſſeſſed and <hi>filled by
him,</hi> as the Head is by the humane ſoul more than the
hand or other lower parts.</p>
               <p>11. The <hi>Trinity of Perſons</hi> is ſuch, as is no way
contrary to the perfect <hi>Vnity</hi> of the Divine eſſence;
As the faculties of Motion, Light and Heat in the
Sun, and of <hi>Vital Activity, Intellection</hi> and <hi>Volition</hi> in
man, is not contrary to the Unity of the eſſence of
the ſoul: (yet man is not ſo perfectly <hi>One</hi> as God is.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:55406:22"/>
12. The <hi>Vnity</hi> of a <hi>ſpirit in it ſelf,</hi> is a great Image
or Likeneſs of the <hi>Divine Vnity;</hi> As having no
ſeparable <hi>Parts,</hi> as paſſive matter hath, but being
<hi>One without diviſibility;</hi> even one Eſſential <hi>Vertue</hi> or
Vertuous ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>13. The moſt <hi>large extenſive Vnity</hi> (as far as
<hi>ſpirits</hi> may be ſaid to have <hi>extenſion</hi> or <hi>Degrees of
Eſſence</hi>) is likeſt to God: And the Unity of a <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
atome</hi> is not more excellent than the <hi>Vnity</hi>
of the material part of the world, made up of ſuch
Atomes. (Whether there are ſuch Atomes phyſical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indiviſible I here meddle not, but the ſhaping of
an Atome into cornered, hollow and ſuch other
ſhapes, is to common reaſon a palpable contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.)</p>
               <p>14. Whether there be any one paſſive Element
(Earth, Water or Air) any where exiſtent in an
<hi>Vnion</hi> of its proper Atomes, without a mixture of
any other Element, is a thing unknown to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</p>
               <p>15. So is it whether there be any where exiſtent
a body of the united Atomes of the ſeveral paſſive
Elements without the active.</p>
               <p>16. The mixt Beings known to us do all conſiſt
of an union of the paſſive and active Elements (or
of theſe <hi>united.</hi>)</p>
               <p>17. We perceive by ſenſe what <hi>Vnion</hi> and <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
of Paſſive matter is, which hath ſeparable parts:
But how far ſpirits are paſſive (as all under God are in
ſome degree,) and whether that <hi>Paſſivity</hi> ſignifie any
kind of <hi>Materiality</hi> as well as <hi>Subſtantiality;</hi> and
how far they are <hi>extenſive,</hi> or partible, or have
any Degrees analogous to <hi>Parts,</hi> and ſo what their
<hi>Vnity</hi> is in a poſitive conception, and how ſpirits
are <hi>Many,</hi> and how <hi>One,</hi> and whether there be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent
One Univerſal ſpirit of each kind Vegetative,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55406:23"/>
ſenſitive, and Intellective, and whether they are
both <hi>One,</hi> and <hi>many</hi> in ſeveral reſpects, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch like queſtions, Theſe are all paſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
certain knowledge in this life: <hi>Many</hi> it is
certain that there be: But whether that <hi>Number</hi> here
be <hi>Quantitas diſcreta,</hi> and how they are Individuate
and diſtinguiſhable, and how 'tis that <hi>Many</hi> come
from <hi>One</hi> or two in generation, are queſtions too
hard for ſuch as I.</p>
               <p>18. But we ſee in Paſſive matter, that the parts
have a natural propenſity to <hi>Vnion,</hi> and the <hi>aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi>
inclination is ſo ſtrong, as that thence the
Learned Dr. <hi>Gliſſon</hi> (<hi>Lib. de Vitâ Naturae</hi>) copiouſly
maintaineth that all <hi>Matter</hi> hath <hi>Life</hi> or a Natural
Vital ſelf-moving Vertue, not as a compounding
part, but as a formal inadequate conception: In
which though I conſent not, yet the Aggregative
Inclination is not to be denyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All heavy terrene
bodies haſten to the earth by deſcent, and all the
parts of Water would unite; and Air much more.</p>
               <p>19. The groſſer and more terrene any Body is,
the eaſilier the parts of it continue in a local ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration;
you may keep them eaſily divided from
one another, though they incline to the whole:
But liquids more haſten to a cloſure; and Air
yet much more.</p>
               <p>20. Whether this their ſtrong inclination to
<hi>Vnity</hi> be a natural Principle in the paſſive Elements
themſelves, or be cauſed by the <hi>Igneous Active</hi>
part which is ever mixed with them, and whoſe
<hi>Vnity</hi> in it ſelf is more perfect; or whether it
principally proceed from any ſpiritual ſubſtance
which animateth all things, and is above the Igne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſubſtance, I think, is too hard for man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:55406:23"/>
21. But ſo great is the Union of the whole
Igneous ſubſtance that is within our knowledge, that
we can hardly tell whether it have diviſible ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
parts, and more hardly prove that there
are any parts of it actually ſeparated from the reſt,
even where by <hi>Termination</hi> and <hi>Reception</hi> in the
<hi>Paſſive matter</hi> there is the moſt notable diſtinction.
The Light of the Sun in the air is <hi>One,</hi> and that Light
ſeemeth to be the effect of the <hi>preſent ſubſtance</hi> of
the ſolar fire, and not a <hi>quality</hi> or <hi>motion locally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi>
from it: A burning-glaſs may by its Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
aptitude occaſion a combuſtion by the Sun-beams
in one place which is not in another. But
thoſe beams that terminate on that glaſs are not
ſeparated from the reſt. As there are in Animals fixed
ſpirits which are conſtitutive parts of the ſolid mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and moved ſpirits which carry about the
humours, and yet theſe are not ſeparated from each
other: ſo the <hi>Earth</hi> it ſelf, and its groſſer parts,
have an Igneous principle ſtill reſident in them, as
fire is in a flint, or ſteel, and indeed in every
thing: And this ſeemeth to be it which many call
<hi>Forma telluris:</hi> But that all theſe are not contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or united alſo to the common Solar fire, or
Igneous Element, is not to be proved. The ſame
Sun-beams may kindle many things combuſtible
and light many Candles, which yet are all one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided
fiery ſubſtance, though by the various Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
of matter, ſo variouſly operating, as if
there were various ſeparate ſubſtances. And as
all theſe Candles or fires are <hi>One</hi> with the ſolar fire
in the Air, ſo are they therefore <hi>One</hi> among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
and yet not <hi>One Candle;</hi> becauſe that word
ſignifieth not only the common fire, but that fire
as <hi>terminated</hi> and <hi>operative</hi> on that particular <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>

one <hi>Vine</hi> or <hi>Pear Tree</hi> hath many <hi>Grapes</hi> or <hi>Pears</hi> nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically
different; And many <hi>leaves</hi> and <hi>branches</hi>
and <hi>roots;</hi> And yet it is one <hi>vegetative ſubſtance</hi> which
animateth or actuateth them all; which conſiſteth
not of ſeparated parts: And that Tree which is thus
principled, is it ſelf <hi>Vnited</hi> to <hi>the Earth,</hi> and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
in it is a real part of it, as a mans hair is
an <hi>Accident,</hi> (or as ſome will call it, <hi>an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
part</hi>) of the man, or the <hi>feathers</hi> of a <hi>bird:</hi>
And conſequently the <hi>forma arboris</hi> or its vegetative
ſpirit, and the <hi>forma telluris</hi> are not ſeparated, but
<hi>One.</hi> And we have no reaſon to think that there
is not as true an Union between that <hi>forma telluris,</hi>
and the <hi>forms</hi> or ſpirits of the ſun, ſtars, or other
Globes of the ſame kind, as there is between the
ſpirits of the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>plants.</hi> So that while <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
Spirits</hi> are <hi>many</hi> by the diverſity of Receptive
or Terminative matter, (and perhaps other ways
to us unknown) yet ſeem they to be all but <hi>One</hi>
thus diverſifyed, as <hi>One</hi> ſoul is in many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
               <p>24. Seeing the <hi>Nobleſt natures</hi> are moſt perfect
in <hi>Vnity</hi> (and the baſeſt moſt diviſible) we have
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55406:25"/>
no reaſon to think that the Vital principles of the
divers ſenſitive Animals (meerly ſuch) are not as
much <hi>One</hi> as the divers principles of plants or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables
are.</p>
               <p>25. And as little reaſon have we to think that
there is no ſort of <hi>Vnity</hi> among the divers Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
ſubſtances, ſeeing their nature is yet more
perfect, and liker to God, who is perfectly one.</p>
               <p>26. It is not to be doubted but the <hi>Vniverſe</hi> of
created being is <hi>one,</hi> conſiſting of parts compagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
and <hi>Vnited,</hi> though the bond of its <hi>Vnion</hi> be
not well known to us.</p>
               <p>27. But it is certain that they are all <hi>Vnited</hi> in <hi>God</hi>
(though we know not the chief created Cauſe of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;)
and that though it be below him to be the <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
ſoul</hi> of the world, yet is he <hi>more</hi> than ſuch a ſoul to
it: &amp; of <hi>Him,</hi> and <hi>through Him</hi> and <hi>to Him</hi> are all things,
who is <hi>All things</hi> in <hi>all things, above all</hi> and <hi>through
all</hi> and <hi>in us all</hi> (as is aforeſaid): and being more
intimate <hi>to all things</hi> as their proper form, is the
<hi>firſt Vniting principle</hi> of all <hi>being,</hi> as he is the firſt
<hi>Cauſe</hi> and the <hi>End</hi> of all. And yet it is <hi>Above</hi> the
<hi>Creatures</hi> to be accounted <hi>parts of God;</hi> for they are
not his Conſtitutive parts (who is moſt <hi>ſimple</hi>) but
ſlow from him by his Cauſal efflux, and ſo are by
many not falſly called, <hi>Vna emanatio Divina,</hi> or a
continued effect of one <hi>Divine creative</hi> or <hi>efficient Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition;</hi>
All <hi>One</hi> as <hi>In</hi> and <hi>Of</hi> and <hi>To One God,</hi>
and as compaginated among themſelves, and yet
<hi>Many</hi> by wonderful incomprehenſible diverſities:
<hi>Ab uno Omnia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>28. God is ſaid to be <hi>More One</hi> with ſome <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
than with others, as he <hi>operateth</hi> more excellent
effects in one than in others, and as he is related to
thoſe effects: but not as his <hi>eſſence</hi> is <hi>Nearer</hi> to <hi>One</hi> than
to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:55406:26"/>
29. Accordingly his <hi>Vnion</hi> with the Intellectual
Spirits, and ſouls of men is ſaid to be <hi>nearer,</hi> than
with Bodies, and his Communion anſwerably: But
that is becauſe they are the <hi>Nobler</hi> product of his
Creating or efficient Power and Will.</p>
               <p>30. And ſo he is ſaid to be more <hi>Vnited</hi> to holy
ſouls than to the unholy, to the Glorified than to
the dammed; Becauſe he maketh them <hi>Better,</hi> and
communicateth to them more of his <hi>Glory</hi> and the
effects of his <hi>Power, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi> As the Sun
is more United to a <hi>burning-glaſs,</hi> or to a place
where it ſhineth brightly, or to ſome excellent plant
which it quickneth, than to others.</p>
               <p>31. Accordingly we muſt conceive of that <hi>Vnion</hi>
(before mentioned <hi>Theſ.</hi> 10.) of Chriſt with Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
here, and with the glorified hereafter, as
to his <hi>Divine Nature;</hi> which may well be called
<hi>myſtical,</hi> and is of late become the ſubject of ſome
mens contentious oppoſition, and is matter of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
enquiry to the wiſeſt. And yet it is hard to ſay
that in all their hot oppoſition any ſober men are in
this diſagreed: For 1. it is by ſuch commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
that the Spirit of Chriſt doth operate more
excellent effects on believers than on others, and
on the Bleſſed than on the damned; even making
them liker unto God. 2. And that this Holy ſpirit
is by Covenant related to them, to operate for the
future more conſtantly and eminently in them than
in others. 3. And that this Spirit proceedeth and is
ſent from the Father and the Son to do theſe works.
4. And that Chriſt is Related to each <hi>Believing</hi> and
each <hi>Glorifyed</hi> ſoul, as one in Covenant ſelf-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
(or a Promiſer) thus by his Spirit to operate
on them. 5. And that he is thus Related to the
whole Church or ſociety of ſuch perſons, whereof
each Individual is a part.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:55406:26"/>
So that all this ſet together telleth us, that every
<hi>Believing</hi> and every <hi>Glorifyed ſoul</hi> is ſaid to be Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Chriſt in all theſe ſeveral conjunct reſpects
(as to his Godhead) 1. In that he eminently ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
Grace and Glory in them, that is, <hi>Holy Life,
Light and Love,</hi> by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> And this he
doth (as God doth all things) <hi>per eſſentiam,</hi> and
not as diſtant by an intermediate Vertue which is
neither Creator nor Creature: As the very Sun-beams
touch the illuminated and heated object. 2. By
a moral-relative Union by Covenant to that indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
perſon, to do ſuch things upon him.
(As husband and wife are United by Covenant for
certain uſes.) 3. By a <hi>Political Relative Vnion,</hi>
as that perſon is a member of the Church or Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
body, to which Chriſt is United by Promiſe
as aforeſaid: who denieth any of this, and who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth
more?</p>
               <p>32. And then our <hi>Vnion</hi> with Chriſts <hi>humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
(beſides the <hi>General</hi> and <hi>ſpecial Logical Vnion,</hi>
as he is a <hi>Creature,</hi> a <hi>Man,</hi> of the ſame <hi>Nature</hi> with
us) can be of no <hi>Higher</hi> or <hi>Nearer</hi> a ſort: But
differeth from the former, ſo far as the <hi>Operations</hi>
and <hi>Relation</hi> of a <hi>Created Medium</hi> differ from thoſe
of the Creator: That is, 1. The <hi>humane nature</hi> is
honoured and uſed by the Divine, as a <hi>ſecond cauſe</hi>
of the foreſaid effects of Grace and Glory on us.
2. The humane Nature (being of the ſame ſpecies
with ours) is by a Law, obligation and conſent, related
to each <hi>Believer</hi> and to all the Church, as the Root,
and chief Medium, Adminiſtrator and Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of this Grace and Glory; and ſo as our Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Head in the foreſaid Moral and Political ſenſe,
communicating thoſe <hi>Real Benefits.</hi> 3. And Chriſt
in his <hi>Humanity</hi> is the Authoriſed Lord and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of all inferiour means and cauſes, by which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55406:27"/>
and Grace and Glory is conveyed to us (as of
Angels, Miniſters, Word, Sacraments, changing
Providences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) 4. But whether his own <hi>Humane
Soul per eſſentiam &amp; immediatam attingentiam,</hi> do ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
on all <hi>holy ſouls,</hi> and ſo be <hi>Phyſically</hi> alſo <hi>Vnited
to them</hi> as the Sun is to the quickened plants or
animals, I told you before, I know not yet, but
hope ere long to know.</p>
               <p>33. Chriſts <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is United to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
in a peculiar ſort, as it is not to any other
creature. But it is not by any change of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine:
but by that peculiar poſſeſſing operation and
<hi>Relation,</hi> which no other created being doth partake
of, and which no mortal can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend;
of which I have ſaid more
elſewhere.<note n="*" place="margin">In Methodo Theologi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>34. All <hi>Creatures</hi> as ſuch are United in God
as the Root or firſt cauſe of Nature: All Believers
and Saints are United in Chriſt as the Head of the
Church, as aforeſaid; and in the <hi>Holy ſpirit</hi> as the
principle of their ſanctification.</p>
               <p>35. The Political Relative Union of ſuch Saints
among themſelves, is intelligible, and ſure; as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>One God,</hi> one <hi>Head,</hi> one <hi>Holy ſpirit:</hi> But (as
I ſaid before) how and how far their <hi>very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
is <hi>One,</hi> by an Unity analogous to <hi>Phyſical
Continuity</hi> (like the ſolar Light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and how far
and how they are ſubſtantially divers; and how
and how far the <hi>ſpirit of Holineſs</hi> doth in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
manner Unite the <hi>ſubſtances</hi> of <hi>Holy ſouls</hi> among
themſelves, (by Analogie to the Illuminated Air,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and how all ſouls and Angels are individuate
and diſtinguiſhed, I ſay again is paſt our reach.</p>
               <p>36. Seeing <hi>Vnion</hi> is ſo naturally deſired
as <hi>Perfection</hi> by all creatures known to us, it is
great mordinateneſs and folly to fear leſt death
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55406:27"/>
will by too near an Union end our individua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>37. And as <hi>things ſenſible</hi> are the firſt known by
man in fleſh, and we ſee that among them Union
deſtroyeth no part of their ſubſtance; but a ſand
or Atom is the ſame thing in Union with others as
it would be if ſeparate, or ſolitary, and a drop
of water hath as true and much <hi>exiſting</hi> ſubſtance
in the Ocean, as in its ſeparate ſtate, and ſo of a
particle of Air; we have reaſon to conclude
no worſe of the ingneous Element, nor yet of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
or Intellectual ſpirits: For 1. How far they
are paſſive and partible (being many) we know
not. Moſt of the old Fathers, eſpecially the Greeks
(as <hi>Fauſtus Regienſis</hi> cited them in the book which
<hi>Mammertus</hi> anſwered) thought that God only was
totally Immaterial or Incorporeal; And it muſt
not be denyed that every creature doth <hi>pati à Deo,</hi>
is paſſive as from God the firſt cauſe; and many
Philoſophers think that all <hi>Paſſivity</hi> is a conſequent or
proof of anſwerable Materiality; And many think
that we have no true notion of <hi>ſubſtantia,</hi> beſides
<hi>Relative</hi> (as it doth <hi>ſubſiſt</hi> of it ſelf and <hi>ſubſtare
accidentibus</hi>) but what is the ſame with <hi>Materia
puriſſima.</hi> 2. But ſuppoſing all this to be otherwiſe,
ſpirits being true <hi>ſubſtances,</hi> of a more perfect na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
than groſſe bodies, as they are more inclined
to Union <hi>inter ſe,</hi> ſo there is as little if not leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that they ſhould be loſers by that Union, than
that a drop of water ſhould be ſo: For the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the higheſt nature, muſt needs be more
the perfection of all the Parts (Phyſical or intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible)
than the perfection of the loweſt: And the
nobleſt inclineth not to its own loſs, by deſiring
Union which to the loweſt is no loſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:55406:28"/>
38. It is called in the Text [The <hi>Vnity of the
ſpirit</hi>] 1. As it is <hi>One ſpecies</hi> of <hi>Spiritual Grace</hi>
which all the members are endowed with, which is
their <hi>Holineſs,</hi> or <hi>Gods Image</hi> on them which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
The <hi>Spirit in us,</hi> becauſe it is the immediate
and excellent work of Gods ſpirit: As the <hi>Sun</hi> is
ſaid to be in the room becauſe it ſhineth there. 2.
As the <hi>Spirit</hi> is the efficient cauſe hereof. 3. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this <hi>One ſpirit</hi> in all the members inclineth them
to <hi>Vnity;</hi> even as the ſoul of every animal inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it to preſerve the Unity of all its parts, and
to abhor wounding and ſeparation, as that which
will be its pain and tendeth to its deſtruction, by
diſſolution.</p>
               <p>39. The Holineſs, or ſpiritual qualification of ſouls,
which is called The <hi>Spirit,</hi> is <hi>Holy</hi> or <hi>Divine, Life,
Light</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> or the holy diſpoſition of the ſouls
three natural faculties, <hi>Vital Power</hi> (or Activity)
<hi>Vnderſtanding</hi> and <hi>Will.</hi> As all men have <hi>One ſpecies</hi>
of humanity, ſo all Saints have this <hi>One ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>40. Though <hi>Quickning</hi> (by holy <hi>Life</hi>) and <hi>Illu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mination</hi>
be parts of <hi>ſanctification</hi> (or this <hi>ſpirit</hi>),
yet the laſt part [<hi>Love</hi>] is the compleating per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
part, and therefore is oft called <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
ſpecially; and by the word [<hi>Spirit</hi>] and [<hi>Love</hi>]
is oft meant the ſame thing. And when the <hi>ſpirit</hi>
is ſaid to be given to Believers, the meaning is, that
upon and by believing the wonderful demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Gods Love in Chriſt, the <hi>habit</hi> of <hi>holy
Love</hi> is kindled in us.</p>
               <p>41. This <hi>holy Love</hi> which is gods Image, (for
<hi>God is Love</hi>) uſually beginneth at things viſible,
as being the neareſt objects to man in fleſh; And as

us,</hi> and of <hi>good</hi> people, and of <hi>good words</hi> and <hi>actions;</hi>
But yet when we come up to the <hi>Love of God,</hi> it is <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
that is the <hi>chiefeſt object,</hi> in whom all the Church by
Love is centred: ſo that we thenceforth <hi>Love God for
himſelf,</hi> and all his <hi>ſervants</hi> and <hi>word</hi> as for <hi>his
ſake</hi> and impreſs on them. And our <hi>Vnion</hi> by
<hi>Love</hi> would not be perfect, if it United us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
only among our ſelves, and did not Unite us
all in God and our Redeemer. So that the <hi>Vnity</hi>
of <hi>the ſpirit</hi> is the <hi>Love of God in Chriſt and of all the
faithful,</hi> (yea and of all men ſo far as God appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in them) to <hi>which Gods ſpirit ſtrongly enclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all true believers; including</hi> holy <hi>Life</hi> and
<hi>Light,</hi> as tending to this <hi>Vnity</hi> of <hi>ſpiritual Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>42. Therefore <hi>Love</hi> is not diſtinctly named after,
among the particular terms of <hi>Vnity,</hi> as <hi>faith</hi> and
<hi>hope</hi> are; becauſe it is meant by that word [<hi>There
is One ſpirit.</hi>]</p>
               <p>43. The love and <hi>Vnity</hi> of Chriſtians as in <hi>One
Church,</hi> ſuppoſeth in <hi>Nature</hi> a Love to man as man,
and a deſire of the <hi>Vnity</hi> and concord of mankind:
As Chriſtianity ſuppoſeth humanity.</p>
               <p>44. But Experience and Faith aſſure us that this
humane Love and <hi>Vnity</hi> is wofully corrupted, and
much loſt; and that though mans ſoul be convinced by
natural light, that it is good, and have a general lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid
inclination to it, yet this is ſo weak &amp; uneffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
as that the principles of <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>diviſion</hi> prevail
againſt it, and keep the world in miſerable confuſion.</p>
               <p>45. It is the predominancy of the corrupt <hi>ſelfiſh
inclination</hi> which is the great Enemy and deſtroyer of
<hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Vnity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>46. Chriſtianity is ſo far from confining all our
Love to Chriſtians, that it is not the leaſt uſe
of it to revive and recover our <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>Men</hi> as <hi>Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
ſo that no men have a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>healed Love</hi> to <hi>mankind,</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:55406:29"/>
and <hi>deſire</hi> of <hi>univerſal Vnity,</hi> but believers.</p>
               <p>47. The pureſt and ſtrongeſt <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> is
<hi>univerſal.</hi> And it is not genuine Chriſtianity if it
do not incline us to <hi>Love all men as men,</hi> and all
<hi>profeſſed Chriſtians</hi> as ſuch, and all Saints as Saints;
according to their various degrees of amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>48. <hi>Love and Vnity</hi> which is not thus <hi>univerſal,</hi>
partaketh of <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

but a part of men, doth not love the reſt; and
he that is <hi>Vnited</hi> but to a part (whether great
or ſmall) is Schiſmatically divided from all the
reſt.</p>
               <p>49. But <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>All,</hi> muſt not be <hi>Equal to all,</hi>
nor our <hi>Vnity</hi> with all Equal, as on the ſame terms,
or in the ſame degree. As the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of meer
<hi>Humanity,</hi> and the meer <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is
leſs, and ſo leſs amiable, than is the Goodneſs of
true <hi>ſanctification;</hi> ſo our <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> muſt be
diverſified. All the members of the body muſt be
<hi>Loved,</hi> and their Unity carefully preſerved: But
yet not <hi>Equally;</hi> but the <hi>head</hi> as an <hi>head,</hi> and the
<hi>heart</hi> as an <hi>heart,</hi> and the <hi>ſtomach</hi> as a <hi>ſtomach,</hi>
and all the eſſential parts as <hi>Eſſential,</hi> without which
it is not a humane body: and all the <hi>integral</hi> parts
as <hi>ſuch,</hi> but diverſely according to their worth and
uſe: The eye as an eye, and a tooth but as a tooth.
Goodneſs being the object of Love, and Love being
the life of our <hi>Vnity,</hi> it varieth in degrees as Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
varieth.</p>
               <p>50. That <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> which is <hi>ſincere</hi> in
<hi>kind,</hi> may be mixt with lamentable <hi>wrath</hi> and
<hi>Schiſm</hi> (as all our Graces are with the contrary
ſin in our imperfect ſtate:) Not but that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
have an <hi>habitual inclination</hi> to <hi>Vniverſal Love</hi>
and <hi>Vnity;</hi> but the act may be hindred, by the want of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55406:29"/>
due information, and by falſe reports and miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations
of our brethren, which hide their
amiableneſs, and render them to ſuch more odious
than they are.</p>
               <p>51. Sincere and genuine <hi>Love and Vnity</hi> hath
an Univerſal care of all mankind, and is very apt
to enquire and take knowledge how it <hi>goeth</hi> with
all the world, and ſpecially with all the Churches:
For none can much love and deſire that which they
mind not, or take no thought of. And this is the
chief <hi>News</hi> which a true Chriſtian enquireth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whether <hi>Gods name be hallowed,</hi> his <hi>Kingdom
come,</hi> and <hi>his will be done on Earth, as it is done in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>

               <p>52. The <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> inclineth men to mourn
much for the ſects, Schiſms, diviſions and diſcords
of believers; and to ſmart in the ſenſe of them,
as the body does by its wounds. And they that

               </p>

of the ſpirit and peace, will appear in theſe
reſpects. 1. For the good of the particular perſons
that poſſeſs it. 2. For the good of Chriſtian ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties.
3. For the good of the uncalled world.
4. For the Glory and well-pleaſing of Jeſus Chriſt
and of the Father: of theſe in order.</p>
               <p>1. For the good of each particular perſon that
poſſeſſeth it.</p>
               <p>1. It is the very <hi>Health and Holineſs</hi> of the ſoul,
and the contrary is the very ſtate of <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>death.</hi>
What is <hi>Holineſs</hi> but that <hi>Vniting Love</hi> by which
the <hi>will</hi> adhereth to God and delighteth in his
Goodneſs as it ſhineth to us in his works, and
ſpecially in Chriſt and in all his members (and in a
common ſort in all mankind?) And what is the
unholy ſtate of ſin and death, but that <hi>Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ractedneſs</hi>
and retiring to our SELVES, by which the ſelfiſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
departeth from the due <hi>Love of God</hi> and <hi>others,</hi>
and of that holineſs which is contrary to this his
ſelfiſhneſs? So far as any mans Love is contracted,
narrowed, confined to himſelf, and to a few, ſo
far his ſoul is indeed unſanctified and void of the
<hi>Vnity of the Spirit,</hi> or the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Vnity.</hi> If a man
lived in baniſhment or a priſon uncapable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others any good, yet if he have that Love
and ſpirit of Unity which <hi>inclineth</hi> him to do it
if he could, this is his <hi>own health</hi> and rectitude,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55406:32"/>
and acceptable unto God. Little do many Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
people think how much they do miſtake
<hi>unholineſs</hi> and <hi>ſin</hi> it ſelf, for a degree of <hi>holineſs</hi>
above their neighbours! When they contract and
narrow their Chriſtian Love and Communion to
a party, and talk againſt the Churches of Chriſt,
by diſgraceful and Love-killing cenſures and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
as being not holy enough for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
this want of the ſpirit of Love and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
is their own want of holineſs it ſelf. It was
the old deceit of the Phariſees, which Chriſt the
meſſenger and mediator of love condemned, to
think that holineſs lay more in <hi>ſacrifices</hi> and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>
obſervances, and in a ſtrict keeping of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths
reſt and ſuch like, than in the <hi>Love of God
and all</hi> men: And the leſſon that Chriſt twice ſet
them to learn was, [<hi>I will have mercy and not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi>]
He hath moſt grace and holineſs who hath
moſt of the ſpirit of Love and Unity.</p>
               <p>2. It is the ſouls neceſſary qualification for that
life of true Chriſtianity which God hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us in the world. It is this inward <hi>Health</hi> which
muſt enable us to all our duty.</p>
               <p>1. Without this ſpirit of <hi>Vnity</hi> we cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the duties of the firſt table unto God: Our
ſacrifices will be as loathſome as theirs deſcribed
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. <hi>If we lift not up pure hands
without wrath,</hi> and <hi>wrangling</hi> (or diſputing) (for

                  </gap>, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.
8. than [doubting]) our prayers will not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God: Though it be <hi>Chriſts worthineſs</hi>
for which our prayers and ſervices are accepted,
yet there muſt be the ſubordinate worthineſs of
neceſſary qualification in our ſelves. For Chriſt
himſelf hath annexed ſpecially the expreſs menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this one qualification in the Lords prayer
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55406:33"/>
it ſelf [<hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes as we forgive them that
treſpaſs againſt us</hi>] and he repeateth it after, [<hi>For
if ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly Father
will forgive you your treſpaſſes; but if ye forgive not
men their treſpaſſes, neither will your heavenly Father
forgive you</hi>] Mat. 6. 13, 14. <hi>Love</hi> is here included
in [<hi>forgiving</hi>] as a cauſe in its effect: And Chriſt
rather nameth [<hi>forgiving</hi>] than [<hi>Love</hi>], becauſe
men may pretend to that act which is <hi>ſecret</hi> in
the heart, but if it ſhould not work in the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
fruits (of which forgiving others is one) it
would be but a vain pretence.</p>
               <p>And here I intreat the <hi>Reader</hi> to conſider a
while the ſingularities of this paſſage of Chriſt. 1. That
men that muſt truſt in <hi>Chriſts merits</hi> and <hi>mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
muſt yet be told of ſuch an abſolute neceſſity
of a <hi>Condition</hi> or <hi>qualification</hi> in themſelves. 2. That
<hi>Forgiving others</hi> as an <hi>Act of Love,</hi> is ſingled out
as <hi>this qualification.</hi> 3. That this condition muſt be
put into the very <hi>prayer it ſelf,</hi> that our own
mouths may utter it to God. 4. That it muſt be
annexed to this one petition of [<hi>Forgiveneſs</hi>] ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than any of the reſt, where men are apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
their own neceſſity, and where many are readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
to think that <hi>Gods mercy</hi> and <hi>Chriſts merits</hi>
and <hi>mediation</hi> muſt do all without any condition
on their part: They that know that [<hi>their daily
bread</hi>] and [<hi>deliverance from temptation</hi> and <hi>evil</hi>]
muſt have ſome care and endeavours of their own,
are yet apt to think that the <hi>Forgiveneſs of ſin</hi>
needeth nothing on their part but [<hi>asking</hi> and
<hi>receiving.</hi>] 5. That Chriſt ſhould after ſingle out
this one clauſe to repeat to them, by urgent
application. And yet how little is this laid to
heart?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:55406:33"/>
And indeed the firſt word in the Lords prayer [<hi>Our
Father</hi>] teacheth us the ſame leſſon, How needful
a qualification <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> are to all that will
come to God in prayer: He that teacheth us that
to <hi>Love our neighbour as our ſelves</hi> is the ſecond ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
Commandment, and even like to <hi>the firſt,</hi>
which is Love to God (for it is <hi>Loving God</hi> in his
<hi>Likeneſs</hi> on his works) doth here call us in all our
prayers to expreſs it, by Praying for our brethren as
for our ſelves. O that men of <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>wrangling</hi>
were truly ſenſible what affections ſhould be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by that word [<hi>OVR FATHER</hi>], and with
what a heart men ſhould ſay [GIVE US] and
[FORGIVE US] and how far [<hi>VS</hi>] muſt
extend beyond [ME] and beyond [OUR PAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY]
or [<hi>our ſide</hi>] or [<hi>our Church</hi>] in the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
ſenſe. I tell you if you will be welcome to God
in your prayers or any other religious ſervices, you
muſt come as in <hi>Vnion</hi> with Chriſt and with his Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Church: God will receive no one that cometh
to him as <hi>alone</hi> and <hi>divided</hi> from the reſt? As you
muſt have Union with <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Head, ſo muſt you
have with his Body: A divided member is no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
but a dead thing. Little think many ignorant
perſons of this, who think that the <hi>ſingularity</hi> and
<hi>ſmallneſs</hi> of their ſect or party is the neceſſary ſign
of their acceptance with God: Becauſe they read
[<hi>Fear not little flock:</hi>] As if [<hi>a little flock</hi>] muſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from <hi>Chriſts little flock,</hi> for fear of being <hi>too
great?</hi> And as if his <hi>Flock</hi> which then was but a
few hundreds muſt be no greater, when the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the world are become his Kingdoms? Yet
ſuch have there been of late among us, who firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
(as they were called) <hi>Puritans,</hi> or <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
when they ſaw them a ſmall and ſuffering party.
But when they proſpered and multiplyed, they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55406:34"/>
turned <hi>Independents</hi> or <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> thinking that the
former were too many to be the true Church. And
on the ſame reaſon when the <hi>Independents</hi> proſpered
they turned <hi>Anabaptiſts;</hi> And when <hi>they</hi> proſpered,
they turned <hi>Quakers,</hi> thinking that unleſs it were a
ſmall and ſuffering party it could not be the <hi>Little
flock of Chriſt.</hi> As if he that is called <hi>The Saviour
of the world,</hi> would take it for his honour to be the
Saviour only of a few Families or Villages, and his
Kingdom muſt be as little as <hi>Bethlehem</hi> where he was
born.</p>
               <p>Should they take the ſame courſe about their <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi>
and ſay, that it is not the language of <hi>Canaan</hi>
but of the <hi>beaſt,</hi> if it grow common, and ſo take up
with a <hi>new one,</hi> that it might be a <hi>narrow one,</hi> the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of it would diſcover it ſelf: And what is the
excellency of a Language but <hi>ſignificancy</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive
community?</hi> and what greater plague ſince
<hi>Adams</hi> ſin hath befaln mankind, than the diviſion of
tongues? as hindering communication, and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Goſpel? And what greater bleſſing as
a means to univerſal Reformation could be given
men, than an univerſal common language? And
what is the property of <hi>Babel</hi> but diviſion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
of tongues? And doth not all this intimate
the neceſſity of a Union of minds?</p>
               <p>While we keep in the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
we may, we muſt ſtrive for ſuch a <hi>ſingularity,</hi> as
conſiſteth in an <hi>excellency</hi> of <hi>degree,</hi> and endeavour
to be the <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>holieſt</hi> perſons, and the uſefulleſt
members in the body of Chriſt. But if once you
muſt ſeparate from the <hi>body</hi> as <hi>too good</hi> to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of ſo <hi>great</hi> or ſo <hi>bad</hi> a ſociety, you periſh.</p>
               <p>God will own <hi>no Church</hi> which is <hi>ſo Independent</hi> as

them as Chriſts members, and have communion with
them in faith and Love, and holy profeſſion of
both; and while we are abſent in body, muſt be as
preſent in ſpirit with them, and ſtill come to God
as in <hi>communion with all his Church</hi> on earth, and offer
up our prayers as in conjunction with them, and not
as a ſeparated independent thing.</p>
               <p>2. And as our <hi>Vnity</hi> is part of our neceſſary
fitneſs for duties of <hi>holy worſhip,</hi> ſo is it alſo for
<hi>duties</hi> of the ſecond table, that is; of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and
<hi>Charity</hi> to men: And this is evident in the nature
of the thing. No man will be exact in <hi>Juſtice</hi> till
he <hi>do as he would be done by:</hi> And who can do that
who Loveth not his neighbour as <hi>himſelf?</hi> What is
our <hi>unity</hi> but our <hi>Love</hi> to others as <hi>our ſelves?</hi> And
how can we do the works of Love without Love?
It is <hi>divided</hi> SELF that is the cauſe of all the
unmercifulneſs and injuſtice in the world. Unity
maketh my neighbour to be to me as my ſelf, and
his Intereſt and welfare to be to me as my own, and
his loſs and hurt to be as mine: And were he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
my ſelf, and his welfare and his hurt mine
own, you may judge without many words how I
ſhould uſe him; whether I ſhould ſhew him mercy
in his wants and miſery? whether I ſhould rejoice
with him in his joy, and mourn with him in his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows?
whether I ſhould ſpeak well or ill of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
his back? and whether I ſhould perſecute him,
and undo him? whether I ſhould defame him and
write books to render him odious, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the rulers that he is unworthy to have the
liberty of a Chriſtian or of a man; to preach, to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55406:35"/>
pray, to be converſed with, or to live! Would not
<hi>uniting Love</hi> make a wonderful change in ſome mens
judgements, ſpeeches and behaviour, and make thoſe
men good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or good <hi>Moraliſts</hi> at leaſt, who
now when they have cryed up Morality, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and good works, would perſwade men by the
Commentary of their practice, that they mean
<hi>Malignity, cruelty,</hi> and the propagating of hatred
and all iniquity? Where there is not a dominion of
LOVE and UNITY, there is a dominion of
SELFISHNESS and ENMITY; and how
well theſe will keep the Commandments which are
all fulfilled in LOVE, how well they
will <hi>do good to all men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 12, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>eſpecially to
them of the houſhold of faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 6, 7, 8.</note> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
one another to Love and to good
works,</hi> it is eaſie for any man to judge. Once alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
mens hearts from one another, and the Life
will ſhew the alienation.</p>
               <p>3. This UNITY of SPIRIT (and ſpirit
of <hi>unity</hi>) is our neceſſary preſervation againſt <hi>ſins</hi>
of <hi>commiſſion</hi> (as well as of omiſſion as aforeſaid),
even againſt the common iniquities of the world:
LOVE and UNITY tyrannize not over infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
contrive not to tread down others that
we may riſe, and to keep them down to ſecure our
domination: They oppreſs not the poor, the weak,
or innocent: They make not ſnares for other mens
Conſciences, nor lay ſtumbling-blocks before them,
to occaſion them to ſin, nor drive men on to ſin
againſt. Conſcience, and ſo to hell, to ſhew mens au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
in a thing of nought. Had this ruled in
<hi>Ahab</hi> and his Prophets, <hi>Michaiah</hi> had not been ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
on the mouth, nor fed in a Priſon with the bread
and water of affliction; nor had <hi>Elijah</hi> been hunted
after as the troubler of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Had this <hi>unity of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55406:35"/>
ſpirit</hi> ruled in <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and in <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> one had not
ſtretcht out his hand againſt the Prophet, nor the
other deſpiſed experienced Counſellours, to make
heavier the burdens of the complaining people.
Had it overcome the SELFISHNESS of the
Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> their Calves and High places had
not engaged them againſt the Prophets, and been
their ruine. Had it prevailed in the Kings of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
and their people, <hi>Jeremy</hi> had not been laid in
the dungeon, nor had they forbid <hi>Amos</hi> to propheſie
at the <hi>Kings Chapel</hi> or his <hi>Court,</hi> nor had they
<hi>mocked the meſſengers of God,</hi> and <hi>deſpiſed his prophets,
till the wrath of the Lord aroſe and there was no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
2 Chron. 26. 16.</p>
               <p>Had this <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Vnity</hi> been in the perſecuting
Jews, they would not have counted <hi>Paul</hi> a <hi>peſtilent
fellow, and a mover of ſedition among the people,</hi> nor
have hunted the Apoſtles with implacable fury, nor
have <hi>forbidden</hi> them to <hi>preach to the Gentiles that they
might be ſaved,</hi> and have brought Gods <hi>wrath</hi> upon
themſelves to the <hi>uttermoſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2. 15, 16.</p>
               <p>Had this <hi>Vnity</hi> of ſpirit prevailed in the <hi>Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
and other hereticks of old, they had not ſo
early grieved the Apoſtles, and divided and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
the primitive Church, nor raiſed ſo many
Sects and parties among Chriſtians, nor put the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
to ſo many vehement obteſtations againſt them,
and ſo many ſharp objurgations and reproofs: Nor
had there been down to this day a continuation for
ſo many hundred years, of the Churches woful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions
and calamities by the two ſorts of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Clergie Tyrants</hi> on one ſide, and the
ſwarms of <hi>reſtleſs Sectaries</hi> on the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And if the</hi> Spirit <hi>of</hi> Vnity <hi>ruled in the</hi> people, <hi>there
would he leſs rebelling, repining and murmuring
againſt Governours, but ſubjects would render to</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:55406:36"/>
all their <hi>dues: tribute to whom tribute, cuſtome to whom
cuſtome, fear to whom fear</hi> is due, and <hi>honour to whom
honour,</hi> Rom. <hi>13. 7.</hi> They would <hi>owe nothing to any
man but to Love one another,</hi> v. <hi>8. For he that loveth
another hath fulfilled the Law: For this, Thou ſhalt not
commit adultery, Thou ſhalt not kill, Thou ſhalt not ſteal,
Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs, Thou ſhalt not covet,</hi>
and if there be any other Commandment, <hi>it is briefly
comprehended in this ſaying, Thou ſhalt Love thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as thy ſelf. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour:
Therefore Love is the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> v. <hi>9, 10.</hi>
Love is <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> and <hi>kind; Love envyeth not:</hi>
Love <hi>vaunteth not it ſelf</hi> (or is not <hi>raſh) nor is
puffed up, doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly; ſeeketh not
her own, is not eaſily provoked</hi> (or <hi>ſiercely angry),
thinketh no evil, rejoyceth not in iniquity, but rejoyceth
in</hi> (or <hi>with</hi>) the <hi>truth: Love beareth</hi> (or <hi>conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,
endureth all things, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>13. 4,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Did the <hi>Vnity</hi> of <hi>the ſpirit</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> prevail, it
would undo moſt of the Lawyers, Atturneys, Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citors,
Proctors: It would give the Judges a great
deal of eaſe: It would be a moſt effectual corrector
of the preſs, of the pulpit, of the table talk of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniators
and backbiters; It would heal factious
preachers and people, and many a thouſand ſins it
would prevent. In a word, <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> are the
moſt <hi>excellent Law.</hi> They are a Law <hi>eminenter:</hi> For
it is to ſuch that the Apoſtle ſaith, there needeth no
Law: that is, no <hi>forcing conſtraining Law</hi> which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
an <hi>unwilling ſubject:</hi> For what a man <hi>Loveth,</hi>

their own ſouls, as they do their <hi>bodies,</hi> piety and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55406:36"/>
juſtice and concord and felicity would be as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
as humanity is.</p>
               <p>As the beſt phyſicions are moſt for ſtrengthening
<hi>nature,</hi> which is the true curer of diſeaſes, ſo he
that could ſtrengthen <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> would ſoon
cure moſt of the perſecutions, ſchiſms, reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,

which ſelſiſhneſs cauſeth in the world.</p>
               <p>4. The <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is neceſſary to the <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of our joy,</hi> and the true conſolation of our lives:
A private ſelfiſh Spirit, hath very little matter to
feed his joy; even his own poor narrow and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
pleaſures: And what are theſe to the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
which feaſt the joy and pleaſure of a publick
mind? If <hi>Love Vnite</hi> me as a Chriſtian to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and as a man to all the world, the bleſſings of
Chriſtians and the mercies of all the world are mine.
When I am poor in my own body, I am rich in milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of others, and therefore rich in mind: When
I am ſick and pained in this narrow piece of fleſh, I
am well in millions whoſe health is mine: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I am well in mind: when I am neglected, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
ſlandered, perſecuted in this vile and periſhing
body, I am honoured in the honour of all my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and I proſper in their proſperity, I abound in
their plenty, I am delivered in their deliverances; I
poſſeſs the comfort of all the good which they poſſeſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> By the ſame reaſon you may ſay, that you are
holy in their holineſs, and righteous in their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<hi>which will be</hi> a fanatical kind of com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He that is himſelf <hi>unholy</hi> and <hi>unrighteous,</hi>
hath not this <hi>Vnity</hi> with holy righteous perſons: He
that hath not the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> hath not the unity of the
<hi>ſpirit:</hi> This frivolous objection therefore goeth
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55406:37"/>
upon a miſtake, as if this <hi>Vnity</hi> were common to
the ungodly. But to thoſe that have the ſpirit of
Unity indeed, the comfort of all <hi>other mens holineſs</hi>
is <hi>theirs,</hi> and that in more than one reſpect. 1. By
ſome degree of cauſal participation; As the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
health of the body is extended to the benefit
of each particular member; And the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
of the Kingdom, doth good to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſubjects: Goodneſs in all men is of a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative
nature; as Light and Heat are: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as a greater fire, much more the <hi>Sun,</hi> doth
ſend forth a more extenſive Light and Heat than a
ſpark or candle; ſo the Grace of Life in the <hi>Vnited
body</hi> of Chriſt, doth operate more powerfully for
every member, than it would do were it confined to
that member ſeparatedly: As in the <hi>holy Aſſemblies</hi>
we find by ſweet experience, that a conjunction of
many holy ſouls doth add alacrity to every one in
particular: And it is a more lively joyful work, and
liker to heaven, to pray and praiſe God with many
hundreds or thouſands of faithful Chriſtians, than
with a few. I know not how the conceit of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
may work on ſome, but for my part Gods
praiſes ſung or ſaid in a full aſſembly of zealous, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and ſerious perſons, is ſo much ſweeter to me
than a narrower Communion (yea though many
bad and ignorant perſons ſhould be preſent) that
I muſt ſay that it is much againſt my will, when
ever I am deprived of ſo excellent a help.</p>
               <p>2. And as <hi>Efficiently,</hi> ſo <hi>Objectively</hi> a holy ſoul by
this Unity of <hi>ſpirit</hi> hath a part in the bleſſings and
Graces of all the world. He can know them and
think of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (ſo far as he is <hi>One</hi> with them) with
ſuch pleaſure as he thinketh of his own. For what
ſhould hinder him? Do we not ſee that husband and
wife are pleaſed by the Riches and honour of each
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55406:37"/>
other, becauſe their <hi>Vnion</hi> maketh all to be common
to them? Are not Parents pleaſed to ſee their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
proſper, and every one delighted in the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of his friend? what then if all the world were
as near and dear to us as a husband, a child, or a
boſome friend? would it not be our conſtant plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to think of Gods bleſſings to them, as if they
were our own? A narrow ſpot of ground doth
yield but little fruit, in compariſon of a whole
Kingdom, or all the earth: And he that fetcheth his
content and pleaſure from ſo little a clod of earth as
his own body, muſt have but a poor and pitiful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in compariſon of him that can rejoice in the
good of all the world. It is <hi>Vniting Love,</hi> which is
the great enriching, contenting and felicitating <hi>art.</hi>
(An <hi>Art</hi> I call it as it is a thing <hi>Learned</hi> and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by Rule, but more than an <hi>Art,</hi> even a <hi>Nature</hi> as
to its fixed inclination.)</p>
               <p>3. And <hi>Vnion maketh</hi> other mens <hi>Good</hi> to be all
<hi>ours,</hi> (as <hi>efficiently</hi> and <hi>objectively,</hi> ſo alſo) <hi>finally:</hi>
As all is but a <hi>means</hi> to <hi>one</hi> and the ſame <hi>end</hi> in which
we meet: It is <hi>my ends</hi> that are attained by all the
Good that is <hi>done</hi> and <hi>poſſeſſed</hi> in the world. They
that have <hi>One</hi> holy <hi>ſpirit,</hi> have <hi>one end.</hi> The Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of God in the felicity of his Church, and the
perfection of his works, and the <hi>Fulfilling and
Pleaſing</hi> of his bleſſed <hi>will</hi> in this his Glory, is the
<hi>end</hi> that every true believer doth intend and live for
in the world: And this <hi>One End,</hi> all Saints, all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
all Creatures are carrying on as means. If I
be a Chriſtian indeed, I have nothing ſo dear to
me, or ſo much deſired as this <hi>Pleaſing</hi> and Glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God, in the good and perfection of his works:
This is my Intereſt: In this he muſt grati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ie me that
will be my friend: All things are as nothing to me,
but for this: And in this all the world, but ſpecially
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55406:38"/>
all Saints are continually ſerving me: In ſerving
God they are ſerving me; while they ſerve my
chiefeſt end and intereſt. If I have a houſe to build,
or a field to till, or a garden to dreſs, do not the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of all the builders and workmen ſerve me,
and pleaſe me, while it is my work that they do.
This is no fancy but the real caſe of every wiſe and
holy perſon: He hath ſet his heart and hope upon
that <hi>end,</hi> which all the world are joyntly carrying
on, and which ſhall certainly be accompliſhed. O
bleſſed be that Infinite <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> which
teacheth this <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and giveth this <hi>Vniting Love</hi>
to every holy ſoul! All other wayes are <hi>dividing,
narrow,</hi> poor and baſe: This is the true and certain
way for <hi>every man</hi> to be a poſſeſſour of <hi>all mens
bleſſings,</hi> and to be owner of the good of all the
world. They are all doing our Heavenly Fathers
will, and all are bringing about the common end
which every true believer ſeeketh. It is this baſe
and narrow SELFISHNESS and inordinate
contractedneſs of ſpirit, and adhering to <hi>individual
intereſt,</hi> which contradicteth all this, and hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us from the preſent joyful taſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the fruits of
UNITY which we now hear and read of.</p>
               <p>Yea I can dye with much the greater willingneſs,
becauſe (beſides my hopes of heaven) I live even
on earth when I am dead: I live in all that live,
and ſhall live till the end of all. I am not of the
mind of the <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> perſon, that ſaith, <hi>when I am
dead, all the world is dead or at an end to me:</hi>
But rather, God is my higheſt object: His Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and complacency is my End: Theſe ſhine and
are attained more in and by the whole Creation
than by me: while theſe go on, the End is attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
which I was made for: And I ſhall never be
ſeparated living or dead from the univerſal Church
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55406:38"/>
or univerſal world: ſo that when I am dead, my
end, my intereſt, my united fellow-Chriſtians and
Creatures will ſtill live. If I loved my friend <hi>better</hi>
than my <hi>ſelf,</hi> it would be <hi>leſs grief</hi> to me to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
than for him to be baniſhed: And ſo it would
be leſs grief to me to dye, than for him to dye.
And if I loved the Church and the world but half
as much more than my ſelf, as my reaſon is fully
convinced there is cauſe, it would ſeem to me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
a ſmaller evil to dye my ſelf than that
the Church or world ſhould dye. As long as my
Garden flouriſheth, I can bear the death of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
flowers, whoſe place will the next ſpring be
ſucceeded by the like: And as long as my Orchard
liveth I can bear the falling of a leaf or an apple,
yea of all the leaves and fruit in Autumn, which
the next ſpring will repair and reſtore in kind,
though not thoſe individual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What am I that
the world ſhould miſs me, or that my death ſhould
be taken by others or by me, for a matter of any
great regard? I can think ſo of another, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can think ſo of me: But unhappy <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi>
maketh it hard for every man or any man to think
ſo of himſelf. Did UNITY more prevail in
men, and SELFISHNESS leſs, it would more
rejoice a dying man, that the Power, Wiſdom and
Goodneſs of God, will continue to ſhine forth in
the Church and world, and that others ſhall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
him in ſerving God and his Church when he
is dead, than it would grieve him that he muſt dye
himſelf.</p>
               <p>Yea more than all this, this Holy UNITY will
make all the <hi>Joyes of Heaven</hi> to be partly ours.
Even while we are here in pain and ſorrows, we
are members of the Body, whoſe Beſt part is above
with Chriſt; and therefore their joyes are by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55406:39"/>
ours, as the pleaſure of the head and
heart extendeth to the ſmalleſt members. Would
it be nothing to a mother if all her children, or
to a friend if all his friends, had all the proſperity
and joy that he could wiſh them?</p>
               <p>The <hi>nearer</hi> and <hi>ſtronger</hi> this holy UNITY is,
the more joyfully will a believer here look up, and
ſay, Though I am poor or ſick or ſuffer, it is not
ſo with any of the bleſſed ones above: My fellow
Chriſtians now rejoyce in Glory: The Angels with
whom I ſhall live for ever are full of Joy in the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Jehovah: My bleſſed Head hath Kingdom
and Power and Glory and Perfection. Though I
am yet weak and muſt paſs through the gates of
death, the Glori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ied world are triumphing in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Joyes; Their Knowledge, their Love, their
Praiſes of God, are perfect and everlaſting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all fears of death or any decay or interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
UNITY giveth us a part in all the Joyes
of earth and heaven: And what then is more deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to a Believer?</p>
               <p>5. And in all that is ſaid it appeareth that
UNITY is a great and neceſſary part of our
<hi>preparation for ſufferings and death:</hi> without this
men want the principal comforts that ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them: They that can fetch comfort neither
from Earth nor from Heaven, but only from the
narrow intereſt of themſelves, are like a withering
branch that's broken from the tree, or like a lake
of water ſeparated from the ſtream, that will ſoon
dry up: A <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> perſon hath neither the motives to
right ſuffering, nor the trueſt cordials for a dying
man. Something or other in this <hi>ſinful</hi> SELF
will be ſtill amiſs; And a ſelfiſh perſon will be ſtill
caring, fearing or complaining: Becauſe he can
take but little pleaſure, in remembring that <hi>all is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55406:39"/>
well in Heaven,</hi> and that if <hi>he</hi> were <hi>nothing,</hi> God
would be <hi>ſtill Glorified in the world.</hi> Therefore the
more <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> true Chriſtians are, the leſs is their peace,
and the more their hearts do ſink in ſuffering:
Their Religion reacheth little higher than to be
ſtill poring on a ſinful, confuſed heart, and asking,
How ſhould I be aſſured of my own ſalvation?
When a Chriſtian that hath more of the Spirit of
UNITY, is more taken up with ſweeter things,
ſtudying how to Glorifie God in the world, and
rejoycing in the aſſurance that his name ſhall be hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
his Kingdom ſhall come, and his Will ſhall
be done, yea and is perfectly done in Heaven:
that which is firſt in his deſires and prayers, is
ever the chiefeſt in his thankſgivings, and his Joyes.</p>

               <p>II. AS the UNITY of the Spirit is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
welfare of every Chriſtian, ſo is it
the <hi>common intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Societies, Kingdoms, Cities, Schools and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies:
And that in all theſe reſpects.</p>
               <p>I. UNITY is <hi>the very life of the Church</hi> (and
of all Societies as ſuch). The word LIFE is
ſometime taken for the LIVING PRINCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE
or FORM, and ſo the SOUL is the
LIFE of a Man, and the SPIRIT as dwelling
and working in us, is the Moral or holy-ſpiritual
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55406:40"/>
LIFE of the ſoul, and of the Church as myſtical:
And ſometime LIFE is taken for the <hi>VNION</hi>
of the ſaid vital principle with the Organical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or matter duly united in it ſelf: And ſo the
UNION of ſoul and body is the Life of a man;
and the <hi>Vnion</hi> of the Political Head and Body is
the Life of political Societies: And ſo the <hi>Vnion</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> is the Life of the Church;
And the Union of the members among themſelves,
is (as the union of the parts of the organical body)
the neceſſary <hi>Diſpoſitio materiae,</hi> without which it
cannot have Union with the <hi>Head;</hi> or the effect
of <hi>Vnion</hi> with the Vital principle, and ſo the Union
which is eſſential to the Church. As that is no
<hi>Body</hi> whoſe parts are not <hi>united</hi> among themſelves,
nor no <hi>Living Body</hi> which is not united to the <hi>ſoul</hi>
(and in it ſelf); ſo that is no Church or no Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which is not <hi>Vnited</hi> in it ſelf; and no Chriſtian
Society or Church which is not united unto
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It is a groſs overſight of them that look at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Regeneration of the members, as eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
to the Church, and take <hi>Vnity</hi> to be but a
ſeparable Accident. Yea indeed Regeneration it
ſelf conſiſteth in the <hi>Vniting</hi> of perſons by <hi>Faith</hi>
and <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and the Redeemer and to the body
of the Church: And if <hi>Vnion</hi> be <hi>Life,</hi> then Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is no Leſs than <hi>Death:</hi> Not every degree of
diviſion: For ſome breaches among Chriſtians are
but wounds: (But to be divided or ſeparated from
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> or from the Univerſal Church which is his
body, is Death it ſelf: And even <hi>wounds</hi> muſt have
a timely cure, or elſe they threaten at leaſt the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
of the wounded part.)</p>
               <p>

II. UNITY is the <hi>health, eaſe</hi> and <hi>quiet</hi> of the
Church and all Societies, as well as of each perſon:
And <hi>Diviſion</hi> is its <hi>ſmart</hi> and <hi>pain:</hi> And a divided
diſagreeing Society is a wounded or ſick Society;
in continual ſuffering and diſeaſe: But how eaſie,
ſweet, and pleaſant is it, when brethren dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in Unity? when they are not of many minds,
and wills and wayes; when they ſtrive not againſt
each other, and live not in wrangling and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when they have not their croſs intereſts, wills
and parties, and envy not or grudge not againſt
each other: But every one taketh the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
to be his own; and ſmarteth in all his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns
ſufferings and hurts: when they ſpeak the
ſame things, and mind the ſame intereſt, and carry
on the ſame ends and work?</p>
               <q>
                  <l>O foelix hominum genus</l>
                  <l>Si veſtros animos Amor</l>
                  <l>Quo coelum regitur, regat, <hi>ſaith</hi> Boetius.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Many contrivances good men have had, for the
recovering of the peace and felicity of Societies:
And they that deſpaired of accompliſhing it, have
pleaſed themſelves with feigning ſuch Societies as
they thought moſt happy: whence we have <hi>Plato</hi>'s
Common-wealth, <hi>Moor</hi>'s <hi>Vtopia, Campanella's Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
ſolis,</hi> &amp;c. But when all is done, he is the wiſeſt
and happieſt Politician, and the beſt friend and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor
to Societies and to mankind, who is the
skilfulleſt contriver, and beſt promoter of UNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TING
LOVE. I know that this is (like Life
in man) a work that requireth more than <hi>Art:</hi>
But yet I will not ſay <hi>hoc non eſt artis, ſed pietatis
opus,</hi> as if art did nothing in it: It is Gods work
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55406:41"/>
bleſſing mans endeavours. Even in the propagation
of natural Life, though <hi>Deus &amp; ſol vivificant,</hi> God is
the Quickener, and Fountain of all life; yet man is
the <hi>Generator</hi> (even if it prove true that the ſoul is
created): And God will not do it without the act
of man: So God will not bleſs Churches, and
Kingdoms and Families, with <hi>Vniting-Love,</hi> without
the ſubordinate endeavours of man: And the <hi>skill</hi>
and <hi>honeſty</hi> of the endeavourers greatly conduceth
to the ſucceſs of the work: Men that ſtand in a
ſignificant capacity (as <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>publick Teachers</hi>
do) may do much by holy <hi>Art</hi> to promote <hi>Vniting-Love</hi>
in all Societies; By <hi>contriving</hi> an <hi>Vniting of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,</hi>
(and not by cudgelling them all into the
ſame Temples or Synagogues as priſoners into a
Jaile); and by diligent clear teaching them the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
and neceſſity of <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
of <hi>dividing ſelfiſhneſs:</hi> But of this more after
in due place. All the devices in the world for the
felicity of Societies which tend not unto <hi>Vnity,</hi> and
all wayes of <hi>Vnity</hi> which promote not <hi>Love,</hi> are
erroneous and meerly frivolous: And all that are
<hi>Contrary</hi> to <hi>Love</hi> are pernicious, whatever the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers
pretend or dream.</p>
               <p>III. UNITY is the <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>preſervation</hi> of
Societies, and <hi>Selfiſhneſs</hi> and <hi>Diviſion</hi> is their <hi>weakneſs,</hi>
their <hi>diſſolution</hi> and their <hi>ruine.</hi> As in <hi>Natural,</hi> ſo
in Political Bodies, the cloſeſt and perfecteſt <hi>Vnion</hi>
of Parts, maketh the firmeſt and moſt durable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.
What is the ſtrength of an <hi>Army</hi> but
their UNITY? When they obey one General
Commander, and cleave inſeparably together, and
forſake not one another in fight, ſuch an Army
would conquer far greater multitudes of incoherent
ſeparable men: when every Souldier thinketh how
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55406:41"/>
to ſhift for himſelf, and to ſave his own life what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
become of others, a few run away firſt, and
ſhew the reſt the way, and they are quickly all made
conquered fugitives: when they that reſolve [We
muſt all ſtand or fall together, and we will not <hi>Live</hi>
or eſcape alone; It is more the Army than my Life
that I would preſerve] theſe are ſeldom over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by any policy or power. What is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of an Army, but the routing and ſcattering of
them? The ſtrength of compoſed bodies lyeth in
the <hi>great Number</hi> of <hi>parts</hi> moſt <hi>inſeparably conjoyned.</hi>
Small Cities and Republicks are made a prey to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Princes, becauſe they are inſufficient for their
own defence, and are hardly <hi>Vnited</hi> with their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
for mutual preſervation. An United flame
of many Combuſtibles conſumeth all without reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
when divided ſparks and candles have no
ſuch power: Divided drops of rain are eaſily born,
when United ſtreams and floods bear down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them. He can break a ſingle thread, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
break a cord that is made of multitudes. And
though the chief <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the Church of Chriſt
be not in themſelves, but in their God and Head,
yet God fitteth every thing to the uſe that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigneth
it to, and maketh that creature, that perſon,
that ſociety ſtrong, which he will have to be moſt
ſafe and durable, and to do the works and bear the
burdens that require ſtrength. Though we have all
<hi>one God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> yet are there great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of gifts and graces; and as there are ſtrong
and weak Chriſtians, ſo there are ſtrong and weak
Churches and Common-wealths.</p>
               <p>O what great things can that Church or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
do, which is fully United in it ſelf! What
great aſſaults can they withſtand and overcome!
But the Devil himſelf knoweth that a Kingdom or a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55406:42"/>
houſe divided cannot ſtand, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 25, 26. And
therefore by ſome kind of Concord
(whatever it is) even Satans King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is upheld:<note place="margin">Mark 3. 24, 25. Luke 11. 17, 18.</note> And by <hi>Diſcord</hi> it

Chriſts Kingdom to be ſtronger than the Devils,

thing, and <hi>ſimilitude</hi> is another. 2. <hi>Active</hi> Concord
or Union of excellent coherent and cooperative na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
is one thing, and <hi>Negative</hi> non-repugnancy of
dead or baſer creatures is another.</p>
               <p>1. As there is a great <hi>ſimilitude</hi> between incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſands or drops of rain, ſo is there between un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
men: They are very like in their <hi>privations</hi>

faithful are not only <hi>Like,</hi> but <hi>Vnited,</hi> as many drops

not among themſelves, becauſe they are <hi>unactive</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
whoſe nature is to <hi>lye ſtill;</hi> while parents and

And yet there is that <hi>Vnity</hi> in Parents and Children,
inclining them to the Loving Communion of each
other, which is not in the ſand or duſt or dead.</p>
               <p>And ſo wicked men in ſome caſes have not thoſe
vital principles which are neceſſary to an <hi>active

Dogs will not ſtrive or fight for Gold or Lands or

for greater edification and advancement
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55406:45"/>

and <hi>offences,</hi> contrary to Chriſts doctrine of

which he made the <hi>Nature</hi> and character and badge
of his true diſciples) but by thoſe <hi>good words and
fair ſpeeches deceived the hearts of the ſimple</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable.
Here there are four words eſpecially to
be noted: 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which we tranſlate good
words, is commonly tranſlated <hi>flattery;</hi> but as <hi>Beza</hi>
well noteth, it ſignifieth a <hi>ſpeaking of things</hi> that are
plauſible in themſelves for ſome good that is in
them, and that are pretended to be all ſpoken for
the hearers good; as <hi>Satan</hi> pretended when he
tempted <hi>Eve;</hi> yea, perhaps to be neceſſary to their
ſalvation, or to make them the moſt knowing and
excellent ſort of Chriſtians. 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
both to <hi>Bleſs them</hi> as miniſters do that deſire
their happineſs, and to praiſe them and ſpeak well
or highly of them: And ſo almoſt all ſects and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
bodies are gathered by flattering the hearers
into a conceit that thus they ſhall become the ſureſt
and moſt excellent Chriſtians; and all others are
far inferiour to them. 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, It is the <hi>Hearts</hi>
of ſuch hearers that are deceived, and not their
<hi>heads</hi> or reaſon only or chiefly: For the <hi>good words</hi>
firſt take with them by moving <hi>their Paſſions</hi> or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
And then the <hi>Praiſe,</hi> fair promiſes and
ſpeeches kindle a kind of ſecret ſpiritual pride and
ambition in the heart, as Satans words did in <hi>Eve</hi>
to be as Gods in Knowledge: And the <hi>Heart</hi> thus
infected and puft up promoteth the deceit of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.
4. And this is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>hominum

fools,</hi> but ſuch <hi>ſimple perſons</hi> as we call harmleſs or
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55406:46"/>
                  <hi>innocents,</hi> (as the Vulgar Latine tranſlates it), <hi>well
meaning men,</hi> or <hi>not ill men:</hi> People that fear God
and have good deſires and meanings, are for want
of Judgement and watchfulneſs overcome by divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>And on the contrary, the amiable examples of
<hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Concord,</hi> and their happy effects, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in Scripture, to make us in Love with them:
but none ſo eminent as that of the firſt Chriſtians.
It is very remarkable, that when Chriſt would ſhew
the world the work of his Mediation in its notable
effects, and when he would ſhew them the excellency
of his diſciples about the common world, and of his
Church under the Goſpel above that under <hi>Moſes</hi>
Law, he doth it by ſhewing them in the power and
exerciſe of <hi>Vniting Love. Love</hi> was it which he came
to exerciſe and demonſtrate (his Fathers and his
own): Love was that which he came to kindle in
their ſouls, and bring them to poſſeſs and practiſe:
Perfect Love is the perfect felicity which he hath
promiſed them: Love and Unity are the matter of
his laſt and great Command: Theſe are the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
of his genuine diſciples, and of the renewed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature in them: It was <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> which
muſt in them be the witneſs of Chriſts ſpirit and
power, to convince the unbelieving world; And
therefore it is <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> which is the matter of
his laſt excellent prayer for them: <hi>John</hi> 17. 22, 23,
24, 25. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. 12, 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. 34. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 14, 23.
<hi>&amp;</hi> 4. 21. And all theſe his preparations, precepts,
examples, and prayers, were accordingly exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the wonderful <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.
When the day of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> was come, in
which the Holy Ghoſt muſt be moſt eminently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to them, they <hi>were all with One accord in
one place,</hi> Acts 2. 1. The Apoſtles had an <hi>Vnanimity</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:55406:46"/>
and <hi>Concord</hi> before, proportionable to the meaſure
of their grace, which was preparatory to their recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the eminent gift of the Spirit, which increaſed
their <hi>unanimity.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46. the
<hi>three thouſand that were ſuddenly added to the Church,
continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and in breaking of bread, and in prayers: And
all that believed were together, and had all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and ſold their poſſeſſions and goods, and parted
them to all men as every man had need: And they
continuing daily with one accord in the Temple, and
breaking bread from houſe to houſe, did eat their meat
with gladneſs and ſingleneſs of heart, praiſing God, and
having favour with all the people.</hi>] What greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
could be given that Chriſt is the great
Reconciler, the meſſenger, gift and teacher of
Love, the Prince of Peace, and the great <hi>Vniter</hi> of
the divided world, both with his Father and Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and with <hi>one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this text <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and marvellous example, you
ſee the deſign and work of the great Reconciler:
When men fall out with God, they fall out with one
another: when they depart from the only Center of
<hi>Vnity,</hi> they can have no true Unity among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
when they loſe the Love of God, they loſe
the Love of Man as for Gods ſake and intereſt. And
he that cannot ſee and Love God in man, can ſee
nothing in man that is worthy of much love: As he
that loveth not a man for his <hi>ſoul</hi> and its operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
more than for his body, loveth him not as a
man: And few have any great Love to a dead
Corpſe. <hi>Cicero</hi> could ſay, <hi>It is your ſoul that we ſpeak
to, and converſe with: were that departed we ſhould ſpeak
to you no more.</hi> God is more to every man, than
his ſoul: If God were not their life and amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
all men would be unlovely loathſome carkaſſes:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55406:47"/>
Therefore wicked men that cannot Love God and
Goodneſs, can Love none thoroughly but themſelves
and for themſelves, or as Bru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es by a low or ſenſitive
kind of love: For it is <hi>ſelf</hi> that they are fallen to
from God and Man: And yet while <hi>ſelf</hi> is carnally
and inordinately loved inſtead of God and Man, it
is but deſtroyed and undone by that inordinate ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
love: And he that loveth <hi>Himſelf</hi> to his own
deſtruction (with a Love more pernicious than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
hatred) doth love his <hi>friends</hi> but with ſuch a
kind of killing love: (as I have ſeen ſome Brutes
kill their young ones with the violence of their love,
that would not ſuffer them to let them alone.)
Thus all love to man, ſaving a pernicious love, doth
dye, where the love of God and goodneſs dieth:
And <hi>Cain</hi> giveth the world the firſt <hi>ſpecimen</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of depraved nature, in envy and wrath, and
finally in the murder of his Brother, and undoing
<hi>Himſelf,</hi> by ſetting up and adhering inordinately to
himſelf.</p>
               <p>But when Chriſt reconcileth God and Man, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileth
<hi>Men</hi> to one another: For he teacheth men
to love God in Man, and Man for God, with a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
noble, reaſonable kind of Love: And ſo to love
<hi>all men,</hi> as far as God hath an Intereſt in all: And
to Love <hi>all Chriſtians</hi> with an eminent Love, as God
is eminently intereſſed in them. And this is
Chriſts work on the ſouls of men; and much of his
buſineſs which he came for into the world. And
therefore he would have his firſt Diſciples to give
the world ſuch a <hi>ſpecimen</hi> of Love in this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
way of Community: For as extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
works of <hi>Power,</hi> (that is, <hi>Miracles</hi>) muſt be
wrought by the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel, to
ſhew Chriſts <hi>power,</hi> and convince the unbelieving
world; ſo it was as needful that then there ſhould be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55406:47"/>
extraordinary works of <hi>Love,</hi> to ſhew <hi>Chriſts Love,</hi>
and teach them the great work of Love which he
came to call and bring men to: For the firſt Book
that Chriſt wrote, was on the <hi>Hearts of Men,</hi> (which
no Philoſopher could do); <hi>In fleſhly tables he wrote</hi>
LOVE TO GOD and MAN by the finger
of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> (many a year before any Book of the
New Teſtament was written). And as his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
was [<hi>Love one another</hi>] and [<hi>Love your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
forbear and forgive,</hi> &amp;c.] ſo his firſt Churches
muſt extraordinarily exemplifie and expreſs this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
by living in this extraordinary community,
and <hi>ſelling all,</hi> and diſtributing as each had need:
And afterwards their <hi>Love-feaſts</hi> did long keep up
ſome memorial of it: For they were the <hi>firſt ſheet,</hi>
as it were, of the <hi>New Book</hi> which Chriſt was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing:
And, LOVE was the ſumm of all that
was imprinted on them: And their <hi>Practice</hi> was to
be much of the <hi>Preaching</hi> that muſt convert the
world. Chriſt was not a meer Orator or teacher of
<hi>Words:</hi> And, <hi>non magna loquimur, ſed vivimus,</hi> was
the profeſſion of his diſciples: He came not meerly
to <hi>talk,</hi> and teach men to <hi>talk;</hi> but to <hi>Do,</hi> and
teach men to Do; even to do that himſelf which
none elſe ever did, and to teach his followers to do
that which no other ſort of men did in this world:
But this leadeth me up to the next Uſe of Unity.</p>
               <p>V. The SPIRIT of UNITY and LOVE is the
Great means of the Churches <hi>increaſe:</hi> There is a
twofold augmentation of the Church: 1. Intrinſick
and <hi>Intenſive;</hi> when it Increaſeth in all Goodneſs, and
haſteth to perfection: And it is this Vital principle
of <hi>Vniting Love,</hi> or the <hi>Spirit of Vnity,</hi> which is the
immediate cauſe of this. 2. <hi>Extenſive,</hi> when the
Church is enlarged, and more are added to it: And
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55406:48"/>
it is a <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Vniting Love</hi> among Chriſtians, that
muſt do this as much or more than preaching: Or
at leaſt, if that preaching which is but the effect of
Knowledge, produce Evangelical Knowledge in the
hearers, yet a <hi>Life of Love and Vnity</hi> is the adapted
means of breeding <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Vnity,</hi> the Life of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in the world: <hi>Light</hi> may cauſe <hi>Light;</hi> but
<hi>Heat</hi> muſt cauſe <hi>Heat;</hi> and it muſt be a <hi>Living</hi>
thing that muſt <hi>generate life,</hi> by ordinary cauſation:
That which cometh from the <hi>Head,</hi> may reach the
<hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>perhaps</hi> the <hi>Heart,</hi> but is not <hi>ſo fit</hi> to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
on <hi>Hearts</hi> as that which cometh from the heart.
Undoubtedly if Chriſtians did commonly live in
ſuch <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> among themſelves, and ſhew
the fruits of common Love to all about them, as
their Great maſter and his Religion teacheth them,
they would do wonders in converting ſinners, and
enlarging the Church of Jeſus Chriſt. Who could
ſtand out againſt the convincing and Attractive
power of Uniting Love? Who could much hate
and perſecute thoſe that Love them, and ſhew that
Love? This would heap melting coals of fire on
their heads. Our Saviour knew this when he made
this his great Leſſon to his diſciples, and when he
prayed (<hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 21, 22, 23, 24.) over and over
[<hi>for them which ſhould believe on him, through the
Apoſtles word, [that they all may be One, as thou Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one
in us, that the world may believe that thou haſt ſent me:
And the Glory which thou gaveſt me I have given them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that they may be One even as we are One: I in them,
and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in One,
and that the world may know that thou haſt ſent me,
and haſt loved them as thou haſt loved me</hi>]. O when
will Chriſt revive this bleſſed principle in his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and ſet them again on this effectual way of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55406:48"/>
preaching, that <hi>Love</hi> may draw the world into the
<hi>Churches Vnity?</hi> Some look for new <hi>miracles</hi> for the
converting of the now-forſaken Nations: what God
will do of that kind we know not; for he hath not
told us: But <hi>Holy Vniting Vniverſal Love</hi> is a thing
which he hath ſtill made our certain <hi>duty;</hi> and
therefore we are all bound to ſeek and do it: And
therefore we may both pray and labour for it in
hope: And could we but come up to this <hi>known du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
we ſhould have a means for the worlds converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as effectual as miracles, and more ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
to them and us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But why then is the world ſtill unconverted,
when all true Chriſtians have this love?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Alas, thoſe true Chriſtians are <hi>ſo few,</hi>
and the hypocrites that are ſelfiſh worldlings are ſo
many, that the poor people that live among pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
Chriſtians, do judge of Chriſtianity by thoſe
falſe profeſſours, who are indeed no Chriſtians:
Men ſee not the hearts of one another. Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of ungodly perſons, for intereſt, education
and cuſtome take on them the <hi>name</hi> of Chriſtians,
who never were ſuch indeed by heart-conſent. When
theſe counterfeit Chriſtians live like Infidels, men
think that Chriſtians are no better than Infidels:
For they think they muſt judge by the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ſuch as go under the Chriſtian name. But
if the world could tell who they be that are truly
Chriſtians at the heart, they would ſee that they
have that ſpirit of <hi>Love,</hi> which is not in unbelievers.
2. And alas the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> even of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
is yet too imperfect, and is darkened and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed
with too much of the contrary vice: were
Chriſtians <hi>perfect</hi> Chriſtians, they would indeed be the
honour of their profeſſion. Then <hi>Love</hi> would be the
powerful principle of all their works; which would
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55406:49"/>
taſte of its nature, and, as it is ſaid of <hi>Wine, Judg.</hi>
9. 13. it <hi>cheereth God</hi> and <hi>man,</hi> ſo I may ſay, <hi>God
and man</hi> would be delighted in the ſweetneſs of theſe
fruits: For with ſuch Sacrifice God is well pleaſed,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 16. But alas what crabbed and contrary
fruits, how ſoure, how bitter do many diſtempered
Chriſtians bring forth? If it will increaſe the Church,
and win men to the Love of Chriſtianity, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled
or perſecuted, to be contemned and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
to be ſeparated from as perſons unworthy of
our-love and kindneſs, then Chriſtianity will not
want propagaters: The pouring out of the Spirit,
was the firſt planting of the Chriſtian Church: And
where there is moſt of Love, there is moſt of the
ſpirit. As there needeth no forcing penal Laws, to
compel men to obey God ſo far as Love prevaileth
in them; ſo if Love were more eminent in the
Church Paſtors and Profeſſors, that they <hi>preached</hi>
and <hi>ruled</hi> and <hi>lived</hi> towards all men in the power
of ſincere and fervent Love, there would be leſs
pretence for all that violence, oppreſſion and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
which hath been long exerciſed by the worldly
Clergy, and ſo much the more odiouſly by how
much the more the ſacred name of <hi>Religion</hi> hath
been uſed for its juſtification or excuſe.</p>
               <p>VI. UNITING LOVE is the GLORY
and Perfection of the Church: And therefore there
will be in Heaven much greater Love, and much
nearer UNITY, than there is of the deareſt
friends on earth, yea <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>nearer</hi> than we can
now diſtinctly underſtand.</p>
               <p>And again I ſay, that they that in thinking of the
ſtate of ſeparated ſouls, do fear leſt all ſouls do
loſe their individuation, and fall into one common
ſoul, do fooliſhly fear a greater <hi>Vnity</hi> than is to be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55406:49"/>
expected. (And yet nothing elſe about the ſouls
Immortality is lyable to a rational doubt: For,
1. Its <hi>ſubſtance</hi> certainly is not <hi>annihilated:</hi> 2. Nor
its <hi>formal eſſential Virtues</hi> loſt, by mutation into
ſome other <hi>ſpecies;</hi> 3. Nor doth the <hi>Activity</hi> of ſuch

for it to act upon). Were it well conſidered
that LOVE is as Natural to a ſoul as <hi>Heat</hi> is to
the Sun, that is, an effect of that Act which its very
eſſence doth perform; 2. And that our UNITY
is an Unity of LOVE (Voluntarily performed)
it would much abate ſuch ſelfiſh fears of too much
Unity: For who ever feared too much <hi>Love?</hi> too
extenſive, or too intenſive? too large, or too near
a Union of minds? And as the beloved Apoſtle
ſaith, that GOD IS LOVE as a name which
ſignifieth his eſſence, why may not the ſame be ſaid
of <hi>ſouls,</hi> which are his Image? that A SOUL IS
LOVE? Not that this is an Adequate conception
of A SOUL (much leſs of GOD); but of the
partial or inadequate Conceptions, it ſeemeth to
be the chiefeſt. <hi>The SOVL of Man is a Pure (or
Spiritual) ſubſtance informed by a Virtue of Vital acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
Intellection, and Volition,</hi> (which is LOVE),
<hi>informing (or animating) an organical body for a

in the body the LOVE of a Mans SELF and
of felicity, or pleaſure, ſeemeth to be a deep, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

obſerved. And if LOVE be ſo far eſſential
to it, the perfection of Love is the ſouls perfection,
and the exerciſes of Love are the chief operations of
the ſoul: And conſequently the perfection and
glory of the Church (which is but a conjunction
of holy perſons) conſiſteth in the ſame Uniting
Love, which perfecteth ſouls.</p>
               <p>And indeed <hi>Vniformity</hi> in circumſtantials, and in

               <p>§. 7. II. And as <hi>Efficiently,</hi> ſo <hi>Objectively</hi> and

Chriſtians, deſpiſe them when they ſee them fall

his prayer to his Father, that his diſciples might be
One, even as the Father and he were One, to this
end [<hi>that the world may know that the Father ſent
him</hi>] if this their Union had not been a ſpecial

not by a Political Union of the reſt of his Diſciples

Prophets ſhould all ſay that they ſpeak from Chriſt,
and ſpeak contrary things, and charge each other
with falſhood and deceit, would this be to his honour
or to the credit of their teſtimony? It is the great
Concord of the prophecies, promiſes and types of
the Old Teſtament with the hiſtory and doctrine of
the New, and the great concord of all the writers of
the New Teſtament among themſelves, which
greatly facilitateth our belief both of the Old and

they could prove the later, they would prove the

               <p>§. 2. And the ſpirit of Holineſs as it regenerateth
and ſanctifieth ſinners from generation to genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is no leſs a witneſs of the Truth and Love and
Glory of Chriſt, than prophecies and miracles: The
ſame ſpirit that is the author of prophecie and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
doctrine, is alſo the author of believers reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to the image of God. And <hi>Illumination</hi> is
not the leaſt or laſt part of this ſanctifying work:
Chriſt is the light of the world, and his word and
ſpirit are given to enlighten blinded minds, and to
bring them out of darkneſs into his marvellous light,
and from the power of the Prince of darkneſs and
from doing the works of darkneſs, to the Father of
Lights who giveth wiſdom liberally to them that ask
it, that they may walk as Children of the light.
<hi>Light</hi> is uſually called <hi>Glory:</hi> Heaven is the place of
the greateſt Light and greateſt Glory: And heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wiſdom in believers, is much of their Glory here
begun, in which their Father, their Saviour and their
ſanctifier is glorified. Whatever therefore obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
or diminiſheth this ſacred Light in Saints, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
that Glory of God and our Redeemer which
muſt appear and ſhine forth in them. The holy
Learning of his diſciples is the honour of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Teacher of the Church: All true believers are
taught of God: were they no <hi>wiſer,</hi> nor no <hi>better</hi>
than other men, where were the teſtimony and the
honour of their Teacher? and who would believe
that he were a happier Teacher than Philoſophers?
or that he were the true Saviour of the world that
doth not ſave his own diſciples from ſin and folly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
No wonder that God hath no pleaſure in fools, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55406:53"/>
that the fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in his fight, when
they are ſuch a diſhonour to Chriſt and him: what
fellowſhip hath Light with darkneſs?</p>
               <p>And who knoweth not that diſagreement proveth
ignorance and errour, in one party at leaſt? When
they hold and plead for contrary opinions, both can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be in the right. And when this is but in dark
and difficult matters, of no great influence on our
hearts and lives and future hopes, it is tolerable;
and no more to be wondered at, than that we are yet
but imperfect men in fleſh, and in this low and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
world: But when it amounteth to that which
maketh Chriſtians judge it neceſſary to anathematize
one another, and to caſt out each other from their
communion as intolerable, and perhaps to ſeek
one anothers deſtruction, do they not loudly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
their ſhameful ignorance to the world?</p>
               <p>§. 3. I know that diſcipline muſt be exerciſed and

they only being the true Church, the condemning

of the Chriſtian name, that ſo great bodies for ſo

each other? That the Greek Church condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Weſtern, and the Weſtern them? That the

And the Weſtern Chriſtians ſo divided among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
Who that is not a ſtranger to man and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
knoweth not that it hath been to exerciſe a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion

their underſtandings, as ſpeaking rightlier than

that very much of their anathematizing hath been
uſed? And when the Pope hath anathematized the
Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople, he</hi> hath anathematized
<hi>him</hi> again: yea ſo hath the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi>
alſo. And when the three parties (the Orthodox,
the Neſtorians and the Eutychians) for ſo many
ages have continued anathematizing each other, the
diſhonour falleth on them all in the eyes of beholders,
and no party recovereth their honour with the reſt.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Undoubtedly it is they that God ſhall make the

of Concord, and thereby of reviving Chriſtian Love

agents for the repairing of the honour of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

All parties ſeem agreed in this, even they that moſt

that it muſt be <hi>Love and Concord</hi> that at laſt muſt heal

written in words which are hard to be underſtood,
but plainly uttered and often urged: Yea when ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of Gods commands are mentioned, this is ſtill
preferred before moſt others that can be imagined
to ſtand in competition againſt it: As the <hi>uniting
Love of God</hi> is called the <hi>firſt and great Command,</hi> ſo

the living members of Chriſt: Not only as needful
to ſome inferiour uſes, but as neceſſary to all the

and all the rituals, and not to be diſpenſed with,

intereſt of God in the world, as is that <hi>unity</hi> and
concord of the body of Chriſt? And if he that doth
or doth not good to <hi>one of the leaſt</hi> of the <hi>ſervants of
Chriſt,</hi> is ſuppoſed to have done it or not done it to
<hi>himſelf,</hi> how much more he that doth or omitteth
that which Chriſt and his whole Church is ſo much
concerned in?</p>
               <p>§. 4. IV. The Love of our <hi>own ſouls</hi> obligeth us,
conſidering how many and great impediments diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
doth raiſe againſt all grace and duty, and
againſt our holineſs, comfort and ſalvation: And
how much Chriſtian Love and Concord do conduce
to the preſervation of all grace, and to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Glory: All men in true Concord are our
helpers, and all men in diſcord are our hinderers,
and tempters. How fair and eaſie is the way to
Heaven among true Loving and agreeing Chriſtians?
and how hard is it where diviſions and contentions
take place?</p>
               <p>§. 5. V. The Love of our neighbours ſouls ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
us to this: That which is beſt for us is beſt
for them. Alas, carnal minds deceived by ſin need
not to have the way to heaven made harder, nor to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55406:55"/>
be tempted by the diſcords of Chriſtians to deſpiſe
them: Their own malignity and the devils tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
when we have done our beſt may ſuffice to
deceive them and undo them: Every Chriſtian
ſhould be a helper to the ſalvation of all about him,
and a ſouldier under Chriſt, to fight againſt Satan as
he is the great divider and deſtroyer. As ever
therefore we pity the ſouls of ſinners, and would
not be guilty of their damnation, we ſhould keep
the Unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace.</p>
               <p>§. 6. VI. Our Love to the Church and Sacred
Miniſtry doth oblige us. Our Diſcords unſay too
powerfully what Chriſts Miniſters ſay, when they
ſet forth the power of grace, and the excellency of
Chriſtianity! All the oppoſition of the arguments
and reproaches of Quakers or malignant prophane
enemies is of far leſs force againſt the Goſpel, than
the diſcords of profeſſed Chriſtians. The labours
of many worthy Miniſters have been hindered, and
their hearts even broken with ſuch ſinful and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
diviſions; when the enemies hit us in the
teeth with theſe, we are aſhamed and cannot deny
the fact, though we can deny their falſe concluſions.
How much of the deſigns of Satan and his agents
have lain in dividing the ſervants of Chriſt? Some
of the moderate and peaceable Emperours in the
more flouriſhing ſtate of the Church and Empire, by
the diſcords and mutinies of factious Chriſtians were
made a-weary of their Crowns: Yea ſome of thoſe
that the haſty hereticating Orthodox party too ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily
pronounced hereticks and heretical (ſuch as
<hi>Theodoſuis</hi> junior, <hi>Zeno, Anaſtaſuis, Juſtinian, &amp;c.</hi>)
were tired out with labouring in vain to keep the
Chriſtian Biſhops in Peace, and by Hiſtorians
are recorded to be men of better qualities than
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55406:56"/>
the Biſhops: And one of them (<hi>Anaſtaſius</hi>) laid
down his Crown and told them he would not be the
Ruler of ſuch contentious and unruly men, till the
neceſſities of the people brought them to remorſe,
and to intreat him to continue Emperour, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to ceaſe their mutinous contentions.</p>
               <p>And what the diviſions in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did
to ſhame and thus far abaſe the Papacy, is paſt all
doubt: When there have been in many generations
ſometimes two and ſometimes three called Popes at
once; when ſome Kingdoms owned one and ſome
another, and when they often fought it out, and (as
<hi>Victor</hi> the third and many another) got their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
right by Victory, not by the Word but by
the Sword; When one Pope for forty years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lived in <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Avignion,</hi> and the other at
<hi>Rome;</hi> When they fought it out with many Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
and Kings; When <hi>Italy</hi> was kept by them
many ages in diviſions and bloody wars; and when
the very Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> and their Popes were
put to fight it out at home in their ſtreets; And
when the Popes have excommunicated the people of
<hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf (where then was the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi>)
All this Church hiſtory recordeth to their perpetual
ſhame.</p>
               <p>And have not the diſſenſions between <hi>Luther</hi> and
<hi>Caroloſtadius,</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius, Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts,</hi>
to name no more, been a reproach to the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(as I ſaid before). As we Love the Church then,
and as we regard the honour and ſucceſs of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
and would not have Chriſts houſe and
Kingdom fall or be ſhaken or diſgraced by our ſinful
diſcords, Let us keep this ſpiritual Unity and
peace.</p>

               <p>§. 2. I. Negatively: I. It is certain that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
will never be all of one ſtature or degree of
grace. The Apoſtle hath fully opened this,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and here <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. and
elſewhere. Some will be of more blameleſs lives,

have greater gifts than others for that end: ſome
will be more patient and meek, and others more
paſſionate and hot: ſome will be more conſiderate
and prudent, and ſome more raſh and of indecent
carriage: ſome will be more humble, and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending,
and abhorr pride much more than others
will do: ſome will be more zealous, and ſome more
frigid or luke-warm: ſome will be much more
heavenly, and make leſs of earthly things than
others: ſome will be more ſelf-denying and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
under ſufferings, and ſome will too much ſeek
their own tranſitory things, and with greater impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
bear both croſſes from God and injuries from
man: ſome will be more cheerful and rejoyce in
God, and the hope of Glory, and others will be
more ſad and timerous and heavy: Some will have
a ſtrong faith, and ſome a weak: Some will have
aſſured ſealed hopes, and others will be doubting
of their ſalvation: But in nothing will there be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55406:57"/>
more certain and notable difference, than in mens
<hi>knowledge</hi> and conceptions of ſpiritual things. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
there is ſcarce a greater difference of
<hi>Viſages,</hi> than there is of <hi>Intellectual apprehenſions:</hi>
Nay, perhaps the likeneſs of all mens faces is greater
than of their <hi>underſtandings.</hi> Some will ſtill know
little, (and none very much, but) others compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively
much more: Some that know much in one
kind, will be ignorant in others: And as all men are
not of the ſame Trade, nor all Scholars proſecute
the ſame ſtudies, but ſome excell in one thing, and
ſome in another, and ſome in nothing, ſo in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
ſuch proportions and differences of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there will be.</p>
               <p>§. 3. No obſerving man that converſeth with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
one would think could be ignorant of this:
And yet the talk and actions of too many Church-Leeches
in moſt parts and ages of the Chriſtian
World, hath ſhewed that they did not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it. If univerſal, conſtant, undenyable <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi>
be not enough to prove that <hi>it is ſo,</hi> and <hi>hath
been ſo,</hi> and therefore <hi>will be ſo,</hi> Let the certain
Cauſes of it be conſidered.</p>
               <p>1. Men are born of much <hi>different Intellectual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions,</hi>
and degrees of capacity: ſome are Ideots
or natural fools; ſome are half ſuch: ſome are
very flegmatick and dull of wit, and muſt have long
time and teaching to learn a little; and of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
as weak to retain what they learn: ſome have
naturally ſtrong wits, and as ſtrong memories. If
theſe be bred up in the ſame houſe, will they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have the ſame knowledge and conceptions?</p>
               <p>§. 4. 2. And as men naturally differ in quickneſs
and dulneſs of wit, ſo they do in the temperature
of all their humours and bodies, which acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
will cauſe great difference in their minds. A
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55406:58"/>
ſanguine man hath uſually other thoughts and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
than a phlegmatick man; and a phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
man hath other thoughts and ſenſe of things,
than the cholerick have: And the melancholy
man differeth from them all, and often from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
As theſe tempers variouſly affect the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie
and the paſſions, ſo conſequently, they do uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the Intellect and the Will.</p>
               <p>§. 5. 3. The Countreys that men are born in, it
not by the air and ſoil, at leaſt by the great diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of Languages, Laws, Governments and Cuſtoms,
do make much difference in mens conceptions: As
we ſee by experience in the difference of many
Nations.</p>
               <p>§. 6. 4. The very ſins or merits of Parents may
do much to the hurt or benefit of Children; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by corrupting or bettering their bodily tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature,
and partly by Gods curſe or bleſſing on
their ſouls: As I have fully proved in my <hi>Second
Diſputation</hi> of <hi>Original Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 7. 5. And were there no other cauſe of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
conceptions than the different <hi>education</hi> of
<hi>children</hi> by their parents, it would make a very
great difference in the world. When one is brought
up in Learning, and another in barbariſm; one in
reading and hearing Gods Word, and another in
contemning and deriding it: One is taught to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
Gods name and truth, and another to
blaſpheme them or deſpiſe them: One is taught one
Religion and another another: One is taught to
lay all his ſalvation on that which another is taught
to abhorr. And it is not only in <hi>Divers Lands,</hi> but
in the ſame <hi>Cities, Towns</hi> and <hi>Streets,</hi> yea, among
men that publickly profeſs the ſame Religion in
Name and Generals, that this difference is found.</p>

                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:55406:58"/>
§. 8. 6. And if Parents make no difference, yet
<hi>Schoolmaſters</hi> often will: With their Grammar lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
one teacheth his Scholars to deride ſuch
or ſuch a party of Chriſtians as Hereticks, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teroclites
or anomalous; and others ſay the ſame
of others, as they themſelves do like or diſlike:
And Boyes uſually take deeply their Maſters dictates,
eſpecially if they be cunning and malignant, and ſuch
as the Devil and fleſh befriend.</p>
               <p>§. 9. 7. And it is no ſmall difference, that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi>
and <hi>Converſe</hi> cauſe: Even among Children and
Servants in families, and Boys at School: from whom
they are as apt to receive ill impreſſions as from
evil Teachers. And therefore variety of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in Youth, is like to breed variety of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>§. 10. 8. And the different <hi>Books</hi> which they
read, will make the like difference: while one
writeth againſt that which another proclaimeth to
be excellent, and neceſſary, and all ſet off the matter
with ſuch plauſibility and confidence as young and
unexerciſed perſons are unable to ſee through and
perceive the error.</p>
               <p>§. 11. 9. And when they go abroad in the world,
the difference among thoſe that they converſe with
all their lives, may well be expected to cauſe much
difference in their thoughts. If they be ſet Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices,
one falls into a family of one mind, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of another: And ſo if they be ſervants: And
their friends and companions will occaſion as
much: And if they marry, the different judgements
of Husbands and Wives may do the ſame.</p>
               <p>§. 12. 10. And eſpecially when differences in
Religion have already got poſſeſſion of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
(in ſome degree) and they ſet themſelves to
enquire after the nature of theſe differences, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55406:59"/>
being at firſt unskilful are unable to try and judge
aright, they muſt needs fall into great variety of
judgements.</p>
               <p>§. 13. 11. And the great difference among
<hi>Preachers</hi> and Paſtors of the Church will be as pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
a cauſe of diſcord to youth and learners, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
any of the reſt: while one Preacher condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that as a dangerous errour, and frighteneth them
from it as a heinous ſin, which another extolleth as
neceſſary truth or duty. And yet thus it is in many
particulars even where men profeſs the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
witneſs the many loads of books that are
written by the Papiſts againſt each other; As the
Dominicans againſt the Jeſuites, and the Jeſuites

the ſame ſpirit have more illumination, and ſome
leſs, as the Apoſtle at large declareth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and
elſewhere. There is one Glory of the Sun, and
another of the Moon ſaith <hi>Paul;</hi> And as one ſtar
differs in glory from another, ſo doth one man in
gifts and underſtanding; And the face of the whole
Creation ſheweth that God delighteth to make a
wonderful diverſity in his works; ſcarce two ſtones
in the ſtreet, two ſheep, two beaſts, two birds, two
fiſhes, two trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo like, but we may know one
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55406:61"/>
from another by their differences: No nor two
ſons of the ſame parents, or two of the off-ſpring of
any animals.</p>
               <p>And is not all this joyned to the conſtant experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of all ages, enough to prove, that even among
Chriſtians, and good and tolerable Chriſtians, yea
among all, there will ſtill be differences in degrees
of knowledge and virtue, and conſequently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
in ſome matters of Religion, higher or lower
more or leſs?</p>
               <p>§. 23. II. It is therefore certain that while there
will be diſcord in Judgement, there will be alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
in <hi>profeſſions,</hi> and in <hi>practice.</hi> For honeſt mens
profeſſions and practices will agree with their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the main. Even <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> will
part when their judgements lead them ſo to do
When men have not the ſame meaſure of skill and
accurateneſs in expreſſing their own minds, and in
ſpeaking properly, grammatically, logically, ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly,
agreeably to the thing ſpoken, nor the ſame
skill in defining, or diſtinguiſhing, or ſitting the true
ſenſe of words, they will really differ, and they will
verbally differ, and ſeem to moſt unskilful judges, to
differ really when they do not.</p>
               <p>§. 24. It is not therefore to be expected that if
ſome men think that <hi>long doctrinal confeſſions</hi> formed
in mens private words, or <hi>Liturgies</hi> or other <hi>humane
formes,</hi> have nothing in them untrue, or evil, or
which all men may not conſent to, therefore all
others muſt think ſo too, and ſay as they: who can
think that in many thouſand uncertain words, all
men can and muſt be of the ſame mind, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them all alike? Or that honeſt men can lye,
and ſay that they aſſent to what they do not?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:55406:61"/>
§. 25. And if mens judgements differ about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of practice, in eſſentials, integrals or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
their practice will accordingly differ. He
that judgeth a thing unlawful will not do it, if he
fear God and be truly conſcionable. Had <hi>Images</hi>
been lawfully uſed in places or exerciſes of Gods
worſhip, yet it was inhumane and unchriſtian in
thoſe Biſhops and Councils who curſed from Chriſt
all that were of the contrary mind, and pronounced
it an intolerable hereſie, and ejected and ſilenced
diſſenters, and raiſed wars and bloodſhed for ſuch a
difference: Much more unchriſtian was it for the
Roman Pope to rebel againſt his proper Prince, the
Greek Emperour, and alienate the Weſtern Empire
from him, to the French, on that account, and to
excommunicate and depoſe Emperours as hereticks
called Iconoclaſts, as if Imagery had been an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of faith, or a neceſſary univerſal Command of
God: For how can that be a hereſie that is not a
plain denyal or ſubverſion of any neceſſary article
of faith or practice? And ſure no ſuch for Images is
in the Creed or Decalogue.</p>
               <p>§. 26. The ſame I may ſay of many other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
practices: As St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of meats and
drinks and dayes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. ſo muſt we ſay of
all things that are of no greater neceſſity: If men
in all theſe muſt be brought to uniformity and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing
in the ſame mode, it muſt be either by <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
and perſwaſion, or by <hi>force:</hi> The firſt we are
ſure will never do it, in all things, though it may in
many: All the twenty reaſons before mentioned
prove it; and many hundred years experience much
more; It is certain to all ſave blinded perſons, that
all Chriſtians will never be in all things of a mind,
about Lawful and Unlawful, Duty and Sin: And
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that force will never do it: St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:55406:62"/>
ſaith of things indifferent, that he that <hi>doubteth is
damned if he eat, becauſe he eateth not of faith: For
whatſoever is not of faith is ſin.</hi> Ungodly perſons
that have no true Conſcience may go againſt their
falſe Conſciences for worldly ends, and wilfully ſin for
fear of men; But ſo will no true Chriſtian, unleſs in
the hour of ſuch a temptation as <hi>Peters,</hi> by a fall
from which he will riſe again to a ſtronger reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than he had before: No ſound believer will
ſell his ſoul to ſave his fleſh, nor hazard heaven by
wilful ſin to ſave his intereſt on earth. So that this
way of <hi>forcing</hi> men to practiſe contrary to their
Conſciences, in points in which good and tolerable
Chriſtians differ, will but make up Churches of
wicked men that have no conſcience, joyned with
one party that is therein agreed. And I ſhall ſhew
you in due place, that they will never deviſe what to
do with the Conſcionable diſſenters, that ſhall not be
far worſe than a charitable and peaceable forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>§. 27. III. It is certain that there will never be
ſo great Concord, as that all <hi>Diſputings, oppoſition,</hi>
and <hi>paſſionate</hi> and <hi>injurious</hi> words and writings will
ceaſe among all ſorts of Chriſtians; No nor among
all that are honeſt and upright in the main. For as
long as one taketh that for a dangerous errour or
ſin which another taketh for a neceſſary <hi>truth</hi> or
<hi>duty,</hi> men will (even on Gods account) think ill
of one another, and in ſome meaſure ſpeak ill as they
think. They that know that they muſt not call
<hi>evil good and good evil, nor put darkneſs for light, and
light for darkneſs,</hi> will abuſe and injure one another in
things where they confidently err: A Lutheran,
though pious, will ſpeak and diſpute againſt a Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

                  </gap>iniſt againſt a Lutheran; And ſo
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55406:62"/>
of many other Parties. And though it is greatly to
be wiſhed that all Chriſtians had humble thoughts
of their own underſtandings, and would ſtay till
they know well what they ſay, before they talk
much againſt things or perſons, and though it be
ſo with wiſe and eminently ſober humble men, yet
with too many it is far otherwiſe, and like ſo to
continue. Perverſe diſputings and ſhameful back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitings,
and ſpeaking evil of things and perſons not
underſtood, have ſuch unhappy cauſes in the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
of dark corrupted nature, that they ſeem to
be like to live till a golden age or heaven do cure
them. Talking and writing againſt one another
even of the ſame Religion, yea praying and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt one another muſt be expected in ſome
degree: I would I need not ſay, <hi>ſilencing</hi> and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
one another; yea excommunicating and
anathematizing among the worſer ſort of men;
ſuch uſage as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> had from one of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
General Councils, and ſuch uſage as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>
had from ſuch Biſhops as <hi>Theophilus Alexand.</hi> and
<hi>Epiphanius</hi> and a Council of other Biſhops, and ſuch
as abundance of excellent men in moſt ages have
met with in the like kind and way, may be expected
again till Biſhops and all Chriſtians become more
wiſe and reſined perſons.</p>
               <p>§. 28. II. But (affirmatively) there is yet
an excellent ſort and degree of Unity and Concord
to be ſought with hope among Chriſtians, worthy
of all our utmoſt labour: Yea there is a true and
excellent Unity and Concord which all true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
do already enjoy: conſiſting in the following
things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:55406:63"/>
§. 29. I. All Chriſtians (truly ſuch) believe in
<hi>One God;</hi> and believe the incomprehenſible <hi>Trinity,</hi>
and believe Gods <hi>Eſſential Attributes</hi> and <hi>Grand Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
to <hi>man.</hi> They believe that he is <hi>Infinite</hi> in <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity
and Eternity and Perfection,</hi> even a moſt <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Spirit, Life, Vnderſtanding and Will,</hi> moſt <hi>Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
Wiſe and Good,</hi> the <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>preſerver, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
and the End of all, of whom and through whom
and to whom are all things;</hi> in whom we <hi>Live and
Move and have our being;</hi> Moſt Holy and True and
Merciful and Juſt; whom we are bound to believe
and truſt and love and ſerve, and obey and praiſe
with all our heart and mind and ſtrength: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
and everlaſtingly to ſee, Love and Praiſe him,
(to Pleaſe Him and be Pleaſed in Him) in Glory, is
the end and happineſs of Saints.</p>
               <p>§. 30. II. All true Chriſtians believe in One Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
between God and man, Jeſus Chriſt, the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Word, God, and one in Eſſence with the Father,
Incarnate, aſſuming the whole Nature of man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the holy Ghoſt, born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi>
and was holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
fulfilling all righteouſneſs, and overcame the
Devil and the world, and gave himſelf a Sacrifice
for mans ſin, by ſuffering a curſed death on the
Croſs, to ranſome us and reconcile us unto God;
and was buried and went to the departed ſouls in
<hi>hades,</hi> and the third day roſe again from the dead,
having conquered death: And having declared the
new Covenant or Law of Grace, and commanded
his Apoſtles to preach the Goſpel to all the world,
and promiſed them to ſend the Holy Spirit, he
aſcended into <hi>Heaven</hi> before their faces: The ſaid
Covenant of Grace is ſummarily this [that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
all have ſinned and come ſhort of the Glory of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55406:63"/>
God; ſin by one man entring into the world and death
by ſin, and ſo death and condemnation paſſed upon
all, in that all have ſinned; God ſo loved the world
that he gave his only begotten Son that whoſoever
Believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
life; that is, God freely giveth to loſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
ſinners Himſelf to be their reconciled God
and Father, Jeſus Chriſt to be their Saviour, and the
Holy Ghoſt to be their Sanctifier, if they will Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

give up themſelves to him, Repenting of
their ſins, and conſenting to forſake the Devil, the
world and the Fleſh as oppoſite to God, and ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(though not perfectly) obey Chriſt and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to the end, according to the Law of Nature and
his Goſpel inſtitutions, that ſo they may overcome
and be Glorified for ever.]</p>
               <p>And they believe that Chriſt will come at laſt in
Glory and judge all men according to his Laws and
to their works].</p>
               <p>§. 31. III. And they all believe that the <hi>Holy
Spirit,</hi> being God and one in Eſſence with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Son, proceeding from the Father and
(or <hi>by</hi>) the Son, is the Great Witneſs, Agent and
Advocate of Chriſt, before, at, and after his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the world incarnate; by his gifts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
Miracles and Sanctification, convincing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and drawing them to Repent and Believe, and
dwelling in Believers as an operating cauſe of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Life and Light and Love, thus Uniting them
to God in Chriſt their Head, and to each other in
Faith and Love, by which they are gathered to him
as his Church or body, having the forgiveneſs of
their ſins, and the adoption of Sons, and right to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55406:64"/>
the heavenly inheritance; And living in holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
on earth, their ſouls at death are received
to happineſs with Chriſt, and their Bodies ſhall be
raiſed, and ſoul and body Glorified at the laſt with
Jeſus Chriſt and all the bleſſed, in the perfect Viſion,
Love and joyful Praiſe of the moſt Glorious Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah.</p>
               <p>§. 32. And as I. All Chriſtians agree in this
Belief, ſo alſo II. They all ſolemnly in and by the
Baptiſmal Covenant, and their holy Euchariſtical
Communion and other duties Profeſs the <hi>Conſent of
their wills</hi> to theſe Relations to God their Creatour,
Redeemer and Sanctifier, and to his Church or body,
and their thankful Acceptance of the foreſaid Gifts:
And they profeſs and expreſs their ſeeking-deſires
hereof, according to the Contents of the Lords
Prayer.</p>
               <p>§. 33. III. And as to <hi>Practice</hi> they all agree in
profeſſing and promiſing obedience to Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law of Nature, the Decalogue and
all his Written Laws, ſo far as they underſtand
them, and their deſire to Learn them to that end.</p>
               <p>§. 34. All <hi>ſincere</hi> Chriſtians agree in the <hi>true</hi> and
<hi>Hearty Conſent</hi> to all this; And theſe are the true
<hi>ſaved Church</hi> of Chriſt, called <hi>Inviſible,</hi> becauſe their
<hi>Hearts-conſent</hi> is <hi>Inviſible.</hi> All other Baptized and
Profeſſing Chriſtians with them, agree in the <hi>Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
of all this; And are called <hi>The Church-viſible,</hi>
their <hi>Profeſſion</hi> being viſible. And all this being truly
included in Baptiſm, which is our entrance into the
Catholick (or Univerſal) Church, in this before
deſcribed conſiſteth our <hi>Catholick Communion</hi> in
<hi>Chriſts body,</hi> as ſpiritual or inviſible and as viſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:55406:64"/>
§. 35. II. But beſides this Univerſal Church-Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Communion, for ORDER and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to our great end, God hath inſtituted the OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER
of Chriſtian Aſſemblies or Particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
which are to the <hi>Vniverſal Church</hi> as <hi>Cities</hi> and
<hi>Corporations</hi> to a Kingdom: Which are the nobleſt
and moſt priviledged parts of the Kingdom; but
yet not <hi>eſſential</hi> parts, but eminently Integral: For
it may be a Kingdom without them, and would be if
they were all disfranchiſed and laid common. And
if Apoſtles and Evangeliſts as Itinerant Preachers,
convert and baptize men, they are part of the
Church Univerſal before they are gathered into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
ſocieties under proper Paſtors of their own.
The Eunuch <hi>Act.</hi> 8. was baptized into no <hi>particular
Church,</hi> but into the <hi>univerſal</hi> only; and ſo were
many others: And <hi>meer Baptiſm</hi> as ſuch without any
additional contract, doth no more. If thouſands
were Converted in <hi>America,</hi> or caſt there without
Paſtors, they were parts of the Univerſal Church,
if baptized Profeſſing Chriſtians. And before the
Apoſtles ordained any fixed Biſhops or Paſtors of
particular Churches, the Church Univerſal was in
being though ſmall.</p>
               <p>§. 36. But theſe particular Churches being a great
part of Chriſts Inſtitutions, and neceſſary not only
by <hi>Precept,</hi> but as a <hi>means</hi> to the <hi>Well-being</hi> of the
Univerſal, and the Edification of it and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
members; It muſt be endeavoured, and that with
good hope of ſucceſs, that there may ſo much <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church-Vnion be obtained</hi> and <hi>maintained</hi> as
ſhall much conduce to its great and excellent ends.
That is, 1. So much as that in them, God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son and Holy Ghoſt may be Publickly, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly,
and conſtantly confeſſed, by ſound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55406:65"/>
holy worſhip, and holy diſcipline and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
               <p>2. So much as that hearty Chriſtian Love may be
exerciſed and maintained, and Chriſtians edified in
Communion of Saints.</p>
               <p>3. So much as that God ſhall accept them, delight
in them and bleſs them, their converting, edifying
and comforting ſouls, hearing their prayers and
praiſes, and owning them by his Miniſtry, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
and grace, and differencing them from the
people that do not thus confeſs and worſhip him,
and promoting hereby their ſalvation.</p>
               <p>And if this much be attained, it is not to be vilifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for want of more, nor blotted with reproachful
names; but acknowledged with thankfulneſs and
praiſe.</p>
               <p>§. 37. III. And yet there is a further degree of
concord to be hoped for and endeavoured, and that
is the concord of theſe particular Churches with one
another: That they may all Profeſs, 1. The <hi>ſame
faith,</hi> and neceſſary <hi>doctrine;</hi> 2. and the ſame <hi>Love
to God and one another;</hi> 3. and the ſame <hi>Hope</hi> of life
eternal, 4. and may offer to God the ſame neceſſary
and acceptable ſort of worſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>preaching</hi> and
<hi>applying</hi> his <hi>holy word,</hi> recorded in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
preſerving and reading them, calling upon
his holy name by Confeſſion, prayer, thankſgiving
and praiſes, and holding reſpective communion in
the uſe alſo of the Sacraments of his Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and exerciſing in ſome meaſure ſuch holy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Diſcipline, by Paſtors overſeeing their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
flocks, as he himſelf by his inſtitution hath
made univerſally neceſſary. And all this, though
not in perfection, nor every where with the ſame
degree of purity and care, yet ſo far, 1. as that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55406:65"/>
Gods word and ordinances be kept up in ſoundneſs
in all parts and reſpects neceſſary to ſalvation;
2. and as may tend to the edifying of the Churches
by Love, and concord in neceſſary things, and their
mutual help by counſel, and ſtrength by that
concord, 3. and the avoiding of pernicious feuds
and diviſions.</p>
               <p>§. 38. The means by which this is to be done,
1. by communicatory Letters; 2. by Synods, 3. and
by Civil Governours, is after in due place to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
               <p>Thus much of Chriſtian <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> may
be well hoped for upon juſt endeavours here on
earth: But neither <hi>Perfection</hi> in theſe, nor thoſe <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary</hi>
terms of Concord which ſome have long ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to be neceſſary.</p>
               <p>§. 39. And indeed ſo much as <hi>may be hoped for,</hi> is
ſo very <hi>hardly</hi> to be obtained, that if we truſted not
to Gods extraordinary Grace, more than to any
natural probability that appeareth to us in man, we
ſhould be ready to deſpair that ever Chriſtians
ſhould live long in ſo much peace and concord:
And though the great difficulty muſt not kill our
hopes, it muſt much quicken us to ſtrenuous endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours:
Of which more anon. Satan is ſo great an
enemy to it, and every ſin in man is ſo much againſt
it (as every diſeaſe in the body is againſt its eaſe
and peace), and the multitude and malignity of
ſins and ſinners is ſo great, and the very healers ſo
few and faulty and unskilful, and do ſo much againſt
their own deſired ends, that inſtead of accuſing
the providence of God, we ſhould thankfully won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that there is ſo much peace and concord as
there is, and that all men live not as enemies to
each others in continual war; or that the devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Pikes</hi> leave ſo many of the leſſer fiſh alive, and

the weak and innocent are not wholly a prey to

               <argument>
                  <p>That Chriſt himſelf who commanded the Vnity,
Love and Concord of Chriſtians, did preſcribe
the neceſſary terms.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. IF it be once proved, that Chriſt himſelf
hath preſcribed the conditions or terms of
Chriſtian Union and Communion, what remaineth
to Chriſtians, but to enquire <hi>What are thoſe terms?</hi>
Whereas for want of that neceſſary ſuppoſition,
while men think it is left <hi>to them,</hi> no man knoweth
who ſhould do it, and the <hi>Pope</hi> preſcribeth <hi>his terms,</hi>
and <hi>others</hi> preſcribe <hi>their terms,</hi> and almoſt each
Sect hath different terms.</p>
               <p>§. 2. That Chriſt did preſcribe them, I ſhall
prove I. Antecedently, <hi>à Cauſis,</hi> II. Conſequently,
<hi>ab Effectis;</hi> III. By proving the neceſſary excluſion
of any other competent preſcribers.</p>
               <p>§. 3. I. Antecedently it is proved from 1. The
univerſal neceſſity of the thing, 2. And from the
office of Chriſt to do things of ſuch univerſal neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
and his faithfulneſs therein.</p>
               <p>§. 4. 1. There are few Chriſtians ſo ignorant or
inconſiderate, but will confeſs that the <hi>Vnion</hi> of
Chriſtians is neceſſary, not only to the edification
and well being, but to the very <hi>being</hi> of the Church,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55406:66"/>
(both univerſal and particular.) For what is a
<hi>Church,</hi> but <hi>many Chriſtians united</hi> and <hi>aſſociated</hi> for
Church-ends? Pull all the Bricks or Timber of the
houſe aſunder, and it is no houſe: Pull all the
Planks and parts of a Ship aſunder, and it is no
Ship: Pull all the leaves and ſentences of a Book
aſunder, and it is no Book: Pull all the parts of a
mans body aſunder, and there remaineth no body
of a man, conſidered formally, but only materially,
and in their aptitude to re-union at the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
An <hi>Army</hi> disbanded and diſſipated, is <hi>no
Army.</hi> And certainly it is no <hi>Church,</hi> that hath not
Church-unity of parts.</p>
               <p>2. And all that believe in Chriſt, believe that he
came into the world to call and gather his Church,
and to ſave them; and that he ſent his Word, his
Miniſters and Spirit to this end. He is the principle
of life to the Church his body; who firſt by aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
uniteth them to himſelf and one another,
and then is their conſtitutive and governing and
quickning head. It is his undertaken office firſt to
<hi>make</hi> all his own members, and then to <hi>govern, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
edifie</hi> and <hi>ſave</hi> them. And how can <hi>Chriſt
make his Church,</hi> without <hi>uniting the members?</hi> Can
he build his houſe, and never ſet the <hi>bricks, ſtones</hi>
or <hi>timber</hi> together? Can you make a Clock or
Watch, without adapting and uniting the parts?
And can Chriſt gather, build, compaginate and
unite his Church, and not ſo much as tell men (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Paſtors or people) what are the Conditions and
terms of union, and the cement or ſolder that muſt
unite them?</p>
               <p>§. 5. And all Chriſtians confeſs Chriſts ſufficiency
for his office, and his perfect faithfulneſs in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
it. He wanted neither Power, Wiſdom,
nor Love (or Will) to gather his own Church or
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55406:67"/>
body: He was faithful as <hi>Moſes</hi> in all Gods houſe.
And he that fulfilled all the righteouſneſs of the
Law, and whatever was impoſed on him as a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<hi>ſatisfier of Juſtice,</hi> ſurely no leſs fulfilled all that
belonged to him as the grand Adminiſtrator, and
Benefactor, and Executor of Gods mercy and his
own will, and as <hi>Head over all things to his Church,</hi>
Eph. 1. 22, 23.</p>
               <p>§. 6. Nay, as he was the <hi>King and Law giver</hi> of
the Church, who was to give them all their <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Laws (binding all men</hi>) could he be ſuppoſed to
have done this faithfully, if he had left out the
very terms of Church-unity and concord, when
ſuch unity is <hi>eſſential</hi> to the Church? Did he ſend
the Apoſtles to diſciple and baptize all Nations, and
be in Gods houſe (the Church) as <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>
[<hi>Pillars and baſes of truth</hi>] yea, <hi>foundations,</hi>
and <hi>Maſter-builders,</hi> that muſt gather his Church out
of all the world, and yet never tell them <hi>What
a Church is?</hi> that is, how the parts muſt be
united?</p>
               <p>As he is the <hi>Teacher</hi> of the Church, did he never
teach them ſo neceſſary a thing, as what <hi>eſſential
Church-unity is?</hi> Theſe are ſuch imputations againſt
Chriſt, as ſeem to deny him to be <hi>Chriſt;</hi> As he
would deny God to be God, that would deny his
providence and government of the world.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Chriſts Law is to be both the Rule of our
<hi>actions</hi> and his <hi>judgement.</hi> And if he have left out
ſo great a point as the <hi>eſſentiating</hi> terms of <hi>Church
Vnion,</hi> what momentous acts of our lives are left to
be ungoverned and unjudged by the Laws of
Chriſt?</p>
               <p>§. 8. Above all men thoſe are bound to conſent
to what I ſay, who hold that Chriſts Laws have not
left ſo much as a ceremony undetermined, and that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55406:67"/>
nothing may be added or diminiſhed in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
How much leſs then hath he left the eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
terms of Church-unity unpreſcribed?</p>
               <p>§. 9. II. And conſequently <hi>ab effectis</hi> we find, that
<hi>Chriſt did it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. He plainly declared what maketh a Chriſtian.
2. He declared how all Chriſtians ſhould live in love
and concord. 3. And how the coalition of theſe
Chriſtians maketh his Church.</p>
               <p>§. 10. I. It had been ſtrange, if he that came into
the world to <hi>make men Chriſtians,</hi> had never told men
<hi>what a Chriſtian is.</hi> And if he that ſent his Apoſtles
to make Chriſtians, had ſet them to do they knew
not what, and never told them what a Chriſtian is,
and conſequently what they muſt perſwade men to.
And if he that promiſed Juſtification, Pardon, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption
and Glory to all true believers (that is, to
true Chriſtians,) had yet never told them how they
may know that they are ſuch? And that he that
commanded ſo much Chriſtian duty, publick and
private, and required Chriſtians to ſuffer ſo much
for his ſake, and to look for a reward in Heaven,
ſhould yet never tell them what Chriſtianity is? If
Chriſt <hi>made Chriſtianity,</hi> (that is, the Laws and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
objects and principle) then he made a
<hi>Determinate thing:</hi> If not, hath he left it to man
to <hi>make Chriſtianity</hi> (objectively)? Then how ſhall
we know to whom he gave this power? And how
many ſeveral <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Chriſtianity (or faith) may
be made in the world?</p>
               <p>§. II. It is evident in Scripture, that Chriſt <hi>ſent
his Apoſtles,</hi> and that he taught them what to
preach, and particularly that he <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20.
ſaid [<hi>Go and Diſciple me all Nations, baptizing them
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55406:68"/>
in the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghoſt</hi>]
<hi>teaching them to obſerve all things whatever I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
you.</hi>] And it is certain, that a <hi>Baptized perſon</hi>
was then accounted a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was their
<hi>Chriſtening;</hi> and that this was the <hi>Church entrance,</hi>
and <hi>viſible ſymbol</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
And that all Chriſts Church hath ſo accounted
of baptiſm to this day: and true Tradition is in no
one point ſo full and conſtant as in this. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
the very nature of the thing it ſelf declareth
it. Is not he a Chriſtian that believeth according
to the ſenſe of the inſtitution, in <hi>God the Father,
Son and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and by a <hi>ſolemn Vow and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
devoteth himſelf to him as his God and Father, his
Redeemer and Saviour, and his Sanctifier and Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and the <hi>witneſs of Chriſt;</hi> and that hereupon hath
<hi>right to juſtification, adoption,</hi> and the <hi>heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi>
Who is a Chriſtian, if this be not?</p>
               <p>§. 12. The ſenſe of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
in this, that I think there is little diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
about it. The Papiſts confeſs it: The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
confeſs it: See but <hi>Voſſii Theſes de Baptiſmo,</hi>
and <hi>Davenant de Bapt.</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Gatakers Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions</hi>
on that of <hi>Davenant:</hi> All confeſs, that
all the antient Churches held, that to the <hi>duly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
receiver,</hi> all ſin was pardoned in baptiſm, and
the perſon put into a ſtate of life: And therefore
was a member of the Church.</p>
               <p>§. 13. II. And that Chriſt commanded all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
to take each other as brethren, and to live in
Love; and that all men by this were to know them
to be his diſciples, is ſo fully revealed in Scripture,
that it is needleſs among Chriſtians to prove it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:55406:68"/>
III. As alſo that ſuch Chriſtians united to him
their Head, are <hi>eo nomine his Church;</hi> and living in
<hi>this Love,</hi> live as the members of his <hi>Church</hi>
muſt do.</p>
               <p>§. 14. And here three things are to be noted,
1. That what was done by the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> as given
extraordinarily to the Apoſtles as founders or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitects
of the Church, to <hi>lead them into all truth,</hi>
was truly done by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf; the Holy Ghoſt
ſo extraordinarily given being his <hi>promiſed Agent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That yet this work of <hi>Inſtituting Baptiſm</hi> as the
<hi>terms of Church-union,</hi> he would not leave to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the Apoſtles, but was the immediate author
of it himſelf.</p>
               <p>3. But yet two things hereabout he left to the
Apoſtles, 1. To <hi>explain</hi> to the baptized the true
ſenſe of the <hi>general words</hi> in the baptiſmal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:
2. And to <hi>inſtitute part</hi> of the terms of
<hi>Particular Church Order</hi> and <hi>Vnity:</hi> who according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſetled (or ordained) Elders, Biſhops or <hi>Paſtors,</hi>
in every particular Church, which at firſt was for
the moſt part in every City (or great Town)
where the Goſpel was received by any competent
number; and after they added Deacons and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coneſſes
or Widows <hi>ad melius eſſe</hi> only, and they
taught them by word and writing to <hi>obſerve all that
Chriſt commanded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 15. III. And as I have proved, 1. That it
muſt be done, 2. And that Chriſt did it, ſo 3. It is
part of our proof, that no other did it or could
do it.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>No other</hi> had <hi>authority</hi> to inſtitute Church-Eſſentials,
and to give ſuch <hi>neceſſary univerſal</hi> Laws.
2. No other came early enough to do it, but as his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55406:69"/>
Miniſters <hi>after Chriſt</hi> had done it. 3. No other had
wiſdom and fitneſs enough for it; nor were fit to
agree to make Church eſſentials. 4. <hi>De facto</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
proves they did it not. 5. To undertake it, is
to invade Chriſts office. The Apoſtles themſelves
found it done to their hands: Much leſs can any
ordinary Paſtors ſince prove any authority from
God, or any true capacity in themſelves for ſuch
a work.</p>
               <p>§. 16. And if any pretend to it, they muſt be ſuch
as lived before Chriſt had any Evangelical Church
(that is, of the ſame ſpecies as hath been ſince the
inſtitution of Chriſtian baptiſm) or ſuch as have
lived only ſince. The former came not in as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors:
The latter were too late to be the do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s
of that which was done before. Union is eſſential
to the Church in general: The neceſſary terms of
Union are eſſential to it <hi>in ſpecie</hi> as the Chriſtian
Church: For <hi>neceſſarium eſt ſine quo res eſſe non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt:</hi>
It's no Chriſtian Church, without the neceſſary
terms of Church union. And therefore before thoſe
terms were firſt made or inſtituted, there was no
Church of that ſpecies: and after there was ſuch a
Church, and conſequently ſuch terms of its Union,
none could make them, they being made before.</p>
               <p>If any that came after did or ſhall hereafter at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to make ſuch terms, it muſt be new ones,
and not the ſame that conſtituted the firſt Church:
and then their Church will be new, and not of the
ſame <hi>ſpecies</hi> as the firſt. Indeed God did make
<hi>new Laws</hi> of <hi>Adminiſtration,</hi> and ſo may a <hi>Kingdom,</hi>
without changing the <hi>conſtitution:</hi> but not new
<hi>conſtituting terms: Governing Laws</hi> which follow the
<hi>Conſtitution,</hi> are not to make the Kingdom a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
or the Church a Church: but to preſerve
the Church and its order, and promote its wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55406:69"/>
and the Oath of Allegiance maketh a man
a Subject, without ſubſcribing to the Governing
Laws: But as a Subject he conſenteth to live under
thoſe Laws: and if he break them, he is puniſhable
according to them, and for breaking ſome of them,
may be cut off: and for ſome crimes a man may be
excommunicate.</p>
               <p>But yet excommunication muſt be diſtinguiſhed:
That which totally cuts a man off from the Church,
muſt be but a ſentence upon proof that he hath
firſt morally cut off himſelf: Leſſer crimes muſt be
puniſhed with the leſſer excommunication, which
is but a ſuſpenſion, and that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh
of, 2 Theſſ. 3. 15. <hi>Yet take him not for an enemy, but
admoniſh him as a brother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 17. By all this it is moſt evident, that <hi>Chriſt</hi>
himſelf the Inſtitutor and maker of his Church,
hath made the <hi>terms of eſſential Catholick Vnion;</hi>
and that we have nothing to do herein, but to find
out what are the terms that he hath made, and
not to enquire what any men ſince have made or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as being not authorized thereto.</p>

                  <p>No humane terms, not made by Chriſt, or his

               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. DIvers men ſpeak diverſly of this matter:
1. Some ſay that <hi>no form</hi> of the Polity
of particular Churches is of Divine inſtitution, but
that God hath left all the forming of them to the
will of man.</p>
               <p>2. Others ſay, that <hi>no form</hi> of them is <hi>lawful</hi> but
<hi>what is</hi> of <hi>Divine inſtitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And of the firſt, ſome ſay that Chriſt inſtituted
the Papal form, and ſome ſay General Councils, the
<hi>ſummam Poteſtatem</hi> to the <hi>univerſal Church,</hi> and left
it <hi>to them</hi> to form <hi>particular Churches.</hi> Others ſay
that <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> are to do it: And others that the
<hi>Dioceſane Biſhops</hi> of every Nation in National or
Provincial Synods may do it. But all agree that the
form of particular Churches muſt be made, by ſome
that had authority from Chriſt to do it.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Of the ſecond ſort (who hold no form of a
particular Church lawful, but what is of Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution)
ſome hold that only a <hi>Dioceſan Church</hi>
(that hath <hi>many Congregations and Altars</hi>) is of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

and ſome that theſe and Provincial, National,

Thus do mens judgements vary.</p>
               <p>§. 3. A third ſort hold that God hath inſtituted
<hi>ſome Church forms</hi> beſides the Univerſal, and left <hi>men</hi>
to make <hi>others:</hi> And here ſome think that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
<hi>Patriarchal,</hi> and left them to make the <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan</hi>
and <hi>Parochial:</hi> ſome hold that God inſtituted

made only the <hi>Parochial</hi> (I mean <hi>ſingle ſocieties aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated</hi>

voluntary aſſociations to make the greater over
them.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Among theſe opinions let us firſt try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Chriſt hath inſtituted <hi>any</hi> Church form beſides
the univerſal, and 2. what that is.</p>

§. 5. Here ſtill it is ſuppoſed that the Spirit in
the Apoſtles, who were deſigned to be founders and
maſter-builders, and to gather and order Churches,
and teach them to obſerve all Chriſts commands,
was Chriſts promiſed Agent (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls
him) and that Chriſt did what the Spirit did
by the Apoſtles in their proper work, to which he
was promiſed them as their Guide; as it is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
               <p>§. 6. And that Chriſt and his Apoſtles inſtituted
ſacred ordinary Aſſemblies of Chriſtians for holy
worſhip and Communion, is ſo clear in the New
Teſtament that it were vain to prove it.</p>
               <p>§. 7. And 2. as notorious and paſt doubt it is
that the end of theſe Aſſemblies was ſuch as is here
mentioned; 3. And as plain that ſuch Paſtors as
are here deſcribed were ſet over all theſe Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
and authorized and obliged to the foreſaid
work, that is under Chriſt the great Teacher,
Prieſt and Ruler of the Church, to Teach them
Gods word, to intercede under Chriſt for them to
God, and from Chriſt to them in prayer and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to Guide them by that called the

many other places ſhew this.</p>
               <p>§. 8. And it is no leſs plain that the people were
bound to continue in their doctrine, communion
and prayer, and to obey them in that which they
were commiſſioned to do: <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7, 13, 24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.
25, 26. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 12, 13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20. and

Churches as conſiſt of ſuch Congregations and
their Paſtors is paſt all denyal and juſt doubt.</p>

                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:55406:71"/>
§. 9. And as to all other Church-forms (Claſſical,
Dioceſan, Metropolitical, Provincial, National, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal
and Papal, it is theſe only that fall under
reaſonable doubt and controverſie. And 1. for
<hi>Claſſical Churches,</hi> I can ſay but this, 1. That the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
commands of holding Chriſtian Love and
Concord, and doing all to edification require ſuch
Churches as live near together to be <hi>helpers to each
other,</hi> and that counſel and correſpondency is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
hereto, which the Churches have ſtill lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
exerciſed by Synods: And if theſe aſſociations
for order-ſake be agreed on, as to ſtated times and
numbers and bounds, it is but the circumſtantiating
of a known duty: And if any will call this a <hi>diſtinct
Policy</hi> or <hi>Church-form,</hi> I contend not againſt their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of ſpeech, while we agree <hi>de re:</hi> But I judge
it perillous to give the ſame name to ſuch an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
or. Aſſociation as to a <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſts inſtitution;</hi>
leſt it ſeduce men to think that the word is not
<hi>equivocally</hi> uſed. If the Agents of ſeveral Kingdoms
met at a common Dyet, I had rather not call them a
<hi>ſuperiour Kingdom,</hi> were their meeting never ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.
An Aſſembly that is the <hi>Pars Imperans</hi> of
one body Politick, having Legiſlative power, is one
thing; and an <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of <hi>Agents</hi> or <hi>Princes</hi> for
<hi>meer concord</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>help</hi> of diſtinct King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
Schools, Armies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is another thing. And
I know no proof that ſuch Councils muſt be <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
or at <hi>ſtated Times</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> but ſometimes that
is beſt, and ſometime not, as the caſe ſtandeth, as
even the Papiſts confeſs. And when they begin to
degenerate from a <hi>Council for Concord</hi> to a <hi>Majeſty</hi>
or <hi>higheſt Governing power,</hi> it's time to croſs their
claim and interrupt the occaſions of it.</p>
               <p>§. 10. And if men at ſuch Claſſes, and Councils
chooſe one to keep order as a <hi>moderator,</hi> yea if they
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55406:72"/>
                  <hi>fix</hi> him, it is but the circumſtantiating of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
work: But if he will claim hereupon a <hi>diſtinct
order, office,</hi> and <hi>proper political Church relation,</hi>
ſo as hence to make himſelf the <hi>Regent part</hi> of a <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
of a <hi>Church,</hi> yea and claim this as of God and
unalterable, I cannot juſtifie ſuch a Church-form.</p>
               <p>§. 11. This holds as to the <hi>Preſidents</hi> of all <hi>ranks of
Synods,</hi> Claſſical, Dioceſan, Metropolitical, Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial,
National or Patriarchal. To uſe them as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents
of Councils for Concord is one thing; and
to uſe them as the <hi>Pars Imperans,</hi> or the conſtitutive
heads of a diſtinct Church-<hi>ſpecies</hi> is another. Arch-Biſhop
<hi>Vſher</hi> told me himſelf his judgement, that
Councils were but for Counſel and Concord, and
not for the Government of each other or any of
the members; and that they had no proper Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
power either over their Minor part, or over any
abſent Biſhops: Though each Biſhop was ſtill the
Governour of his own flock, and their power over
their flocks was exerciſed with the greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by their Concord in Councils. Dyets and
Councils of diſtinct independent Biſhops are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
forms of policy or Churches.</p>
               <p>§. 12. And if this hold true, that the <hi>Councils
themſelves</hi> are not thereby <hi>Rectors</hi> of a diſtinct poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
ſociety, but for <hi>Concord</hi> of many, then it will
follow that a <hi>Preſident</hi> of ſuch a Council, whether
Dioceſan, Provincial, National or more General, is
not <hi>as ſuch</hi> a Rector of the Biſhops under him and
their people, but only the <hi>Orderer</hi> or <hi>Guide</hi> of the
Modes and Circumſtances of the Council as ſuch.
And therefore could the Pope prove a right to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
in General Councils (<hi>orbis Romani, vel orbis ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum</hi>)
which he cannot, it were no proof that he
is <hi>Regent Head</hi> of the Church univerſal. The ſame

or <hi>Parochial Churches</hi> (as for <hi>preſent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>)
then it muſt needs follow that none of the
reſt inſtituted by man, have power to deprive ſuch
ſingle Churches of any of the Priviledges granted
them by Chriſt: And therefore whereas Chriſt hath
made the terms of Catholick Communion himſelf,
and hath commanded all ſuch to worſhip him pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
in holy Communion under faithful Paſtors
choſen or at leaſt conſented to by themſelves (which
many hundred years was the judgement of the
Churches), no humane order or power can deprive
them of any of this benefit, nor diſoblige them from
any of this duty, by juſt authority.</p>
               <p>§. 14. Nay ſeeing that the univerſal Church is
certainly the higheſt ſpecies, none hath authority
on pretence of narrower Communion in lower
Churches, to change Chriſts terms of <hi>Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi>
nor to deprive Chriſtians of the right of
being loved and received by each other, or diſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
them from the duty of loving and receiving
each other. Humane power made by their own
contracts, cannot change Chriſts Laws, nor the
Priviledges or forms of Chriſts own Churches.</p>
               <p>§. 15. They that ſay that theſe ſeveral Church
<hi>ſpecies</hi> are of God, muſt prove that God inſtituted
them; and that can be only by <hi>Scripture:</hi> or elſe that he
gave ſome power to inſtitute them ſince Scripture
times: which till they prove, none are bound to
obey them, at leaſt when they over rule Chriſts own
inſtitutions.</p>
               <p>§. 16. To deviſe new ſpecies of Churches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Gods authority and impoſe them on the world
(yea in his name) and call all diſſenters ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
is a far worſe Uſurpation than to make and
impoſe new Ceremonies or Liturgies.</p>

§. 17. Dr. <hi>Hammond (Diſſert, cont. Blond. &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</hi>
in <hi>Act.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp; paſſ.</hi>) affirmeth that it cannot be
proved that the order of ſubject Presbyters was
exiſtent in Scripture times; and conſequently hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that Biſhops had but ſingle Congregations (as
<hi>Ignatius</hi> ſpeaketh with <hi>One Altar</hi>). Now if Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſans,
Metropolitans, Provincials, Patriarchs, or
Pope as conſtitutive of Church-ſpecies were made
<hi>after,</hi> either theſe new Churches were made by the
<hi>Biſhops of Parochial Churches,</hi> or by thoſe that were
<hi>No Biſhops</hi> or Paſtors of any Churches at all (For
the Apoſtles were dead, and no inſtitution of theſe
but Scriptural can be truly proved. And other
Churches beſides the <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Parochial,</hi> or
ſingle, (diſtinct from a compound of Churches)
there were then none.) For the <hi>lower</hi> to make the
<hi>higher Churches,</hi> is that which they will not grant,
who grant not that Presbyters may propagate
their own <hi>ſpecies;</hi> and deny that power aſcendeth
<hi>ab inferioribus.</hi> And that men of <hi>no Church,</hi> made
all theſe new Church-<hi>ſpecies</hi> is no honour to them.</p>
               <p>§. 18. Two contrary opinions herein now reign:
One of the Papiſts that think Chriſt inſtituted the
Pope with power to make inferiour <hi>Church ſpecies.</hi>
That other is, that Chriſt or his Apoſtles inſtituted
<hi>Dioceſans,</hi> giving them power both as rulers to
make <hi>Pariſh Churches</hi> (or <hi>Chapels</hi>) under them,
and by <hi>Contract</hi> or <hi>Conſent</hi> to make the <hi>higheſt ſpecies
over them,</hi> (Provincial, National, Patriarchal,
and ſay ſome Papal.) But as to the Papiſts
ſo much is ſaid againſt their ſuppoſition that it's
not here to be confuted: And it's certain that <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Church order</hi> was conſtituted by no Pope, and
that all the Apoſtles had power thereto. And
as for the latter, which affirmeth the lower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
to make the higher, we ſtill want the proofs
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55406:73"/>
of their authority ſo to do: of which more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>§. 19. As for them that ſay that it is <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi>
that have power to make new <hi>ſpecies</hi> of
<hi>Churches,</hi> I grant them that whatever alterations
of Church-Orders may be made, Magiſtrates may
do much in them. The <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> and
the <hi>Guidance</hi> of Paſtors, and the <hi>Conſent</hi> of the
<hi>people</hi> have each herein their ſpecial place: But
what theſe alterations or additions are which
they may make, is the chief queſtion: Both the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>
Church, and <hi>ſingle Church aſſemblies</hi> being
inſtituted by Chriſt are not left to them. The
<hi>circumſtantiating</hi> of other Aſſemblies and Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are left to them, to be done according to
Gods general Law: But that making new Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
Societies that are properly called Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
or Religious bodies conſiſting of the <hi>Pars
regens, &amp; pars ſubdita,</hi> is left to them by Chriſt,
I never ſaw proved, any more than the making
of <hi>new Sacraments.</hi> But if that could be proved,
yet that theſe humane Churches or their <hi>makers</hi>
may <hi>change</hi> thoſe that are of <hi>Divine inſtitution</hi> or
deprive them of their priviledges, or forbid them
commanded duty, cannot be proved.</p>
               <p>§. 20. And it is certain, 1. That if Princes or
Biſhops or the people did inſtitute Dioceſan, or
Metropolitan, Provincial or Patriarchal Churches,
they may yet make more and other ſpecies: And
who knoweth how many new forms of Churches
we may yet expect? 2. And they that made them,
upon good reaſon may unmake them, or alter them
when they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>§. 21. But though the <hi>Legiſlator</hi> and not the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
be the <hi>inſtitutor</hi> of the <hi>Vniverſal</hi> and <hi>particular</hi>

               <p>§. 22. By all this it appeareth that as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to Chriſt to inſtitute the political ſpecies
of Churches (though circumſtantiating may be left

               <argument>
                  <p>The danger of the two extreams: And firſt of
deſpairing of any Concord, and of unjuſt To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerations.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. SOme men having ſeen the Chriſtian world
ſo long in Sects and contending parties, do
think that there is <hi>no hope</hi> of <hi>Vnity</hi> and Concord, and
therefore that all ſhould be <hi>left at liberty:</hi> And others
think that there is no hope but on terms <hi>ſo wide</hi> as
ſhall take ſuch as <hi>Chriſt receiveth not,</hi> nor <hi>would have</hi>
us receive. And on ſuch accounts there were very
early great contentions about the qualifications of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55406:74"/>
the baptizers and baptized, and the validity of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
and about re-baptizing.</p>
               <p>As to the Baptizers, ſome thought that only
Prieſts ſhould baptize (none appropriated it to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops):
ſome thought Lay-men might baptize in
caſe of neceſſity, and ſome thought that women alſo
might do it: And ſome thought that though women
or Lay-men might not do it lawfully, yet <hi>factum va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi>
being done, ſuch ſhould not be re-baptized.
And ſome thought that thoſe that were baptized
even by <hi>Prieſts</hi> that were <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> (or as they
called them <hi>Hereticks</hi> when they ſeparated from
common Concord and Communion) muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized.
And they thought that if they were
baptized in ſuch a Schiſmatical (or Heretical) ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
by whomſoever, it was not into the true
Church. In this caſe <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the <hi>African</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
with <hi>Firmilian</hi> and his Collegues, were in the
wrong, when the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was in the right.
And the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> thought they were but of <hi>Cyprians</hi>
mind: For it ſeems they had there the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Biſhops; And the greater number went for
the Church, and the leſs for hereticks: and ſo they
called themſelves the Church (though out of <hi>Africa</hi>
the number againſt them, or that meddled not in the
quarrel was far greater.) And all this aroſe but by
the conteſts of two men for the Biſhoprick of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
ſome following one and ſome the other.</p>
               <p>§. 2. This errour of <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi>
aroſe 1. from their not ſufficiently diſtinguiſhing the
<hi>Church univerſal,</hi> from the <hi>Aſſociated Churches</hi> of their
Countrey; nor well conſidering that Baptiſm as
ſuch is but our entrance into the <hi>univerſal Church,</hi>
and not into this or that particular Church. 2. By
an abuſive or equivocal uſe of the name [<hi>Heretick</hi>]
their doctrine being true of Hereticks ſtrictly ſo
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55406:75"/>
called, who <hi>deny</hi> in baptizing any eſſential part of
Chriſtianity, but falſe of Hereticks laxly ſo called,
that are only Schiſmaticks, or deny only or corrupt
ſome lower doctrines, precepts or practices of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Therefore the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
the caſe by diſtinction, decreeing the re-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
of ſome (as ſuch as the <hi>Pauliniſts</hi> baptized)
and not of others. That is, All that had not true
Chriſtian baptiſm conſiſting of all the true eſſentials,
were to be re-baptized, and not others, whatever
particular Church they were of.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Hereupon alſo among the Roman Doctors,
it hath been a great debate, whether the <hi>Prieſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi>
was neceſſary to the validity of baptiſm:
The true anſwer to which is this.</p>
               <p>It is one queſtion what is neceſſary to the <hi>juſtifying
of the Prieſt, before the Church?</hi> and another <hi>before
God?</hi> and another queſtion what is neceſſary to the
<hi>validity of baptiſm to the receiver before the Church?</hi>
and another <hi>before God?</hi> And ſo I anſwer.</p>
               <p>Suppoſing that no man ſhall ſuffer for anothers
fault, but for his own: 1. If the Prieſt <hi>profeſs</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi>
to baptize in general, and expreſs it in the
true words of baptiſm, his act <hi>ex parte ſui</hi> is valid <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram
eccleſiâ</hi> though he diſſemble.</p>
               <p>2. If the Prieſt diſſemble, his act is a crime and
ſhall be puniſhed by God.</p>
               <p>3. If he <hi>profeſs not</hi> to <hi>intend</hi> to baptize the perſon,
or to intend it in general, but to corrupt it in the
Eſſentials, it is as a <hi>Miniſtration</hi> invalid <hi>coram Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiâ</hi>
and ſhould be done again.</p>
               <p>4. If the adult perſon baptized profeſs <hi>baptiſmal
Conſent diſſemblingly,</hi> it is valid baptiſm <hi>coram eccleſiâ</hi>
as to what the Church muſt do upon it, but invalid
as to what God is to do as the performer of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:55406:75"/>
5. If the perſon baptized do not ſo much as <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
conſent,</hi> or profeſs not to conſent, nor to intend
to be then baptized, it is no baptiſm before God or
the Church.</p>
               <p>6. If he profeſs to be baptized in general, but
deny any <hi>Eſſential</hi> in particular, it is not the true
Chriſtian baptiſm, but muſt be better done.</p>
               <p>§. 5. When any came in ſo great errour as that
the Church ſcarce knew whether it was an Eſſential
part of faith and baptiſm that was denyed, it made
the Controverſie hard about their re-baptizing. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thought that the <hi>Photinians</hi> and <hi>Arians</hi> denying
Chriſts Godhead as of the ſame ſubſtance with the
father, denyed an eſſential article, and were to be
re-baptized if they ſo entred at firſt: Our <hi>Socinians</hi>
are much worſe, that deny Chriſts Godhead in a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
ſence. And how doth he believe in Chriſt that
believeth him not to be God, which is moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
eſſential to him?</p>
               <p>§. 6. They that are over-bold in altering Chriſts
terms of Church Union and Communion, making
them leſs or more or other, if they knew what they do,
would find themſelves more concerned in theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
of baptizing and re-baptizing, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
greater corrupters, than they have thought.</p>
               <p>§. 7. To think that Church <hi>Vnion</hi> is <hi>impoſſible</hi> is to
deny that there is any Church, and conſequently any
Chriſt. To think that neceſſary Concord in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
is impoſſible, is ſo great a diſparagement to
the Church, as tempteth men by vilifying it to doubt
of Chriſtianity: For if Chriſtians cannot live in
Unity of faith and love and converſe, what is their
Chriſtianity? And ſuch deſpair of Concord will
make men ſuſpend all endeavours to attain it: For
Deſpair uſeth no means.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:55406:76"/>
§. 8. And to take into the Church of Chriſt ſuch
as want the Eſſentials, and Chriſt would not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
is to corrupt his Church, and bring in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
and ſuch as will diſhonour him, and will be
more hurtful in the Church than they would be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out:
like rebels in a Kingdom, or mutineers in an
Army, or enemies in a Family: The nearer the
worſe.</p>
               <p>§. 9. It is for this uſe eſpecially that Chriſt hath
committed the <hi>Church Keyes</hi> to the <hi>Paſtors:</hi> And
the <hi>Key of entrance</hi> is the <hi>Chief.</hi> Therefore he that
judgeth <hi>who is to be Baptized,</hi> exerciſeth the <hi>chief act
of the Church Keyes:</hi> And he that <hi>Baptized</hi> was held
to have the Power of judging whom to baptize:
which was never denyed to the Presbyters, till after
for <hi>order</hi> ſome reſtrained them.</p>
               <p>§. 10. It is a ſtrange contrariety of ſome Paſtors
to themſelves, who judge that all Infants of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
Jews, Turks or wicked men are without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
to be taken into the Church, if any igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Chriſtian will but offer them, and ſay over a
few words; and the Adult alſo if they can but ſay
over the Creed by rote, and a few words more;
and thus fill the Church with Enemies of Chriſt;
and yet when they are in, deny them Communion
unleſs they will ſtrictly come up to many <hi>humane
unneceſſary impoſitions;</hi> as if far ſtricter <hi>obedience to
men</hi> (perhaps in uſurpations) were neceſſary, than
to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>§. 11. How far Infidels, Catechumens, or Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. <hi>ADdition</hi> to Chriſts terms are very peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
as well as diminution: When men
will deny either <hi>Church entrance</hi> or <hi>Communion</hi> to any
that Chriſt would have received, becauſe they come
not up to certain terms which they or ſuch as they
deviſe. And though they think that Chriſt giveth
them Power to do thus, or that reaſon or neceſſity

guiltleſs: Imputing their errour to Chriſt untruly, is
no ſmall aggravation of the ſin.</p>

               <p>§. 3. And it is dangerous Pride to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Great enough, Wiſe enough, and Good

               <p>§. 4. Much leſs, when they hereby imply an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation

§. 6. And the merciful Lord and Saviour of the
Church, that came to take off heavy burdens and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
yokes, will not take it well to have men
come after him and as by his authority, to make his
eaſie yoke more ſtrait, and his light burden heavy,
and to caſt or keep out thoſe that he hath Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and doth receive, and to deal cruelly with thoſe
that he hath ſo dearly bought, and tenderly loveth.</p>
               <p>§. 7. And indeed it is ofter for mens own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
and dominion, to keep up their power and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of ſuperiority, that men thus uſe the ſervants
of Chriſt, than truly to keep clear the Church, and
to keep out the polluters.</p>
               <p>§. 8. But when it <hi>is done</hi> by too much <hi>ſtrictneſs</hi> and
as for Church-purity, yet this alſo hath its aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
For men ſo far to forget themſelves, that
they are ſervants and not Lords, ſinners that have
need themſelves of mercy, unfit to be too forward
to caſt the firſt ſtone, to ſeem more wiſe and holy
than Chriſt, is but ſpecious offending him.</p>
               <p>§. 9. And as ſpiritual priviledges excel temporal,
ſo is it an aggravated Tyranny, to deprive Chriſts
ſervants of benefits ſo precious, and ſo dearly
bought. As it was not with Silver and Gold that
we were Redeemed, ſo neither for the enjoying of
Silver and Gold. Communion with Chriſt, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and blood and his Saints in his Ordinances, is a
bleſſing ſo great, that he that robs ſuch of it that
have right to it, may anſwer it dearlier than if he

which is of moſt extenſive miſchief, even to all
that are ſubject to them, when others do it but by
local practice, extending but to thoſe that are
about them, or the particular aſſemblies which
they gather. 3. Theſe make the Schiſm unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
when private Seducers may be reſiſted:
For it is not in the power of good men to bring
their judgements to the ſentiments of every or
any dictator, or yet to go contrary to their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<hi>Ilicitum ſtat pro impoſſibili.</hi> 4. Theſe ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
the crime by pretending power from God,
and fathering Schiſm on ſo good a thing as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and cauſing it as for Unity it ſelf.
5. They condemn themſelves by crying down
Schiſm, while they unavoidably cauſe it.</p>
               <p>§. 12. And this over-doing and making unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
termes, unavoidably involveth them in
the guilt of perſecution; and when they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
it, they know not where to ſtop. Suppoſe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55406:78"/>
they decree that none ſhall preach the Goſpel, or
aſſemble for holy Communion in publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
but thoſe that ſubſcribe or ſwear or promiſe
or profeſs or do, ſomewhat accounted ſinful by the
perſons commanded, and not neceſſary indeed, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
eſteemed by the impoſer (who yet perhaps
calls it but Indifferent). It is certain that no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Chriſtian will do that which he judgeth to be
ſin: It is certain that other mens confident talk will
not make all men of their minds, to take all for law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
which they take for ſuch: what then will the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers
do? They will make ſtrict Laws to puniſh
ſeverely all that diſobey: For ſay they, Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
muſt not be contemned, nor diſobedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated:
ſo do the Papiſts as to the <hi>Trent</hi> Oath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
ſo did <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, a while about the Interim;
and ſo many others. Theſe Laws then muſt be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted:
The Paſtors muſt be caſt out; the preachers
ſilenced; They ſtill believe as <hi>Daniel</hi> did about pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the Apoſtles about preaching, that God
commandeth what men forbid, and it is a damnable
ſin to forſake their calling and duty, no leſs than ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge,
and cruelty to ſouls, and deſerting the
Church and worſhip and cauſe of Chriſt; and the
people will ſtill believe that no mans prohibition can
excuſe them if they forſake Gods publick worſhip
and comply with ſin. The Prelates will ſay that all
this is but errour, wilfulneſs, and rebellion, and they
can prove the contrary. Their words will not
change the judgement of diſſenters. The Paſtors
and preachers then muſt be fined, impriſoned or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
for preaching, and the people for publick
worſhipping God: when they are fined they will go
on: when they are out of priſon they will return to
their work: nothing is left then to remedy it, but
either perpetual impriſonment, baniſhment or death.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55406:78"/>
When this is done, more will ſtill riſe of the ſame
mind and continue the work that others were diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to perform: And the Prelates that cauſe this
will be taken by the ſuffering people for thorns and
thiſtles, and grievous Wolves that devour the
flocks, and the military Miniſters of the Devil: The
indifferent common people knowing their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to be conſcionable men of upright lives, will
become of the ſame minds, and look on the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
as the enemies of good men and of publick
peace, that do all this by pride and domination.
The ungodly rabble of drunkards, prophane ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
adulterers, and ſuch like, for the moſt part ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Godlineſs and ſtrict living, will cry up the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
and triumph over the ſufferers: And thus the
Land will be divided; the Prelates and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors
with the dirty malignant rabble of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious
will make one party, and theſe will call
themſelves Orthodox and the Church; The ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and all that pity them and like them better than
the Perſecutors will be the other party. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of the debauched and malignant rabble
with the Prelates and their party will increaſe ſober
mens diſaffection to them, and make men take them
for the patrons of impiety: And how ſad a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
muſt ſuch Churches be in! To ſay nothing of
the ſtate concuſſions and diſeaſes that uſually follow.
Whatever ignorant men may dream, theſe prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks
are moſt certain, as any man that can diſcern
effects in moral cauſes, may ſee, and as hiſtory and
ſad experience prove to all men of reading, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and underſtanding.</p>
               <p>§. 13. And in Paſtors of the Church, this will be a
double crime and ſhame; becauſe 1. It is their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to gather and edifie Chriſts flock, and not to ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and afflict them: 2. Becauſe they ſhould moſt
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55406:79"/>
imitate Chriſt in tender bowels, gentleneſs and long-ſuffering,
bearing the Lambs in their armes, and not
breaking the bruiſed reed, nor quenching the ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
flax: Nurſes or Mothers uſe not to kill their
Children for crying, nor to turn them out of doors
becauſe they are unclean, nor to cut their throats to
make them ſwallow bigger morſels, inſtead of cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their meat: Much leſs to caſt them off for obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their father. 3. Becauſe it is ſuppoſed that
they beſt know the will of Chriſt, and ſhould be beſt
acquainted with the wayes of peace. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhould underſtand Rom. 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. <hi>Him that is
weak in the faith Receive; but not to doubtful diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The Kingdom of God is not meats and drinks, but
righteouſneſs, peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt: And he
that in theſe things ſerveth Chriſt, is acceptable to God,
and approved of men,</hi> that is, of wiſe and good men,
but not of proud perſecutors, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17, 18.
<hi>Wherefore receive ye one another as Chriſt alſo received
to the Glory of God. Rom.</hi> 15. 7. If the people were
Schiſmatical and inclined to fall in pieces, the Guides
and builders ſhould ſoder and cement them, and as
<hi>pillars</hi> and <hi>baſes in the Church which is the houſe of the
living God</hi> (as <hi>Timothy</hi> is called) ſhould bear them
up that they fall not by diviſion.</p>
               <p>§. 14. In a word, whoever will impartially read
Church Hiſtory, eſpecially of the Councils and
Popes, ſhall find that the ſelf-conceited Uſurpation
of proud Prelates, impoſing unneceſſary devices of
their own (profeſſions or practices) on the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and this with proud and fierce impatience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
diſſenters, and uſurping a Legiſlation which
Chriſt never gave them, hath been the great cauſe
of much of the hatred, ſchiſms, perſecutions, wars,
rebellions againſt Emperours and Kings, falſe excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications,
interdicts, and the diſgrace of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55406:79"/>
weakning of the Church, and hindering the
Converſion of Jews and Infidels, and been a chief

               <head>CHAP. XIII.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>To cry out of the intolerable miſchiefs of Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and call for ſharper execution, while di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
ſnares are made the terms of Vnion, is
the work of ignorant, proud and malignant
Church-deſtroyers.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. TO tolerate all evil that pretendeth Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
is to be no friend to Religion, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
or peace. To tolerate no error in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
is for no Prince to tolerate himſelf, his wife,
his child, or any one ſubject: And to pretend to
this, is to crave ſelf-deſtruction (<hi>neque enim lex
juſtior ulla eſt, &amp;c.</hi>) and to proclaim himſelf igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
yea groſly ignorant, what is a Church, a Paſtor,
a Government, a Chriſtian, or a Man.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Multitudes of Books are written for and
againſt Toleration: They that are loweſt uſually
write for it (Even <hi>Jer. Taylor</hi>'s <hi>Liberty of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying</hi>
before he was a Biſhop, was thought a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
or tolerable Book). But moſt are againſt
it that are in power, and think they can force others
to their wills. But it is wiſe and juſt and impartial
men, that are here the diſcerners of the truth, whoſe
judgements are not biaſſed by intereſt or paſſion, nor
blinded by unacquaintedneſs with their adverſaries
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55406:80"/>
or their cauſe, or perverted by uſing only one ear
and one eye. He knoweth not mankind, who knoweth
not how greatly (not only the common gang, but)
even learned men, yea, and zealous religious men,
are to be ſuſpected in their evil characters and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of thoſe that they are ſpeaking againſt as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries.
It grieveth me to know and think, how
little moſt adverſaries in this caſe are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
               <p>§. 3. To deſcribe the due bounds of Toleration is
far from being impoſſible, or very difficult to an
underſtanding and impartial man: But to ſtop the
mouth or rage of Contradicters, and to reconcile
the multitude of ignorant, proud, tyrannical, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable,
intereſſed, factious, partial men to ſuch
certain meaſures, is next impoſſible, and never yet
even among the Clergy was attained, ſince the Spirit
of infallibility, ſimplicity and Love departed, and
the Spirit of darkneſs, pride and malignity in moſt
places got the upper hand.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Many and many Books of this nature I have
lately read, that cry down liberty and Toleration,
and call for greater ſeverities, and deſcribe thoſe
whoſe ruine or ſufferings they plead for, as ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and falſly, as if they talkt of men at the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes,
whom they had never ſeen, and as if they
had never heard their Cauſe; and as cruelly, as if
they had been preaching to Souldiers, and confuting
<hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> or preaching a Viſitation Sermon to
<hi>Bonner</hi> or <hi>Gardiner:</hi> And yet the falſhoods or inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
ſet off, with ſo great confidence, and well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
words, and zeal againſt ſchiſm, and error,
and eſpecially for the Church and Government, that
it grieveth my ſoul to think, how difficult ſuch men
do make it, to ſtrangers that muſt know all on
truſt from others, and men of other buſineſs, that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55406:80"/>
cannot have while to ſearch into the truth, to eſcape
deceit and the conſequent miſchiefs: Zeal for piety
is not more abuſed by Sectaries, than zeal for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and their power and wealth, called zeal for
the Church and truth and order, is abuſed by bad
domineering men. Or elſe the world had not been
embroiled by the Clergy theſe twelve hundred years
at leaſt, nor <hi>Rome</hi> arrived at its pernicious Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and power to deſtroy.</p>
               <p>§. 5. And let mens different Religions or Opinions
be never ſo many and notable, yet every where the
ſame plea againſt Toleration is uſed, and the ſame
Arguments ſeem good for every party that is in
power. In <hi>Japan</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> and Heathen Lands,
they can copiouſly declaim againſt the miſchiefs of
tolerating Chriſtianity: The Papiſts think torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Inquiſitions, and burning Chriſtians, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
thouſands and hundreds of thouſands better
than to tolerate Proteſtants. The Lutherans cry
down the toleration of Calviniſts: What need I
name more? As the Papiſts ſay, that every Sect
pleadeth the Scripture, ſo we may ſay, that every
<hi>powerful party,</hi> be their cauſe never ſo falſe, cry out
againſt <hi>tolerating others,</hi> though in the truth.</p>
               <p>§. 6. And doubtleſs Concord even in perfection is
ſo deſirable, that it's eaſie for a man to ſet forth the
beauty and excellency of it: And diſcord is ſo bad,
that it's eaſie to declaim againſt it: But for him
that <hi>Cauſeth it,</hi> to do it, is ſelf-condemnation. And
for him that falſly deſcribeth the cauſe, and juſtifieth
the Schiſmatick, and accuſeth the innocent, to write
Books and preach Sermons againſt Schiſm and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,
is but deluſion tending to their own ſhame,
and others deceit and ruine.</p>
               <p>§. 7. And he never was a good Muſician, Builder,
Watch-maker, nor good at any Art or Science, that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55406:81"/>
thought all <hi>diverſity</hi> was <hi>diſcord:</hi> He that would with
zeal and learning write a Book to prove that a
Lute or Organs muſt not be tolerated, if each ſtring
and key be not of the ſame ſound; or that all the
parts in a Clock, Watch, Building, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt be of
the ſame ſhape and magnitude, or all men of one
language or complexion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would ſcarce get ſo
much credit as moſt of our Hereticaters do, when
they call for fire and faggot and Jaylors, as more
meet and able confuters of error than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>§. 8. The men on whom they cry for vengeance,
either are really religious, or not: If not, it's a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
that they are not of the accuſers mind, being
ſuppoſed to follow the upper ſide: It's poſſible that
ſome advantage may turn a man that hath no reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
out of the Kings high-way, into ſome Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
cottage, eſpecially in ſome ſtorms: But it's very
rarely that Gain goeth not for Godlineſs, and the
way of reputation, eaſe and profit, for religion,
with ſuch as indeed have none at all. But if they
are ſeriouſly religious, they take it as from the Law
of the Almighty, the King of Kings and Lord of
Lords; to whom all men are leſs than the vileſt
worms to us: and they take it to be that which they
lay their ſalvation and everlaſting hopes on; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that God will bear them out, and if they dye
for it, will reward them with the crown of Glory:
They believe that they ſhall be damned in Hell for
ever, if they break Gods Law, and obey man againſt
him: And in this caſe it ſhould not be hard to reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
men, eſpecially Biſhops and Teachers, to know
what means and meaſures are meeteſt to be uſed
with ſuch men; and when he that muſt ſuffer, hath
fleſh that is as unwilling to ſuffer as other mens, it
ſhould be conſidered how far Satan uſeth the fleſh for
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55406:81"/>
his intereſt, and how far the Paſtors of the Church
ſhould take part with it; when as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<hi>He that doubeth is damned if he eat, becauſe he eateth
not of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 9. There is no heed to be taken by mens crying
out againſt error or ſchiſm, to diſcern who is the
erroneous or Schiſmatick. None more cry out
againſt them than the guilty: Who condemneth er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and ſchiſm more than the Papiſts, and who are
greater cauſes and authors of them than the Pope?
As our common prophane rabble are ſo great hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
that they live quite contrary to their
Baptiſmal Vow, and the Religion which they nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
profeſs, and yet commonly cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ut againſt hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,
and call all men hypocrites that ſeem to be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in living as they vowed and profeſs; even ſo the
greateſt Schiſmaticks and Hereticks, partly in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and partly to avert both men and conſcience
from accuſing themſelves, do uſually firſt cry down
Schiſmaticks and Hereticks, and perhaps preach and
write moſt vehemently againſt them. I take a man
to be never the more Orthodox, Catholick, or of
the true Church, for crying up the true Church, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiciſm
and Orthodoxneſs, and crying down the
contrary, and accuſing others.</p>
               <p>§. 10. I have long obſerved with the beſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I have, that uſually thoſe Divines that write
moſt for Peace and Reconciliation of hot conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
are men of <hi>clearer judgement</hi> than others, and
uſually ſee further into the cauſe, than either of the
fierce contending parties: Though the <hi>Turks</hi> in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
give ſome liberty to Chriſtians, as a neceſſary
preſervation of their Empire; and the <hi>Socinians</hi> have
much pleaded for peace and concord, partly by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
for themſelves, and partly from common
light of reaſon; yet among real Reformed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55406:82"/>
the greateſt judgement is found in the greateſt
Pacificators: ſuch as <hi>Le Blank, Amyrald, Phaceus,
Camero, Lud. Crocius, Bergius, Martinius, Calixtus,
Dallaeus, Blondel, Vſher, Davenant, Hall, Morton,
Chillingworth,</hi> and ſuch others: Darkneſs doth beſt
fit the Spirit of contention.</p>
               <p>§. 11. There is nothing in humane actions that is
free from inconveniences; eſpecially actions of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
conſequence. And the collecting and aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of ſuch inconveniences, and making tragical
exclamations thereupon, without looking to the
miſchiefs that men imagine muſt be the remedy, or
ſeeing the evils on the other ſide, is the common
practice of theſe Church-Mountebanks. How eaſie
is it to ſay [If we be not all of one Religion, it
will cheriſh contention, bring Miniſters into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
ſcandalize the weak, harden the enemies,
raiſe factions, ſhake the peace of Kingdoms] and
more ſuch like: How eaſie is it to ſay [If men be
tolerated to break the Laws, and gather Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
ſouls will be poyſoned, error propagated,
Chriſtianity diſgraced, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] When in the mean
time 1. Their courſe tendeth not at all to make
men of one Religion: 2. Nay, they plead for that
which is the great divider: where do fire and
baniſhment or priſons cauſe true faith, or make
men think that their perſecutors are in the right?
Is there any thing in the nature of the thing ſo to
perſwade men? nay what more inclineth men to
think that other mens opinions are falſe, than to
feel that their practice is hurtful? All will ſay, <hi>Do
men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thiſtles? By
their fruit they may be known.</hi> If it be forcing ſome
to diſſemble, and deſtroying the reſt, that they
mean, by [making men of one religion] thus ſaith
<hi>Tertullian</hi> did the Heathen perſecutors: <hi>Solitudinem
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55406:82"/>
faciunt &amp; pacem vocant.</hi> But 1. This will not do:
<hi>France, Ireland, Belgia,</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>England</hi>
cryed it in vain: God will ſtill have ſome that ſhall
be ſeriouſly religious, and ſhall fear him more than
man, and not ſell their ſouls to ſave their bodies:
If you have no hope of making men to be of <hi>one
Religion,</hi> but by making them to be of <hi>no Religion</hi>
(as all are that fear not God more than man)
your hopes are vain as well as wicked. There is
ſo full teſtimony given to the world, that there is
<hi>a God and a life to come,</hi> that ſtill ſome men <hi>will
believe</hi> it, and will think whither they muſt go
next, and therefore will not forſake their religion
through fear, ſeeing that is to forſake their God,
and their ſalvation.</p>
               <p>2. And if you could accompliſh it, it were
not worth your labour: If all the Princes on earth
ſhould force their ſubjects to be of <hi>One Religion,</hi>
it would be <hi>their own:</hi> And then five parts of ſix
would be Heathens and Mahometans, and of the
ſixth part a third or fourth would be Papiſts, and
above two parts of the other three would have
foul corruptions, for which they would be ſharply
cenſured by the reſt. Is it not better that in <hi>Congo,
China, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſtianity is tolerated, than that they
had all continued of their <hi>One Religion?</hi> And ſo is
it that the <hi>Turks</hi> do tolerate the <hi>Greeks</hi> and other
Chriſtians. And I think if <hi>Spain</hi> had both Papiſts
and Proteſtants, it were better than to have but
Papiſts only; And if the <hi>Swedes, Danes</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi>
did tolerate the more Reformed, it would do more
good than harm. If Prelacy were baniſhed out of
<hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> many would think it better
to tolerate it.</p>
               <p>§. 12. It is certain, that Unity and Concord is
moſt deſirable; and as certain that theſe over-doers
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55406:83"/>
do deſtroy it, while they lay it upon impoſſible
terms. 1. The moſt <hi>deſirable Concord</hi> is in <hi>common
perfection of wiſdom and holineſs:</hi> But it's certain <hi>it
will not be,</hi> nor are <hi>any</hi> perfect.</p>
               <p>2. The next deſirable Concord is in ſuch high
degrees of Wiſdom and Goodneſs, as that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
be <hi>ſtrong and excellent,</hi> and err not notably in
a word, ceremony or mode: But it is certain, this
is not to be expected.</p>
               <p>3. The next degree deſirable is, that all ſhould
be ſo far <hi>teachable</hi> and <hi>perſwadeable,</hi> as to yield to
every truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lawful impoſition, when reaſon
is ſet before them: But it is certain this is not
to be expected: And he that denyeth it, knoweth
not man.</p>
               <p>§. 13. A Peace-maker therefore muſt underſtand
1. What Concord <hi>is already</hi> among <hi>all Chriſtians,</hi> and
what is of neceſſity to Communion with the Church
univerſal: 2. And what more is neceſſary to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in a particular Church. 3. And what more
is neceſſary to the Aſſociation and Concord of ſuch
particular Churches: 4. And what is neceſſary only
to <hi>eminency, praiſe</hi> and <hi>ſpecial</hi> encouragement: 5. And
what is neceſſary to meer humane neighbourhood
and converſe.</p>
               <p>And accordingly he ſhould ſtudy, 1. How all men
may be uſed like men, and all peaceable men as
peaceable: 2. How all Chriſtians may be uſed as
Chriſtians: 3. How all the members of particular
Churches may hold ſuch Concord as the ends of
their ſociety require: 4. How all ſuch Churches
may keep ſuch Love and Correſpondency as tendeth
to the good of all. 5. And how eminent Chriſtians
may be uſed according to their worth: 6. And how
hereſie and ſin may be ſuppreſſed without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
any of theſe ends.</p>

§. 14. If once <hi>unneceſſary terms</hi> of Unity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
be taken for <hi>neceſſary,</hi> even multitudes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
well meaning men, will hence bend all their
ſtrength to do miſchief: They will think that all
Peace-makers muſt promote theſe terms: and all
muſt be uſed as Schiſmaticks that are againſt them:
and ſo all the fore-mentioned accuſations, cruelties
and perſecutions will (alas) go for the work even
of Peace-makers: And ſo the common engine of
Church-diviſion and perſecution and diſcord, will
be preaching and writing againſt Schiſm, and crying
up peace, and aggravating diſſent as a heinous
crime, even when it is a duty, and making all odious
as far as they can that are not of their mind.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>In general, What are the true and only terms of
Church-Vnion and Concord, and what not?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. THE true works of a Peace-maker
conſiſteth, 1. In finding out the
true and neceſſary terms of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
and diſcerning the evil and
inſufficiency of the falſe terms: 2. In finding out
the meet and neceſſary Inſtruments and helps: 3. In
diſcovering the Hinderances and Enemies: and 4. In
faithful proſecuting his known duty. And the firſt
is not the leaſt.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Having proved what Chriſt himſelf hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
done in inſtituting the terms of Unity and
Concord, I ſhall here further ſhew, I. In General
what theſe Terms are and muſt be, and what not.
II. What Texts of Scripture deſcribe them.
III. Particularly and diſtinctly what they are.
IV. I ſhall anſwer ſome of the objections that are
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55406:85"/>
made againſt them. And V. The falſe Terms ſhall
be detected and confuted in the third Part.</p>
               <p>§. 3. I. In General, the terms of Catholick Unity
and Concord, neceſſary to all Chriſtians muſt be and
are, I. Only things Great and needful, II. Only
things True and Sure; III. Only things plain and
intelligible: IV. Only things of Gods inſtitution
or authority. V. And but <hi>Few</hi> and not <hi>very many</hi>
as to matter of Knowledge and belief.</p>
               <p>§. 4. If they were not ſuch, mans known inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
would make them unfit to be any means of
the intended end: And this is fully proved by all
the foregoing proofs of unavoidable diverſity that
will be found in men: And I will here add yet
more profs that Concord is ſo very difficult as that
it will not be had on any ſtricter terms: and when
all is done it will be very imperfect in this life.</p>
               <p>§. 5. The great difficulty of Concord doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thus appear.</p>
               <p>1. It cannot be expected but that the greateſt
part of men will be of <hi>low capacity,</hi> and partial, and
<hi>ignorant,</hi> and therefore uncapable of underſtanding
higher terms than theſe.</p>
               <p>2. The Greater number, or too many will <hi>be
bad,</hi> though their profeſt Religion be <hi>Good:</hi> And
<hi>bad men</hi> will be ſtill ſelf-troublers, and troublers of
others: There is no Peace ſaith my God to the
wicked: They are like the troubled Sea that caſteth
up mire and dirt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46. Piety and true Concord
muſt grow together. There will be in Chriſts
Kingdom things that offend and men that work ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity:
There will be Paſtors and people that are
Worldly, Covetous, Lovers of themſelves, Lovers
of pleaſures more than of God, proud, boaſters,
haters of thoſe that are good, ſtriving who ſhall
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55406:85"/>
be greateſt: And theſe will be unfit materials in the
building, as to full unity, peace and concord.</p>
               <p>3. Yea there will be Satans Souldiers and bitter
enemies to true piety in the Miniſtry and all ranks of
men: In the ſame houſhold as he that was born af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the fleſh did perſecute him that was born after
the Spirit, even ſo, ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> is it now; and ſo
it will be. The firſt born man was a murderer of
his own brother, becauſe his works were evil and
his brothers good.</p>
               <p>4. And Chriſt ſaith that the <hi>Rich ſhall hardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into heaven;</hi> And yet we ſee the <hi>Rich</hi> will be the
<hi>Rulers:</hi> It hath been ſo and will be ſo, and muſt be
ſo. And if they are as uſually <hi>bad</hi> as Chriſt and his
Apoſtles tell us, then bad men will rule: And <hi>operari
ſequitur eſſe:</hi> As men <hi>are,</hi> they will <hi>do:</hi> Great men
will have worldly ſelfiſh intereſts clean contrary to
the intereſt of Chriſt and his doctrine: And how
great influence Rulers have as to concord or diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is eaſily known.</p>
               <p>5. And hitherto the Paſtors of the Churches have
been, alas, ſuch as <hi>Gregory Nazianzen, Iſidore Peluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ota</hi>
and many others have deſcribed (to ſay nothing
of <hi>Gildas</hi> or <hi>Salvian,</hi> or the ſad Characters that moſt
parties give of one another, and the accuſations that
Afflicters bring againſt thoſe whom they afflict, and
which the ſufferers give of them.) If <hi>Paul</hi> then
muſt ſay, <hi>All ſeek their own,</hi> and not the <hi>things that
are Jeſus Chriſts,</hi> no wonder if it be ſo now; and
that even General Councils have ſadly anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
one another, and thouſands of Biſhops or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
have been curſed from Chriſt by the reſt.
And how much power proud turbulent ignorant
and worldly Paſtors have to hinder the Churches
Concord, hath been found by too long and ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:55406:86"/>
6. And mans nature is <hi>ſenſual</hi> and <hi>ſlothful,</hi> and it
will coſt ſo dear, by long and hard ſtudy to be <hi>wiſe
indeed,</hi> and by mortification and ſelf-denyal to be
truly <hi>good,</hi> that few are likely to attain it.</p>
               <p>7. And education, company, friends, and falſe
writers and teachers will ſtill cheriſh faction and
diſcord in the world.</p>
               <p>8. And diſtance and diſacquaintance will leave
open mens ears to back-biters, ſlanderers and falſe
reports. Men will think it uncharitable not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
ſuch, <hi>e. g.</hi> as Learned Hiſtorians, Doctors and
their Paſtors are.</p>
               <p>9. And the wars and croſs-intereſts of Princes
and States have hitherto by jealouſies fomented di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
in the Church.</p>
               <p>10. And the falſe wayes and termes of Concord
will be kept up in oppoſition to the true, and will
not be the leaſt impediment.</p>
               <p>11. And Laſtly, Even the Wiſe and Good that
muſt be the Peace-makers, are ſuch but in part, and
have in them too much of the folly, errour and ſin
of others, which will hinder their work, yea and
make them alſo troublers of themſelves and others.</p>
               <p>§. 6. Theſe being not doubtful conjectures but
certain Prognoſticks, the remedy muſt be ſuited to
the Patients capacity.</p>
               <p>And I. Neceſſary Eſſentials all Chriſtians are and
muſt be agreed in: But unneceſſary things ſuch as
I have deſcribed are never like to be commonly
united in, nor is it neceſſary that they ſhould: <hi>It
ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt</hi> and to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to
impoſe nothing on the Church, but <hi>Neceſſary things,
Act.</hi> 15. It was the deceivers and falſe Teachers
which would have done otherwiſe: Againſt whom
St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth copiouſly and zealouſly diſpute, in
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55406:86"/>
his Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans, Corinthians, Galatians,
Coloſſians,</hi> &amp;c. To pretend that as neceſſary which
is not ſo, or to command that as neceſſary and
cauſeleſly to make it neceſſary which is not ſo in it
ſelf, and which we may eaſily know will never be ſo
judged of, nor received by all, is but to rack and
tear the Church, and do miſchief for an unneceſſary
thing.</p>
               <p>§. 7. II. As it is certain that nothing but <hi>Truth</hi>
can be fit matter for the Churches Concord, ſo it
muſt be <hi>certain Truth:</hi> that is, not only ſuch as
whoever believeth is not deceived, but ſuch as may
be <hi>diſcerned by aſcertaining Evidence</hi> by all ſober
willing Chriſtians; Not only ſuch as the <hi>Learned</hi>
may be ſure of, but <hi>all</hi> that muſt take it as certain
in their profeſſion; For no man muſt make a falſe
profeſſion, and ſay he is certain when he is not.
Not that all that may be called <hi>certainty</hi> muſt needs
exclude all doubting; but that the Aſſent be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
againſt ſuch doubting: Nor do I mean that
it muſt be <hi>certain</hi> by <hi>natural evidence;</hi> It is enough
if it be ſo by Divine Revelation: And if any be ſo
weak that they perceive not <hi>ſome neceſſary revealed
truth</hi> to be <hi>certainly</hi> ſo revealed, they muſt be put
on no more than to ſay, [<hi>I do, though not with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
believe it.</hi>] And no probability muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
on mens profeſſion, when there is notable
danger on the contrary ſide, if they ſhould miſtake.</p>
               <p>§. 8. III. Therefore the terms of Union muſt be
only things <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>intelligible</hi> to all <hi>ſober wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
minds:</hi> For all perſons of dull wits and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
buſineſs cannot attain ſuch certainty or
firm belief of things which they cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd:
Belief without underſtanding is but a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55406:87"/>
dead notion or name, or rather a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>§. 9. As for the Popiſh doctrine of <hi>Implicite faith,</hi>
it is no true belief of any thing but that <hi>General ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
in which they ſay the <hi>particulars</hi> are implicitely
contained. We muſt all believe implicitely in God,
that is, That <hi>whatever God revealeth is true:</hi> But he
that believeth no more but this, is falſly ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>other things;</hi> For he may believe this, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
underſtood that God revealed any thing in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular:
He that never heard of <hi>Chriſt</hi> or the <hi>reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
may believe that all Gods <hi>revelations</hi> are true:
But to call this, an <hi>Implicite belief of Chriſt and the
Reſurrection,</hi> is but to equivocate, and call that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
a thing,</hi> which is no believing of it: If they
hold that <hi>to believe that the Church</hi> (that is, the Pope
and his Councils) is <hi>infallible in acquainting us with
matter of faith</hi>] is all that is neceſſary to ſalvation,
though they know not what the particulars are, let
them ſay ſo plainly, and not call this a believing of
<hi>other things,</hi> or a believing in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or his
<hi>Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 10. IV. And it is only things of <hi>Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
that can be the neceſſary terms of univerſal
Unity or Concord, ſuppoſing the neceſſary <hi>media</hi>
of bringing them to mens notice: Had we lived
in the time and place where Chriſt and his Apoſtles
did preach and work their Miracles, it had been
one thing to determine what were then preached
as the neceſſary articles of faith, and another
thing, how we come to hear, know and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
them: It muſt have been by our ears, eyes
and intellects, that we knew and perceived what
was ſaid and done. And ſo now ſtanding at the
diſtance of many ages, certain hiſtory, or tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55406:87"/>
muſt bring that to our notice, which our eyes
and ears would then have brought to it: But <hi>ſtill</hi>
the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>terms</hi> of <hi>Vnion</hi> are no leſs Divine,
whatever means do help us to underſtand them:
And as for them that will make humane terms
ſeem neceſſary to <hi>Catholick Vnion</hi> or <hi>Communion,</hi>
that they deceive themſelves and others and ſhall
never attain the end, but tear the Church by ſuch
ill engines, is eaſily thus proved.</p>
               <p>§. 11. The Catholick Church never did or will
agree what <hi>humane power it is</hi> to whom this work
belongeth: whether it be a Pope or Council, or
ſome univerſal Monarch, or a Council of Princes
by agreement; Never ſuch a thing was, or will be.
Popes and Councils were but in one Empire, the
chief Eccleſiaſtical Governours under the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
Civil Government; and not over the world;
nor was there ever ſuch a thing as a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of all the Chriſtian world, but only General as
to one Empire: Nor did any of theſe Councils
take on them to make Conſtitutive terms of the
Univerſal Church or its Union; but only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
declare and expound them, and to make
ſubordinate governing Canons. And if they <hi>had
undertaken</hi> more, no wiſe man can imagine that all
Chriſtians will therefore confeſs the <hi>right</hi> of ſuch a
claim, and ſo ſubmit to it. The proof of their
authority will be ſo obſcure, that as ſuch as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſee it, ſo there will be ſo many no wiſer than
I am, as that the excluſion of all Chriſtians that are
but of our ſize will never ſtand with Catholick
Unity. And if it were poſſible to ſatisfie all the
preſent age, 1. that ſome have ſuch authority from
God, 2. and who they are, 3. and how far it extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
yet ſtill ſuch will ſucceed them in whom the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
and diſſent will be revived. What need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55406:88"/>
there more proof than <hi>mans incapacity</hi> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of ſo many Generations? All Chriſtians agree
in Chriſtianity: All Chriſtians never agreed on any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
terms of Unity; Pope, Council, or Monarch.
One Empire hath pretended to agree in Councils, but
have been ſo far from it, as that they have been the
occaſion of their greateſt diſagreements; witneſs
even the Great ones, <hi>Conſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. &amp; 2. <hi>Calce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
which ſome bleſſed and ſome curſed for many
generations after; and that at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> that
made the decree <hi>de tribus capitulis</hi> divided even the
Roman Church ſo far as that for one hundred years
a great part of it renounced the Roman Biſhop, and
ſet up another Patriarch againſt him. And <hi>Abaſſia</hi>
and other extra-imperial Churches were never under
the Roman or Imperial Government.</p>
               <p>§. 12. V. And that the terms of Catholick unity
muſt not be very <hi>many things</hi> is evident from the
foreſaid Incapacity of the moſt to comprehend ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things; and alſo from the confeſſion of almoſt
all ſorts of Chriſtians: Even the Papiſts who have
advanced the Chriſtian Religion to the monſtrous
magnitude of their vaſt and numerous Decrees of
Councils are forced yet to make them almoſt all
unneceſſary under the name of <hi>Implicite belief,</hi> and do
narrow the neceſſary articles
of the Chriſtian faith almoſt
to an annihilation,<note place="margin">Of this I have written at large in my laſt Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Johnſon, Which is the true Church;</hi> or for our Churches perpetual Viſibility.</note> while they
agree not whether it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
explicitely to believe
the life, death, reſurrection,
mediation, judgement, yea
or being of Chriſt himſelf, or any more than that
there is a God and an Infallible Church: Of which
ſee <hi>Franciſc. de ſancta Clara</hi> his <hi>Deus, Natura, Gratia,</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:55406:88"/>
And thoſe of our ſelves that eject Miniſters and
Chriſtians for diſſenting from ſome of their own
impoſitions, are yet contented to admit ſuch as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to themſelves, upon very low terms of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
knowledge, to the Sacraments and Communion
of the Church. And indeed he knoweth not man,
who knoweth not, that univerſal unity and concord
will never be had upon the terms of Many, dark,
uncertain, humane, or unneceſſary things, but only
on the terms of things <hi>Few, ſure, plain, divine</hi> and

in the words of the Sacred Scriptures.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. I Have before proved, that Chriſt inſtituted
the terms of Catholick Unity in Scripture,
and have cited ſome texts on the by. It will not

them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of

               <p>Here Chriſt himſelf ſendeth his meſſengers, and
preſcribeth them their work, and maketh the terms
of Baptiſm the Entering and Conſtitutive terms of
his Church which they were to gather: But the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring

               <p>§. 5. Chriſt himſelf the Law giver and Judge doth
oft in his explications lay his acceptance of men on
a <hi>few great, plain, ſure neceſſary things:</hi> He ſummeth
up the whole Law into the two great Commands,
the <hi>firſt and the ſecond like unto it,</hi> even the <hi>Love of
God and Man:</hi> and when he tells one that had lived
<hi>ſoberly and juſtly,</hi> that yet <hi>he lacked one thing,</hi>
Luke 18. it is but this plain great neceſſary duty, to
prefer his heavenly reward, and hopes, and Chriſt
to bring him to it, before his wealth and proſperity
on earth: This was not a great Volume of hard opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
but one plain and neceſſary duty, not hard to
know, but hard to an unbelieving worldly heart to
be willing to do. So in his great Sermon on the
Mount, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. it is not many dark opinions or
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55406:90"/>
ſmall ceremonious practices that he pronounceth
<hi>bleſſedneſs</hi> on, but the <hi>pure in heart,</hi> the <hi>poor in ſpirit,</hi>
the <hi>merciful,</hi> the <hi>peace-makers,</hi> and ſuch as <hi>ſuffer for
righteouſneſs ſake:</hi> And in all his moſt excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
and Prayers, <hi>John</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.
<hi>&amp;</hi> 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. what have you but our common
Catechiſm truths? Which of the controverſies of
contenders, or what nice opinions are there decided
or propounded?</p>
               <p>Nay, he himſelf oft diſtinguiſhing tells men, that
<hi>God will have mercy</hi> and not <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> and reproveth
the Phariſees that were ſtrict in <hi>tything mint, anniſe
and cummin,</hi> and neglected the <hi>great matters of the
Law, Mercy, truth and juſtice,</hi> and that troubled the
Church with their ceremonies, and <hi>worſhipped God in
vain with their traditions, teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men,</hi> Matth. 15.</p>
               <p>Yea, when he deſcribeth the Judgement to come,
it is not many <hi>hard opinions</hi> that he layeth life and
death on, but on <hi>loving, relieving, viſiting his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
yea, the <hi>leaſt of his members,</hi> yea, <hi>himſelf in
them:</hi> And he condemneth thoſe that do it not even
<hi>to the leaſt:</hi> What then ſhall they ſuffer, that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
and anathematize Kings and Kingdoms, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticate
great part of the Church of Chriſt; yea,
the Pope and his Councils of military Biſhops that
have riſen to their greatneſs, and conquered the
Chriſtian Nations by this art of Anathematizing or
curſing Kings and Subjects from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>§. 6. We find Chriſt preaching alſo to divers ſingle
perſons, as to <hi>Nathaneal,</hi> to the <hi>Samaritan woman,
John</hi> 4. to the <hi>blind man, John</hi> 9. to the <hi>Canaanitiſh
woman</hi> and others; and he never went beyond theſe
<hi>few, plain, divine</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> terms.</p>
               <p>§. 7. And he ſent out his diſciples to preach but
the <hi>ſame doctrine</hi> that he had done; even to <hi>Repent
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55406:90"/>
and believe</hi> the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> and <hi>Devils were ſubject to them</hi>
that preached this ſhort plain truth; who I fear
are the <hi>Maſters</hi> of many that ſpin a finer web. And
<hi>John Baptiſt</hi> went but the ſame way: And among
the counſels which he gave to the many ſorts that
flocked to him, ſee whether any of our Engines of
heretication and diviſion and ſilencing are to be
found. All the four Goſpels are ſtrangers to ſuch
things.</p>
               <p>§. 8. And the very Controverſal Epiſtles of
St. <hi>Paul</hi> that were written to confute Seducers,
were written by the ſame ſpirit, and go the ſame
way. The ſumm of all is, <hi>Repentance towards God,
and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> The doctrine
of <hi>faith in Chriſt,</hi> and the abrogation of the <hi>burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Ceremonious Jewiſh Law,</hi> and that the <hi>Gentiles

                  </gap>orld, following the ſpirit, and mortifying the luſts
of the fleſh, living a holy and heavenly life in love
and unity and peace. And whereas pride and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
then began the dividing way, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Chriſtians for tolerable differences, he oft and
plainly reproveth and confuteth this: But moſt fully
and purpoſely to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Chap. 14. &amp; 15. <hi>Him
that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful
diſputations</hi> (or not to judge his doubtful thoughts)
inſtancing in differences about <hi>meats and dayes; Let
not him that eateth, deſpiſe him that eateth not; and let
not him which eateth not, judge him that eateth; for
God hath received him: Who art thou that judgeſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans ſervant? to his own maſter he ſtandeth or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth:
Yea, he ſhall be holden up, for God is able to make
him ſtand. Let every man be fully perſwaded</hi> (or <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured)
in his own mind: He that regardeth a day, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55406:91"/>
it to the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But why doſt thou judge thy
brother? or why doſt thou ſet at naught thy brother?
For we ſhall all ſtand before the judgement-ſeat of
Chriſt. Let us not therefore judge one another any
more? but judge this rather that no man put a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
block in his brothers way—If thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be grieved with thy meat, now walkeſt thou not
charitably: Deſtroy not him with thy meat for whom
Chriſt dyed.—For the Kingdom of God is not meat
and drink, but righteouſneſs and peace and joy in the
Holy Ghoſt. For he that in theſe things ſerveth Chriſt,
is acceptable to God and approved of men. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
follow after the things that make for peace, and
things wherewith one may edifie another. For meat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
not the work of God. All things indeed are pure,
but it is evil for that man that eateth with offence. I
is good neither to eat fleſh, or drink wine, nor any thing
whereby thy brother ſtumbleth or is offended or ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

faith is ſin.</hi> Ch. 15. <hi>We then that are ſtrong ought to
bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to pleaſe our
ſelves: Let every one of us pleaſe his neighbour for his
good to edification. For even Chriſt pleaſed not himſelf,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Now the God of patience and conſolation grant you
to be like-minded one towards another according to Chriſt
Jeſus: That ye may with one mind and one mouth glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
God even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 9. I know not what can be ſpoken more plain
and home to the caſe in hand, and the humane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
impoſitions which have ſo many ages torn
the Churches of Chriſt: And yet all this is nothing
to the Impoſers. The different expoſition of this
one part of Scripture hath had a great hand in the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55406:91"/>
calamitous diſtractions, ſilencings, impriſonments,
ſcatterings that have been exerciſed in many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the world. The controverſie lyeth here:
The One ſide ſay, that <hi>All this was ſpoken by St.</hi> Paul
<hi>only of ſuch things indifferent as the Church had not ſetled
by any Law, and would not ſo ſettle; but that it's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to ſuch as the Church either hath or will ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:</hi>
This opinion hath carried it in <hi>England</hi> and
other Nations of the world. Being once commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
to plead this cauſe by his Majeſty among
others, I then preſumed to ſay, 1. <hi>That St.</hi> Paul <hi>here
writeth not only to the laity,</hi> but to all the Roman
Church? That therefore he writeth (as Chriſt,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. to the Angels of the ſeven Churches,)
to the Rulers of the Church as well as to the People.
2. And therefore he forbiddeth thoſe Rulers what
he forbiddeth others; and ſo forbiddeth them the
impoſing of any thing contrary to this his full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.
3. Yea himſelf was an Apoſtle and
a Church-Governor of as great authority as thoſe
that he wrote to; And theſe his words ſignified his
own judgement and what he would do himſelf.
Yea they were as <hi>good a Law,</hi> as any the <hi>Romans</hi>
could make that he wrote to. Therefore when an
Apoſtle by the Spirit of God, ſhall write thus plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and peremptorily to Prieſts and people thus to
tolerate and receive each other, he that now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth
it with an [<hi>except the Church otherwiſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi>]
maketh this the ſence [<hi>I do by all theſe great
reaſons charge and perſwade you not to judge, deſpiſe or
reject one another unleſs you decree to do it; or not to
make ſuch rejecting Laws, unleſs you make them.</hi>] And
the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh not in the holy Scriptures
at this rate.</p>
               <p>§. 10. Yea I prove from the arguments uſed by
St. <hi>Paul</hi> that he extended his ſpeech to the Clergy
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55406:92"/>
or Rulers as well as to the people, and ſo <hi>forbad
them making ſuch Laws:</hi> (And indeed the knack of
making <hi>Church-Laws,</hi> (without the Holy Ghoſt in
Apoſtolick perſons) was not as then learnt and
uſed by the Churches): 1. Becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from Univerſal reaſons: 2. and from Moral and
neceſſary arguments, and 3. Speaketh by the Spirit
and Apoſtolical Authority.</p>
               <p>§. 11. I. His reaſons touch not only ſome ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
perſons and caſe, but the caſe of all Churches
in all Ages: He argueth from the difference between
well-meaning Chriſtians as <hi>Weak</hi> and <hi>Strong,</hi> as
<hi>doubting</hi> and as <hi>aſſured,</hi> as <hi>miſtaken</hi> and as in <hi>the right,</hi>
as in danger of being <hi>damned if they act</hi> doubtingly,
and of <hi>ſtumbling</hi> and <hi>being offended, &amp;c.</hi> Now ſuch

                  </gap> Chriſtians in ſuch matters ever have
been, and ever will be, and ſo the reaſon from their
caſe and neceſſity will hold in all Countreys and
Ages to the end.</p>
               <p>§. 12. II. And many great and preſſing Moral
reaſons that all Chriſtians are bound by are
here heaped up. 1. One is from Chriſtian Love
to brethren. 2. Another from humane Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
to the weak. 3. Another is from Gods
own example, who receiveth ſuch, whom therefore
we muſt not reject. 4. Another is from Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
to judge; 5. and another from his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
in his own ſervants. 6. Another is from
our having no ſuch judging power in ſuch caſes.
7. Another is from Gods Love and mercy that will
uphold ſuch. 8. Another is becauſe what men do
as to pleaſe God, muſt not be condemned without
neceſſity, but a holy intention cheriſhed, ſo it be
not in forbidden things. 9. Another is that men
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55406:92"/>
muſt not go againſt Conſcience in indifferent
things. 10. Another is from Chriſts dreadful
judgement which is near, and which we our ſelves
muſt undergo, and muſt be that final decider of
many things which here will not be fully decided.
11. Another is from the ſin of laying ſtumbling-blocks
and occaſions of offence. 12. Another is
from the danger of croſſing the ends of the death
of Chriſt, deſtroying ſouls for whom he dyed.
13. Another is that it will make our <hi>good to be ill
ſpoken of.</hi> 14. Another is that the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi>
or the Conſtitution of Chriſtianity and the Church
lyeth in no ſuch matters, but in <hi>righteouſneſs and peace
and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 15. And another that
<hi>Chriſt is pleaſed</hi> in this without the other, and <hi>God
accepteth</hi> ſuch. 16. Another is that ſuch <hi>are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of men,</hi> that is, This righteouſneſs, peace and
holy joy without agreement in ſuch Ceremonies and
by-matters, beareth its own teſtimony for appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
to the judgement of all impartial men; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
and Chriſtianity teach us to love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
ſuch. 17. Another is from our common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to <hi>live in peace with all.</hi> 18. Another is
from our obligation to <hi>do all</hi> to the <hi>edifying of one
another.</hi> 19. Another is becauſe Gods <hi>work</hi> elſe is
<hi>deſtroyed by us.</hi> 20. And our own lawful acts are
turned into <hi>ſin</hi> when they <hi>hurt another.</hi> 21. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the obligation that lyeth on us to deny
our <hi>own liberty in meat, wine,</hi> &amp;c. to avoid the hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of another that is weak. 22. Another is from
the <hi>damnation</hi> of ſuch as are driven or drawn to act
doubtingly. 23. Another is from the ſpecial duty
and mercy of the ſtrong that ſhould bear the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of the weak. 24. Another is from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
duty of <hi>pleaſing others for their good and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
25. Another is from the <hi>example of Chriſt</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:55406:93"/>
himſelf that <hi>pleaſed not himſelf.</hi> 26. Another is
from <hi>Gods patience</hi> to us. 27. Another is from
our great <hi>obligation</hi> to imitate Chriſt. 28. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becauſe indeed this is the true way <hi>to Love</hi>
and <hi>unity,</hi> that <hi>with one mind and one mouth we may
glorifie God,</hi> while we lay not our concord on impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
terms. 29. Another is in the concluding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
becauſe Chriſt <hi>receiveth us</hi> and it is to <hi>Gods
Glory:</hi> therefore we muſt thus receive each other.
If all theſe moral arguments ſignifie no more than
this [<hi>Receive and tolerate ſuch till you make Laws
againſt it</hi>] I cannot underſtand the argumentations
of God or holy men.</p>
               <p>§. 13. III. And to conclude, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake by the
Holy Ghoſt and by Divine authority himſelf, and
his words recorded are part of Chriſts Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited
by the Spirit; and no man that cometh after
him or to whom he wrote, had power to contradict
or obliterate it. All this methinks ſhould ſatisfie
men of the meaning of ſo full a deciſion of an eaſie
caſe about things indifferent, which it's ſtrange that
ſo many yet for nothing do oppoſe: And that the
authority of an Apoſtle in Sacred Scripture, the
peace of the Church, and the ſouls and peace of all
diſſenters and doubting perſons, ſhould ſeem ſo
contemptible to them, as not to weigh down their
humour and domineering will, in an unneceſſary and
indifferent thing? But it is the nature of <hi>ſin,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>Pride,</hi> to be <hi>unreaſonable</hi> and <hi>unpeaceable,</hi> and
the troubler of the ſoul, the Church, the world.</p>
               <p>§. 14. The ſame Apoſtle in the Epiſtles to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi>
1. c. 1. <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> importuneth them to <hi>peace
and unity,</hi> and ſharply reprehendeth their <hi>diviſions</hi>
(1. <hi>c.</hi> 3.) He deſireth them to be <hi>perfectly conjoyned in
the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgement.</hi> But what
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55406:93"/>
are the terms and means of ſuch a union? Is it that
they all unite in <hi>Cephas (Peter)</hi> or in <hi>One Patriarch</hi>
or <hi>Pope?</hi> Or that they adhere to men with greater
eſtimation? No, but contrary. It is this that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
them, while one was for <hi>Paul,</hi> and another for
<hi>Apollos,</hi> and another for <hi>Cephas:</hi> He calls them to
unite <hi>in Chriſt alone,</hi> and not to think of men above
that which is written, nor to be puffed up for one
againſt another, nor to take any Paſtors as the <hi>Lords
of their faith,</hi> but as <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt and ſtewards of
his myſteries, given for their good, and helpers of their
joy and edification:</hi> c. 3. &amp; 4. He tells them that
<hi>neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that
watereth, but God that giveth the increaſe: and he that
planteth and he that watereth are one:</hi> c. 3. v. 7, 8, 9.
And in caſe of eating things offered to Idols, as to
ſo much as was lawful in it ſelf, he chargeth them
to deny their liberty when it will be a ſtumbling-block
to the weak, and tells them that he <hi>will never
eat fleſh while the world ſtandeth, if it make his brother
to offend:</hi> c. 8. 13. Telling them that when <hi>they ſin
ſo againſt the brethren and wound their weak Conſcience,
they ſin againſt Chriſt;</hi> v. 12. And he himſelf would
labour for his bread, and not take a lawful and due
maintenance from them, when he ſaw it would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his ſucceſs, <hi>c.</hi> 9. and <hi>would rather dye, than any
ſhould make void this his glorying,</hi> v. 15. <hi>To the Jews
he became as a Jew, to gain the Jews, and to the weak
he became as weak to gain them, and was made all things
to all men that he might by all means ſave ſome,</hi> v. 20,
21, 22, 23. His rule is, <hi>Give no offence to Jews, or
Greeks or to the Church of God: even as I pleaſe all
men in all things, not ſeeking my own profit, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of many that they may be ſaved,</hi> c. 10. v. 32, 33.
Their diviſions at the Communion he reproveth,
<hi>ch.</hi> 11. not cauſed by ceremonious impoſitions, but
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55406:94"/>
their own partiality and ſelfiſhneſs. The great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
among Chriſtians in gifts and ſtrength he
largely openeth, <hi>c.</hi> 12. to ſhew them that all this
muſt ſtand with unity, and that yet there muſt be
no <hi>Schiſm in the body,</hi> but the <hi>members</hi> muſt have the
<hi>ſame care one of another,</hi> v. 25. yea the <hi>leſs comely
parts</hi> muſt have the <hi>more care,</hi> v. 23, 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> ch. 15. 1, 2, 3. <hi>he giveth us this ſum of the
Goſpel which he preached</hi> [Moreover brethren I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to you the Gospel which I preached, which alſo
you have received, and wherein ye ſtand, by which alſo
ye are ſaved if ye hold faſt what I preached, to you,
unleſs you believed in vain: (<hi>Are not here the terms of
Chriſtian unity and ſalvation?</hi>) For I delivered to
you firſt of all that which I alſo received, how that
Chriſt dyed for our ſins, according to the Scriptures,
and that he was buried and roſe again the third day ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Scriptures, and was ſeen, <hi>&amp;c. whence our
reſurrection is proved. Here is nothing but the
common articles of the Creed; and this was the
Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed St. <hi>Paul</hi> is an Anathematizer too, but it is
not of men that differ about words or humane forms,
but of all them that <hi>love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
1 Cor. 16. 22.</p>
               <p>§. 15. <hi>The ſame Apoſtle ſharply reprehendeth the
faults of the</hi> Galatians; <hi>But what is it for? not for
differing about things unneceſſary, but for</hi> making
ſuch neceſſary that were not: <hi>For which he wiſheth
thoſe</hi> cut off that troubled them. <hi>And he concludeth
all with this uniting true Canon,</hi> c. 6. v. 15, 16.
[For in Chriſt Jeſus neither Circumciſion availeth any
thing, nor uncircumciſion, but a New Creature: And
as many as walk according to this Canon (or Rule),

               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Paul <hi>there giveth alſo this rule and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

Can all the Canons in the world attain more

<hi>though his ſubtilty</hi> (<hi>flattering</hi> her with the hopes of

from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt.</hi>] Chriſtianity is
not a ſnare for mens wits, but a way to their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
It is a plain and ſimple thing though moſt
myſterious: 1. It conſiſteth of <hi>ſimplicity of doctrine,</hi>
a few, great plain and neceſſary things, and not of
philoſophical curious ſubtilties, though it forbiddeth
not but encourageth the utmoſt improvement of
reaſon and true learning, eſpecially for method, elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and defence.</p>
               <p>2. It is a <hi>ſimple and ſpiritual worſhip</hi> that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth,
for God is a ſpirit and will be ſo worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in ſpirit and in truth. The Schiſmaticks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>whether in this Mountain or at Jeruſalem</hi>] but
Chriſt rebuked that contention.</p>
               <p>3. And it is a ſimple ſort of Government or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline
that Chriſt hath inſtituted; commanding
him that will be Greateſt to ſeek his preeminence in
being moſt <hi>uſeful</hi> and <hi>humble,</hi> as a <hi>ſervant unto all,</hi> and
not as the Rulers of the world to be called <hi>Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors

                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 2, 3.</note> Not ſmiting with the ſword, but
leaving force to Civil Magiſtrates.</p>
               <p>4. And it is a <hi>ſimple converſation</hi> that Chriſt by his
Law and example hath preſcribed, and his ſervants
uſed: This was <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>rejoycing,</hi> the <hi>teſtimony of his
Conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not in
fleſhly wiſdom, he had his converſation in the world,</hi>
2 Cor. 1. 12. Wiſdom muſt go with innocency:
but it is not worldly carnal wiſdom, but ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth

§. 24. Now this fourfold Chriſtian-ſimplicity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> foreſaw the <hi>Serpent</hi> on pretence of finer wit and
ſubtilty would draw the Church to forſake, till (as
<hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſaith) it became a point of wit to be a
Chriſtian: and this would be (and hath been) the
corruption of the Churches.</p>
               <p>1. The ſimplicity of Doctrine is turned by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
and by other Dictators into multitudes of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
and uncertain notions, to ſay nothing of
the <hi>falſe</hi> ones. In the clear diſcovery of the ſence
and method of the ſacred doctrine, we muſt uſe our
greateſt skill and accurateneſs: But ſalvation, peace
and concord is not to be laid on the fine elucidati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and numerous articles of mens wits.</p>
               <p>2. The ſimplicity of Chriſtian <hi>worſhip</hi> is corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted,
and turned into ſuch pageantry of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and formalities (to paſs by much worſe) that
ſpiritual worſhippers find it exceeding unſuitable to
them, in much of the Chriſtian world.</p>
               <p>3. And how far and dolefully the ſimplicity of
<hi>Church-Government</hi> or <hi>Diſcipline</hi> is loſt, in more
places than the Papal Kingdom, needs not many
words to tell him, that can compare things old and
new.</p>
               <p>4. And what wonder if the honeſt ſimplicity of
<hi>Converſation</hi> periſh with the reſt, and carnal intereſt
and fraud and falſhood, and oppreſſion reign by
carnal wiſdom? Thus hath the ſubtile ſerpent
corrupted the Churches by drawing them from the
ſimplicity that is in Chriſt.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">§. 2. I. Nothing but Baptiſm truly received is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to entrance into the ſtate of Vnion with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Church called Catholick or Vniverſal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 3. I before ſhewed that Chriſt himſelf inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the terms, in the inſtitution of Baptiſm, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:55406:98"/>
that herein all Chriſtians are agreed. The proof of
this is ſo full that nothing but groſs ignorance or
wilfulneſs can make it a matter of doubt. 1. In the
fore-cited inſtitution; 2. In the conſtant judgement
and practice of the Univerſal Church, through all
places and ages ſince the inſtitution of baptiſm to
this day.</p>
               <p>1. That Baptiſm hath been <hi>ſtill uſed,</hi> no one that
knoweth Church hiſtory can deny.</p>
               <p>2. That it hath been uſed <hi>to this end,</hi> to be the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the Church univerſal and viſible Chriſtian
ſtate,</hi> is an undenyable. About Infant baptiſm the
Anabaptiſts doubt; But they alſo deny Infants to be
Chriſtians or Church-members: and we prove to
them both together, by Chriſts command to <hi>Diſciple
Nations baptizing them:</hi> They confeſs that Baptiſm
is the <hi>Church-entrance</hi> as well as we.</p>
               <p>3. And all that <hi>are</hi> truly baptized perſons <hi>are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
or <hi>viſible Church-members,</hi> till they revolt or are
caſt out, all the Chriſtian world from the dayes of
the Apoſtles are agreed.</p>
               <p>4. And as all viſible Covenanters in baptiſm have
been taken for viſible Chriſtians, ſo all <hi>ſincere heart-Covenanters</hi>
have ever been ſuppoſed by the Church
to have by Baptiſm a ſealed and delivered pardon
of ſin, and right to adoption, and everlaſting life.</p>
               <p>All this is ſo evident that it is labour in vain to
prove it, that this hath been the conſtant conſent of
the Chriſtian world, and ſo continueth to this day:
And all that are Chriſtians are ſtill in all Countries
thus baptized.</p>
               <p>§. 4. And if Baptiſm be the common <hi>ſymbol of
Chriſtianity,</hi> and the common <hi>making</hi> of a <hi>viſible
Chriſtian,</hi> then it muſt needs be the <hi>conſtitutive
term</hi> or qualification <hi>ſufficient</hi> to mens <hi>firſt Church-Vnion</hi>
and Communion: which is commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:55406:99"/>
§. 5. If there be any place for contention here, it
muſt be only about the <hi>validity</hi> of mens Received
baptiſm: 1. As to the Miniſter and his part:
2. As to the mode and Ceremonies: 3. As to the
qualification of the receiver or baptized.</p>
               <p>§. 6. I. As to the firſt, though all be not agreed
in point of <hi>Duty who ſhould baptize,</hi> yet ſo great a
number of the Chriſtian world are agreed as to the
<hi>validity</hi> of baptiſm received <hi>de neceſſitate medii,</hi> that
the diſſenters are ſo few as that we need not fear any
great diſagreement hereabout. The very Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts
maintain the validity not only of the Baptiſm
received by hereticks and wicked Prieſts, and ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and ſuſpended Prieſts, but alſo of <hi>Lay-men,</hi> yea
of <hi>women:</hi> But <hi>de officio</hi> all are agreed that where it
is poſſible a lawful Miniſter of Chriſt ſhould do it.
Only a few Anabaptiſts ſay that it muſt be only one
that was baptized at age himſelf: And one or two
Singulariſts (whether in ignorance or deſign I know
not) think it the apteſt medium to unchurch the
Reformed Churches, that they have no <hi>true Prieſts</hi>
for want of due ſucceſſion of ordination, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<hi>no true Sacraments,</hi> becauſe God owneth no
Acts but ſuch as are commiſſioned or appointed by
him; and conſequently no <hi>Covenant;</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
no Covenant-<hi>promiſe</hi> and benefits, of pardon,
juſtification and ſalvation: But this is after at large
to be detected and confuted.</p>
               <p>§. 7. The great difficulty is of the neceſſary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
of the baptized: And there 1. the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts
keep out Infants: But beſides <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and
<hi>Church-memberſhip,</hi> they deny them no offices that
their age is capable of: And they are ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them all by baptiſm as ſoon as they come to the
uſe of due underſtanding: And theſe delayes are
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55406:99"/>
but few in compariſon: And 1. the ancient Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<hi>compelled none</hi> to be baptized, but only recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them that voluntarily came, or were duly
brought. 2. And if men will ſtay without or keep
their Children out, they wrong themſelves and
theirs, but this breaketh no unity of the Chriſtian
Church.</p>
               <p>§. 8. There have been alſo factious perſons that
tye the validity of Baptiſm to their ſects: ſuch as
were ſpecially the Donatiſts, ſuppoſing that their
Prelates had the trueſt call and power; and that all
others were Sectaries or Hereticks, and therefore
their baptiſm null and void and to be iterated: But
though in other arrogancies ſome follow them to
this day, yet few if any in the nulling of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
               <p>§. 9. But a greater and longer ſtir there hath
been about <hi>Creeds</hi> and <hi>profeſſions</hi> required as Teſts to
excuſe men from hereſie. But yet it is to be noted,
that few of them by theſe altered the form of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
but there took up with the ancient Creed,
(the Apoſtles and the <hi>Nicene</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinopolitane</hi>)
and required no more; but only impoſed the reſt
on Biſhops, Prieſts or other afterwards.</p>
               <p>§. 10. And is there now any cauſe of diſcord
here? 1. All Chriſtians have been made ſuch by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
from the Apoſtles dayes till now. Is there any
thing in the world that ever came down to us by
more certain, uniform, conſenting tradition? The
very ſame words of baptiſm which Chriſt did inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
are every where uſed to this day: And if all
ages and Countreys have ſtill baptized perſons as
believers, or Chriſtians, and yet be not agreed what
Chriſtianity is, or what the faith is that baptiſm
requireth, it will be a ſtrange incredible ſhame to
them. But even <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Hillary</hi> that cry out
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55406:100"/>
of their new Creeds, do tell us that in Baptiſm the
old one was ſtill uſed, to which they did appeal.
And though the Greeks and Latines differ about
their <hi>filióque,</hi> and ſome ſmall new clauſes are found
in the Creed that were not in the old Copies which
are now found on Record, they are not ſo factious
or vain, as to nullifie Baptiſm by any of thoſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.
For the Creed is but part of the <hi>Expoſition</hi>
of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and Baptiſm is true Baptiſm, if no other
Creed or words were uſed but it ſelf.</p>
               <p>2. And there are few Chriſtians yet that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
any of the truly ancient Creeds; of which
more anon.</p>
               <p>§. 11. 3. It is true that there are ſome <hi>humane
ceremonies</hi> which ſome Churches adjoin to Baptiſm,
and by others are rejected or omitted. The moſt
of the ancient Churches uſed the <hi>taſting of milk and
honey,</hi> the wearing of <hi>a white garment,</hi> and <hi>Chriſme:</hi>
and now ſome uſe the <hi>tranſient Image</hi> of the <hi>Croſs as
a ſymbol of our engagement to a Crucified Chriſt;</hi> which
others omit as taking it to be ſo far participant of
the nature of a Sacrament of the Covenant of
Grace, as that it is an uſurpation of Chriſts prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
for any men without his inſtitution to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point:
But yet all theſe Churches that differ in
theſe Ceremonies agree that the validity of Baptiſm
dependeth not on them. Whether they be uſed or
omitted, the perſon is nevertheleſs baptized.</p>
               <p>§. 12. <hi>Qu.</hi> But what is it that is neceſſary to the being
and validity of baptiſm?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This was partly anſwered before. 1. It is
neceſſary to the validity of it <hi>in foro Eccleſiae,</hi> that
both the <hi>baptizer</hi> and the <hi>adult baptized</hi> (or the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that is authorized to Covenant for the infant)
do <hi>Profeſs to intend real Baptiſm,</hi> and not to do it in
jeaſt or to other ends: And it is neceſſary to its effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55406:100"/>
to pardon and ſalvation, that this profeſſion
of the Baptized be ſincere, and that he do it from
the heart: And it is neceſſary to free the baptizer
from Gods diſpleaſure that his intention be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</p>
               <p>2. It is neceſſary that the words of Baptiſm be
ſuch as expreſs all the Eſſence of it; ſuch as are
thoſe of Chriſt which all Chriſtians uſe [<hi>I Baptize
thee in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghoſt.</hi>] And that no contradictory words
which nullifie theſe be added.</p>
               <p>3. It is neceſſary to the validity of it in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church, that the adult perſon, (and the
Parent or pro-parent for the Infant) do ſeem or
profeſs to <hi>underſtand all the words of Baptiſm,</hi> ſo far
as is eſſential to it: For <hi>ignorantis non eſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. It is neceſſary to the validity of it to real par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and ſalvation that he not only <hi>ſeem</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it, but really do ſo.</p>
               <p>5. It is accordingly neceſſary that the perſon
<hi>conſent to</hi> all the <hi>eſſence</hi> of the Covenant, that is,
ſeem and profeſs to do it, to the Church, and <hi>really
do it,</hi> to ſatisfie God, and obtain pardon and life
by it.</p>
               <p>6. It is not abſolutely neceſſary to the validity,
that the Creed or any other profeſſion be uſed, by
the baptized, beſides the words themſelves [<hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in God the Father Son and Holy Ghoſt, and give
up my ſelf to him in this Baptiſmal Covenant.</hi>] Becauſe
<hi>underſtanding</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> may be expreſſed by thoſe
words.</p>
               <p>7. But it is uſually neceſſary to the <hi>bene eſſe,</hi> or
the <hi>beſt performance</hi> of baptiſm that the adult per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
(or the Parent of Infants) do in larger words
profeſs his underſtanding, belief and conſent to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55406:101"/>
baptiſm: And it is <hi>beſt</hi> that theſe words be not too
many nor too few, and that they be for the moſt
part one unchanged form; Leſt ignorance or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie
deprave baptiſm by change and variety of
words.</p>
               <p>8. To this end the Churches of Chriſt have ſtill
uſed the <hi>Creed</hi> as the <hi>ſummary form</hi> of <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of
<hi>faith,</hi> As the Lords Prayer is a ſummary form of our
Deſires, and the Decalogue of our rule and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of practice. But becauſe Aſſent is ſuppoſed
to imply <hi>Conſent</hi> to the particulars Aſſented to,
though but Generally profeſſed, therefore the
Church hath more rarely omitted <hi>the Creed</hi> in the
profeſſion of Aſſent, when yet they have accepted
of a more General profeſſion of <hi>Conſent</hi> to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
and promiſe of obedience.</p>
               <p>9. But if the adult do before-hand as a Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
learn the <hi>Creed, Lords Prayer</hi> and <hi>Decalogue,</hi>
and give the Paſtor a ſatisfactory account of his
competent underſtanding of them, then that may be
ſuppoſed, and only a General profeſſion of faith,
conſent and ſubjection, be uſed at <hi>the time</hi> and in
the words of baptiſm. And ſo much of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive
cauſes of baptiſm.</p>
               <p>§ 13. II. <hi rend="margQuotes">Though no more than Baptiſm be
eſſentially <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> becauſe ſo great a work
ſhould be well done; and ignorance and errour
are very common, it is meet that the Church
require [an underſtanding Aſſent to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Articles of the Creed, and an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
Conſent to the Lords Prayer and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue;
and in general to all that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth
to be Gods Word, Belief and ſincere
Obedience.] And therefore that the adult per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
(and Parent of the Infant) be one that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55406:101"/>
hath before been Catechized or examined
herein.</hi>]</p>
               <p>§. 14. Though I conſent to <hi>Ger. Voſſius</hi> and others
that there is no proof at all that the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
made the twelve Articles of the Creed reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively,
every one making one, as ſome have feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and though I deny not what he and Biſhop
<hi>Vſher</hi> and many others ſay, of the two or three Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
being not found in the moſt ancient Copies or
Records, and though I verily conſent to <hi>Parker de
Deſcenſu</hi> and many others, that the <hi>words of Baptiſm</hi>
were the <hi>firſt Creed,</hi> and that the Creed was brought
in by degrees as the Expoſition of the Baptiſmal
profeſſion, and that at firſt it had but <hi>three Articles</hi>
[<hi>I believe in</hi> (<hi>and give up my ſelf to</hi>) <hi>God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son and Holy Ghoſt</hi>], Yet I take the Creed in
the ſence at leaſt to be of neceſſary uſe to the ends
now mentioned, and I think we may ſay ſo much as
is of greateſt antiquity to be <hi>Divine and the word of
God,</hi> and a <hi>ſpecial part</hi> of his word more neceſſary to
be believed than many other parts.</p>
               <p>§. 15. For, 1. Though we receive not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Traditions of <hi>Rome</hi> or any Church that
ſhall be obtruded on us without proof, or as accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Scripture of inſufficiency; yet we never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
that the Apoſtles preaching was Gods Word
before they wrote it, and as well as their writing.
It being eight years after Chriſts Aſcenſion (as is
commonly ſuppoſed) before the firſt part of the
New Teſtament was written by St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and
near an hundred years after his incarnation that the
laſt was written by St. <hi>John;</hi> and only four or five
of the twelve Apoſtles having left us any of their
writings, it were intolerable to deny that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
preaching of them and all the reſt to their
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55406:102"/>
death, was not done by the inſpiration of the ſame
infallible ſpirit as their writing was, and ſo was the
Word of God.</p>
               <p>§. 16. 2. And it is certain that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was then
as common as Chriſtians, and that nothing was
<hi>ſooner</hi> done by the Apoſtles, nor more <hi>conſtantly,</hi> nor
with <hi>greater concord and concent,</hi> than diſcipling per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and baptizing them: For this was the ſumm
of their firſt appointed work, in which Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to be with them to the end.</p>
               <p>§. 17. 3. It is certain that the Apoſtles did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
Baptiſm as wiſely and holily according to
Chriſts will, as any that ever did come after them:
And therefore that they did not take up with mens
bare ſaying of three words [<hi>I believe in God the
Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt</hi>] without underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what they ſaid: All following ages Cathechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
or examined the adult before baptiſm, and to
this day we would take the contrary courſe for an
abuſe: Therefore no doubt but the Apoſtles did it
and appointed it.</p>
               <p>§. 18. 4. And this is plainly implyed in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
when believers are all ſaid to be <hi>inlightned,</hi>
and tranſlated from darkneſs to <hi>light,</hi> and to <hi>know
God and Jeſus Chriſt as being life eternal,</hi> Eph. 1. 18.
Act. 26. 18. Joh. 17. 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to be <hi>wiſe to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi>
and indeed when they are ſaid to <hi>Believe:</hi>
For <hi>believing</hi> ſuppoſeth <hi>underſtanding:</hi> And when
<hi>Peter</hi> ſaith that <hi>Baptiſm ſaveth; not the waſhing of the
filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God.</hi> And when all the Chriſtians in the
world as far as we have any notice from the Apoſtles
dayes, have been baptized after <hi>Profeſſion of faith,</hi>
we have no reaſon to doubt, but that the Apoſtles
uſed and appointed the requiring of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:55406:102"/>
§. 19. 5. In doing this, it is no doubt but what they
required of the Confeſſours from their mouths was
<hi>ſhort</hi> and <hi>plain,</hi> or elſe thoſe multitudes of men and
women who were in a ſhort time baptized, would
neither have had capacity nor time to do it: But
the words of the <hi>Teachers</hi> and <hi>baptizers</hi> in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſaid articles were large, and many: For
we find that it was their common preaching
work.</p>
               <p>§. 20. 6. It is moſt probable (by the reaſon of the
thing and the hiſtory, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. and elſewhere) that
at the firſt no form of words was required and uſed
beſides the form in baptiſm, but that the people
being inſtructed in the ſenſe of thoſe words, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
profeſſed <hi>underſtanding, belief</hi> and <hi>conſent.</hi> (And
no more is eſſentially neceſſary) But that after a
Creed in terms was the common form which was
uſed by Profeſſors in order to baptiſm: 1. Becauſe
ſo many thouſands being baptized, the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhort, and meerly Divine, they could not be
ſuppoſed to be left to much variety of expreſſion:
Divine, great, neceſſary things muſt be ſpoken with
ſo much caution as may avoid errour, hereſie, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
and abuſe: And if every ignorant man
and woman were left to uſe only words of their
own deviſing to expreſs the Chriſtian faith, it
would be of confounding and diſhonourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
               <p>2. And the great care that then was uſed that
all Chriſtians might be of one faith and ſpeak the
ſame things, and that the hereſies then ariſing
might be ſuppreſſed, doth imply that this neceſſary
means was then uſed by thoſe that commanded
that all be done to edification and unity and in
order.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:55406:103"/>
3. And many expoſitors think that this Creed is
it that <hi>Paul</hi> meant by the <hi>depoſitum</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of <hi>whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
words</hi> to <hi>Timothy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. But the fulleſt proof is univerſal hiſtorical
tradition and conſent of the Chriſtian Churches,
who have ever uſed Catechizing and the <hi>Creed</hi> as the
profeſſion of faith, in order to baptiſm, and this as
from the Apoſtles, without the leaſt notice of any
other original of it: There is ſome difference in
words between that recited by <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and that which we now uſe, and
ſome little difference between that of <hi>Marcellus</hi>
in <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and that of <hi>Aquileia</hi> in <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> and
ours now uſed: And the forming of the <hi>Nicene</hi>
Creed in other words doth ſhew that the Churches
took not themſelves to be ſo tyed to the ſame
words of the former Creed as not to alter any
part of them: And it is ſuppoſed that before the
<hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, the <hi>Greek</hi> Church had a Creed that
had as much of the words of the <hi>Nicene</hi> as of that
called the Apoſtles. And no doubt it was the
wiſdom of the Apoſtles and the Churches, not
to lay too much on particular words, and make
them ſeem eſſential to baptiſm or more neceſſary
than they were: And to this day if any in other
words expreſt the ſame thing, he may be baptized.
But <hi>ad melius eſſe</hi> and for concord and ſafety the
Churches that ſtill agreed in words of the ſame
ſence, and moſtly the ſame words as to all that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
the eſſentials of Chriſtianity, found it more
and more needful to agree in every word, and leave
men no room for dangerous diverſity (though over
and above they may explain their minds.) From
whence it was that ſo great contentions have riſen
about ſome ſingle word, as the <hi>Nicene</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and
the Latines <hi>Filióque,</hi> leſt the Creed ſhould be altered
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55406:103"/>
at the will of man, and the Chriſtian faith ſeem to
be an uncertain mutable thing.</p>
               <p>§. 21. By all this it is evident that the Church
muſt make <hi>Baptiſm</hi> the term of Chriſtian Catholick
unity and concord as neceſſary <hi>ad eſſe,</hi> and <hi>the
Creed</hi> as needful and apt <hi>ad bene eſſe</hi> ordinarily.</p>
               <p>§. 22. There is a controverſie raiſed (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
by <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and other Sectaries, ſo) now by
the Papiſts, whether the perſon baptized muſt not
alſo own, 1. the Miniſtry in general, 2. the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Miniſter that baptizeth him, 3. and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church into which he is received; 4. and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
himſelf by profeſſion to ſuch paſtoral power.
To all which I ſhall diſtinctly anſwer.</p>
               <p>§. 23. I. To the firſt, 1. what is <hi>connoted</hi> is not
alwayes a neceſſary part of the contract: A man
cannot be baptized but he muſt know that ſome one
hath power to baptize him.</p>
               <p>2. It is more needful of the two that the <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
office</hi> and power be known and believed than
the <hi>ſucceſſive ordinary Miniſtry:</hi> Becauſe the belief of
the truth of the Goſpel more dependeth on their
teſtimony, as commiſſioned and qualified with thoſe
extraordinary gifts of the ſpirit which are its ſeal
and proof.</p>
               <p>3. It is of great uſe to our faith and obedience to
underſtand that Chriſt hath ſettled an authorized
Miniſtry to preſerve and preach his Word, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
his Sacraments, and guide his Churches to
the end of the world, and he that knoweth not this
wanteth an integral part of Chriſtianity, and a great
and needful help to his edification and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>4. Yet none of theſe are abſolutely neceſſary to
the eſſence of Chriſtianity: If any lived where the
miniſterial office were not known, or ſhould by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leading
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55406:104"/>
ſo far err as to think that any judicious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
or any Chriſtian Magiſtrate, or maſter of a
family, might preach and adminiſter the Sacraments,
if yet this man believe in God the Father, Son and
Holy Ghoſt, as his Creator, Redeemer and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier,
and be accordingly devoted to him in baptiſm,
this man ſhall be ſaved, notwithſtanding his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
or errour about the Miniſtry, yea though he
knew not of the office of the Apoſtles, but took
them for lay men. For the promiſe is, that <hi>whoever
believeth in Chriſt ſhall not periſh,</hi> but <hi>have everlaſting
life,</hi> Joh. 3. 16, 18. by what means ſoever he was
converted to the faith: It is not only, [He that is
converted by a Prieſt ſhall not periſh] Nor is it
ever ſaid [<hi>He that believeth in the Apoſtles</hi> or <hi>Prieſts</hi>
ſhall not periſh], but he that believeth in Chriſt
(which eſſentially includeth the belief in the Father
and the Holy Ghoſt.) And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> calleth
them carnal as guilty of Schiſm that ſaid I am of
<hi>Paul,</hi> and I of <hi>Cephas;</hi> becauſe they were not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
into the name of <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> but of Chriſt:
And he thanketh God that he had baptized few of
them, leſt they ſhould ſay that he had baptized
them into his own name.</p>
               <p>And yet are the Apoſtles <hi>foundations</hi> or <hi>baſes and
pillars</hi> in the Church, becauſe Chriſt uſed them as the
firſt great keepers of his word and ſeals, and the
means of converting unbelievers, and it's hard and
rare to believe in Chriſt without knowing and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that they were his commiſſioned Miniſters.</p>
               <p>§. 24. II. But, though it be a duty to chooſe a
true Miniſter to be baptized by, yet it is not at all
neceſſary to the validity of baptiſm to know that
the baptizer is ſuch: Indeed not one of many can
be ſure, as not having ſeen his ordination, nor
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55406:104"/>
knowing of his neceſſary qualifications: Many
things may deceive them, and all baptiſm by Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
is not null, as the Fathers held, and the Papiſts
now hold and confeſs.</p>
               <p>§. 25. III. And as to reception into a particular
Church, I have proved before that it is no work of
baptiſm as ſuch, but a conſequent act (in order of
nature alwayes, and oft of time.) The <hi>Eunuch,
Act.</hi> 8. was baptized into no Church but the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal.
There be ſome few rigid miſtaken brethren
called Independents in <hi>New England</hi> that think in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that all baptized perſons muſt be baptized into
a particular Church, but others even of that party
are wiſer herein. It is very fit that every one that <hi>can,</hi>
be a member of ſome particular Church: But ſome
<hi>cannot</hi> (as Travellers, Merchants, Ambaſſadors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
who reſide among Infidels only, and thoſe that live
in Countreys where the Paſtors by tyranny refuſe
to admit any to their communion who will not ſay
or do ſome unlawful thing.) But yet Baptiſm as
ſuch is no ſuch thing, nor hath ſuch an effect. Much
leſs is it a profeſſion that ſuch a particular Church is
ſound.</p>
               <p>§. 26. IV. And as to <hi>ſubjection</hi> to the <hi>Clergie,</hi> It is
true that Baptiſm <hi>eſſentially ſubjecteth us to Chriſt;</hi>
and this includeth an obligation to obey <hi>him in all</hi>
things which we know to be his Law; And it is true
that juſt obedience to the Guides of the Church is
his command: But it followeth not that every <hi>man
knoweth this,</hi> nor that every diſobedience unchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us: It is his command that we pray continually,
and in all things give thanks, and that we ſpeak not
an idle word, and uſe not vain jeaſting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifieth
not Chriſtianity that we culpably offend in
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55406:105"/>
one of theſe: Nor doth our baptiſm contain our
promiſe that we will never ſin, nor that we will obey
a command which we underſtand not: but that we
will be Chriſts ſubjects and obey him ſincerely, ſo as
that when we fail by weakneſs we will renew our
repentance. Chriſt alſo commandeth every child,
ſubject, wife, ſervant to obey their parents, Princes
and Magiſtrates, Husband and Maſter; And he that
is baptized bindeth himſelf alſo to obey theſe Laws
ſincerely if he know them. But it followeth not
that it is eſſential to Baptiſm to oblige us to ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to parents, husbands, maſters, but only to
Chriſt who commandeth us to obey them. Even
as ſubjects take not an Oath of Allegiance to every
Juſtice, Conſtable, or Meſſenger, but only to the
King, who yet commandeth us to obey his Judges,
Juſtices, Conſtables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 27. To pretend that Baptiſm as ſuch doth ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
men to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or to the Biſhop of
<hi>Alexandria, Antioch, Paris, London,</hi> or to the Paſtor
of a ſingle Church, is a perverting the ſence of it,

of the Catholick Church: That is, the bare <hi>profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
of faith and conſent and ſubjection, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting
with Chriſt for future ſincere obedience, is
enough to our firſt reception by baptiſm: But ſome
<hi>performance</hi> of this Covenant is neceſſary to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</p>
               <p>The reaſons are, 1. Becauſe the <hi>Covenant</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi>
is neceſſary, not meerly for <hi>it ſelf,</hi> but for the
<hi>performance-ſake,</hi> to engage us to do what we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.
2. And as a known falſe Covenant is null as
to the <hi>benefit</hi> of the Covenanter, though not as to
<hi>his obligation,</hi> ſo at the <hi>entrance</hi> a <hi>mans word</hi> is his
<hi>credible profeſſion;</hi> but if he by notorious wilfulneſs
violate this word or promiſe in any eſſential point,
he then ſo far nullifieth his verbal profeſſion as to his
benefit, and proveth his Covenanting to be falſe.
And therefore all diſciplined Churches do caſt out
groſs impenitent violaters of that Covenant, in
ſuch eſſential parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:55406:106"/>
§. 2. But what is ſuch violation, and for what
fin men are to be caſt out, is a difficult queſtion in
ſome inſtances.</p>
               <p>1. I take it for a ſure rule that no man is to be
further cut off from the univerſal Church by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
than he firſt morally departeth or cuts off him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
For the Paſtors have not their power for <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi>
but <hi>for edification:</hi> And their office is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient
to Chriſt, who came not <hi>to deſtroy mens lives
but to ſave them,</hi> even to <hi>ſeek and to ſave the loſt.</hi>
They are not to be <hi>hurtful</hi> but <hi>helpful</hi> to mens ſouls.</p>
               <p>§. 3. 2. He therefore that apoſtatizeth or deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
any one eſſential article of Chriſtianity, cuts off
himſelf firſt, and is to be declared by the Churches
ſentence to have ſo done, if he repent not: If he
timely repent, it muſt prevent the ſentence.</p>
               <p>§. 4. 3. Whatever ſin amounteth to an evident
refuſal of promiſed ſubjection to Jeſus Chriſt, cuts
off the ſinner morally from Chriſt, and if he prevent
it not by repentance, he is to be ſentenced accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
by the Church; who do but thus declare who
depart from Chriſt and cut off themſelves.</p>
               <p>§. 5. 4. Every ſin is not a renouncing of our alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
or ſubjection to Chriſt, nor to be cenſured by
excommunication.</p>
               <p>1. There are ſins of meer <hi>infirmity</hi> or <hi>imperfection</hi>
in duty; as imperfection of ſincere faith, love,
hope, obedience, prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. There are ſins of
<hi>ſudden paſſion</hi> and ſurprize which the will habitually
abhorreth, and the ſinner quickly repenteth of.
3. There are ſins of <hi>ignorance</hi> which a man knew
not to be ſins. 4. There are ſins of meer <hi>forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</hi>
5. Yea it is not all preſumptuous ſin that
is a renouncing of our ſubjection: A faithful man
knoweth that the leaſt ſin ſhould be avoided, and
he may know that vain jeſting or idle words are a
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55406:106"/>
ſin; And he may be often guilty of theſe by ſome
degree of preſumption, that is, he may be tempted
to think that all men being ſinners, ſuch a ſin may
ſtand with grace, and for want of due excitation
not fear it or fly from it becauſe it is a little one, as
he would do from perjury, murder or ſome greater
ſin: No ſmall evils or danger doth ſo much ſuſcitate
the ſoul to reſiſt and avoid it as a greater doth:
no man is ſo careful to avoid the prick of a pin as of
a ſword: This want of ſuſcitation through the
ſmallneſs of the thing, maketh leſs reſiſtance and ſo
ſome degree of preſumption in all men.</p>
               <p>§. 6. 5. No one Act of ſin ſufficiently repented
of, is matter for a juſt excommunication, be the ſin
never ſo great; For the penitent are pardoned: If
the Repentance be before the excommunication, it
preventeth it: For the firſt part of diſcipline is to
perſwade the ſinner to repentance, as being intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for his recovery and ſalvation: and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is never juſt but when the ſinner will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
As under the Law of Innocency <hi>death</hi> was
the wages of <hi>any ſin,</hi> but under the Goſpel <hi>faith
and repentance</hi> are the <hi>remedying conditions;</hi> ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
though <hi>Adam</hi> was caſt out of Paradiſe for
the firſt ſin, none are to be caſt out of the Church for
any ſin meerly <hi>as a ſin,</hi> but as <hi>not repented of</hi> by a
believer. I ſay not that this is the Magiſtrates rule
in puniſhing the body, but the Paſtors in excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating.</p>
               <p>§. 7. 6. Yea the time and means of admonition
for bringing the ſinner to repentance muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent,
and ſuch as are ſuitable to a rational hope
of his repenting, and not as ſome Lay Chancellors
do, if a few rough words make them not repent, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
excommunicate him; nor <hi>pro forma</hi> to ſay
thrice I <hi>admoniſh you,</hi> I <hi>admoniſh you,</hi> I <hi>admoniſh you</hi>]
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55406:107"/>
and then [I <hi>excommunicate you.</hi>] It is not a jeaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
matter, nor to be paſt as haſtily as angry
word. The ſinner muſt be gravely and ſeriouſly
told of the evil of his ſin, and if it be ſomething
which he taketh for no ſin, he muſt be convinced
by Scripture proof, and muſt be heard ſpeak for
himſelf with patience; and if he hear not a more
private admonition, he muſt be reproved before
the Church, that many may conſent for the more
authoritative conviction, and for the warning of
others, and that the Church may thereby clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as not conſenting to the ſin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. And the
excommunication is only to paſs at laſt, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
juſtly ſeemeth hopeleſs.</p>
               <p>§. 7. But yet there is much difference herein to
be made in reſpect of the difference of <hi>ſins</hi> and of
<hi>perſons:</hi> 1. A ſin of errour or ignorance, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted,
as alſo a ſmaller ſin, requireth a longer
time of patience for the ſinners conviction before
he be judged to be impenitent: But a notorious ſin
againſt the light of nature, or plaineſt proof, and
of moſt ſcandalous conſequence, muſt have ſhorter
time of patience: yet ſo much as that the ſinners paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
may be over, and he may have leiſure well to
conſider of the evil, and of the Churches reproof.</p>
               <p>§. 8. As gravity, convincing reaſon, compaſſion
and patience are certainly neceſſary, ſo it ſeemeth
very convenient at leaſt that when the ſinner is
admoniſhed before the Church, the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
joyn with the Paſtor in earneſt Prayer to God
for his conviction and repentance, and if that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
not at once, in tolerable caſes to do it again,
before the ſinner be caſt out: <hi>Ye ought to mourn,</hi> ſaith
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. Men will not cut off a corrupt
member of the body haſtily, nor till flat neceſſity,
nor without ſenſe of pain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:55406:107"/>
§. 9. It is not every ſin that a man repenteth not
of, that is a juſt cauſe of excommunication: For
there is no man living that hath not ſome ſins
which he no otherwiſe repenteth of, than as in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
he hateth all ſin ſo far as he knoweth it: For
every man hath ſins of ignorance, and every man
hath ſome degree of errour, and ſome faithful men
have more than others, and take ſome ſins to be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
or no ſins; and ſome have darker minds than
others that are hardly convinced and cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the force of an argument againſt the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
before received. And ſome are educated where
ſome ſins are praiſed, and converſe with ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
as by their parts and intereſt in them harden
them in their errour; How many thouſand zealous
<hi>Papiſts, Neſtorians, Eutychians, Greeks</hi> take others
for hereticks by miſtake, and perhaps by words and
actions wrong or perſecute them, and never repent
of it, becauſe they err? How many <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and they the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi>
and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> oft make each others matters ſeem
otherwiſe than they are; Yea ſo do <hi>Conformiſts</hi> and
<hi>Nonconformiſts, Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Padobaptiſts</hi> and
moſt that diſagree, and yet repent not, thinking
that to be true that is not, and ſo that they do
well?</p>
               <p>§. 10. Therefore two things muſt concur in the ſin
that deſerveth an Excommunication from Catholick
Communion. 1. That it be ſuch as ſome call a
<hi>Mortal ſin,</hi> that is, <hi rend="margQuotes">Not a ſin of meer infirmity and
ignorance, which may conſiſt with ſincere Love to
God and holineſs, and ſubjection to the Government
of Chriſt, but a ſin which in an impenitent perſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the abſence of ſuch Subjection and Love:</hi> And
the mark of this is, <hi rend="margQuotes">That it be a ſin which is ſo
<hi>much in the power of the Will, that no one can keep it
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:55406:108"/>
that is ſincerely willing to leave it, and which muſt
be known to be ſin by all that are truly willing to
know it:</hi>
                  </hi> A ſin that men may know if they are
willing, and had rather keep than leave. 2. And
that it be <hi>unrepented of, and ſuch as due information
and perſwaſion with patience, do not bring the ſinner to
repent of.</hi> A heinous, mortal, wilful ſin unrepent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of.</p>
               <p>§. 11. By this it appeareth, who is to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced
cut off from the Catholick Church, and
who not. None but thoſe that firſt really depart,
becauſe the ſentence muſt be true and juſt: And this
departure is either direct, by Apoſtaſie, renouncing
God the Father, the Son or the Holy Ghoſt, or ſome
eſſential part of Godlineſs or Chriſtianity: 2. Or
indirectly, when men deny not any of theſe in words,
but in works do that which is evidently inconſiſtent
with them, and may be ſo diſcerned by any willing
mind.</p>
               <p>§. 12. And hence it appeareth, 1. that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of theſe is greater than the Paſtors that caſt off
true diſcipline do acknowledge. That is, All thoſe
that are guilty of living in ſuch ſins as the common
light of nature detecteth to every willing mind,
(ſuch as are fornication, adultery, drunkenneſs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
malignity, perſecution, ſlanderous preaching
or ſpeech, hating others, eſpecially for good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)
and are obſtinate in refuſing to repent and amend.
And, alas, how great a number live in our Churches
never excommunicated nor publickly admoniſhed
who lye in ſuch ſins and will not repent? The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
Prieſts themſelves conform by unjuſt oaths and
profeſſing to aſſent and conſent to many Decrees and
Canons of Councils which are falſe and ſinful, and by
many other ſinful practices. Their very perſecution
of men better than themſelves on falſe pretences of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55406:108"/>
hereſie and ſchiſm, is a crime that many were they
truly willing might ſoon know. Drunkenneſs, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
lying, perjury, prophane ſwearing, curſing
and ſlandering, covetous and proud oppreſſing, and
many ſuch like, yea even profeſſed Saduceiſm and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity
and deriding ſerious Godlineſs, are all too
common in the world; Yet few of all theſe are
ever excommunicated.</p>
               <p>§. 13. 2. Yet hence alſo it is plain that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneſt
ſort of Excommunications for theſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years at leaſt have been but the acts of carnal
tyrannical uſurpation like a plague or publick war
or fire to the Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> I. Anathematizing men for a dark ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
word or phraſe, though inept, and though in
the obvious ſence by undiſcerned conſequence it
might be inconſiſtent with the eſſentials of Religion,
is tyrannical and unjuſt.</p>
               <p>§. 14. 1. When the <hi>words only</hi> are bad, and the
man doth not ſo <hi>mean them,</hi> this is no hereſie in the
man. If that word which ſignifieth God, or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
ſhould in another language, or by miſ-informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be uſed to ſignifie, Satan or Hell, and ſo have
opprobrious epithers annexed, this were no blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
or errour in the man. For he uſed the words
as ſignifications of his mind: And they are not <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
but <hi>arbitrary</hi> ſigns. Elſe all unskilful ſpeakers
would be hereticks: Yea all men would be damned;

another.</p>
               <p>§. 15. 2. And as <hi>Ameſius</hi> hath well noted, there
is ſo harmonious a connexion between all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

conſequence it will overthrow the reſt: and <hi>every

yea ſubverteth the foundation.</p>
               <p>§. 16. 3. And (not only <hi>Davenant, Morton,

that unſeen conſequences are not to be taken for a

which he profeſſedly owneth.</p>

<hi>Juſtin</hi> and all the reſt of the Ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> whoſe

have been Excommunicated. Doubtleſs the denyal

that I may ſafely inſtance in,<note place="margin">See what I have recited out of <hi>Philaſtrius</hi> in my book againſt <hi>Johnſon</hi> called [<hi>Which is the true Church</hi>] in the end.</note>

(as calling the ſtars by the

divers in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> are not much worſe. But I will
ſpeak only of three or four that have made the
greateſt diviſions in the Church.</p>
               <p>§. 19. I. <hi>Cyprian</hi> with his <hi>African</hi> Councils with
<hi>Firmilian</hi> judging for the re-baptization of thoſe
baptized by hereticks, was judged a hereſie, which
their Countreymen the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> followed: Yet <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
ſaith that <hi>Cyprian</hi> was no heretick for it. And
indeed, it had been but juſtly diſtinguiſhing of men

if not, this was no ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> cauſe of Excommunication.</p>
               <p>§. 20. II. The ſame I may ſay of the unhappy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
of the <hi>time of Eaſter;</hi> about which <hi>Victor</hi>
and <hi>Polycrates</hi> ſtrove; wherein <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth
<hi>Victor,</hi> as moſt wiſe and good men ever ſince
have in their judgements done.</p>
               <p>§. 21. III. And truly I think on ſeveral accounts
that the Novatian hereſie was not ſuch as deſerved
Excommunication from the Catholick Church,
though they ſinfully ſeparated from thoſe concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:55406:110"/>
particular Churches, which by advantage got
the name of the Catholick. For 1. wiſe men are
not agreed what the hereſie was: But the skilfulleſt
agree that it was not a denyal of pardon <hi>before God</hi> in
another world, to the penitent, but only of Church-pardon
and admittance to Communion: And ſome
of their accuſers told them that their firſt founders
denyed ſuch Church-pardon only to thoſe that <hi>deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Chriſt</hi> or <hi>lapſed againſt Chriſtianity</hi> in time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
(good Chriſtians that came out of priſons
being too unwilling to receive thoſe when the ſtorm
was over, that had ſaved themſelves by denying the
faith), and that the denyal of it to <hi>other criminals</hi>
came in after by degrees on ſuppoſed parity of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
2. And I find it confeſſed by their adverſaries
that the wicked lives of the Catholicks occaſioned
this addition; and that the Novatians were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
Orthodox, and of better lives than moſt of the
Orthodox. 3. And I find that the proudeſt and
worſt Biſhops (ſuch as <hi>Neſtorius</hi>) were their ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Adverſaries, and that the beſt lived lovingly and
as brethren with them: <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> once threatned
their Biſhop in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but went no further,
and recalled it at the next word. <hi>Atticus</hi> and
<hi>Proclus</hi> kindly kept peace with them. And though
<hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> are by many accuſed as being
Novatians, for ſpeaking well of them, I ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to believe it; unleſs every man that chooſeth
rather to ſpeak truly of diſſenters, than maliciouſly
and ſlanderouſly, be therefore of their opinion.
But if it were ſo, it would be ſo much the greater
honour to the Novatians, with them that diſcern,
that we have no ancient Church-hiſtorians that
write more credibly than <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen;</hi>
or in whom the footſteps of veracity may by a
ſtranger be eaſilier diſcerned: If their hiſtorians are
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:55406:110"/>
trueſt, it's like they were not the worſt men. And to
ſay, [Let men be never ſo pious, ſuch an opinion
cuts them off from Chriſt] deſerveth indignation
rather than confutation.</p>
               <p>§. 22. IV. <hi>Neſtorius</hi> himſelf was ſo turbulent an
enemy to hereſie and toleration, that while he would
needs be an Orthodox perſecutor he fell under the
reputation of being a moſt damnable heretick: His
zeal aroſe againſt the ſuppoſed hereſie of calling <hi>Mary</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

denyed that ſhe was the <hi>mother of him that is God:</hi>
Hereupon <hi>Cyril</hi> (as turbulent a man and more, if
<hi>Iſidore Peluſiota</hi> and other good men ſay true) charged
him with aſſerting <hi>two perſons</hi> in Chriſt, as well as
<hi>two Natures:</hi> which his own expreſs words deny:
And who beſt knew his own opinion but himſelf?

                  </gap> that they meant the ſame
thing, and ſtrove but about words, and skilful
ſpeaking, in which <hi>Cyril</hi> carryed it by his greater
learning, and by <hi>Neſtorius</hi> his ſucceeding St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi>
in the <hi>hatred of the Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Plainly, <hi>One ſpake</hi> of the <hi>concrete,</hi> and the other
<hi>of the abſtract:</hi> One of <hi>Him that was God,</hi> and <hi>the
other</hi> of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> and both true: <hi>Neſtorius</hi> ſpake
<hi>formally</hi> (that is, ſtrictly, for <hi>denominatio eſt à formâ</hi>)
and <hi>Cyril Materially: Neſtorius</hi> ſaid, Mary <hi>was not
the Parent of the Deity or of Chriſt as God,</hi> but only of
the <hi>humanity</hi> and partly of the Union; and therefore
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55406:111"/>
was not aptly to be called <hi>The Mother of God, but of
Chriſt, who is God</hi>]: <hi>Cyril</hi> ſaid that <hi>Mary</hi> was not the
Cauſe or Parent of the Godhead, but yet becauſe of
the Union of the two Natures was to be called <hi>The
Mother of God:</hi> And is it not evident that they
ſtrove but about words? which <hi>Sophronius</hi> in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
after plainly opened, and could not be heard.
O doleful! that two mens ſinful ſtriving who
ſhould be judged to ſpeak beſt, while they meant
the ſame thing and did not know it, ſhould ſet moſt
of the Chriſtian world under Anathema's and in a
flame of wrath and mutual condemnation to this
very day! But ſuppoſe ſome difference had been in
their ſence, was it any renouncing of Chriſtianity
and ſuch as cut them off from Chriſt?</p>
               <p>§. 23. V. <hi>Cyril</hi> ſo carryed it by wit and Grandeur,
and the countenance of the Court that all went for
right that he had ſaid. And he had ſaid (as is yet
viſible in his writings largely cited by <hi>Derodon,</hi>)
that <hi>Chriſts Natures were two before the Vnion</hi> (as if
the humane had exiſted before) and <hi>afterward but
one. Eutyches</hi> imitated him, and was accuſed for it
otherwiſe: <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> honouring his predeceſſour
<hi>Cyril</hi> took his part, thinking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> which carryed it
then would carry it now: But the Court and ſtream
was changed and he was deceived: and when they
had fought it out and <hi>Flavian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
was mortally hurt, <hi>Eutyches</hi> went for the heretick, and
yet the name of <hi>Cyril</hi> was honoured ſtill as Orthodox.
And now that Church war was revived, which drew
ſtreams of conſecrated blood, and ſhook the Empire,
and dolefully continueth to this day. The baniſhed
<hi>Eutychians</hi> prevailed in the Eaſt and South, and even
beyond the Empire as far as <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> and the <hi>Abaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines,
Copties,</hi> and others are called by many Eutychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55406:111"/>
hereticks, who know not what that hereſie is, but
only honour the names of <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> and
condemn thoſe that condemned them; and being
now, from a later propagater of the party called
<hi>Jacobites,</hi> are the greateſt number of Chriſtians in
thoſe Countreys. And thus the pride and contention
of Prelates under pretence of zeal againſt hereſie and
errour, have ſet the meer names of differing leaders
to be the means and marks of Schiſm to this day.</p>
               <p>§. 24. And that ſtill it was the ſame thing that
they meant, will appear to a diligent reader of the
hiſtory, and the contenders words: The undenya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
truth is (as <hi>Nazianzene</hi> before lamented) few
Biſhops were learned underſtanding men, but ſuch
as the more ignorant ſort of our Curates, and too
many of them worldly, proud and factious, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Court and thoſe Patriarchs that were moſt
able to promote or eject them, after Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
had once made them the Rulers of the
Countreys and the Judges of all Chriſtians even in
ſecular affairs: And when one <hi>Sophronius</hi> or few
others opened the caſe rightly to them, they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
underſtood it not, or bawl'd it down and ſet up
a cry, <hi>Away with the Hereticks.</hi> The <hi>Eutychians</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>Cyril</hi> ſpake u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

natures before the union and but one after, becauſe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and union maketh one of two.</hi>] But it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
(as <hi>Derodon</hi> hath proved) that <hi>Cyril</hi> (and ſo
his ignorant followers) did not think that Chriſts
humane nature did exiſt before the union, and ſo
that ever they were divided, but that in order of
nature the exiſtence is <hi>intelligible</hi> before the union,
and ſo that they were but one as being <hi>undivided,</hi>
not denying them to be ſtill diſtinguiſhable, and ſo
to be what <hi>Neſtorius</hi> and the Orthodox meant by
[two] as being <hi>diſtinct</hi> but not divided.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:55406:112"/>
§. 25. And <hi>Derodon</hi> hath alſo proved that <hi>Cyril</hi>
(and ſo the <hi>Eutychians</hi>) when they called them
[<hi>One</hi>] did mean [<hi>One perſon</hi>] miſtaking the ſenſe
of the word [<hi>Nature</hi>] and meaning by [<hi>Nature</hi>]
the ſame that the Orthodox meant by [<hi>Perſon</hi>].
And ſo the opening of two words, would have
ended all their Controverſie, and proved that they
meant the ſame thing and knew it not; that is,
1. diſtinguiſhing between [<hi>One undivided</hi>] and
[<hi>One undiſtinguiſhed</hi>]. 2. Opening what they
meant by <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Perſon:</hi> But, alas, this was no
work for thoſe famous General Councils, but to cry
out [<hi>Anathema to</hi> Neſtorius, <hi>Anathema to</hi> Eutyches,
<hi>Anathema to</hi> Dioſcorus; <hi>Holy</hi> Leo, <hi>Holy</hi> Cyril, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]
theſe were their arguments. And <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> as bad
as his adverſaries or worſe, excommunicated <hi>Leo</hi>
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and went the Anathematizing
way: And ſo much of Religion was placed in <hi>curſing</hi>
one another, that there were ſcarce any Biſops in
the world that were not curſed by one another.</p>
               <p>§. 26. VI. And the difference between the <hi>Greeks
and Latines</hi> about the words [<hi>hypoſtaſes &amp; Perſonae</hi>]
had almoſt come to the ſame extremity: When
<hi>Hierome</hi> himſelf that liked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ot [<hi>three hypoſtaſes</hi>]
was accuſed of hereſie, and was fain to fly to his
<hi>baptiſmal Creed</hi> for refuge, and to prove that he was
<hi>a believer</hi> becauſe he was <hi>baptized.</hi>
But<note n="*" place="margin">Greg. Nazianzene.</note> one wiſer than the reſt had
the unuſual good ſucceſs as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them that by the <hi>two words</hi> it was the <hi>ſame
thing</hi> that they meant, and did not know it.</p>
               <p>§. 27. VII. The next calamitous Anathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
fell out about the owning or diſowning of the
<hi>Council of Chalcedon,</hi> becauſe of the foreſaid <hi>Neſtorian</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:55406:112"/>
and <hi>Eutychian</hi> quarrels: And ſo doleful was the caſe,
that it became the teſt of the Orthodox in one
Countrey to <hi>Curſe or Anathematize</hi> that <hi>Council,</hi> and
in another to <hi>Curſe all that did not receive it.</hi> Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when one <hi>Emperour</hi> was for one ſide, and the
next for another, the Curſing varyed accordingly,
for the moſt part.</p>
               <p>§. 28. But that which added grievouſly to the
Calamity was, that the ſame Biſhops that under one
Emperour curſed the Council, under the next cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
thoſe that owned it not, and thus moſt ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
anathematized themſelves, even one party
this year, and another the next. I ſay nothing but
what <hi>Binius</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> and ſuch others ſay.</p>
               <p>§. 29. VIII. The next ſad Anathematizing was
about the <hi>Monothelites:</hi> They that ſaid that Chriſt
had but <hi>One Will</hi> and <hi>One Operation</hi> were curſed as
<hi>Monothelite</hi> hereticks, and they that ſaid <hi>He had
two</hi> were curſed by the <hi>Monothelites:</hi> And theſe were
no narrow petty Sects, but Emperours and great
General Councils were for them. <hi>Binius</hi> ſaith, that
the Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> called <hi>Quin ſextum</hi> that
made the <hi>Trull</hi> Canons, were <hi>Monothelites,</hi> and yet
that they were the ſame Biſhops that had conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the fifth Council, ſo that thoſe alſo were <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelites;</hi>
And in the reign of <hi>Philippicus</hi> he ſaith a
Council of the <hi>Monothelites</hi> was ſo great that there
were beſides the reſt <hi>Innumerable Biſhops out of the
Eaſt.</hi> And theſe and their adverſaries kept on the
curſing trade of Religion, one ſide curſing under one
Emperour, and the contrary under the next.</p>
               <p>§. 30. And (O doleful caſe) even theſe alſo
ſeem fully to me to contend about nothing but <hi>bare
words,</hi> and really agreed and did not know it, partly
following the ſtream for worldly intereſt, and partly
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:55406:113"/>
having not skill enough to explicate ambiguous
words and ſtate the Controverſie. Who knoweth
not that ever read any Metaphyſicks, how many
ſenſes the word [<hi>One</hi>] or [<hi>Vnity</hi>] hath? and how
the ſame thing in ſeveral reſpects may be ſaid to be
<hi>One</hi> or <hi>Two?</hi> And was this diſcuſſed in any of theſe
Councils? Which? where? and when? 1. Two
<hi>things</hi> may concur to one effect, where, ſay the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tileſt
Philoſophers, <hi>materially</hi> they are <hi>two cauſes,</hi> but
<hi>formally</hi> and properly <hi>but one;</hi> All ſet together make
but <hi>one cauſe</hi> (being <hi>ejuſdem generis</hi>) and are but
many <hi>parts</hi> of that one cauſe, though many <hi>things:</hi>
And ſo ſome called Chriſts <hi>Wills One</hi> as being but <hi>One
cauſe</hi> in theſe School-mens ſenſe of the ſame effect.
For the Deity operateth only <hi>per eſſentiam</hi> and hath
no effect in God himſelf. 2. And as <hi>Voluntas</hi> and
<hi>operatio</hi> ſignifie the <hi>Internal principle</hi> of the effect, no
one can doubt but Chriſt had <hi>two;</hi> for the Divine
eſſential <hi>Will,</hi> and the <hi>humane</hi> faculty or Act, were
not the ſame principle or thing: But <hi>Objectively</hi>
they <hi>are One;</hi> that is, The <hi>Divine Nature</hi> or <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
and the <hi>humane</hi> do <hi>will</hi> the <hi>ſame thing,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
not one another. 3. And the Controverſie
is the ſame as the former with the <hi>Eutychians:</hi> Chriſt
hath but <hi>One Will</hi> as oppoſite to <hi>Diviſions; One as
not</hi> divided: but <hi>Two</hi> as <hi>intellectually diſtinguiſhable.</hi>
Two as denominated <hi>à principiis</hi> from two <hi>natures;
one</hi> as 1. from <hi>One perſon,</hi> and 2. as undivided, and
3. as terminated on <hi>One object.</hi> I doubt not but had
this been thus opened to them, all the ſober men
would have ſaid, we are all agreed in it. And yet
this wordy difference maketh the name of an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematized
hereſie to this day.</p>
               <p>§. 31. IX. The next curſing difference aroſe about
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> queſtion <hi>whether Chriſts body on earth was corruptible
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:55406:113"/>
or no?</hi> O the unhappy ſpirit of ſelf conceited ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematizing
Prelates! The affirmers were called
<hi>corrupticolae</hi> and reproached as blaſphemers of the
Chriſt, and the worſhippers of that which was <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible.</hi>
The denyers were called <hi>Phantaſiaſticks</hi>
and made hereticks, the affirmers getting the laſt
prevailing vote; And alas, the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian</hi>
out of his great zeal for the honour of Chriſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
one of the hereticks, and is ſo branded to this
day; yea and perſecuted the <hi>corrupticolas</hi> as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.
Where will hereticating, curſing and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
ſtop or end? And yet one word of juſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
had ended all this, had it been duly uſed
and received. <hi>Chriſts Body</hi> was potentially and as
to the natural quality of fleſh lyable to or capable
of corruption: But not <hi>actually corrupted,</hi> and not
<hi>corruptible</hi> in reſpect to Gods decree, that it ſhould
not actually corrupt. And yet even holy <hi>Hilary Pictav.</hi>
held not only this errour but ſomewhat more; His
words are ſo bad I am loth to cite them.</p>
               <p>§. 32. X. The next lamentable Schiſm and
Curſing aroſe from the Decree of the <hi>Conſtantinopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan</hi>
Council <hi>de tribus capitulis.</hi> The Curſing one
another for <hi>owning</hi> or <hi>not owning</hi> the Council of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi>
ſtill continuing; and Learned <hi>Theodoret</hi> with
<hi>Theodore</hi> of <hi>Mopſueſt</hi> and <hi>Ibas</hi> having been formerly
by <hi>Dioſcorus Epheſine</hi> Council condemned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
as <hi>Neſtorian</hi> hereticks, and the Council of
<hi>Chalcedon</hi> having reſtored them upon their juſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,
a crafty <hi>Eutychian</hi> perſwaded the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
that he might reconcile all the <hi>Eutychians</hi> to
the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> if he would but condemn
ſome <hi>ill words</hi> in the writings of theſe three Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops;
which the Emperour called a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
together preſently to do. The one half the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55406:114"/>
abſent thought this was a condemning in part
of the <hi>Chalcedon</hi> Council; And <hi>Vigilius</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> being then at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> refuſed to ſubſcribe,
and after excommunicated <hi>Menna</hi> the Patriarch;
The Emperour cauſed him to be dragg'd through
the ſtreets by a rope, to reconcile him: The flames
of the Church were by this Council much increaſed,
and by condemning three dead mens writings, the
living were more engaged in a doleful war. At
laſt Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> conſented to the Council; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
a great part even of the Weſtern Churches
and <hi>Italy</hi> ſeparated from and renounced the Pope,
and choſe them another Patriarch (at <hi>Aquileia</hi>)
to be their chief Church-Ruler in his ſtead. And
this continued about an hundred years, till <hi>Sergius</hi>
reconciled them: ſo far was the univerſal Church
even then from taking the Pope or Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
for the Head, or any eſſential part of the Church-Univerſal.
And all this was about the Expoſition
of ſome doubtful words in three mens writings:
And can any ſober man now think that the right
or wrong Expoſition of every mans, or thoſe three
mens writings, was a thing that ſalvation lyeth on?
or that theſe are the terms of Chriſtianity and
Church-memberſhip?</p>
               <p>§. 33. It would be but matter of ſhame and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to go on, and add the later and more ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
inſtances of Anathematizing, eſpecially about
Images, ſeveral Emperours and Councils hereticating
each other. What an Engine the Pope and Prelates
made <hi>Curſing men from Chriſt,</hi> to get dominion over
Emperours and Kings, to ſubdue Kingdoms, and to
turn Love and peace into wrath and wars and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
and pernicious diviſions: To recite their damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Loyalty</hi> under the name of the <hi>Henrician he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie:</hi>
their damning all that (about Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation)
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:55406:114"/>
renounced not the belief of all their ſenſes
and rational perception of ſenſate things; and that
renounced not alſo the belief of all the ſound mens
ſenſes in the world, and conſequently the belief of
God: as he is the God of Nature, making his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
to our underſtandings by our ſenſes; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it neceſſary to ſalvation to take God for the
deceiver of the ſenſes (or apprehenſions by ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
of all the world. How they have decreed
the burning or exterminating of all others, that do
not thus believe Tranſubſtantiation, and depoſing
temporal Lords that will not exterminate them, and
abſolving their Subjects from their Oaths and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
and giving their dominions to others. Did
I but recite to you how ridiculouſly they hereticated
<hi>Gilbert Porretane</hi> and ſome other learned men, and
how ſuch expoſed the Councils of Biſhops to ſcorn
by detecting their ignorance by ſome queſtions which
they could not anſwer; ſhould I tell you what work
their long and numerous Schiſms, and two or three
Popes at once made for the great Councils of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
and <hi>Baſil;</hi> and alſo what work thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
made themſelves, it might melt the heart of a
lover of Chriſtianity into grief and tears.</p>
               <p>§. 34. I conclude this, that the hereticating and
Curſing men for doubtful words, or want of skill
in aptneſs of expreſſions, yea or for errours which
conſiſt with ſaving faith in Chriſt, is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a means of the Churches good, that it hath
been the grand engine of Satan to exerciſe Tyranny,
excite hatred and Schiſm and Rebellions, and do
moſt lamentable miſchiefs in the world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
carefully to be avoided.</p>
               <p>§. 35. II. And what I have ſaid of <hi>words,</hi> I may
partly ſay of <hi>actions:</hi> Anathematizing men for
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:55406:115"/>
                  <hi>doubtful actions,</hi> or for ſuch faults as conſiſt with
true Chriſtianity, and continued ſubjection to Jeſus
Chriſt, is a ſinful Church-dividing means.</p>
               <p>§. 36. More particularly I ſhall ſhew after in the
third part of this book, that it is not all the ſame
things that make a man uncapable of preſent Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in this or that ſingle or particular Church, or in
a compound Church, Dioceſane, Metropolitane,
Provincial or National (or Imperial) which make
him uncapable of continuing in the Univerſal
Church. Much leſs doth every continued diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to a Biſhops or Councils Canons or Commands
make him Excommunicable from the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal.</p>
               <p>§. 37. But moſt abominable was it in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Popes and Prelates, to ſhut up <hi>all Churches, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict
whole Kingdoms,</hi> and excommunicate the <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
people,</hi> becauſe a King diſpleaſed them, or deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them ſubjection or obedience. And as old <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Groſthead</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> in his Epiſtle to
Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> IV. recorded by <hi>Matth. Paris,</hi> truly
tells them, <hi>It is the work of Satan, and next Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianity
one of the greateſt ſins in all the world, thus
to ſilence Chriſts Miniſters, and hinder the preaching of
the Word of God, and the exerciſe of his publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:</hi>
Which it concerneth all unjuſt Silencers to
conſider.</p>
               <p>§. 38. But yet ſomewhat more tyrannical and
abominable is it, for one man, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
to damn <hi>all the Church of Chriſt on earth</hi> that will not
be <hi>his Subjects</hi> as the Vicar-General of Chriſt,
and own his Uſurpation, and ſo to cut off and
damn the far greateſt part of the Chriſtian world.
But the beſt is <hi>procul à Jove, procul à fulmine,</hi> the
remote Churches feel it not, and do but deride it,
and to the nearer parts his thunderbolt doth not
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:55406:115"/>
kill all ſo many nor kindle ſo many fagots as once
it did; nor is any one ever the more condemned
by God for ſuch Papal condemnations.</p>
               <p>§. 39. But when I ſpeak of particular Church-Communion,
I ſhall ſhew, that there is ſome lawful
ſuſpenſion (called by ſome the Minor excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
which cuts not a man off from Communion
with any Church, much leſs from the univerſal or
from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>§. 40. Not approving of or practiſing a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
or indifferent humane form of Liturgy, or
ceremony or circumſtance or mode, is no juſt
cauſe of cutting off a man from the Univerſal
Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Becauſe notwithſtanding that, he may be
a true Chriſtian and a member of Chriſt and his
Church, and therefore muſt not falſly be declared to
be none.</p>
               <p>§. 41. Not taking this or that man to be ones
Biſhop or Paſtor who is obtruded, yea or juſtly ſet
over that Church, nor yet particular acts of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to him meerly as ſuch, are no good proofs
that a man is no true Chriſtian or member of Chriſt
and his Church; and therefore are no juſt cauſe to
ſentence or declare him none: For the ſentence muſt
be true. Many things in ſuch caſes may cauſe a
man to err, which do not unchriſten him or cut him
off from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>§. 42. The diſowning and refuſing ſome humane
forms of Profeſſion of faith, called Creeds, or ſome
doubtful (though lawful) ſubſcriptions, promiſes,
declarations, Covenants or oaths (much leſs falſe
ones) are no juſt cauſes of Excommunicating that
man who profeſſeth all the eſſentials of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and whatever is neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>§. 43. The condemning of ſome ſuch humane
Creeds, Articles, Forms, Covenants, promiſes or
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55406:116"/>
oaths, though unjuſtly, is no juſt cauſe of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication;
becauſe all men being known to
be fallible, a good Chriſtian may miſtake another
mans (or many mens) words: And the miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of a man (or many men) may ſtand
with Chriſtianity, piety and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>§. 44. It is not all that maketh a man uncapable
of local Communion with this or that particular
Church which unchriſteneth him, or maketh him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of continuing in the Church-univerſal, as
ſhall be after proved.</p>
               <p>§. 45. Nay a man may be a Chriſtian in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Church, who is a member of no particular
Church, as is before ſhewed: As 1. ſome newly
Baptized, as the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 2. Some Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
that live among Infidels, where is no Paſtor or
Church: As if one were now Converted in any
Heathen Land, or caſt there after; or called as an
Embaſſador or Merchant to live there. 3. Some
poor vagrant perſons that have no dwelling; as
Pedlars, Tinkers, and ſuch others that go from
place to place: and ſome others.</p>
               <p>§. 46. Therefore if a man ſhould ſo far <hi>err</hi> as to
think that he were not bound to be a member of
ſome particular Church, it may conſiſt with his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a member of the Univerſal Church.</p>
               <p>§. 47. Some few brethren called Independents,
think that none are members of the Church-Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
but thoſe that are members of ſome particular
Church: But it is but few of them, and they are
miſtaken: As Corporations are the moſt regular
parts of the Kingdom, but not the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
ſo particular Churches are the moſt regular
parts of the univerſal Church, but not the whole:
as hath been proved by inſtances.</p>

§. 48. Yea (though we need lay no ſtreſs on
this) I doubt not but in caſes of neceſſity an open
profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and entring into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of God, doth make a man a Chriſtian even
without baptiſm it ſelf. As if a Bible or good
book or ſpeech convert a man among Infidels where
there is no one to baptize him: St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, It is
not the outward waſhing that ſaveth, but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
of a good Conſcience to God (in the holy
Covenant.) And it is a diſhonourable doctrine
againſt God and Chriſtianity to ſay that God layeth
his <hi>love</hi> and <hi>mans ſalvation</hi> ſo much on a Ceremony,
as to damn or deny an upright holy ſoul for want
of it, or to give grace to none but by that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
though it be of <hi>Gods inſtitution.</hi> I am ſure
St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Elſe were your Children unclean, but
now are they holy,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 14. And if <hi>Holy before
baptiſm,</hi> (becauſe the Parents are ſo and do devote
them to God and God accepts them) then baptiſm
doth but <hi>ſolemnize</hi> this dedication and inveſt them.
It is the <hi>ſolemn Covenanting with God,</hi> that is the
chief part of baptiſm, and is it which the ancient
Churches meant, when they pleaded for the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of baptiſm to ſalvation; Though it is, no doubt,
a duty, where it may be had; and the <hi>thing ſignified</hi>
is neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>§. 49. The Keyes of Admiſſion and excluſion as
to the Church univerſal, and ſalvation are not given
<hi>abſolutely</hi> to the Paſtors, but only to exerciſe on <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
perſons:</hi> And every man herein hath more
power as to his own <hi>entrance</hi> or <hi>ejection</hi> than the
Paſtors have: They do but judge a man to <hi>be what
he is,</hi> according to Chriſts Law, and not what <hi>he is
not:</hi> no man can <hi>make a man a Chriſtian without him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
nor unchriſtian him <hi>without himſelf:</hi> nor can all
men and devils do ſo much to it as himſelf: God
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55406:117"/>
hath not put our ſalvation or damnation ſo much in
any ones power as our own.</p>
               <p>§. 50. A falſe and unjuſt ſentence of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
doth no more to damn a man than a falſe
abſolution doth to ſave him: But till the falſhood
is known, others for order ſake muſt avoid the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
if it be done by a juſt power, and not notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
abuſed to the ſubverſion of order or the
Church; otherwiſe not. But the injured perſon is
ſtill a member of the Catholick Church; And is
not diſobliged from his Communion with it, and
publick worſhipping of God, becauſe a Paſtor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
forbiddeth him: Though he muſt give all due
ſatisfaction, and ſeek his right in a regular way.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>III. What are the terms neceſſary to the Office
and Exerciſe of the Sacred Miniſtry?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. THe Schiſms in the Church are far more
among the Clergy than the people, and
have been moſtly exerciſed by Biſhops militating
againſt each other, and anathematizing each other
as hereticks or as not ſubmitting to the challengers
of ſuperiour juriſdiction: Or elſe in the Biſhops ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing
Chriſts Miniſters for not obeying them as
they expect: HARD WORDS for want of an
equal skill in ſpeaking, and JURISDICTION
or ſuperiority through pride and a carnal mind,
contended for by the Clergy againſt each other,
have torn the Church, and confounded States, and
been the ſhame of Chriſtianity in the eyes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55406:117"/>
and brought us to the low and broken ſtate
that we are in.</p>
               <p>§. 2. The great cauſe of all this hath been the
introduction of ignorant or bad men into the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Paſtoral Office. And the remedy doth not
yet ſeem very hopeful to us: And <hi>operari ſequitur
eſſe:</hi> As the man is ſo will he do. A good tree will
bring forth good fruit, and <hi>è contra.</hi> An ignorant
man will err: An erring man will do evil and not
repent: none will do more miſchief againſt the
Churches peace, than an erring Ruler, that <hi>Can do
it,</hi> and thinketh that he <hi>Ought</hi> to do it: worldly
men will prefer their worldly intereſt, before the
intereſt of Chriſtianity and mens ſouls: The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
mind is not ſubject to the Law of God, nor
(while ſuch) can be: But the Proud while they
will not obey God, will rage againſt the beſt that
obey not them. Read Church-Hiſtory, and you'll
ſee it proved.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Such as the <hi>chooſers</hi> are, ſuch ordinarily the
<hi>choſen</hi> are like to be: God and the ancient Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
ſet three locks to this door, for the ſafety of
the Church; that ſo great a matter ſhould not be
diſpoſed of without a manifold conſent:</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>perſon to be Ordained</hi> and the <hi>Ordainers</hi>
were made the Judges who ſhould be a <hi>Miniſter of
Chriſt</hi> in the Church-Univerſal, as being qualified by
God thereto.</p>
               <p>II. The <hi>People</hi> and the <hi>Ordainers</hi> were to chooſe
or conſent who ſhould be <hi>their Paſtors</hi> in particular.
The <hi>people</hi> and the <hi>Presbyters</hi> choſe the <hi>Biſhop:</hi> and
the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>people</hi> conſenting, choſe the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:55406:118"/>
III. The <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> was judge whom he would
<hi>countenance</hi> or <hi>tolerate.</hi> But <hi>Gods Law</hi> was the <hi>Rule</hi>
which all theſe were to obſerve in judging.</p>
               <p>§. †. But all men are corrupt, and ſome more
than others: And they like thoſe beſt that are
likeſt themſelves, or at leaſt moſt agreeable to their
intereſt and deſires. This chain hath been long
broken: ſometimes the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the choice of Biſhops, and given the Biſhops
the choice of the Presbyters: ſometime he hath
given the people the <hi>choice</hi> of their Biſhops, but
claimed to himſelf the power of <hi>inveſting</hi> and <hi>inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting
them.</hi> Sometime <hi>Emperours</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> have
uſed this <hi>inveſting</hi> power, leaving ſtill the <hi>people</hi> to
<hi>chooſe.</hi> In <hi>England</hi> now the King really <hi>chooſeth all
Biſhops,</hi> commending them to the Dean and Chapter
<hi>pro formâ:</hi> And the Biſhop only chooſeth whom <hi>he
will ordain a Miniſter in ſpecie:</hi> And one called <hi>the
Patron chooſeth who ſhall be the Pariſh Prieſt,</hi> and the
Biſhop <hi>muſt inſtitute and induct</hi> him; but according to
the Law, and the <hi>chooſing</hi> and <hi>conſenting</hi> liberty is
wholly taken from the people.</p>
               <p>§. 5. 1. How the Popes formerly choſe and yet
chooſe where it is in their power, I need not tell
them that know hiſtory and the world: nor yet
what Presbyters ſuch Biſhops choſe: nor is it any
wonder that ſuch chooſers ſerved their own intereſt,
nor that the choſen ſerve it.</p>
               <p>2. How Princes, and Patrons and Prelates have
choſen, hiſtory tells us: And Chriſt who ſaith, <hi>How
hard it is for the Rich to enter into the Kingdom of
heaven,</hi> teacheth us to expect that ordinarily Rich
men ſhould not be the beſt (to ſpeak ſoftly). And
the Rich will rule; and will chooſe according to
their intereſts and their appetites.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:55406:118"/>
3. And when the people had their choice, in ſome
places they choſe hereticks or ignorant men: In
other places they choſe vitious men: In moſt places
they followed the Court or Great men, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they interpoſed: and too often divided from
each other by diſagreement, or cauſed tumults in
the choice. And then what wonder if the ſacred
office was corrupted to the doleful detriment and
danger of the Churches, when the chooſers were
but ſuch as theſe?</p>
               <p>§. 6. The things neceſſary to the ſacred Miniſtry
(Biſhops or Presbyters) are I. Either to the <hi>Being,</hi>
II. Or to the <hi>Well-being;</hi> III. Or to the Exerciſe.</p>
               <p>§. 7. I. To the Being are Neceſſary, I. A true

III. A due <hi>Terminus</hi> or End.</p>

And this is, 1. Primary (or Principal)
which is Jeſus Chriſt the Lord Redeemer, and the
Churches King and Head: 2. <hi>Inſtrumental;</hi> and that
is, <hi>The Law of Chriſt,</hi> which is as a Charter to the

               <p>§ 9. II. The neceſſary <hi>Conſtitutive Cauſes</hi> are
I. Matter (or the ſubject.) II. The neceſſary <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi>

               <p>§. 12. III. The End or <hi>Terminus</hi> of the Sacred

brought in by the arrogance and ignorance of men,
which hinder the concord and peace of Chriſtians:
And I. About the Efficient Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Too many falſly perſwade the world that the
ORDAINERS are the <hi>efficient Cauſes</hi> of the

                  </note> yea that their <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
can <hi>alter</hi> the <hi>ſpecies</hi> inſtituted by
Chriſt, in the conveyance of it to this or that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
As if when Chriſt and his Apoſtles have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
the office in its parts, and commanded that
a Biſhop or Presbyter be choſen and ordained to
ſuch particular work and ends, an Ordainer might
now give him half this power without the reſt:
And when he maketh Biſhops or Presbyters they
ſhall have no more power than the Ordainer was
willing, or intended, or did particularly expreſs:
Than which nothing is more falſe. For it is Gods
Law, that is the ſpecifier and donation, and the
Ordainer doth but miniſterially inveſt and deliver
poſſeſſion of what the Law gave, and commanded
him to deliver.</p>
               <p>The Kings Law or Charter giveth power to the
Citizens to chooſe a Major, and deſcribeth all his
power and work, and ordereth the Recorder to
Swear him and deliver him the <hi>inſignia.</hi> Here now,
1. The Electors do but determine of <hi>the perſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi>
the power, but do not at all <hi>give it.</hi> 2. The
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:55406:120"/>
                  <hi>King</hi> by his <hi>Charter as the inſtrument giveth</hi> it: It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
hence as every <hi>Jus à titulo ſeu fundamento juris.</hi>
3. The Recorder only Miniſterially delivereth poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
by inveſtiture. Now if the Recorder or
Chooſers ſhall ſay, [We <hi>chooſe you or deliver you
power as Major according to the Kings Charter, but you
ſhall have but ſo much leſs</hi>] than the Charter giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
this diminution is a nullity? For they have no
power to chooſe <hi>another kind of Major</hi> than that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
in the Charter, nor to make his power more
or leſs; but he may exerciſe what the Charter
giveth.</p>
               <p>Let them not deceive men by making a Verbal
ſtrife of it. If they will call either <hi>electing</hi> or <hi>inveſting</hi>
[a <hi>Giving</hi> of the <hi>Power</hi>] I will not contend againſt
their liberty of ſpeaking as unfitly as they liſt, if
they will but well explain it. But the <hi>thing</hi> is <hi>plain</hi>
and <hi>ſure,</hi> that 1. The election doth but determine of
the <hi>Receiver,</hi> 2. and that the <hi>Inveſting</hi> act is but a
miniſterial publick delivery of a <hi>Right</hi> which reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
immediately from the Charter or Law of Chriſt:
If a Biſhop ſay [I <hi>ordain</hi> you <hi>to the office</hi> of a <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter</hi>]
the Scripture muſt tell us what that is. If
the Biſhop ſay [<hi>Take the office of a Presbyter, but
preach</hi> not, or only <hi>preach</hi> and <hi>adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or do both, but you ſhall have none of the Church
Keyes, or power of diſcipline</hi>] it is null, as to the reſtraint.</p>
               <p>There is no contract freer than that between a
husband and wife, as to the choice of perſons.
And yet when a woman chooſeth a man for her
husband, it is not ſhe that (properly) <hi>giveth him</hi>
the <hi>Ruling</hi> power; ſhe did but <hi>chooſe</hi> the <hi>receiver;</hi>
God by his Law is the <hi>Giver:</hi> If ſhe bargain with
him that he ſhall not be her Governour, it is null
becauſe againſt Gods Law: And ſo it is in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
caſe. If the power of Ordination and Church
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:55406:120"/>
Government can be proved to be ſetled by Chriſt on
the Presbyters either conjunct with the Biſhop or
alone, he that ordaineth a Presbyter by virtue of
Chriſts inſtitution, cannot deprive him of that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by his own will and act, by ſaying, <hi>You ſhall have
no ſuch power:</hi> For God is the deſcriber and the
giver.</p>
               <p>§. 14. Yea ſome would perſwade men that the
very <hi>office of Presbyters</hi> is of <hi>humane inſtitution;</hi> As
ſome Papiſts in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> would have
had it paſs that Chriſt having made the Pope, the
Pope maketh the office of Biſhops, and they hold
their power from him, ſo ſome Prelates would have
it believed that Chriſt only inſtituted the Order of
Biſhops, and that Biſhops made the Order of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
Presbyters,</hi> and that after Scripture-times; there
being none till then exiſtent, but the word [<hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>]
in Scripture, everywhere ſignifying only a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.
Which thoſe that are againſt the diſtinct
order of Biſhops thankfully accept, and ſay that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>Subject Presbyters</hi> having <hi>no ordaining power</hi> are a
<hi>humane invention</hi> ſince Scripture-times, and that God
inſtituted no ſuch order: But the difference, is that
<hi>theſe</hi> ſay man had no authority to do it, and bid the
other prove by what authority it was done, and
where the Biſhops had ſuch power given them to
make a new ſpecies, order or office of ſacred Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters;
But the other ſay that it was well done:
But proof is all.</p>
               <p>§. 15. And here come in many other Church-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting
contentions: As 1. Whether any Biſhops
Ordination be valid that holdeth not his Power
from the Pope? 2. Whether he be a true Biſhop
that is not Canonically ordained by three Biſhops?
3. Whether he be a true Biſhop that is not choſen
or conſented to by the people and Presbyters of his
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55406:121"/>
Church? 4. Or if he have but the minor part? the
reſt not being allowed or called to chooſe? 5. Or if
the major part be againſt him? 6. Or if three neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Biſhops be for him and ordain him Biſhop,
and many more be againſt it, or forbid it? 7. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be a true Presbyter that is not ordained by
a Biſhop of diſtinct and ſuperior Order: And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an uninterrupted ſucceſſion of ſuch ordination
is neceſſary? 8. Whether he be a true Biſhop that
is ordained only by Presbyters? 9. Whether he
may be a true Biſhop or Presbyter that hath no
Ordination? 10. Or he that hath no <hi>Election</hi> but
the <hi>Kings</hi> or the Patrons, nor other proved Conſent
of the people? 11. Whether he be a true Biſhop or
Presbyter that the King alloweth not or forbiddeth?
12. Whether the Ordination of hereticks be null?
13. Whether the Ordinations of prohibited, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded
or excommunicate Biſhops be null? Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of ſuch controverſies ignorance and faction
have torn the Churches with.</p>
               <p>§. 16. I. As to the firſt I need not anſwer it to
any but Papiſts, and as to them, I and others have
ſaid enough that is unanſwered.</p>
               <p>§. 17. II. As to the ſecond, where the Churches
agree to take none for a Biſhop that is not ordained
by three, four or more, that perſon cannot be the
Biſhop of that particular Church which by ſuch
agreement doth refuſe him: Not for want of any
thing neceſſary to a valid ordination, but for want
of the <hi>Conſent</hi> of <hi>the people</hi> or <hi>ſubjects</hi> that are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him: For he cannot be their Paſtor againſt
<hi>their will.</hi> But the Ordination of One may make a
man a Miniſter in the <hi>Church-univerſal, unfixed;</hi>
and to a particular Church, if the receivers of him
do conſent.</p>

§. 18. III. As to the third, <hi>Election</hi> oft ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the firſt determining nomination diſtinct from
<hi>after conſent:</hi> This is not neceſſary to the office or
power: But <hi>Conſent</hi> is neceſſary at leaſt to the <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe:</hi>
and therefore to the <hi>office</hi> which is for that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe.
If people were as much under Princes for
chooſing Guides for their ſouls, as a daughter in
her fathers houſe is under her father for the choice
of a husband (which yet I never ſaw proved to be
ſo), yet as he can be no husband to her without her
conſent, though ſhe <hi>culpably</hi> deny conſent, ſo is it
here: he can be no Paſtor to them till they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>§. 19. IV. and V. In all Societies where <hi>conſent</hi> is
neceſſary, the conſent muſt be either of All or of the
<hi>Moſt,</hi> or elſe they will divide.</p>
               <p>§. 20. VI. To the ſixth, The queſtion of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
of the Ordination dependeth not on it; but
on the peoples <hi>acceptance</hi> and <hi>conſent:</hi> If ten Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
ordain one man Biſhop of a Church, and three
ordain another to the ſame Church, and <hi>one</hi> a <hi>third</hi>
(as ſometimes there have been divers ordained
Popes) that only is the true Biſhop whom the
Church which he is to be over, <hi>conſenteth</hi> to. Other
deciſions will not ſerve.</p>
               <p>§. 21. VII. I will anſwer this largelier by it ſelf
in the third part: Here I only ſay, 1. ſo far as any
Ordination is neceſſary, the Ordination of a Biſhop
is neceſſary: But the queſtion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>what a Biſhop is?</hi>
If he be defined by the Power of <hi>ordaining</hi> alone,
ſome think there is no ſuch: becauſe by the old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
the Presbyters were to joyn in Ordination.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:55406:122"/>
Others think that when none elſe are there, any one
Presbyter may ordain alone. If he be defined by
the Power of <hi>Ordaining ſimply,</hi> or of having a <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
vote</hi> in ordaining, the doubt is whether every
Presbyter have not <hi>Power to ordain,</hi> as in <hi>nature</hi> the
Propagation of its own ſpecies is common to all
living things. Either Ordination is a <hi>Governing act</hi>
of ſuperiority, or a <hi>propagation of the ſpecies.</hi> If the
later, Presbyters may do it. If the former, then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
cannot ordain Biſhops as ſuch, nor Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
ordain Arch-biſhops, nor Patriarchs ordain
Patria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rhs, nor any one ordain a Pope: And yet of
old Deacons and Presbyters were made Popes, that
were not before ſo much as Biſhops, <hi>Formoſus</hi> being
the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> that had been a Biſhop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and therefore condemned and executed dead,
the Canons forbidding any to remove from one ſeat
to another, ſaith Arch-biſhop <hi>Vſher,</hi> [<hi>Jerome ad E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagr.</hi>
aſſureth us that at <hi>Alexandria</hi> from the dayes
of St. <hi>Mark</hi> till <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Presbyters made their
Biſhop, <hi>ergo</hi> they may make Presbyters: They that
can do the greater can do the leſs.] And Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
concluding that there is no proof that in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-times
there were any ſubject Presbyters di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from Biſhops, maketh it hard to be proved
that there <hi>ſhould</hi> be any ſuch at all; and whether
the making of a rank of Presbyters that have no
power of Ordination be not a changing of Scripture
order and a ſin? Yet even ſubject Presbyters (made
ſince Scripture-time) concurred in ordinations, and
do partly to this day.</p>
               <p>2. If a Biſhop be deſcribed by his actual <hi>ſuperiority</hi>
over <hi>Presbyters,</hi> then ſaith the foreſaid Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi>
there was none in Scripture-times.</p>
               <p>3. If a Biſhop be deſcribed by being over a
<hi>Church compounded</hi> of <hi>divers Pariſh Churches,</hi> (or
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:55406:122"/>
Congregations that have Altars) there can none
ſuch be proved to be in the world for about two
hundred years after Chriſt, (beſides Apoſtles and
Itinerants, whoſe Province was indefinite and not a
particular Church) not of long after ſaving at
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria.</hi> There was none ſuch when
<hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Epiſtles were written.</p>
               <p>4. But if the <hi>chief</hi> or <hi>only</hi> Paſtor of a <hi>ſingle Church</hi>
(that hath <hi>unum altare</hi>) yea of a <hi>City Church,</hi> be
to be called a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> then multitudes now called
<hi>meer Presbyters</hi> have been ſuch Biſhops, and have
ordained.</p>
               <p>And as to a Negative Vote in ordaining, that
(if it were proved it ſelf) proveth no <hi>diſtinct or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
or <hi>office,</hi> but for <hi>order-ſake</hi> a prerogative in the
ſame office. The queſtion is yet undecided even
among Schoolmen and Biſhops, whether a Biſhop
and Presbyter differ only <hi>Grad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> (as the foreman
from the reſt of the Jury, or a Juſtice of <hi>Quorum</hi>
or a chief Judge or Juſtice, from the reſt) or alſo
<hi>Ordine</hi> or <hi>Specie,</hi> (as a Juſtice and a Conſtable.)
Saith Arch-biſhop <hi>Vſher</hi> with Biſhop <hi>Reignolds</hi> and
many other Biſhops, <hi>Ad ordinem pertinet ordinare;</hi>
and they are <hi>ejuſdem ordinis;</hi> which others deny.</p>
               <p>§. 22. But not to anticipate my fuller anſwer
to this caſe, I briefly anſwer, that Gods Law or
Charter giving the Miniſterial power to the duly
qualified receiver, no Ordination doth more than to
<hi>determine</hi> (with the <hi>peoples conſent</hi>) <hi>who</hi> is the <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
receiver,</hi> and for the ſake of Order, and the
Churches notice, to <hi>declare his right</hi> and <hi>ſolemnly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
him.</hi> And God hath not appropriated this
declaring and inveſting power, ſo to their Prelates
diſtinct from Presbyters (that I ever found) as that
the Church ſhould receive none but of their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
What men decree is one thing, and what
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:55406:123"/>
God ordaineth is another. Where an order is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by men according to Gods allowance and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
rules, there the people ſhould <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him that is moſt regularly commended to
them. But if they receive one <hi>leſs regularly</hi> ſent
them, if he want nothing neceſſary to the <hi>Being</hi> of
the office, he is their Paſtor who is ſo <hi>received</hi> by
them. When Juſtices of the Peace did marry the
people in <hi>England,</hi> the Marriage was valid before
God, as truly as when the <hi>Clergy</hi> did it. The ſame
is a ſufficient deſignation of the Recipient perſon
in ſome times, places and circumſtances, which is
not at others. And when the Perſon is but <hi>Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined</hi>
of and <hi>conſented</hi> to, Gods word authorizeth
him.</p>
               <p>§. 23. VIII. The anſwer to the ſeventh queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſerveth to the eighth: They were true Biſhops
whom the Presbyters made at <hi>Alexandria;</hi> and
thoſe in the North of <hi>England</hi> who (as <hi>Beda</hi> ſaith)
were made by Scots Presbyters.</p>
               <p>§. 24. IX. He may be a true Biſhop or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that in caſes of neceſſity hath <hi>no Ordination at
all:</hi> (much more he that is ordained but by Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters)
The proof lyeth in theſe things ſet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>1. As is ſaid, <hi>Gods Law</hi> or <hi>charter</hi> giveth the
<hi>right</hi> or <hi>power</hi> to the duly <hi>qualified, determined</hi> and
<hi>choſen</hi> perſon: But in caſes of neceſſity a <hi>qualified
perſon</hi> may be <hi>determined of and choſen</hi> without any
Ordination: Therefore he may have the right or
authority without.</p>
               <p>2. Such <hi>neceſſity</hi> there may be in ſeveral caſes:
As 1. If by good <hi>books</hi> men be Converted among
Infidels where no Biſhop or Ordained Miniſter can
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:55406:123"/>
be had: They muſt not therefore forbear Church-aſſemblies
and publick worſhipping God, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing.</p>
               <p>2. In caſe that many Chriſtians be baniſhed or
caſt upon forraign lands where no Miniſter is to
be had.</p>
               <p>3. In caſe that perſecutors baniſh or deſtroy all
ordained men, and will ſuffer no other to come
among them, or them to fetch ordination.</p>
               <p>4. In caſe that all the Biſhops or Ordainers turn
either hereticks or tyrants, and will ordain none but
on ſome ſinful terms.</p>
               <p>5. In caſe that men living under Biſhops do
forge Orders and pretend that they are ordained
when they are not, and the people know it not:
Their acts now are of full authority or validity to
the innocent people, though God will condemn the
pretender for his ſin. This caſe I have oft known
my ſelf, and in my youth lived under ſuch as was
after diſcovered. And the opponents themſelves
here confeſs that Preſumption may ſerve turn to the
people, when they cannot detect it. And indeed
few people in <hi>England</hi> know any otherwiſe than by
preſumption that their Biſhops or Paſtors are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.
And if it were true that Presbyters Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
were null, yet when the ordained after great
ſtudy <hi>believeth it</hi> valid, and the people cannot know
the contrary, here is a <hi>Preſumed</hi> title both to the
ordained and the people; that is, valid adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and receptions without ordination.</p>
               <p>§. 25. 2. And indeed the like caſes prove it by
parity of reaſon.</p>
               <p>Ordination to the Miniſtry is but like Coronation
to a King, or publick marriage to Conſenters, or
like liſting and the <hi>ſacramentum militare</hi> to a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or like publick authorizing to a Phyſicion, a
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55406:124"/>
School maſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not all ſo much as <hi>baptizing</hi>
to make a Chriſtian: But an hereditary or Elected
King, is a King before his Coronation; and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
privately contracted and publickly profeſſed,
is valid before God before the ſolemnization by a
Miniſter, and in caſe of neceſſity without it: And
a Souldier may be truly ſuch by contract without
Colours or Oaths: And a man may be a Lawful
Phyſicion or School-maſter in caſe of neceſſity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Licenſe or publick authorizing. Yea one may
be a Chriſtian before God, yea and before men,
that openly profeſſeth and Voweth the Baptiſmal
Covenant, though in caſe of neceſſity (when either
a Miniſter or Water cannot he had) the waſhing be
wanting. And we are not to feign God to make a
difference here without proof, or to lay more ſtreſs
or an outward act of man and point of order than
he doth.</p>
               <p>§. 26. 3. And as to the Nature and Uſe of the
thing, <hi>Order</hi> is for the ſake of the <hi>thing ordered,</hi> and
the perſons for whoſe good it is; And therefore
not to be ſet againſt them.</p>
               <p>§. 27. 4. And Chriſt himſelf hath oft taught us
this way of judging: When he bids us, <hi>Go learn what
this meaneth, I will have mercy and not ſacrifice.</hi> And
when he oft reproveth Jews and <hi>Samaritans</hi> for ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
about circumſtances, ſetting them againſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
worſhipping of God; And when he ſaith,
The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for
the Sabbath; And <hi>Paul</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>All things are
yours,</hi> whether <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Apollos,</hi> and Let all be done to
Edification. All which tell us that the End is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Canon to the means, and to be preferred; and
that Morals muſt be preferred before Rituals, and
Rituals never ſet againſt them. And methinks they
ſhould be of this mind that deny the Scripture to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:55406:124"/>
have unchangeably fixed all Rituals; and yet confeſs
that Morals are fixedly determined.</p>
               <p>§. 28. 5. And even Popes have been taken for
Popes upon Election before Conſecration: And
Arch-biſhops with us have no ſuperiours to Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate
them, but ſuch Inferiours as promiſe them
obedience at their own Conſecration.</p>
               <p>§. 29. X. To the tenth queſtion, There be ſome
called <hi>Eraſtians</hi> who hold the King to be ſo <hi>mixta
perſona</hi> like <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> as that he is alſo the <hi>chief
Prieſt,</hi> and hath the chief power of Ordination, and
that he might adminiſter the Sacraments if he would,
and that his <hi>Appointment</hi> is an <hi>Ordination,</hi> which the
people are bound by reception of the perſon to
conſent to. There are others that think that
though the inveſting act muſt be performed by a
Biſhop, yet he is bound by the Kings choice and
command to do it, as a Miniſter of God and the
King. But as I never ſaw either of theſe well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
ſo very few comparatively receive them, and
therefore they will never unite the Churches. And
Chriſts giving the power of the Keys himſelf to
the Apoſtles and their Succeſſours in the Miniſtry,
ſeemeth to me to contradict them. Sure I am that
Chriſts Church hath not thus been founded or edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
And yet Magiſtrates have a great and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
part even in the Government of the Church,
I ſpeak not for all thoſe Popiſh Councils and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
which nullifie all Ordinations of Biſhops either
choſen or preſented by Civil Rulers or Great men
that are Secular; nor of thoſe that pronounce even
a Pope an Uſurper that is ſo introduced: But of the
Councils and practice of the ſounder ages that were
ſtill againſt this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:55406:125"/>
2. However if Clergy and people were proved
to be <hi>bound to Conſent</hi> to whomſoever the <hi>Prince</hi>
ſhall chooſe, yet till they <hi>do conſent,</hi> he is no Biſhop
to them: You may (could that be proved) prove
them <hi>culpable</hi> for <hi>not conſenting,</hi> but not prove him
<hi>their Biſhop;</hi> as the Scripture, and all Church cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
and Canons and Reaſon ſhew.</p>
               <p>§. 30. XI. To the eleventh caſe I anſwer, That
the Prieſts or people ſin who diſobey a lawful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the King (and not otherwiſe.) But ſin
or not ſin, it nullifieth not the Ordination or Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
meerly that it is againſt the will of the Prince.
All the Biſhops and Prieſts in the world (or moſt)
were made againſt the will of Princes for three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years: And Chriſt gave the Keyes to other
hands.</p>
               <p>§. 31. XII. and XIII. To the twelfth and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
caſes I anſwer together, If a heretick whoſe
denyal of an eſſential of Chriſtianity is notorious and
maketh him equal to an Apoſtate, ordain, his Act is
null as without all authority; And the mans Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
or Epiſcopacy is null, if he have not a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
cauſe and proof of it beſides or without this:
The ſame I ſay of one <hi>excommunicate</hi> for ſuch a
cauſe.</p>
               <p>But if the Hereſie be only a ſchiſm or ſome lower
errour conſiſtent with Chriſtianity and Prieſthood,
or the excommunication only on ſuch a cauſe, then
the ordination (in <hi>ſenſu paſſivo</hi>) is not null, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on that account that it was done by ſuch a <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
or excommunicate man (As is commonly
agreed on).</p>
               <p>But yet if this <hi>Biſhop</hi> or <hi>Presbyter</hi> be ordained by
a heretick or excommunicate man of a lower order,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:55406:125"/>
to this or that <hi>particular Church, caeteris paribus</hi> the
people may ſee reaſon to refuſe him; and conſent to
another that hath a <hi>better ordination;</hi> (unleſs in a
Church ſo corrupted that the Ordainers and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicators
authority is not to be regarded
and help up, (which hath too oft faln out.) But
regularly none ought to ordain a man to any
Church before the election or <hi>conſent</hi> of the flock,
though it may ſerve <hi>ad eſſe officii,</hi> if the <hi>conſent</hi> come
<hi>after.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if three Biſhops ordain one man to be Biſhop
of ſuch a Church, and three others ordain another
to the ſame, that is the true Biſhop <hi>quoad eſſe,</hi> which
the Church to which he is ordained doth <hi>accept,</hi> by
their <hi>conſent</hi> before or after. Yea though it were
the worſer party of Biſhops that ordained that
man.</p>
               <p>§. 32. As to the point of ſucceſſive-right-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
uninterrupted from the Apoſtles, I hope af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
in due place to prove, that to the Church
univerſal ſuch there hath been <hi>de facto</hi> in all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
parts: But that to any <hi>particular</hi> Church, or
any <hi>individual perſons</hi> miniſtry, ſuch uninterrupted
courſe of ordination in being, notice or proof, is
utterly unneceſſary: and that the Papacy hath no
ſuch to ſhew.</p>
               <p>§. 33. To conclude, To the <hi>Being</hi> of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of a Biſhop or Presbyter, is neceſſary only,
1. The <hi>Subject,</hi> which is a <hi>Qualified Chriſtian man,
ſufficiently notified and offered.</hi> 2. The <hi>Fundamentum
Relationis, Chriſts Law</hi> or <hi>Charter</hi> giving him his
power and obliging him to his work. 3. The mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
conſent of Paſtor and flock in the Relation to
a particular Church, is partly <hi>Diſpoſitio ſubjecti,</hi> and
partly as it is Gods means, a <hi>modus fundandi</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio
tituli.</hi> 4. The <hi>Terminus</hi> of one ordained to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55406:126"/>
the gathering of Churches <hi>ſine titulo</hi> or not to any
particular Church, is objectively firſt men uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to be called, and next men converted to be
edified: and as Effects, the work to be done and the
good to be done by it. And in thoſe ordained to
particular Churches, it is the work and the effect
on them. 5. The Correlate is, 1. Chriſt to whom
we are related as his Miniſters, as the efficient of
our office; 2. The people to whom we are related
as the end; and that 1. we are Miniſters to the
<hi>world</hi> to be converted, 2. To the Univerſal Church
to be edified, 3. and moſtly to particular Churches
to be guided. 6. The <hi>Relatum</hi> then is, <hi>ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
Authorized and obliged</hi> to <hi>Teach, Worſhip and
Rule</hi> under <hi>Chriſt the Prophet, Prieſt and King of the
Church</hi> the foreſaid flocks or Chriſtians to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
ends.</p>
               <p>§. 34. II. So much for what is neceſſary to the
<hi>Being</hi> of the ſacred office: Now what is neceſſary
to the <hi>well being.</hi> And indeed, though the Eſſential
Unity of the Church lye not upon this, yet the <hi>Peace
and Concord</hi> of it doth, and that ſo much as that no
other means without this will attain it: And the
want of what is neceſſary <hi>ad bene eſſe</hi> in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
and Biſhops, is it that hath cauſed the common
calamities.</p>
               <p>§. 35. And I. Nothing is more wanting hereto
than better qualifications in the perſons: 1. That
there be a ſtrong wit, and good acquired gifts of
knowledge, and a ſtrong and lively <hi>faith</hi> from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
illumination, and good acquaintance with the
Oracles of God: A Paſtor or Teacher ſhould not
only know the <hi>eſſentials</hi> of Chriſtianity, which every
Chriſtian knoweth, but alſo the Integrals and many
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:55406:126"/>
Accidents. And both eſſentials and integrals ſhould
be known by him by a more clear, diſtinct and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly

                     </gap>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,</hi>
(common Chriſtians) but above the better
ſort of the flock. And ſome ſtore of natural and
common knowledge called Learning is needful here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
But eſpecially more illumination, faith and
holy wiſdom, and skilfulneſs in matter, <hi>ſenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> and
method of the word of God.</p>
               <p>§. 36. Where Gods Word is not by the Teacher
clearly underſtood and firmly believed, and he is
not well acquainted with the work of his office, it is
not any formalities of Ordination, conſent or Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
that uſe to make up theſe defects as to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
To ſay what God <hi>can do,</hi> is little to this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
He can make an Aſs to preach to <hi>Balaam:</hi>
He can work by fools and ignorant men and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks:
But Scripture and all the common experience
of ages aſſureth us that it is not his ordinary way,
and that he rarely bleſſeth ſuch with great ſucceſs,
but worketh according to the qualifications of the
Inſtrument and the Receivers. And let a mans <hi>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Activity,</hi> but eſpecially, <hi>Taking utterance</hi> is

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:55406:127"/>
that whole Countreys have cauſe to bleſs God
for: I will venture to name three ſuch, 1. Mr. <hi>John
Eliots</hi> in <hi>New England,</hi> that hath tranſlated all the
Bible into that moſt barbarous language, preached
to the Indians about forty years, and gathered di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Churches among them. (And verily I would
the Jeſuites had never done worſe work than what
they did (with ſeveral Fryars) in <hi>Congo, China,
Japan, &amp;c.</hi> which is their greateſt honour.) 2. Mr.
<hi>John Dury,</hi> I hear yet living, who hath theſe fifty
years or near been employed in reconciling the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran
and Calviniſt Proteſtants, not without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
as <hi>Helmſtadt, Breme, Haſſia</hi> and other places
know; Though much more might have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
if the wars of Princes and the obſtinacy of
contentious Divines had not hindred. 3. Our Mr.
<hi>Thomas Gouge,</hi> an ejected ſilenced Miniſter, who hath
ſet up about fourſcore Schools in <hi>Wales,</hi> for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of Scholars, given away many thouſand books
to them, relieved many poor honeſt ejected Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
got the <hi>Bible,</hi> the <hi>Practice of Piety,</hi> the <hi>Whole
Duty of Man</hi> printed in <hi>Welſh,</hi> and viſiteth the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
there (though aged) once a year.</p>
               <p>Gods work muſt be done as our trade and buſineſs
and not on the by, as taking up the place and time
which mens fleſhly and worldly intereſt and work
can ſpare.</p>
               <p>Had the Church ſuch men enow as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
and as ſome have been (ſuch as <hi>Cyprian, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzene,
Baſil, Chryſoſtom, Atticus, Proclus, Hierom,
Auguſtine, Ambroſe, Martin, Salvian, &amp;c.</hi> and ſuch
as <hi>Melancthon, Bucholtzer, Bucer, Phagius, Muſculus,
Martyr, Calvin, Beza, Vrſine, Olevian, Paraeus, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero,
Placeus, Molineus, Dallaeus, Blondel, Chamier,

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:55406:128"/>
Morton, Hall, Davenant, Chillingworth, Hilderſham,
Dod, Ball, Bradſhaw, Gataker, &amp;c.</hi> and ſuch as yet
through Gods great mercy we have many, (I ſay
had the world enow ſuch as theſe, the light would
ſcatter the diſmal darkneſs, and they would carry
on Chriſts intereſt in the Churches, againſt the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of Uſurpers, hereticks and contenders:
For even a few ſuch have broke through armies of
Philiſtines to fetch men the ſacred waters of life.
And it is not ſcruples and quarrels about their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations
or ſuch like as would fruſtrate their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.</p>
               <p>§. 40. II. It is greatly needful to the <hi>well-being</hi>
of the Miniſtry and the ſucceſs, that <hi>Doctrine</hi> be <hi>kept
ſound:</hi> And therefore, 1. That the <hi>Chriſtian ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi>
be retained, and many ſubtile and curious deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be not made neceſſary: A few great, neceſſary
certain truths, are eaſilier preſerved than multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of uncertain controverted niceties.</p>
               <p>2. It is needful that ſuch as are ordained Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
be tryed men, of ſound underſtanding in that
which they muſt teach and do, and therefore that
both the <hi>ordainers</hi> and the <hi>hearers</hi> try them. This
account of their underſtanding is better than the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
of humane forms upon them for ſubſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Not but that Teachers ſhould know more than
the flock, that is, than the eſſentials; nor that I
preſume to condemn all the Churches that impoſe
their Confeſſions to be ſubſcribed in their own and
not in Scripture-words, while they keep only to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
certain things: But I ſhall afterward prove,
that this way, though tolerable, is not beſt, but <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary</hi>
and <hi>dangerous,</hi> 1. the Scripture affording
us apt words enow to form our Confeſſions in,
which are paſt Controverſie; 2. and there being
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:55406:128"/>
no probability of bounding mens Impoſitions of this
kind, when once they ſet upon this way; 3. and
moſt Confeſſions of that nature now extant having
ſome needleſs words which other Churches or good
Chriſtians do diſſent from: 4. And the ancient
Creeds underſtood (which the ordainers muſt try)
and the old Catechiſtical Verities being ſufficient to
this uſe. 5. And there being means of reſtraining
men from preaching and vending hereſies which are
more ſafe and congruous.</p>
               <p>3. I add therefore that a certain Confeſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the certaineſt and needfulleſt <hi>Integrals</hi> of
Religion ſhould or may well be drawn up as a Law,
forbidding all upon meet penalties to preach or
ſpeak againſt them; without any ſubſcribing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
or profeſſing. 4. And upon proof of the
violating of ſuch a Law, and preaching againſt ſuch
articles it is ſufficient that both the Church and the
Chriſtian Magiſtrate in their ſeveral ways may
judge them, and by juſt penalties correct them (of
which more after in due place.) For it is very hard
ſo to form long Confeſſions (beyond the old
Creeds, Lords Prayer, Decalogue, and the General
belief of Scripture) and this not in Scripture-terms,
which ſhall not have ſome words, which ſound and
honeſt Miniſters cannot aſſent to, (without lying,
which they will not do): But to ſilence many words
which yet we conceive true, and forbear ſpeaking
againſt ſome things which yet he cannot profeſs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to, there are very few ſober men but will do. And
an errour never ſpoken or written hurts not others,
nor is to be judged being not known; <hi>Non apparere</hi>
here is as <hi>non eſſe.</hi> And if it be vended, the perſon
may be judged as well as if he had ſworn, ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
or promiſed. And they that will tell us yet
what evil may befall ſecret whiſpering errours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:55406:129"/>
out ſuch oaths, ſubſcriptions or promiſes, do by
this over-doing dangerouſly undo; and leſt man
ſhould be man and the Church imperfect, on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of avoiding a poſſible unavoidable hurt, they
will ſet up knaves that will ſay any thing, ſhut out
honeſt men, and neceſſitate diviſions, confuſions
and perſecutions, where they can never ſtop on
this ſide baniſhing or killing, or continued impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
multitudes of faithful men, and never the
more attain their ends. Sound doctrine may be
kept up as far as is to be hoped, by the aforeſaid
means.</p>
               <p>§. 41. III. It is greatly needful to the <hi>well-being</hi>
of Miniſtry and Church that <hi>Gods publick worſhip</hi> and
<hi>Sacraments</hi> be kept pure. Not that any thing done
by man will be void of imperfection, but that it be
ſuch as is acceptable to God, honourable to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and profitable and ſuitable to the flock, and to
good men.</p>
               <p>To which end, 1. <hi>Chriſtian ſimplicity</hi> here alſo is
neceſſary; That it be not corrupted or clogged
with things <hi>uncertain, needleſs, curious,</hi> nor yet much
<hi>defective,</hi> not <hi>confuſed,</hi> diſorderly, much leſs erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous,
ſuperſtitious, ludicrous, undecent, falſe or
prophane.</p>
               <p>2. It is needful that men to be ordained be tryed
and known to be ſuch as can ſpeak to God and men
without ſuch unſufferable miſ-performance.</p>
               <p>3. And that they be reſponſible to the Church
and Magiſtrate for what they ſay and do.</p>
               <p>Of Liturgies I am to ſpeak in the third Part: Only
here 4. I add that <hi>fit words,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual life,</hi> are
the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> of worſhip, and one muſt not be
pleaded againſt another, nor any by <hi>Formality morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi>
holy worſhip and turn it into a <hi>Carkaſs</hi> or a lifeleſs
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:55406:129"/>
                  <hi>image;</hi> Nor yet on pretence of <hi>ſpirituality</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
the frequent uſe of the ſame words (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called <hi>Forms</hi>) whether prepared by the
ſpeaker who beſt knoweth what he needeth, or
agreed on by the Churches in fit caſes and meaſures,
for greater Concord.</p>
               <p>§. 42. IV. It is needful to the well-being of the
Miniſtry and Churches that <hi>all Paſtors</hi> in their places
be not only <hi>allowed</hi> to uſe Chriſts true <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> but
that it be <hi>expected</hi> and <hi>really done</hi> in every Church;
and that this Diſcipline be neither <hi>caſt aſide,</hi> nor
<hi>corrupted</hi> and turned into malignant war againſt the
good, nor into tyranny and uſurpation.</p>
               <p>§. 43. What this Diſcipline is, is opened before:
It is deſcribed by Chriſt in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. If thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>treſpaſs againſt thee, tell him his fault between thee
and him, If he hear thee thou haſt won thy brother. If
he hear thee not, take with thee two or three: If he hear
not them, tell the Church: If he hear not the Church,
let him be to thee as a Heathen or a publican</hi>] Serious
convincing admonition muſt be uſed (with due pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience)
to bring a ſinner to repentance. And more
publick admonition after private; And the perſon
ſentenced unfit for Chriſtian Communion, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
all he ſheweth himſelf utterly impenitent.
And he muſt be reconciled, abſolved and received
when he giveth the Church juſt proof of his true
repentance.</p>
               <p>§. 44. 1. It is a great corruption of <hi>this</hi> Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
when it is exerciſed by Lay-Chancellors or
other Lay-men, to whom the Keyes of the Church-Government
were never committed by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>§. 45. 2. It is a great corruption when it is done
only by an officer of another <hi>ſpecies</hi> than Chriſt ever
inſtituted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:55406:130"/>
§. 46. 3. It is an uſurpation and corruption
when it is done by the Paſtor of ſome other Church,
and not by the proper Paſtor of the Church where
the ſinner liveth. Such is Papal Uſurpation, when
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> will be judge in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 47. 4. Eſpecially when ſuch a pretender liveth
far from the place, where perſons and actions are
not half known, and that only by great charge and
travel. When the Paſtor and people of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Church may eaſily know all, and it belongeth to
them, who are executively either to communicate
with him or avoid him, which diſtant ſtrangers have
no opportunity or occaſion to do, further than by
declared conſent.</p>
               <p>§. 48. 5. It is a heinous corruption of it to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
men in a prophane worldly manner,
without wiſe, ſerious, patient endeavours to apply
Gods word to the ſinners caſe and conſcience, to
bring him to true repentance and amendment.</p>
               <p>§. 49. 6. And it is yet more heinous abuſe, to
excommunicate the faithful, for a fearful avoiding
ſin in ſome impoſed Oath, Covenant, Profeſſion,
promiſe, ſubſcription, or unneceſſary Ceremony or
Form; and eſpecially withal to retain in Church-Communion
multitudes of Infidels, Adulterers, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators,
Perjured perſons, drunkards, railers, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
oppreſſours, hereticks, ſcorners at piety,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it's yet worſe to caſt out men for not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
to ſome lye, falſe doctrine or wicked thing,
or for refuſing down right heinous ſin. And yet
worſe is it, to make Diſcipline an engine to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne
Kings and embroile, confound or ſubdue
Kingdoms, and enſlave the earth.</p>
               <p>§. 50. The lower firſt degrees of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which is but doctrinally to teach men and
reprove them, all Paſtors muſt uſe, or they omit
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:55406:130"/>
the eſſential work of their office. But the full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of it to <hi>excommunication</hi> or publick repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is rather needful to the <hi>Well-being</hi> than to the
<hi>Being</hi> of the Churches and Miniſtry: eſpecially
when the Chriſtian-Magiſtrate doth his part. No
doubt but the Magiſtrate may admoniſh a ſinner, and
command him to make publick Confeſſion in the
Church, and may ſhame the impenitent, and forbid
familiarity with him, yea and Church-Communion
when the caſe is notorious or judged by the Paſtor:
But it is the Paſtors office to judge of his <hi>crime,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence,
and repentance, in order to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and abſolution; and herein the Magiſtrate is
not to take on him the Paſtors work, but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Paſtor and people to do their duties.</p>
               <p>§. 51. III. So much of the neceſſaries to the <hi>Being</hi>
and <hi>Well being</hi> of the Miniſtry. As to the <hi>exerciſe,</hi>
it may be gathered from what is ſaid. There is
further neceſſary to it: 1. Natural ability, poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
liberty and opportunity; and the peoples ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,
conſent and reception. 2. And as to
the <hi>Well-being</hi> and <hi>ſucceſs,</hi> 1. The great diligence
and skill of the Miniſter; 2. The forwardneſs and
teachableneſs and zeal and concord of the flock;
3. The Concord of the Miniſters and Neighbour
Paſtors; 4. And the countenance and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of faithful Magiſtrates will much promote it.</p>

theſe Elders as the proper fixed Church-guides
of thoſe Churches; Not that they had no Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

So a Miniſter of Chriſt lawfully invited, may Preach

diſorderly, but as a helper or on juſt call.</p>
               <p>§. 3. <hi>Titus</hi> is appointed to <hi>ordain</hi> ſuch <hi>Elders</hi> in
<hi>every City,</hi> which is all one as in <hi>every Church:</hi> not
that every City then had a Church; nor that he was
to ordain Elders in the Cities that had no Churches:
nor that he was forbidden to ordain Elders in
Countrey Villages: Nor that he was tyed either to
ordain <hi>many</hi> Elders in every Church or City, or yet
to ordain but One in one City, or one Church. But
becauſe <hi>de facto</hi> there were few or no Villages then
that had Chriſtians enow to make a Church of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable
conſiſtence, therefore they were congregate
commonly in Cities and great Towns, where the
Chriſtians of the neighbour Villages joyned with
them.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Every ſuch ſingle Church then by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
order had their <hi>own Paſtor</hi> (one or more) and
every ſuch <hi>fixed Paſtor</hi> knew his <hi>proper Charge and

               <p>§. 7. <hi rend="margQuotes">A ſingle Church is a ſociety of Chriſtians of
Divine inſtitution, conſiſting of one Paſtor or more
as the Guiding part, and a competent number of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Chriſtians as the Guided part, aſſociated by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
for perſonal preſential holy Communion and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
aſſiſtance, in holy Doctrine, holy worſhip of God,
holy order, and holy Converſation, for the edification,
preſervation and ſalvation of that Church, and the
welfare of the Church univerſal of which it is a part,
and the Glorifying and Pleaſing of God our Creator,
Redeemer and Sanctifier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 8. To open the parts of this definition obſerve,</p>
               <p>1. That as in defining a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> ſo in defining
a Church, we mention the <hi>Divine Inſtitution,</hi> becauſe
it is not human Sacraments or humanly-invented
Churches that we treat of.</p>
               <p>§. 9. 2. Note that only <hi>Chriſtians</hi> make a <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Church (as is oft ſaid) <hi>Profeſſed Chriſtians</hi> the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi>
Church, and <hi>ſincere</hi> heart conſenters the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
regenerated ſaved Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:55406:132"/>
§. 10. 3. It is not any other company of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
but a <hi>ſociety</hi> or <hi>Governed aſſociation</hi> that we
ſpeak of as ſtrictly called a Church.</p>
               <p>§. 11. 4. The <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>flock</hi> are the eſſential
conſtitutive parts: It may be a <hi>Community</hi> without
a Paſtor, but not a <hi>Policie,</hi> or Eccleſiaſtical Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
While the Paſtor liveth it is ſuch a Church <hi>in
eſſe exiſtente:</hi> when the Paſtor is dead, it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent
Community, and <hi>virtually</hi> and <hi>morally</hi> a <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Church,</hi> becauſe by the Law and the peoples
reſolution another is to be ſeaſonably choſen. As
an elective Kingdom in the <hi>interregnum</hi> is virtually
and morally a Kingdom: But if the purpoſe of
choſing a Succeſſour be changed, the Kingdom and
ſo the Church is diſſolved, or changed into ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
elſe.</p>
               <p>§. 12. 5. It is indifferent to the <hi>being</hi> (though
not uſually to the well-being) of a Church, whether
it have <hi>one</hi> Paſtor or many.</p>
               <p>§. 13. 6. The number of the people though not
preciſely determined muſt be competent to the <hi>Ends</hi>
of the Society: If it be <hi>Greater</hi> or <hi>ſmaller</hi> than is <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the Ends,</hi> it is no Church of this defined
<hi>ſpecies:</hi> As Logicians ſay of the ſubject of other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations:
If a Boat or Ship be no bigger than a
ſpoon, it is not a Boat or Ship, but equivocally:
And it may be ſo big as to be no Boat or Ship,
when it is uncapable of the Ends. A Family is too
ſmall to be a City: And a Kingdom or the world
is too big. <hi>Diſpoſitio materiae eſt neceſſaria ad recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem
formae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 14. 7. It is impoſſible to be a Church without
the cement of Conſent, profeſſed or cordial: If ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
be <hi>forced</hi> into a Temple not <hi>conſenting,</hi> it is a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
and they are not a <hi>Church.</hi> If they conſent on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>meet on other occaſions,</hi> or for ſome occaſional
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:55406:133"/>
act of Religion, it is not thereby made a Church. If
they be <hi>commanded</hi> to conſent and do <hi>not,</hi> and if it
only be their <hi>duty,</hi> it maketh them not <hi>a Church,</hi>
but only proveth that they <hi>ought</hi> to be one. No
Law or command maketh a Church without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
But this Conſent may be divers waies expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
The plaineſt &amp; moſt obliging way is beſt; but
is not abſolutely neceſſary: In ſome times and caſes
it may be more needful than at others: eſpecially
at the firſt gathering and forming of a Church:
ſometime ordinary Communion or attendance ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of perſons born in that Church, may ſignifie
neceſſary Conſent. It's pity then that men ſhould
be ſo weak as ſome, to make <hi>expreſs Covenanting</hi> of
each member with the Church and Paſtor <hi>neceſſary,</hi>
and others to <hi>deride</hi> it; when it is laudable <hi>ad bene
eſſe</hi> but not <hi>neceſſary ad eſſe.</hi> But <hi>ſome ſignification of
Conſent</hi> is <hi>neceſſary ad eſſe,</hi> that is, <hi>A Conſent to be a
member of the ſociety, and ſubmit to the Paſtor, and
hold Communion with the Church to the Ends in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition.</hi>
And the <hi>plainer</hi> this is expreſt, it is the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to ſatisfie the Church and oblige the perſon.
But whether the Conſent be ſignified by words,
writings or deeds is undetermined. No man can
have the great priviledges of a member either of
the univerſal or particular Church againſt or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his will and conſent: And no Miniſter not
conſenting can be a Paſtor to any. The Relation
of a Church member conſiſteth in a <hi>Right</hi> to great
benefits due to no refuſer or unwilling perſon, and
in obligation to duty contracted by Conſent, beſides
the obligation of Gods Command. We can no
further prove any Company of Chriſtians to be a
Church than we can prove that they <hi>Conſent</hi> to
Church relation for Church Ends.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:55406:133"/>
§. 15. Chriſtianity it ſelf conſiſteth in a believing
Conſent to the Covenant of Grace; and as no man
is a Chriſtian nor hath right to Chriſt and his ſaving
benefits without Conſent, ſo no man can have right
to the Sacraments that ſeal and deliver this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and benefits without conſent: No Chriſtian in
his wits is for the Baptizing of any adult perſon
that conſenteth not; And the Lords Supper is a
ſeal of the ſame Covenant, and no more due to non-conſenters
than Baptiſm. And as it is not enough
to ſay [I am willing to be Baptized, but not by a
Miniſter, or not in the order appointed by Chriſt]
ſo it is not enough to ſay [I would have the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Communion with the Church, but I will
not ſubmit to the <hi>Miniſtry, Doctrine, Worſhip or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline</hi>
of that Church]. For this is as great a
contradiction as to ſay [I will be a ſervant to you,
but I will not work or obey but only have my wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges]
or [I will be a Soldier, but I will not fight but
be paid]. He that will have Communion with the
Church, muſt conſent to the Miniſtry, Worſhip and
Diſcipline of that Church in which Communion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth.</p>
               <p>§. 16. And if a Miniſter ſhall be ſo impoſed on,
as that any man or woman may come when they
pleaſe, and force him to give them the Sacrament of
Communion, without conſenting to take him for
their Paſtor, or to be taught or guided by him,
(yea or give him ſatisfactory notice that they know
what the Sacrament is, or who Chriſt is) he is a
ſlave and not a Paſtor: Baſer than any School-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
Philoſopher, or Phyſicion, that are not forced
to take a Scholar, Pupil or Patient againſt their will,
or that will not take them for their Teacher or
Phyſicion, and obey them.</p>
               <p>§. 17. Yet if on this pretence any Biſhop or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:55406:134"/>
will impoſe unneceſſary Covenants, promiſes
or profeſſions on the Church or any Chriſtians, and
make their wills a Law, and oblige men to give
them any other <hi>Belief</hi> or <hi>Obedience</hi> than truly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the Paſtoral Office, and ſo will ſet up a tyranny
inſtead of a Chriſtian Miniſtry, they are not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to be obeyed, leſt we be guilty of the corruption.</p>
               <p>§. 18. Yea if every <hi>integral</hi> part of the Paſtors
power and the peoples duty be put into ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
or Contracts, and the people required to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
their Conſent, as a neceſſary condition of their
Communion, it is ſinful tyranny, contrary to Gods
Law and common reaſon and the conſtant practice
of the Primitive Church. Chriſt himſelf requireth
unto Baptiſm no other Conſent as neceſſary, ſave to
the eſſentials of Religion. A thouſand <hi>Integrals</hi>
may be unknown to the Baptized, and are ſo to
moſt Chriſtians: It is our <hi>duty</hi> never to think, ſpeak
or do amiſs; But Chriſt maketh not ſuch duty ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to our Baptiſm, Chriſtianity or Church Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
It is the duty of every member of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Church, to hear, believe and obey the Paſtor
in many things where the beſt may fail. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
a man therefore for not ſubſcribing
or profeſſing aſſent to ſome unneceſſary doubtful
form, for not being convinced by a Lay-Chancellours
ſayings in a doubted caſe, or for not paying the
Court Fees, or for not appearing the day that one
is ſummoned to appear at the Chancellours Court,
and ſuch like, are but tyrannical Schiſmatical acts.</p>
               <p>The King himſelf is ſatisfied with the Oaths of
Allegiance and Supremacie, and doth not require all
the ſubjects, no nor the wiſeſt Lawyers or Judges,
to ſwear, ſubſcribe or profeſs, that they aſſent and
conſent to all the Laws of the land.</p>
               <p>§. 19. 8. The great Controverſie of the age
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:55406:134"/>
and many ages, is about the true and formal diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the loweſt <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Churches, which
is called <hi>A particular</hi> or <hi>ſingle Church,</hi> and an <hi>aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation</hi>
of Churches or a <hi>compound</hi> Church: That we
may not confound them, nor make a meer gradual
difference in the ſame ſpecies to paſs for a ſpecifick
difference. And there is more lyeth on this than
moſt obſerve. And therefore I determine it here in
the definition.</p>
               <p>1. It is commonly granted that there muſt be
Chriſtian Aſſemblies fixed for ordinary Communion
in Gods worſhip. 2. And it is agreed that theſe
Aſſemblies cannot be held without the officiating
and conduct of Miniſters of Chriſt, authorized to
teach and adminiſter the Sacraments (Though
there be alſo another ſort of aſſemblies, even for
ſome Religious exerciſes, which may be held by
Princes, Judges and other Lay-men.) 3. And it
is by <hi>Grotius</hi> and many others manifeſted, that Chriſt
formed his Churches more to the ſimilitude of the
Synagogue than the Temple ſtate of order and
worſhip. 4. And it is agreed that though Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
Evangeliſts, and other itinerant Preachers
might gather Sacred Aſſemblies where they came,
and were as tranſient temporary Paſtors to them, yet
the Apoſtles were guided by the Spirit to ſettle
Elders in every Church, as is proved before.</p>
               <p>But here men make a great and diſtracting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,
1. Whether this firſt Church-ſpecies
may not conſiſt of many Congregations, yea, many
hundreds or thouſands? 2. And whether every
Church of the loweſt ſpecies muſt have a Biſhop?</p>
               <p>§. 20. To decide this Controverſie I do in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
expreſs the ſpecification of this Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<hi>from the End,</hi> as all ſuch kind of relations
muſt be. It muſt be a fixed aſſociation of Chriſtians
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:55406:135"/>
[<hi>for perſonal preſential Communion</hi> and <hi>aſſiſtance in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doctrine, worſhip</hi> &amp;c.] This definition is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
and herein ſufficient. 1. It is neceſſary that
a difference be noted between a ſingle Church and
a <hi>Compoſition of Churches:</hi> Becauſe, 1. <hi>Several ends</hi>
ſhew us that they are not <hi>univocaly</hi> called <hi>Churches</hi>
but are of ſeveral ſorts. 2. The firſt is paſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
of Divine inſtitution: The other are by
ſome men taken for Divine, by ſome for Lawful
humane, and by ſome for ſinful inventions, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
to Gods appointed order. Things that ſo
much differ muſt be differenced.</p>
               <p>2. It is ſufficient as 1. Aſſigning the true ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
end, 2. and avoiding all extreams.</p>
               <p>1. It aſſigneth the true end: For that Churches
of ſuch a ſort, for that end were ſettled by the
Apoſtles, none deny: 2. It juſtly differenceth them
from all other ſocieties: 1. There may be occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
meetings of Part of a Church, for want of
room, or liberty, in private houſes, Chapels, or
Oratories; Independents, Presbyterians and Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſans
grant this: But theſe ſtill acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be but <hi>parts</hi> of a larger ſociety conſenting
to the ſame ſpecifying ends; and aſſembling ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with that larger body and ſometimes apart,
by reaſon of impediments, (age, weakneſs, diſtance,
weather, perſecution <hi>&amp;c</hi>): And though a Pariſh
(as many) have far more than can meet at once
together, yet, 1. Still the <hi>ends</hi> of the aſſociation is for
that <hi>ſort of Communion:</hi> 2. Some of a family may
meet one day and ſome another and ſome a third.
3. Every error and corruption altereth not the ſpecies
of the Church: The individuals that fail and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
themſelves make not Parochial Communion to
be another thing for other ends. A Parochial Church
then is the loweſt and firſt true ſpecies of Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:55406:135"/>
2. And this diſtinguiſheth it from all Compound
Churches, which are not for <hi>Preſent Ordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
in publick worſhip and Diſcipline, but only
for <hi>Diſtant Communion</hi> by Officers, Delegates or Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>1. A Synod is for Conſultation, and not purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
congregated for ordinary Communion in worſhip,
and the Churches which ſend their Biſhops or
Paſtors thither have not perſonal preſential Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
one with another ever the more; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mediate by Delegates or Officers. They may
dwell a thouſand miles or more from one another.
If all the Schoolmaſters in ſeveral Kingdoms ſhould
hold Provincial, National, or much larger Synods for
agreement in Teaching and Governing their Schools,
this would not confound ſuch a Synod with
a School, as if they were of the ſame <hi>Species</hi> of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
               <p>2. This diſtinguiſheth a ſingle Church from the
<hi>Papal</hi> pretended <hi>univerſal policy;</hi> And from a <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal</hi>
Church, and from a <hi>Provincial,</hi> and a <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan</hi>
Church in the ſenſe now uſed: For theſe are
<hi>compounded</hi> of <hi>ſeveral ſingle Churches;</hi> and they are
not a ſociety at all aſſociated for <hi>ordinary perſonal
preſential Communion in Gods worſhip</hi> and <hi>holy living:</hi>
Only they are all under one <hi>General Governour,</hi>
not uſing to <hi>meet themſelves</hi> nor ever <hi>ſeeing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
Now if to be under one abſent General Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
be that which ſpecifyeth a ſingle or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Church, then All <hi>that</hi> called the <hi>Roman Catholick
Church</hi> is but <hi>one ſingle Church,</hi> compounded of <hi>no
Churches:</hi> Or one <hi>Patriarchal</hi> or <hi>Provincial</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Church,</hi> were the <hi>loweſt ſpecies,</hi> and a <hi>ſingle
Church,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Dioceſans</hi> were none.</p>
               <p>But if that which maketh it a ſingle Church of
the loweſt ſpecies were that no Biſhop is under
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:55406:136"/>
them, but that they are under one ſole Biſhop, then
1. If all <hi>England</hi> had but one Biſhop (as many tell us
all <hi>Abaſſia</hi> hath but one called the <hi>Abunah</hi>) or if a
Patriarch put down all the Biſhops under him, this
Church of his would be but a ſingle Church. 2. And
then there would be no ſuch thing as a Church aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
for <hi>perſonal preſential Communion,</hi> which I have
proved that the Apoſtles by the ſpirit ſettled.</p>
               <p>§. 21. Thoſe that tell us that a <hi>Dioceſan Church</hi>
is the firſt or loweſt <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Divine inſtitution,
do either mean by a Dioceſs ſuch a ſociety as we
now call a <hi>Pariſh,</hi> aſſociated for <hi>preſential Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
or a Church made of <hi>many</hi> ſuch <hi>aſſociated</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>one</hi> Biſhop: If the firſt, they differ only about
the name, in which they go againſt our common
uſe, and are not intelligible by the vulgar. Though
in old Church writers a Dioceſs is ſometimes taken
as greater than a Province and ſometime as leſs, and
a Pariſh and a Dioceſs are ſometimes uſed for
the ſame, and ſometime not, yet that diverſity of
naming hindreth us not from knowing the difference
of the <hi>things,</hi> either as defined, or as commonly
now denominated <hi>a Pariſh Church</hi> and a <hi>Dioceſs.</hi>
And if their meaning be to prove that <hi>ſingle Churches</hi>
eſſentiated by their <hi>Aſſociation for Preſent perſonal
Communion,</hi> are not of Gods inſtitution, no intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
impartial Chriſtians will believe them, who
underſtand the Scripture and the ſtate of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Churches, and the reaſon of the thing. Did
men believe this, they would believe that Chriſt
had inſtituted no Church order or form at all;
Much leſs being to be ſaid for the reſt than this.
And even thoſe few that ſay that <hi>no form of Church
Government is ſettled by God,</hi> do yet grant that <hi>ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
congregations</hi> for <hi>ordinary worſhip</hi> and <hi>mutual
help with their guiding Paſtors are of Divine right;</hi> and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:55406:136"/>
ſo confute themſelves; unleſs they mean only that
Paſtoral Government of compounded Churches is
not <hi>jure Divino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 22. And ſome called Presbyterians diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
between a <hi>Worſhipping Church,</hi> and a <hi>Governed
Church,</hi> and tell us that the loweſt Governed
Church ſhould conſiſt of <hi>divers worſhipping Churches.</hi>
It <hi>may</hi> ſometime contein divers <hi>ſubordinate by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meetings</hi>
as Chapels for them that muſt needs be oft
abſent from the full aſſembly: But that it <hi>muſt</hi>
have <hi>many ſuch,</hi> or that it <hi>muſt</hi> or <hi>may</hi> have many
full ſettled worſhipping Churches, that perſonally
communicate ſtill diſtantly only in their ſeveral
Pariſhes, is contrary to Scripture, antiquity and
reaſon; and denyeth the firſt inſtituted Church
form.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thorndikes</hi> firſt books which fetch the reaſon of
Church Government from Aſſemblies, were far
truer than his later, in which he ſeemed to dream
of a humane univerſal Policy.</p>
               <p>§. 23. Either a Biſhop as diſtinct (in Order or
Degree) from Presbyters is neceſſary to the Being
of a Church of Divine inſtitution, or not: If <hi>not,</hi>
then it may be a Church without ſuch a Biſhop,
and have accordingly the rights of a Church (in
the proper political ſenſe now intended by the
word [Church.]) And then the old ſayings
would not be true, 1. Of <hi>Ignatius</hi> that [<hi>to every
Church there is one Altar,</hi> and one Biſhop <hi>with his
fellow Presbyters and Deacons</hi>] 2. Of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that
<hi>ubi Epiſcopus ibi Eccleſia:</hi> 3. Of <hi>Hierome</hi> and others,
<hi>Eccleſia eft pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bs adunat a Epiſcopo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If <hi>yea,</hi> then 1. Our Pariſh Prieſts are true Biſhops,
or elſe the Pariſh Churches are no true Churches,
but Chapels, as wanting an eſſential part. 2. And
then there are no Churches in <hi>England</hi> of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:55406:137"/>
ſpecies (for <hi>preſent Communion,</hi> &amp;c.) 3. And
then it will be hard to confute them that ſay, No
form of Church Government is <hi>jure Divino</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
of God. 4. And the <hi>form</hi> of <hi>Government</hi>
being the ſpecifying form of the <hi>policy</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi>
it will follow that God hath inſtituted <hi>no Churches</hi>
but the univerſal as headed by Chriſt. 5. And if
you will confeſs to the Separatiſts that we have <hi>no
Churches</hi> of <hi>Gods inſtitution,</hi> you will never heal their
ſeparation.</p>
               <p>§. 24. I am therefore paſt all doubt that if it
can be proved that a <hi>Biſhop is neceſſary</hi> to <hi>every true
Church,</hi> that <hi>every Pariſh ſhould have a Biſhop,</hi> and
if Arch-biſhops be good and meet, the Dioceſans
ſhould be their Arch-biſhops. And that depoſing
the Pariſh Biſhops and Churches is a heinous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
crime. But if Biſhops be not neceſſary
to a Church as ſuch, the caſe is otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>§. 25. It is therefore of great importance that
ſingle Churches be neither too <hi>great</hi> nor <hi>too ſmall.</hi>
If <hi>too ſmall,</hi> they will want 1. the honour of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
2. and the cheering help of praiſing God in
great aſſemblies, 3. and the mutual counſel and
vigilant help of many, 4. and the ſafe guidance
of many Presbyters (or a Biſhop and Presbyters)
which a few people cannot expect.</p>
               <p>And if it be too <hi>great,</hi> it will 1. hinder the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of thoſe that want room in the Church aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
2. or cauſe the Church to degenerate into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſort of ſociety.</p>
               <p>It is beſt therefore that it ſhould be as <hi>Great</hi> as
that all the people who are conſtant worſhippers
of God on the Lords days may meet in one place,
where they have liberty, Chapels or leſſer meetings
being allowed to the aged, weak, ſick or very
diſtant; yet all that are able coming ſometime to the

§. 26. The firſt degenerating of ſingle Churches
grew 1. out of the ambition of the Paſtors to, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
their power as far as they could; 2. and out
of a deſire in the people to ſee their aſſemblies as
honourable for greatneſs, number, and concord as
they might; 3. and out of a conceit that one <hi>City</hi>
ſhould have but one Biſhop and ſo be one Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Church.</p>
               <p>And hereupon at <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to have ſeveral fixed Chapels in the ſame City
and neighbour villages, and the Biſhop to ſend Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate-Presbyters
to them as he pleaſed, yet ſo that
at firſt they communicated frequently in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
Church. After that theſe Presbyters were
fixed and gave them the Sacraments where they
came: After that they were tyed to come to the
Biſhops Church for communion but at <hi>Eaſter, Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſontide,</hi>
or ſome great and rare ſeaſons: After that
they were ſo many and far off, that they were no
more obliged to come at all, or to hear or ſee
the Biſhop, but only to be diſtantly ruled by him,
and their Presbyters. Then many <hi>Countrey Pariſhes</hi>
got Biſhops: But the City Biſhops diſagreeing with
them, long after got them down.</p>
               <p>§. 27. Were it true that every City in the old
ſenſe ſhould have a Biſhop and but one, it would
follow that every <hi>Corporation</hi> or <hi>great Town</hi> or <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>
(called Market Towns) in <hi>England</hi> ſhould
have one; the word [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] ſignifying ſuch of
old. And were it ſo, and the Countrey Pariſhes
adjoyning made Chapels and diſtributed according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the ſeveral Towns, it would be like the old
ſtate of the Church about three hundred and four
hundred and five hundred years after Chriſt, and
much better than it is, though not as it ſhould
be.</p>

§. 28. 9. The remote ends are mentioned in
the definition, <hi>viz.</hi> the right worſhipping and
obeying God, the welfare of the Church-uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
(for the parts all contribute to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the whole); and the glory and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of God are the common ultimate end
of all.</p>
               <p>§. 29. By all this it appeareth what is neceſſary
to make a particular Church, and to make a man
a member of it: And that it is not neceſſary here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that the perſon be a member of a <hi>Compound
Church,</hi> Dioceſan, Provincial, Patriarchial, Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
or Papal (whatever it be to ſome of theſe
on any other accounts): Nor yet that he make
any unneceſſary profeſſion, promiſe or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>§. 30. But to the <hi>actual Communion</hi> with ſuch a
Church in exerciſe, the nature of the thing maketh
it neceſſary that the people conſent and be guided
by their Paſtor in the circumſtances belonging to
his office, which are neceſſary <hi>in genere</hi> (to be ſome
way determined) but not neceſſary <hi>in ſpecie vel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuo</hi>
(<hi>this</hi> rather than <hi>that</hi>). For inſtance: They
that will have communion in publick worſhip,
muſt meet in ſome <hi>capacious place,</hi> at ſome <hi>day,</hi>
ſome <hi>hour:</hi> If any one will not come to that <hi>place,</hi>
at that <hi>time</hi> appointed, he ſeparateth from that
Communion in that act. The Scripture muſt be
read in <hi>ſome Tranſlation,</hi> ſome <hi>order.</hi> If any ſay
I will not Communicate with you unleſs you uſe
another <hi>tranſlation,</hi> another <hi>order</hi> (without <hi>verſes,</hi>
and <hi>Chapters</hi>) or read ſome other <hi>parts,</hi> he ſo far
ſeparateth from that Church: In <hi>ſinging Pſalms</hi> if
he will not joyn in that Verſion, that Pſalm, that
Tune which the Church uſeth, he ſo far ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth:
If he will not hear the Preacher unleſs he

change his text, his method, or uſe notes, or no
notes, and ſo in ſuch caſes will not follow but lead,
he ſeparateth ſo far: for all cannot be leaders,
and be of one mind. But if the <hi>Miniſter</hi> will
ſay, [You ſhall not communicate with us unleſs
you will ſwear, or ſay, or do ſome unneceſſary
thing] it is he then that is the divider, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly

ſhall offer to defile and endanger any other Church

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:55406:139"/>
is bound by the Laws of Love and Concord, to ſend
notice to ſuch endangered neighbour Churches of
the perſon and his caſe, to prevent their hurt:
And unleſs the Church that caſt him out have cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally
forfeited their credit, other Churches are
bound by the Law of Charity to take their ſentence
as probably juſt, and not to receive the ejected
perſon, till he have either proved his ſentence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
or profeſs repentance. Not that they are

(though yet they claim no ſuperiority over
the Church that excommunicated him;) but
as neighbours and parts of the ſame Church uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal,

any Chriſtian communion that claimeth it; at leaſt
when his allegations have great probability of
truth, and ſeem to weigh down all that they have

               <p>And they may abſolve the Criminal upon a juſt

ſome ſpecial probable reaſon; it being <hi>that Church</hi>
which is moſt wronged by the ſcandal, and hath
heard the cauſes.</p>
               <p>§. 5. If any Church (in the ſame Kingdom or
another) be accuſed of violating the Chriſtian
faith, or of any crime which Chriſtians are bound
to diſown by avoiding the criminal, it is the duty
of the accuſed Church to be ready to ſatisfie the
offended Churches, by anſwering the accuſation;
not as to <hi>Rulers</hi> by the reaſons of obedience, but as
to Chriſtian neighbours by the rule of common
equity and love, and for the preſervation of unity
and peace.</p>
               <p>§. 6. If the charge be but general, (that the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:55406:139"/>
Church is guilty of hereſie or unſoundneſs in the

§. 7. <hi>But if any</hi> particular hereſie <hi>or</hi> crime <hi>be
charged on a neighbour Church, it is not to be
believed without proof, nor they to be diſclaimed
till the charge be ſent to them, and their defence

to the offended Church, 1. By denying the charge if
falſe; 2. By explaining <hi>words</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> which are
ambiguous and to be ſuſpected: 3. In controverted
caſes, by renewing the foreſaid profeſſion of all that

any opinion or practice as ſoon as they perceive
it contrary thereto; 4. And in all caſes of words or
deeds expreſsly contrary to Gods doctrine or Law, or
which they ſhall be convinced to be ſinfull, to confeſs the
errour or crime, and humbly crave the prayers of the
Church for pardon, and profeſs their purpoſe of future
reformation.]</p>
               <p>This is the means, and this is enough for the
offenders ſatisfaction: And if the errour be no real
and diſcerned denyal of any neceſſary article of
faith, but an undiſcerned remote conſequential
contrariety, with which the profeſſed holding of
that particular neceſſary article which they ſeem to
overthrow may ſtand, that Church (or perſon) is
not to be rejected from Communion, or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticated.</p>

[Chriſts natures were two before</hi> the Union, <hi>but

               <p>§ 8. No Church hath power or duty to deny
any other Communion to another Church or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but ſuch as they had power to grant them.
But to remote perſons or Churches, never ſeen
by them (as in other lands or Countries) they can
grant them no <hi>Preſential</hi> local Communion but
only <hi>Mental:</hi> Therefore they can eject them from
none but mental: They cannot take from them
what they never had nor are capable of: But we
in <hi>London</hi> never had local Communion with them
of <hi>Vienna, Paris, Rome,</hi> &amp;c. nor ever ſaw them. All
therefore that they can do is to <hi>account thoſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
or wicked or Apoſtates, whom before they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
good Chriſtians, and to declare that they
own them not as fellow Chriſtians, and would
not communicate with them, did they live among
them; and to warn others that are in danger
of them to avoid them, and this not as an act of
Government over them, but of common Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
duty for the honour of our common religion and
in charity to others. The juſt renouncing of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
or local Communion by equals, or neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
much differs from a <hi>Governing commanding

               <argument>
                  <p>VI. What is neceſſary to the Civil Peace and
concord of Chriſtians, and what is the part
of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate about Religion,
as to his promoting or tolerating mens doctrines
or practices therein.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. THe contentions of the world here call us
to reſolve theſe ſeveral doubts, 1. Who
it is that ſhould have the power of the ſword
or Magiſtracy? 2. How it is to be uſed towards all
men as men in ſociety? 3. How it is to be uſed
for the ſervice of Chriſt and good of the Church?
in encouraging ſome and tolerating others, and
keeping peace among them all?</p>
               <p>§. 2. It is here ſuppoſed that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is underſtood, and that we are agreed what
the Magiſtrates power is, at leaſt <hi>de re,</hi> though not
<hi>de definitione vel de nomine:</hi> that is, it is <hi>the power</hi>
of <hi>Governing by the ſword,</hi> that is, of <hi>making Laws,
and judging according to them, and executing them by
outward force on mens bodies or eſtates.</hi> And ſo it is
contradiſtinguiſhed from the power called <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial,
Paſtoral, Prieſtly</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtical;</hi> which is
the gathering and guiding of Chriſtian Churches
by Gods word preached, expounded and applyed.
The nature of each and their <hi>differences</hi> I have
formerly opened in a ſmall treatiſe written purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on that ſubject to end the <hi>Eraſtian</hi> controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.
(And Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> fuily openeth them in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
book of Chriſtian <hi>Obedience</hi> &amp;c.) The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:55406:141"/>
hath power forcibly to ſeize on offenders
eſtates and bodies, to impriſon, mutilate, ſcourge,
ſtrike and kill them that deſerve it, and to make
Laws and judge men unto ſuch puniſhments. The
<hi>Miniſters</hi> of Chriſt or Paſtors of the Churches have
no ſuch power but only to declare Gods Laws to
the people, and convert and baptize the wicked
unbelievers, and teach them the word and will of
Chriſt, and guide them in publick worſhip, and
Communion, and judge who is capable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and to require the people in the name of
Chriſt to love and receive the worthy, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the unworthy, and to reſolve the peoples
particular doubts, and by perſonal application
to pronounce and declare Gods acceptance of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
believers, and his promiſe to ſave them,
and his decree to condemn the ungodly, unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
impenitent and Hypocrites.</p>
               <p>§. 3. This difference is commonly acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the generality of ſober Chriſtians: But one
ſchiſmatical Writer againſt ſchiſm, will needs call
this Paſtoral power <hi>Coactive, coercive,</hi> or <hi>forcing</hi> alſo,
though he confeſs that it is not a power to touch
mens Bodies or eſtates; that ſo by caſting out all
differencing <hi>names,</hi> he may hide the acknowledged
difference of the power, and execution. And his
reaſon for this errour <hi>de nomine</hi> is, [<hi>becauſe, ſuſpenſion
and excommunication</hi> are <hi>executed</hi> on <hi>the involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and compel thoſe that believe the power, and fear
them, to obey.</hi>] Where, 1. The word <hi>compel</hi> containeth
the confuſion; compelling the mind by meer argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
being not the <hi>compelling</hi> by <hi>corporal force</hi>
which we are ſpeaking of: 2. And every man that
chideth, reproveth or threatneth a ſinner, uſually
doth it to the involuntary: And if he believe him
and yield, he will obey: And if you argue from
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:55406:142"/>
his future danger or ſuffering, it is the fear of it that
moveth him: But the fear of Gods declared threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
is not the ſame as the fear of mans ſtripes,
impriſonments, unleſs <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. And excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
worketh on no mans body further than it work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
on his conſcience to make him a voluntary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.
If you denounce damnation againſt him, it
moveth him no further than he believeth you as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
to him the word of God. If you forbid
him to be preſent or take the ſacrament, and he
refuſe to obey, you may not forcibly thruſt him
out, without the Magiſtrates conſent, but only ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
your own act of delivery, or depart: If you
command the people to avoid him, they will no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
obey you than they perceive Gods au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in your words, and are convinc't in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of their duty: And every ſermon may thus
compel men: And all that judge the ſentence unjuſt
and powerleſs, will deſpiſe it.</p>
               <p>§. 4. 1. There are four or five opinions about the
poſſeſſors of this forcing power by the ſword or
violence: The firſt of them that ſay, It belongeth
to <hi>all Magiſtrates Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>unchriſtian.</hi> The
ſecond of them that ſay, It belongeth only to
Chriſtian Magiſtrates: The third of them that ſay,
It belongeth to Orthodox Magiſtrates or Catholick
only and not to Hereticks: The fourth of thoſe
that ſay, that the <hi>Judicial part</hi> in caſes of Religion
belongeth to the Pope, Prelats or Presbyters, and
the executive only to the Magiſtrate. The fifth
of thoſe that ſay that both judicial and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
belong to the Pope, Prelats and Prieſts: I may
add a ſixth of them that ſay, it is radically in the
people.</p>
               <p>§. 5. 1. As to the firſt, it is undoubtedly true,
if you diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Office, Power,</hi> and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:55406:142"/>
the aptitude of the perſon to perform it. The
Office of a Supreme Ruler is the ſame in all, but
all are not equally capable of performing it. That
is, It is the ſame as deſcribed by Gods command of
their performance. As he commandeth infidels to
believe and communicate with the Church, but not
to communicate before they believe; ſo he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
Infidel Princes to believe and to govern
the Chriſtian affairs: but to govern them as they
are capable. The common Laws of nature, juſtice
and peace among Chriſtian ſubjects, an Infidel Prince
may and muſt ſee executed: The Laws of Chriſt
revealed ſupernaturally, he ought to underſtand,
believe and execute: But till he underſtand and
believe them, he cannot execute them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wants the diſpoſition and ability to do what he
had command and authority to do; but to do it only
in the due manner, to which his ſin diſableth him:
and ſo his Power is in him incomplete.</p>
               <p>§. 6. I confeſs it is a very hard queſtion, How
an Atheiſt can be ſaid to have any Governing right
from that God whom he denyeth, any more than
a Conſtable from the King from whom by rebellion
he revolteth: And alſo ſince all power in Heaven
and earth is given to Chriſt, how an infidel that
renounceth him can be ſaid to be authorized by
him. And I can no otherwiſe reſolve it, than by
diſtinguiſhing of a King or ruler, that is ſuch <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter,</hi>
and one that is ſuch but <hi>ſecundum quid:</hi> 2.
One that is <hi>tolerated</hi> in the place by God the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
and one that is alſo <hi>approved:</hi> 3. One that
the people are bound to obey only <hi>in tantum</hi> for
civil order, peace and ſafety; and one that they
muſt obey in matters of Religion, and whom God
will not condemn as an Uſurper in part. The caſe
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:55406:143"/>
is much the ſame as that: How far ſubjects that are
neceſſitated to live under a Fooliſh Prince muſt obey
him; which is, 1. So far as it is no wrong to another:
2. So far as is neceſſary to the due honour of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
which he poſſeſſeth: 3. So far as is needful to the
common peace, order and ſafety, and to our own,
and to the ends of Government; But ſo as ſtill
to deſire a better, and by juſt means to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
it, but not by ſin, or that which is worſe
to the Common-wealth than his Fooliſhneſs is.</p>
               <p>§. 7. II. The ſame anſwer <hi>mutatis mutandis</hi> will
ſerve to the ſecond: A Heretick truly ſo called
or a wicked man, or perſecutor hath radical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
power to all a Princes work; But he hath <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate</hi>
full power to no more than he <hi>can do</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Gods Laws: and in ſo much he is to be
obeyed, and in nothing that is againſt them.</p>
               <p>§. 8. III. The office of Orthodox Rulers is
the ſame fundamentally and radically: But their
full neareſt Power is greater becauſe their Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
is greater. But yet even they are never to
be obeyed againſt the Laws of God, which give
them their power and limit it, and are theirs and
their ſubjects higheſt rule.</p>
               <p>§. 9. IV. The Papiſts commonly, and many
Prelatiſts, and ſome Presbyterians ſay, that about
cauſes of Hereſie, or Church Communion, the
Church is to <hi>judge</hi> and the <hi>Prince</hi> to execute the
Churches judgement. But with great difference:
ſome Presbyterians only ſay that the Magiſtrate
ought upon the bare judgement of the Church to
force the excommunicate perſon from the Aſſembly
if he intrude: And the Independents will ſay as
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:55406:143"/>
much as this: And indeed this is but to keep peace;
it being due to a <hi>family</hi> that none intrude againſt
their will: But yet as a Prince or Judge may right
a ſervant, child or wife, ſo may they the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
when it is proved that they are wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
And therefore may to that end re-examine
the cauſe.</p>
               <p>But other Presbyterians and <hi>Dioceſans</hi> ſay that
when the Church hath excomunicated a man, the
Magiſtrate is bound to force him by impriſonment,
fines, or corporal penalties to repent and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled:
And the Papiſts ſay that men judged He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
he muſt burn or baniſh: which is all falſe,
as ſhall be proved in the third book.</p>
               <p>§. 10. V. The fifth ſort hold, that as <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedek</hi>
and Chriſt were both <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi> ſo
it ſhould be now: And ſome ſay (before confuted)
that every King is the chief Prieſt; and others that
the chief Prieſt ſhould be King; and that the Pope
is the univerſal Monarch having both ſwords, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and Corporal: But as to the execution,
Biſhops are to obey him in excommunicating He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
(that is, his adverſaries) and Kings in
killing or baniſhing, otherwiſe he may depoſe both
Kings and Biſhops: But againſt this more in due
place.</p>
               <p>§. 11. VI. As to the Radical power of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
I have ſaid ſo much againſt it in <hi>my Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Directory</hi> in confutation of <hi>Richard Hookers Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Policie,</hi> that I need to add no more. In
my Political Aphoriſmes I more fully opened this.
I conclude with the common Chriſtian judgment,
that the Civil Magiſtrate only hath the power of
Ruling by the ſword.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:55406:144"/>
§. 12. II. As to the ſecond caſe, <hi>How the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
power is to be uſed towards all men in Common,</hi>
I anſwer in ſhort, 1. All are agreed that the good
of the Commonwealth is the end of Government,
as the <hi>Terminus</hi> of a Relation which eſſentiateth it:
It is not government univocally but equivocally
which is not for the common good, really or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly,
intentionally, really or pretendedly.</p>
               <p>§. 13. 2. Every true member of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
hath a right to a part in this common good,
till he forfeit it.</p>
               <p>§. 14. 3. Every member hath not an equall right
becauſe all have not equal capacity or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs.</p>
               <p>§. 15. 4. It is as hard a queſtion: How far an
Atheiſt or Infidel is a rightful member of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
as how far ſuch a one may be a rightful
Governour. And, 1. It is certain that as to obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
he is a ſubject of God and man, and bound
to obey: as an Atheiſt King poſſeſſing the place
is bound to rule well, and ſmneth by not doing it:
2. It is certain that as a man, he hath a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
conditional right to the priviledges of a good
ſubject, that is, if he will be ſuch a one. 3. A
Negative not-knowing God or Chriſt, much
differeth from a poſitive denying him, rebelling and
oppoſing: As Catechumens that know not God
or Chriſt are not Anathematized as deniers and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers
are; becauſe they are teachable, and coming
towards the Church, though not of it; ſo in a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Commonwealth, ſuch are members in a large
ſenſe, <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> and forfeit not their lives,
liberties or eſtates, but are only candidates as to
the rewards and preferments and ſpecial priviledges
of worthy members, who either rule or have a
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:55406:144"/>
voice in chooſing Rulers. But being willing to learn
to know God and Chriſt, they ſhould with
love and kindneſs be encouraged and drawn on.
4. But in a Kingdom of ſuch as know not God or
Chriſt they muſt have rule and priviledges becauſe
there are no fitter to have them: But ſuch a
Kingdom is to God no otherwiſe his ſubjects than
ſuch a perſon before deſcribed is. 5. But thoſe
that after ſufficient inſtruction deny and oppoſe
God as God, do forfeit the protection and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
liberty of ſubjects in a Kingdom, that confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
God; and thoſe that deny Chriſt in a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Kingdom and oppoſe him as Chriſt, do forfeit
the Common protection of Chriſtian ſubjects: But
wiſe men think that becauſe the Deity is of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Revelation by all Gods works to all men as
men, and Chriſt only of ſupernatural revelation
by the Goſpel and the work of faith more difficult,
therefore the oppoſers of a Deity, forfeit their
lives if they continue obſtinate; but the enemies
of Chriſt only forfeit their place in a Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
and ſhould be baniſhed if obſtinate: As
the meer ignorance of him, keepeth ſuch out of the
Church till they believe: But then denying or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
Chriſt deſerveth ejection with anathema.</p>
               <p>§. 16. 5. All men then muſt by the Magiſtrate be
uſed as men according to their natures, and not
as <hi>bruits,</hi> and therefore muſt be inſtructed and
ruled by laws of reaſon, and led towards Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
and the hopes of future felicity: And if
they ſin againſt the Laws of humanity, they ſo far
forfeit the priviledges of humanity; or are to be
puniſhed as the ends of the ſociety require.</p>
               <p>§. 17. III. To the third queſtion, how Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracie
(or the ſword or forcing power) is to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:55406:145"/>
be <hi>uſed,</hi> for <hi>Chriſt and for his Church,</hi> and on <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
as ſuch, who is to be rewarded,</hi> puniſhed or
<hi>tolerated</hi> for <hi>the Churches Vnity</hi> and <hi>edification</hi> and
<hi>preſervation.</hi> I anſwer, I. In general; Men ſhould be
uſed as men; Chriſtians as Chriſtians: The weak as
weak; The ſtrong as ſtrong, and the eminently wiſe
and good as ſuch: The criminal as criminal. And
all this with chief reſpect to the laws of God and
the common good.</p>
               <p>§. 18. II. More particularly, 1. Negatively:
1. The Magiſtrate cannot make men <hi>Believers</hi> by
the ſword: He cannot make the ignorant wiſe, nor
the wicked godly at the heart.</p>
               <p>§. 19. 2. He ought not to force men to lie, by
profeſſing themſelves to be what they are not, or
to know or believe or do what they do not: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he may not make a Law that <hi>All men ſhall
be compelled</hi> to <hi>profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, or Godly
perſons,</hi> or any that are not ſuch indeed; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
none muſt be compelled to it, becauſe no
man knoweth who are ſuch: but every man muſt
be the voluntary profeſſor of his own faith and
piety.</p>
               <p>§. 20. 3. He ought not to force the weak to
profeſs that they are ſtrong, or know or believe
more than they do: either to profeſs thoſe meaſures
of wiſdom, thoſe Articles of faith that are not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials,
or thoſe meaſures of affection or practice
which are proper to ſtrong Chriſtians: And for not
profeſſing ſuch things, or <hi>Covenanting</hi> accordingly
he may not deny them any priviledges belonging to
Chriſtians as ſuch, but only ſuch as are proper to
wiſer and ſtronger Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>§. 21. 4. Princes and other Magiſtrates may not
make themſelves the Lictors or executioners to the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:55406:145"/>
Clergie, to puniſh men with fines, impriſonment,
baniſhment or death <hi>eo nomine</hi> becauſe they ſtand
excommunicate by the Clergy, without trying whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was rightly or wrongfully done, and whether
the crime be ſuch as ſhould be ſo puniſhed by them.
Excommunication if juſt is it ſelf a dreadful puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
&amp; no man is to be puniſhed for being puniſhed.
If it be for not <hi>repenting,</hi> 1. He muſt firſt be ſure that it
was a crime: 2. And that God hath appointed this
way to force men to repentance: 3. And that ſuch
forced repentance muſt go for true.</p>
               <p>But when the excommunication is unjuſt, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
muſt not ſecond it with oppreſſion: It is
enough to be ſo much wronged by the Clergy, more
ſhould not be added for that cauſe, nor muſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
ſuppoſe the Clergy to be unerring, and ſo
lay by the perſon of a Judge himſelf and become the
blind executioner of their ſentence.</p>
               <p>§. 22. II. Affirmatively; The Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
Office is, [<hi rend="margQuotes">To promote the common
good of the people, and their ſalvation, and the

needful thereunto: 2. He muſt by juſt means reſtrain
and puniſh the groſs violators of Gods Laws; and

that are needful, plain
and certain, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is beſt in the very
words of Scripture which
all agree to, and this to be conſented to by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
and preferred Miniſters, who ſhall have the
Temples and publick countenance and maintenance.</p>
               <p>III. A Catalogue of Doctrines of ſo great uſe
as that none be ſuffered to <hi>Preach</hi> or privately
diſpute againſt them; And a Catalogue of ſins,
which none may commit: And thoſe that break either
of theſe Laws, and ſubſcribe not to the Eſſentials firſt
mentioned to be judged Intolerable (till reformed) in
the Miniſtry. Who ſhall be judged Intolerable
in the Commonwealth, the firſt rank of enemies here
conſidered ſheweth. And what private members
ſhall be Tolerated in the Churches may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from what is ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe that joyn
with the Tolerated Miniſters, and violate not this
laſt Prohibiting Law, by incorrigible oppoſition to
the Truth here intimated, or by wicked or unpeace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
behaviour.</p>
               <p>§. 43. It is here ſuppoſed that the Catalogue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
on the Approved maintained Miniſters be
not of too many things, nor of any, but great
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:55406:149"/>
and ſure: And they that will needs ſtretch it to the
utmoſt of plain and certain truths, need no other
Catalogue of the third rank: And were it not that
men are very inclinable to overdo in rigor againſt
diſſenters, I ſhould rather leave out the third Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue;
And that which the Tolerated be forbidden
to Preach againſt, ſhould be but the ſame Catalogue
which the Approved muſt ſubſcribe, and ſo two will
be enough, ſo be it that all unpeaceable preaching as
to the manner be reſtrained by the Juſtices of peace.</p>
               <p>§. 44. This rule the antient Churches followed:
and when they ſuppreſſed the intolerable hereſies,
they tolerated the Novatians even in <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi>
And the worſt Biſhops were moſt againſt their
toleration (as <hi>Neſtorius</hi> and ſuch like), and the
beſt dealt gentlieſt and lovingly with them, and
thereby did more for the peace of the Church
than the overdoers. The Lordly turbulency of
<hi>Theophilus</hi> and <hi>Cyril</hi> with <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s ſilly paſſion,
ſet all on a flame againſt <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and his Joanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
which the wiſdom and peace of two peaceable
Patriarchs ſoon quenched.</p>
               <p>§. 45. That the Integrals to be ſubſcribed by
the Approved Miniſters be not too many, is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
1. Becauſe it is not many things that are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to be preached: Read the preachings or doctrine
of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and you may ſoon ſee
this: And they need to ſubſcribe no more than
they need to preach. 2. Becauſe elſe overdoing
will be undoing; and unavoidable diſſent will cauſe
diviſions and diſtractions.</p>
               <p>And for the ſame reaſon it ſhould be written if
poſſible in the very words of Scripture, which
though ſome deride, is of great moment: Becauſe
nothing more tendeth to avoid diviſion by diſſent:
For all are agreed of the truth of the Scripture,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:55406:149"/>
and even they that underſtand not the words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
them to be true, and take not the liberty to
except againſt them as they will againſt the words
of fallible men. The objections againſt this are
anſwered after.</p>
               <p>§. 46. Penalties muſt not be equal, as offences are
not equal: As the <hi>Approved</hi> are not <hi>ejected</hi> for every
fault, ſo the Tolerated are not to be <hi>ſilenced</hi> for every
fault. A prophane ſwearer payeth twelve pence an
oath: And ſome faults of preachers are not worſe:
But ſome are ſo great at firſt, and others by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of impenitencie and incorrigibleneſs, as that
they forfeit their Toleration.</p>
               <p>§. 47. Thoſe are to be accounted <hi>Intolerable</hi>
who do more hurt than good, and whoſe ſilencing
and ſuppreſſion will do more good than harm.
All men are faulty and do ſome harm: And few
are ſo bad as to do no good: But that which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth,
muſt prevail in the judgement of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.
And yet when the ſuppreſſion of a hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
perſon will do by accident much more hurt to the
Church or Commonwealth than the doth (as it may
fall out) he is not to be ſo hurtfully ſuppreſſed.</p>
               <p>§. 48. Thoſe therefore are intolerable in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
1. who through ignorance or diſability are
utterly inſufficient for the neceſſary acts of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
and ſo will marr and diſgrace the work
appointed them, and make Religious exerciſes
ſcorned.</p>
               <p>2. Thoſe that are hereticks in a ſtrict ſenſe, that
is, that deny any Article of faith or practice ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to Salvation, or preach that which plainly
overthroweth it.</p>
               <p>3. Thoſe that are againſt or utterly corrupt any
neceſſary part of Church-order, or of the publick
worſhip of God; ſo as that God accepteth not
worſhip ſo corrupted, or that it tendethto more hurt
than good to the aſſembly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:55406:150"/>
4. thoſe that will not profeſs the Eſſentials of
Chriſtianity, Miniſtry and Church Communion.</p>
               <p>5. Thoſe that live ſuch ſcandalous and wicked
lives as diſgrace the Miniſtry, and do more hurt
than they do good.</p>
               <p>6. Thoſe that will not promiſe and perform
<hi>neceſſary diligence</hi> in the work of the Miniſtry
which they undertake, but idly neglect the flock.</p>
               <p>7. Thoſe that by malignity and miſapplication
of truth, turn their preaching or diſcourſe to the
reproach of ſerious godlineſs, making people think
that it is needleſs, or hypocriſie.</p>
               <p>8. Thoſe that will not promiſe and perform ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the ſupream Governours of the Kingdom
or Republick.</p>
               <p>9. Thoſe that will not forbear ſuch reviling of
Tolerable diſſenters, as tendeth plainly to deſtroy
love and peace, and to turn publick aſſemblies
into ſtages of malignant ſtrife.</p>
               <p>10. Thoſe whoſe Religion or opinion is for burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
deſtroying or exterminating either all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,
or the innocent or tolerable, while they
call them Hereticks; or that are for the ſubjecting

               <p>§. 49. The <hi>Approved, Tolerable</hi> and <hi>Intolerable</hi> thus
diſtinguiſhed and thus uſed by the Magiſtrate, will
beſt anſwer the ends and intereſt of Chriſtianity, and
the Laws of Chriſt, and will do as much to preſerve

Love, Unity and peace as is on earth to be expected
which all other contrary ways will unavoidably

               <p>§. 1. 1. SOme object againſt <hi>any reſtraint</hi> in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>

of <hi>one ſort</hi> before others, and ſay that the
Magiſtrate ſhould equally tolerate all, or elſe he
will diſcontent thoſe that are but tolerated, and
much more thoſe whom he uſeth as intolerable;
But this is ſo unchriſtian and unreaſonable that I
think it needleſs to ſay much againſt it. Few men
that believe there is a God and a life to come,
and that religion is mans duty and intereſt, can
believe that God hath appointed Government for
no higher ends than our bodily peace and ſafety.
If men once believed what divers Popes have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
that the office of the Prieſt excelleth the
Kings, as far as the ſoul excelleth the body, and as
the Sun excelleth the Stars; it would cauſe religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
people to ſet as light by Kings, as they do by
theſe worldly things which Kings have power over.</p>
               <p>§. 2. 2. <hi>Obj.</hi> But each party think themſelves in
the right, and Kings and Parliaments are falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and if they trouble thoſe that are in the right, they are
perſecutors: if others, yet they ſhall be accounted ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Being</hi> is before <hi>Thinking:</hi> either the <hi>King</hi>
is in the right, or the <hi>ſufferers:</hi> If <hi>they</hi> are in the
Right, either their cauſe is <hi>evident</hi> and ſuch as a
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:55406:151"/>
willing diligent perſon may underſtand, or not.
If it be clear, the Prince is a <hi>perſecutor</hi> that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
them. If it be too hard for him, he is unfit
to be an active man againſt them; for he cannot
do it in faith and therefore ſinneth, and may be
a perſecutor for ought he knoweth. If he or
they be ignorant through wilfulneſs or negligence,
it will not excuſe them. If their cauſe ſeem clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good to them, and clearly bad to him, one
of them muſt needs be ſinfully erroneous; and it
is the <hi>erring party</hi> that God is againſt, who will be
the final judge.</p>
               <p>§. 3. 3. <hi>Obj.</hi> But it is a thing that Princes and
Stateſmen are ignorant of: they are not bred up in the
ſtudy of Religion: Biſhops and Clergy-men are liker to
underſtand ſuch matters, and it is their work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. God hath commanded that Kings and
all Rulers ſtudy his word: As Juſtices ſhould
know the Kings Laws, the King and they ſhould
know Gods Laws. It is as truly their office to
Rule by them, as it is the Miniſters to Teach and
Guide by them. Government by the Sword and
Church Government by the word and Keys are to
be exerciſed according to the ſame Law of God; and
both have their uſe about cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, in
which we ſwear the King to be ſupreme as to
that part which is to be done by the ſword or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
force.</p>
               <p>2. This objection long uſed by Popes and their
Prelates hath been ſufficiently confuted by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
Church hiſtory putteth us quite paſt
doubt that it went ill with the Church while the
Clergy had all the power of Religion: It hath
been Popes and Prelates and Prieſts that have
worſe corrupted Religion and diſgraced the Church
and embroiled the world in religious quarrels and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:55406:151"/>
Schiſms, than ever Emperors and Kings have
done. Thirteen hundred years lamentable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
confuteth ſuch thoughts as many have and
as I have ſometime been tempted to my ſelf,
how well it would go with the Church if the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
of all matters of Religion were rather in the hands
of the Biſhops and Clergy, than of Kings and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Nay rarely are any Magiſtrates ſo hot for
perſecution and religious cruelty as the Biſhops
and Clergy or thoſe that are ſtirr'd up by them,
againſt diſſenters or one another. The doleful
devaſtations and Schiſms about Neſtorianiſm, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychinniſm,
and ſuch like, were cauſed more by
the Biſhops than the Magiſtrates: And though <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi>
and <hi>Valens</hi> did much againſt truth and
peace, it was by their Clergies inſtigation. He
that will conſider the lives of <hi>Conſtantine M. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi>

&amp;c. and of <hi>Charles, Otho,</hi> the <hi>Henries</hi> and others
ſince in the Weſt, will ſee how much ado the
Emperors had to keep the Prelates from Schiſms,
and confuſions: And he that readeth but the Laws
of the <hi>Spaniſh, French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings, will ſee
what ado Kings had to keep the Biſhops and Prieſts
from filthy fornication and utter corruption of
their function.</p>
               <p>§. 4. 4. <hi>Obj.</hi> But if Princes meddle with Paſtors,
Preachers and Religion, when far more of them are
bad than good, and erroneous than in the right, it
muſt follow that more good will be hindered by them than
evil, and in moſt places the beſt will be perſecuted by
them, and the worſt approved and preferred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. And was it not ſo, and worſe under
the Popes and their Prelates? Let their own hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
judge. 2. Nay it hath been ill Clergy men
that have inſtigated Princes to do moſt of the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:55406:152"/>
chief to the Church that they have done. 3. This
tells us the calamitous caſe of mankind, but not
at all how to help it. 4. This argument ſhould
urge Princes to amend, but not to neglect their
duty for fear of doing it amiſs. By the like argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Moſcovy</hi> they have put down preaching,
ſaying, Moſt will preach amiſs. And others put
down all praying ſave the reading of impoſed
words, ſaying that moſt elſe will pray amiſs. And
ſo theſe would reſtrain Princes from Governing
Biſhops and Preachers and matters Eccleſiaſtical,
ſaying, Elſe they will do moſt amiſs. 5. But it is
ſuppoſed that Princes have their Councils; And
as they conſult with Lawyers in matters of Law,
and with Souldiers in matters of War, and with
Phyſicions in matters of that profeſſion, ſo they
will conſult with Divines (as they are called) in
matters of Divinity and Religion.</p>
               <p>§. 5. <hi>Obj.</hi> 5. But Religion is to be perſwaded and
not forced, which will but make hypocrites.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We cannot force men to know or believe;
and we ought not to force them to lie: But they

               <p>§. 6. <hi>Obj.</hi> 6. But that which you think wrong ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
right to them, and every mans Conſcience is his
Law, and he muſt obey it, and whatſoever is not of
faith is ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. None but the Atheiſt or irreligious take
all. Religion to be uncertain: Man is naturally <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal

2. No mans Conſcience is his Law no more than
it is the Law of the land. It is but as his eye in
reading it, a <hi>diſcerner</hi> of the Law. And miſtake
is not diſcerning.</p>
               <p>3. No man ought to take evil for good, nor to
do evil becauſe he thinketh it good; but firſt to
uſe means for information, and then to judge bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and then to do better.</p>
               <p>4. Though whatever is not of ſaith is ſin, yet
whatever is of errour is of ſin too and not of faith.
And we are not for forcing men againſt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to any thing unneceſſary, or any thing
which they are uncapable of, but for reſtraining
them from that miſchief which an erring judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
leaveth them to, and putting them on neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
duty which they can do: ſhould they not be
forced to feed their children if their Conſciences
be againſt it? Or to pay their debts, or their
taxes, tythes and other dues?</p>
               <p>§. 7. <hi>Obj.</hi> 7. On the other ſide ſome (and more)
will ſay that any toleration of diverſity in Religion, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
of Aſſemblies, is contrary to the unity and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
which ſhould be among Chriſtians, and will cheriſh
heart-burnings, and cauſe differences in the State, and
foment ſeditions and rebellious, no diſcord having worſe
effects than thoſe about religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To tell us that men are dark and
ſelfiſh and proud and paſſionate, and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious,
and that this is the calamity that ſin hath
brought on all the world, is but to tell us what we
all muſt know: But what's that to the Cure? All
ſin, and all diſcord is contrary to our deſired con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
and is our reproach: But ſhall no ſinners
therefore be endured? <hi>Ye ſuffer fools gladly,</hi> ſaith
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſeeing you yourſelves are wiſe. 2. Will

Will men that really have any religion forſake it
for fear of any thing that you can do againſt them?
It is not Religion if it ſet not God above man.
When they ſuffer by you, will they like you or
your opinions the better for hurting them? or the
worſe? If ever you let them out of priſon, will
they not come out more alienated by exaſperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
If you force the timerous or hypocrites to
diſſemble to ſave the fleſh, will they not hate you
and your <hi>doctrine</hi> the more as that which ſoul and
body are both oppreſſed by? And will not their
ſufferings move compaſſion in the people, and your
cruelty alienate thoſe that elſe would never have
forſaken you (what a ſhameful thing is it to hear
and read mens tragical outcries againſt neceſſary
toleration (which Chriſtianity and humanity plead
for) while they are the cauſes of that which they
<hi>exclaim</hi> againſt, and are furiouſly making it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold

evil, cauſe it not by your unneceſſary Laws and
Canons, and making engines to tear the Church
in pieces, which by the ancient ſimplicity and

a meaſure of Love and Peace, as may be here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.
Are men liker to hate you, or to plot
rebellions for being <hi>gently uſed</hi> as men, or <hi>cruelly</hi>

compariſon of thoſe that are diſſenters from the
Pope, if he get them in his power. Though it
be but for refuſing to deny belief to all mens ſenſes,
and conſequently to Gods natural revelation. If
you <hi>can</hi> cure all mens errours, do it (but begin at
home). But killing is not curing in the ſenſe of
wiſe Phyſicions or Patients. Your way cureth er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
as the man that was angry with the Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs
for ſhewing him his ugly face, did cure
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:55406:153"/>
it by breaking it into twenty pieces, and then it
ſhewed him twenty ugly faces for one.</p>
               <p>There are no tolerated ſorts among us here that
are more accuſed by all for ſeditiouſneſs and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
when they once got ſome ſeeming ſtrength, than
the Anabaptiſts and the people called the fifth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
men. But have they ever (even at <hi>Munſter</hi>)
made any ſuch horrid ſlaughters in the world as the
great enemies of Toleration have done? Did they
ever murder 200000 people that lived peaceably
at once, as the <hi>Friſh</hi> Papiſts did? Or forty thouſand
if not (as ſome ſay) twice as many, as they did
at the <hi>French</hi> Maſſacre? Or ſo many thouſands
if not millions (ſay ſome) as were kill'd of the
<hi>Albigenſes</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes</hi> in <hi>France, Piedmont, Italy,

the Inquiſition hath done? Or did they ever uſe
Emperors as <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth and fifth, and <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi>
were uſed? Or kill two Kings ſucceſſively;
as <hi>Henry</hi> the third and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France</hi>
were killed.</p>
               <p>Nay did ever the Novatians, yea or the furious
Prelatical Donatiſts make ſuch bloody work as hath
been made by Biſhops, Councils and Emperors
for the ſuppreſſing of diſſenters? What hath
been done at <hi>Alexandria, Antioch, Conſtantinople,
Jeruſalem, Rome,</hi> I have elſewhere ſhewed. The
late publiſher of his travels in <hi>Egypt (Vaneſlup</hi> a

deprived of her ancient ſort of inhabitants, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
for following <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> and that <hi>Juſtinian</hi>
killed no leſs than <hi>two hundred thouſand of them.</hi>
I believe not his number. But if this be true,
the tyrannical hereticaters are the Pikes in the

with more errors and more palpable, than the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
who are moſt againſt Toleration? 2. The
meerly Tolerated being diſcountenanced by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
have leſs advantage to deceive men than the
<hi>Approved</hi> if as erroneous. 3. We plead for reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men from poiſoning ſouls by dangerous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
and not for tolerating that. But every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter
or miſtaking perſon is not ſuch a poiſoner
of ſouls. 4. The Tolerated ſpeaking in publick are
more reſponſible and more eaſily convicted of their
fault, than thoſe that do it ſecretly where there
are no witneſſes; And this your violence cannot
hinder. 5. As their errors will be openly known,
ſo you have advantage openly to confute them, and
to keep the people right.</p>
               <p>§. 9. <hi>Obj.</hi> 9. But diſſenting teachers will unſay what
the Approved Teachers ſay, and hinder their work, and
ſteal the hearts of the people from them, and make their
calling bur denſome to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. They are to be reſtrained from preaching
againſt any great ſure neceſſary doctrine or practice.</p>
               <p>2. Chriſt never ſent out his Miniſters with a
ſuppoſition that none ſhould contradict them; but
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:55406:154"/>
with that light and ſtrength which which was to
overcome contradiction. Do you ſo debaſe and
diſgrace your ſelves and your religion, as to think
or ſay that it cannot proſper if any be but ſuffered
to ſpeak againſt you?</p>
               <p>3. Doth the work of Chriſt afford you no more
comfort, than ſhall leave you thus burdened if any
will but gainſay you? How unlike Chriſts Miniſters
or Chriſtians do you ſpeak?</p>
               <p>4. Have not you that have ſound doctrine, Gods
promiſe, the Rulers countenance, maintenance and
honour, much more to ſupport you, than they that
are ſuppoſed to have none of theſe?</p>
               <p>5. If you tolerate not their open preaching,
their ſecret endeavours, and your ſeeming cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
together, will alienate more from you, and
make you not only neglected but abhorred.</p>
               <p>§. 10. <hi>Obj.</hi> 10. The number of the erroneous will
increaſe by a toleration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And the number of the ungodly that will
ſay, ſwear, or do any thing for worldly reſpects;
will increaſe by your miſtaken way of ſuppreſſing
them. 2. It is better that tolerated honeſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
erring in tolerable caſes do increaſe, than that
they be baniſhed or deſtroyed, and a worldly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
thereby lift up, abhorred by the religious,
and heading the malignant and prophane againſt
all ſerious piety.</p>
               <p>3. Violence and Tyranny againſt good men for
tolerable error, hath already increaſed that ſame
error more than wiſer means would have done,
and hath introduced worſe.</p>
               <p>4. We have found where I lived (in <hi>Worceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>
and the neighbouring Counties, <hi>Warwickſhire,
Staffordſhire</hi> and <hi>Shropſhire</hi>) in the late times of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in Religion, that an unanimous, humble,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:55406:155"/>
able, diligent Miniſtry frequently and lovingly
conſulting and all agreeing, did more effectually ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
hereſie, error and ſchiſm, than violence ever
did or would have done. The next Pariſh to me
had, a grave, learned, ſober Anabaptiſt, B. of D.
that had great advantages; and yet almoſt all our
flocks were kept from the infection: In my own
Charge (a great Pariſh of many thouſand ſouls) where
I was above 14. years, we had no one ſeparate aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
nor one ſectary that I remember, ſave two
or three apoſtate Infidels (or Socinians) and two
or three Papiſts. A faithful agreeing Miniſtry
with the advantage of a good cauſe, we found
ſufficient to ſhame all the Sectaries, and fruſtrate
moſt of their endeavours, and to keep the people
unanimous and right.</p>
               <p>§. 11. <hi>Obj.</hi> 11. If every one that will may ſet up
for a preacher and gather a congregation, or if the
ignorant people ſhall all chooſe their own Teachers, we
ſhall have ignorance, error and confuſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I told you that every one that will
may not turn preacher. The <hi>Tolerated</hi> are to paſs
their proper tryal as well as the <hi>Approved,</hi> before
they receive their Toleration.</p>
               <p>2. The Churches commonly choſe their own
Biſhops or Paſtors for near a thouſand years after
Chriſt, or had a Negative conſenting voice at leaſt:
And many Canons did confirm it, yea and decrees
of the Popes themſelves: yea when the Popes and
Emperours in <hi>Germany</hi> (the <hi>Henries &amp;c.</hi>) ſtrove
about the inveſting power, it was yet granted that
the people ſhould have their electing or free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rſenting
power continued. And no man can be
really their Paſtor till they conſent: And your contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
courſe will make worſe work.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:55406:155"/>
3. Our way is of all other the ſafeſt: Two or
three locks keep the Churches treaſure ſafeſt.
We ſay, none ſhall be approved but by three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
conſent, nor Tolerated but by two or three.
The <hi>Ordainers</hi> are to conſent to him as a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and
the <hi>people as their Miniſter;</hi> and the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> as a
<hi>Tolerated Miniſter:</hi> or if any <hi>unordained</hi> be tolerated
(which I determine not) at leaſt the <hi>People</hi> and the
<hi>Ruler</hi> muſt conſent, and that upon a juſt teſtimonial
of his ability, Piety and fitneſs for ſuch toleration.</p>
               <p>4. And yet we ſpeak this but of <hi>Paſtors;</hi> not
denying but <hi>Teachers,</hi> and <hi>Catechizers</hi> may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
on children, infidels, and others that are not in
Communion with any particular Church.</p>
               <p>§. 12. <hi>Obj.</hi> 12. You would have the Church Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
at leaſt for the Tolerated, in Scripture phraſe:
And what's the phraſe without the right ſence? How
eaſily may Hereticks creep in under ſuch phraſes as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
men put ſeveral ſences on?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Is there not Truth enough in all the
Bible in intelligible words neceſſary to ſalvation
and Church Communion? Is the Scripture as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient
as the Papiſts make it, without their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemental
Traditions or Decrees? And had not the
Holy Ghoſt skill to ſpeak even things neceſſary in
tolerable intelligible phraſe? who are they that are
wiſer to reform it?</p>
               <p>2. Almoſt all words are ambiguous and may
be diverſly underſtood: your own invented expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
will be as liable to be wreſted by Hereticks as
the Scripture. It is ridculous preſumption to talk
of making any Law, profeſſion or Articles that
a falſe Heretick may not ſubſcribe to. 3. But there
is another remedy againſt them: while they <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal</hi>
their hereſie, they are no <hi>Hereticks</hi> in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church. <hi>Non apparere</hi> here is as <hi>non eſſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:55406:156"/>
when they divulge it, the judicatures muſt correct
them. It's vanity to dream that the Law is faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as long as it is but ſuch as men can <hi>break:</hi> or
that any Law can be made which none can break:
But as they break them, they are to be judged.
4. And we muſt not rack and divide the good, for
fear of ſuch letting in the bad. The Churches
Concord and peace is of more regard than the
keeping out of ſome ſecret Heretick: yea of old
he was not called a Heretick that did not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from the Church. All good men agree to
the word of God, but all will not agree to every
word of yours.</p>
               <p>§. 13. I conclude, In humane affairs there is
nothing without imperfection, weakneſs and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity:
and to pretend the cure of theſe by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities,
or miſchiefs, is the way of ſuch as
theſe Thirteen hundred years have been the true
ſchiſmaticks and diſtracters of the Church.</p>

I. Of the nature and acts of God.</p>
                  <p>1. The God is corporeal or material.</p>

ſome finite ſpace.</p>
                  <p>3. That God hath parts and is diviſible.</p>
                  <p>4. That God hath the parts or ſhape of humane
bodies, head, face, eyes, hands, feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p>5. That God is the Univerſe or whole world,
or that he is meerly or properly the ſoul of the
world, as his body; and ſo but a part of the world.</p>
                  <p>6. That God or any eſſential of God, is really
new, changeable or finite.</p>
                  <p>7. The God can ſuffer hurt, or hath proper real
grief and paſſion.</p>

or will be, and all that is intelligible.</p>
                  <p>9. That Gods own eſſential perfection, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and love is not the ultimate and chief object
of mans love, to be loved chiefly for himſelf as
moſt amiable, and above our ſelves and all things
created, but that he is only or chiefly to be loved
as our Benefactor, or as good to the creature;
And ſo that man is Gods end, and his own chief
and ultimate end, and not God mans chief and ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
end.</p>
                  <p>10. That God is the firſt and chief, or any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
cauſe of ſin; or that God doth by efficient
premotion as the firſt cauſe predetermine every
mans mind, will, tongue and members, to every
forbidden act that is done, as it is determined to

circumſtances and modes: and ſo to every lie,

                  <p>12. That God may or ever doth lie; or by his

neceſſitate innocent perſons <hi>de facto,</hi> or oblige any
as a duty, to believe that which is falſe.</p>
                  <p>13. That God hath ſo committed the affairs of

more or otherwiſe than he doth, though he
would.</p>
                  <p>16. That Gods will is not the fountain, and the
meaſure of all created good: or that things are not
good becauſe they are willed by God.</p>

be a true or proper cauſe of ſomewhat (not only
relative, but) real in God, or make a real change
on God.</p>
                  <p>19. That God hath no vindictive, or puniſhing,
and no rewarding juſtice.</p>
                  <p>20. That God may be <hi>formally</hi> conceived of and
comprehended by man, and not only known ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logically

II. Of the Bleſſed Divine Trinity.</p>

<hi>in ſpecie,</hi> as <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> are One
man, becauſe they have but one humane ſort of
nature.</p>
                  <p>5. That one perſon in the Trinity is in time or

than other.</p>
                  <p>6. That in the Trinity there are three Fathers,
three Sons, or three Holy Ghoſts.</p>
                  <p>7. That the doctrine of the Trinity is contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
or impoſſible to be true.</p>
                  <p>8. That it is unneceſſary to be believed or

                  <p>9. That there are no Impreſſions or notes of
the Trinity on the ſoul of man, or any other known
works of God.</p>
                  <p>10. That the works of Creation, Redemption
or Sanctification are no more eminently or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
aſcribed in Scripture to any one Perſon in the
Trinity than to the other. That Creation is no
otherwiſe aſcribed to the Father, than to the Son

to the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, nor Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Conſolation and Sealing to the Holy Ghoſt,

Bread and Wine by the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration

no longer Bread and
Wine, but the very Body, Fleſh
and Blood of Chriſt, or that

Wine ſince Chriſts days till now are made Chriſt's
fleſh and blood, and yet his fleſh and blood no whit

                  <p>20. That the humane nature of Chriſt is now
the Godhead, or is become a proper part of

not God of the ſame eſſence with the Father and
the Son.</p>
                  <p>2. That the Holy Ghoſt is but the Angelical na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or ſpecies; and as the diabolical nature and
many Devils are called ſingularly [<hi>the Devil,</hi>] ſo the
many Angels are called [<hi>the Holy Spirit.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>3. That the Immortal part of man called his
<hi>Spirit,</hi> is the eſſence of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>4. That the Holy Ghoſt as operative on man, is
not a valid witneſs of the truth of Chriſt and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
in the world.</p>
                  <p>5. That the Holy Ghoſt did not impregnate the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or that Chriſt was not conceived by
him.</p>
                  <p>6. That <hi>Adam</hi> had not the Holy Ghoſt, or true
Holineſs.</p>
                  <p>7. That the Prophets ſpake not by the Holy
Ghoſt; Or that their prophecies are of Private
interpretation, that is, objectively to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted,

                  <p>9. That the miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles
were not wrought by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>10. That the Holy Ghoſt may ſet the ſeal of
true uncontrolled miracles to a lie.</p>
                  <p>11. That the Canonical Scriptures were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited
by the Holy Ghoſt, as infallible records of the
Divine will.</p>
                  <p>12. That they are but for a time, till a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecter
Law is made, called, [<hi>The Law of the
Spirit.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>13. That they are imperfect without the ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Roman Tradition, as part of the Rule
of faith and life.</p>
                  <p>14. That they were but occaſional writings, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intended for the univerſal law or rule of faith
and holy living.</p>
                  <p>15. That there are in the true original, as they
came from the Apoſtles, ſome errours.</p>
                  <p>16. That in the preſent received Originals there
is any errour inconſiſtent with true ſaving faith and

                  <p>17. That we are not bound to believe the Holy
Scriptures to be Gods word, but by the authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
propoſal of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, A
general Council ſubject to the Pope, or called or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved

18. That the Scriptures are not intelligible in

and all men, is this Spirit, and ſufficient
Rule.</p>
                  <p>23. That men muſt believe the Scripture with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reaſon for their believing it: or muſt believe it
to be Gods word without ſeeking any proof that it
is his word.</p>
                  <p>24. That it is meritorious to believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
to be Gods word, without knowing any
proof or reaſon of it, this being an infuſed faith,
and proof making it but acquired.</p>
                  <p>25. That we muſt believe Gods word no further

                  <p>2. That an evil God made this earth, or a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
God between the perfect God and the evil one
(As old Hereticks variouſly ſpake.)</p>
                  <p>3. Or that ſuch an evil, or middle God made

                  <p>4. Or that ſuch an evil, or middle agent made
the woman.</p>
                  <p>5. That God made ſin, and death and diſorder

                  <p>9. That there is nothing in the world but mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

cauſed by motion: or at leaſt, nothing but
God and matter and motion, and its modal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>

good, but a proper cauſe, and as ſuch is decreed,
willed and cauſed by God.</p>
                  <p>4. That God made a Covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> that
if he ſinned, all that came of him ſhould be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſinners, farther than they were really ſeminally
in him, and by natural in-being and derivation were
partakers of his guilt, and corruptions; and ſo
that God made them ſinners by his arbitrary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
when naturally they were not ſo.</p>
                  <p>5. That Original ſin neceſſitateth every ſin of
omiſſion or act which ever after followeth in the

any thing that the Redeemer hath done to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it.</p>
                  <p>7. That infants have no Original ſin; no guilt
of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and no ſinful pravity of nature.</p>

                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:55406:169"/>
8. That Infants have no participation of guilt
of any nearer parents ſin, but <hi>Adams</hi> only, and
God doth not inflict any puniſhment on children
for their fathers ſin, becauſe of their derived guilt
by nature.</p>
                  <p>9. That therefore Infants have no need of
a Saviour to ſuffer for their ſin, nor of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
                  <p>10. That Infants need not the Holy Ghoſt to

                  <p>11. That ſin was not the cauſe of death.</p>

puniſhment.</p>

                  <p>2. That God made the Covenant of grace only
to <hi>Adam</hi> and the elect, and not to all mankind
in him, no not as it is a Conditional Covenant.</p>
                  <p>3. That all except the elect, or moſt or many

to and with Chriſt, and no other.</p>
                  <p>5. That there was and is an eternal Covenant
of Redemption made between God the Father and

that Jeſus the ſon of <hi>Mary</hi> is or muſt be the
<hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and that he muſt die for ſin, and riſe again
and intercede in heaven, and return to raiſe us and
judge the world.</p>
                  <p>8. That Chriſts Diſciples were not in a ſtate
of juſtification till they believed all this.</p>
                  <p>9. That all men ſhall not be judged as they believed
and kept (or brake) the condition of the Covenant
in that edition which they were under, but all
according to the tenor of the laſt edition.</p>
                  <p>10. That no faith in God as gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to ſinners, and as pardoning ſin, was neceſſary
before Chriſts incarnation.</p>
                  <p>11. That God before did pardon ſin without any
reſpect to the future ſacrifice, and merit of Chriſt as
mans Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>12. That no ſouls were glorified or received to
heaven and happineſs, till Chriſt's reſurrection,
but reſerved in ſome Limbus till then.</p>
                  <p>X. Of the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
<hi>Moſes</hi> Law, and the Iſraelites.</p>
                  <p>1. That <hi>Abraham</hi> was the firſt true Believer, or
the firſt to whom a promiſe or Covenant of Grace
was made.</p>
                  <p>2. That the Covenant of Grace was made to
no other people in the world, but the Iſraelites
were Gods whole viſible Church on earth, and did
not only add to them a Covenant of peculiarity.</p>
                  <p>3. That this promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed
in whom all Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:55406:170"/>
extended no way to the believing Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>4. That all Heathens children that were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
were certainly ſaved, if they died before actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
ſin.</p>
                  <p>5. That <hi>Moſes</hi> Law bound men to no ſpiritual
duty, nor promiſed any future reward or happineſs
after this life.</p>
                  <p>6. That <hi>Moſes</hi> Law was given by an evil God or
evil Angel.</p>
                  <p>7. That <hi>Moſes</hi> Law was the ſame as the Law
or Covenant of perfect innocency firſt made for
<hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. That all the world was bound to keep <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
Law as ſuch even the judicial and ritual parts
of it.</p>
                  <p>9. That under that Law God gave no grace to
obey him.</p>
                  <p>10. That the converted <hi>Jews</hi> are ſtill bound to
keep <hi>Moſes</hi> Law.</p>
                  <p>11. Yea and all converted Gentiles now:</p>
                  <p>12. That we are bound to form our Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
according to the Moſaical or Jewiſh.</p>
                  <p>XI. Of Redemption by Chriſt incarnate; and
the Goſpel or laſt edition of the Covenant of
Grace.</p>
                  <p>1. That Chriſt brought no more Grace than was
as ordinarily given before his incarnation.</p>
                  <p>2. That he was habitually or actually a ſinner,
guilty of original or actual ſin.</p>
                  <p>3. That Chriſt was properly reputed a ſinner by
God, or a proper ſinner by imputation, in that he
took our ſin to be his own, or God took him to be
guilty of the fault of all our ſin; and not only
one that undertook to bear the puniſhment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:55406:171"/>
4. That Chriſt was as guilty of our ſin as we were
of <hi>Adams.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. That Chriſt was habitually or actually holy,
and fulfilled all righteouſneſs in the Legal perſon
of every elect perſon, or of every true believer, ſo
that the Law therefore judgeth them to have been
what Chriſt was, or done what Chriſt did therein,
they doing it in him.</p>
                  <p>6. That Chriſt was not a ſatisfying ſacrifice for ſin.</p>
                  <p>7. That Chriſts ſatisfaction and merit were not
ſufficient for their proper uſe and effect, without
our ſatisfaction and merit to make up their defect.</p>
                  <p>8. That Chriſt was not the Saviour of the world,
or that God did not ſo love the world as to give
his only ſon, that who ever believeth in him ſhould
not periſh but have everlaſting life. Or that God
hath made no ſuch promiſe or grant to all to whom
the Goſpel cometh, that if they repent and believe
in Chriſt they ſhall be pardoned and ſaved: or that
this conditional univerſal pardon was no fruit of
Chriſts death.</p>
                  <p>9. That none but the elect have any mercy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
by the death of Chriſt, nor are bound to be
thankful to him for any ſuch.</p>
                  <p>10. That Chriſt ſuffered the ſame pains of hell,
hatred of God, and torment of Conſcience, which
all the elect ſhould elſe have ſuffered.</p>
                  <p>11. That Chriſts Righteouſneſs and ſacrifice are
not the true meritorious cauſe of our righteouſneſs,
pardon, juſtification and ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>12. That Chriſt muſt be oft really ſacrificed.</p>
                  <p>13. That Chriſt at his laſt ſupper did make the
bread and wine become his real body, then living;
and that it was broken and his blood ſhed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
really before he was crucified by the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. That Chriſt felt no real pain (as St. <hi>Hilary
Pic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:55406:171"/>
15. That Chriſt died not but another in his
ſhape.</p>
                  <p>16. That Chriſt took not his body into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>17. That all power is not given to Chriſt, nor are
Kings and Magiſtrates his Miniſters, nor hold their
power by him.</p>
                  <p>18. That Chriſt is no Law-giver, and made no
Law.</p>
                  <p>19. That he is not our ſufficient interceſſor with
God, by whom we may have acceſs and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>20. That Chriſt ſendeth not forth his ſpirit to
be his agent and witneſs to the end of the world,
in ſanctifying his elect.</p>
                  <p>XII. Of Faith, Repentance and ſanctification.</p>
                  <p>1. That Faith, repentance, holineſs and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
are not neceſſary in us to our ſalvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Chriſt was righteous for us, and repented
and believed in our ſtead.</p>
                  <p>2. That believers are under no Law of God.</p>
                  <p>3. That he may be pardoned and ſaved who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beareth
only the outward Acts of ſin through meer
fear, and is abſolved by a Prieſt, though he love ſin
better than holineſs, and had rather keep it than
leave it.</p>
                  <p>4. That loving others, and doing them good
and no harm is all the Love of God and Holineſs
that is neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>5. That Faith and Repentance are of nature or
by meer natural power and free-will, and not the
gift of grace through Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>6. That God giveth grace equally to all till good
improvers make a difference.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="308" facs="tcp:55406:172"/>
7. That men may be holy in the reſtored Image
of God without the grace of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>8. That men need not the Spirit of God to help
them to pray or preach.</p>
                  <p>9. That the ſins of ſanctified perſons, are not
judged by God to be theirs; and that he ſeeth them
not and hateth them not, nor puniſheth them with
any correcting puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>10. That they that have the ſpirit need not ſtudy
for matter, method, words or affection.</p>
                  <p>11. That they are perfect, or their duties perfect
who have the ſpirit, becauſe all the ſpirits works
are perfect.</p>
                  <p>12. That the day of grace may be ſo paſt with
ſome, as that ſincere faith, and repentance, and a
changed will that loveth holineſs, and conſenteth
to the Covenant of grace, may be rejected of God,
and unavailable to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>XIII. Of Juſtification and pardon.</p>
                  <p>1. That God forgiveth the deſerved puniſhment
of no ſin, but requireth it of the ſinner himſelf,
and Remiſſion is only the deſtroying of ſinful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
and preventing future ſin, and not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
the puniſhment of what is paſt, or will be.</p>
                  <p>2. That Chriſt's ſacrifice and righteouſneſs is not
the meritorious cauſe of our pardon, Juſtification,
adoption and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>3. That Chriſt is not the Lord our righteouſneſs,
or made of God to us, wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
and redemption; nor we made the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
of God in him: or that it is not the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of God by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, which juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
us.</p>
                  <p>4. That Chriſt ſuffered for his own ſin, being
either actually a ſinner, or our ſins made properly
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:55406:172"/>
his own ſin, (in the guilt of culpability, and not
only of puniſhment) before he ſuffered for them.
And ſo that he was by real imputation or Divine
reputation, the greateſt Atheiſt, infidel, malignant,
murderer, adulterer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the world, theſe ſins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their forms, or culpable guilt tranſlated from
all the elect on him.</p>
                  <p>5. That all the elect were juſtified from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or before they were born, or while they were no
true believers, by that juſtification which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
meaneth when it ſaith we are juſtified by faith.</p>
                  <p>6. That the elect are juſtified by the Law of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
made to <hi>Adam,</hi> or the Law of works
made to and by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Jews;</hi> becauſe they
were Legally in Chriſt fulfilling them, and did
perfectly fulfill them in him.</p>
                  <p>7. That the ſenſe of the Law of innocency was,
[Thou or Chriſt for thee ſhall be innocent and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
perfectly to the end, or die].</p>
                  <p>8. That the Goſpel Covenant or Donation is
not Gods juſtifying inſtrument, gift or Law.</p>
                  <p>9. That God reputeth us to have been perfectly
innocent from our birth to our death (or at leaſt
ſince our believing) becauſe we were ſo Legally
in Chriſt, and yet reputeth us ſuch ſinners as need a
Saviour, and Chriſt ſuffered for our ſins, though
we were ſo innocent.</p>
                  <p>10. That the elect have no need of pardon at
all, becauſe they are perfectly obedient by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>11. That at leaſt we need no pardon of any ſin
committed ſince we believed, ſave only of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
correction.</p>
                  <p>12. That pardon and juſtification actually remit
all ſin at once that is yet to come, (and is yet no
ſin) as well as that which is paſt and preſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="310" facs="tcp:55406:173"/>
13. That pardon and juſtification are perfect as
ſoon as we believe.</p>
                  <p>14. That therefore no true penalty, no not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective
is inflicted or remaineth after our firſt
faith.</p>
                  <p>15. Therefore to ſuch none of their wants of grace
or Communion with God, nor permitted ſin, nor
ſuffering nor death, are any true puniſhments for
ſin, for the demonſtration of paternal juſtice.</p>
                  <p>16. That therefore no believer muſt pray for
the pardon of ſin (it being perfected already) nor
ſeek for it of Chriſt by faith.</p>
                  <p>17. That therefore there is no further condition
or means to be uſed by us for pardon of new ſins,
or for fuller pardon.</p>
                  <p>18. Therefore there is no other or perfecter ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
at the laſt judgement.</p>
                  <p>19. That faith is not imputed to us for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>20. That againſt the falſe accuſations [that we were
impenitent, infidels, ungodly, hypocrites] we need
no perſonal Repentance, faith, piety or ſincerity,
to juſtifie us as the righteouſneſs contrary to this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation,
but only the imputed righteouſneſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
perſonally by Chriſt himſelf.</p>
                  <p>21. That we ſhall not be judged according to
our works, nor in any reſpect juſtified before God
by our works, nor is St. <hi>James</hi> ſo to be underſtood,
nor Chriſt that ſaith, <hi>By thy words thou ſhalt be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned.
Mat.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>22. That men are juſtified by the works of the
Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> or of <hi>innocency,</hi> or ſome other works,
which muſt be joyned to the righteouſneſs of Chriſt,
to make it ſufficient to its proper part or office;
and are not only ſubordinate thereto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:55406:173"/>
23. That we are juſtified by faith, only in our
Conſciences; as knowing that we are otherwiſe
juſtified before God.</p>
                  <p>24. That we are juſtified only by inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;
and that pardon of ſin and acceptance for
Chriſts merits and mediation, is none of our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
at all.</p>
                  <p>25. That a man unjuſtified muſt believe that he
is juſtified, that thereby he may be juſtified (tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
juſtification in the ſame ſenſe).</p>
                  <p>26. That God doth not make men juſt before
he ſentenceth them juſt.</p>
                  <p>27. That Chriſt juſtifieth only by his Prieſtly
Office and not by his judicial ſentence.</p>
                  <p>28. That we are juſtified by no act of faith, but
only by the act of reſting on (or alſo accepting)
Chriſts imputed juſtifying righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>29. That being perfectly juſtified by the firſt act
of faith, we are never after juſtified as to continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
by any act after that firſt inſtant.</p>
                  <p>30. That to expect juſtification by believing in
God the Father, or the Holy Ghoſt, and in Chriſt as
Chriſt, in his perſon and whole office of a ſaviour, and
not only by the foreſaid ſingle act, is to ſeek juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by works, reprehended by <hi>Paul,</hi> or unlawfully.</p>
                  <p>31. That faith or repentance are not by Gods gift
or promiſe made any conditions neceſſary to be
done by us, through his grace, that we may have
right to Chriſt or pardon or juſtification.</p>
                  <p>32. That our believing in Chriſt is of equal
impoſſibility to us as our perſonal perfect innocency.</p>
                  <p>33. That to believe Heaven, and that God will
glorifie us for the ſake of Chriſt, and as a Reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of them that diligently ſeek him, is no act of
that faith which juſtifieth; as a Condition of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
or ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:55406:174"/>
34. That it is all mens duty to believe that they
are elect.</p>
                  <p>35. That juſtifying faith is only a full aſſurance
that we are elect.</p>
                  <p>36. That true faith is inconſiſtent with doubting
or imperfection.</p>
                  <p>37. That it is unlawful to truſt to any thing in
us or done by us as a means or condition of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
or ſalvation, though but ſubordinate to
Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>38. That no meer death-bed faith or repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is accepted to ſalvation or pardon, becauſe
good works are part of the condition.</p>
                  <p>39. That there is no degree of pardon given by
God to any but the elect that are ſaved.</p>
                  <p>40. That all praiſe that is aſcribed to any thing
in our ſelves or done by us, or to any ſubordinate
act of man, as a means to our ſalvation or final ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
is a diſhonour to God and our Saviour,
and derogateth from his glory.</p>
                  <p>XIV. Of Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>1. That Baptiſm was inſtituted only for the firſt
times, or for reception of Infidel countreys when
converted, and not for to be continued in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Countreys and Churches.</p>
                  <p>2. That outward Baptiſm by water will ſave the
adult that have not true Repentance, and faith
and ſincere conſent to the baptiſmal Covenant.</p>
                  <p>3. That all the children of Infidels, Heathens,
Hereticks or wicked men are certainly ſaved, if
they be baptized and have Godfathers profeſſing
Chriſtianity (though thoſe Godfathers be wicked
hypocrites, and take not the infants by adoption
or otherwiſe as their own, nor really intend to
educate them as they promiſe) and if they die
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:55406:174"/>
before they actually ſin; and that this is certain by
the word of God.</p>
                  <p>4. That all the baptized are delivered from all
culpable pravity of ſoul, or inherent ſin.</p>
                  <p>5. That it is certain that all baptized Infants of
what parents ſoever, have ſpecial grace infuſed
into their ſouls by the Holy Ghoſt in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
                  <p>6. That baptiſm entering all into the Catholick
Church, obligeth all the baptized to the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> as the ſupreme head or paſtor.</p>
                  <p>7. That the Infants of believers dedicated to
God are holy only as legitimate and not baſtards,
but are not as a holy ſeed under promiſe to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into the Church and Covenant of God by
baptiſm; but all baptized in Infancy muſt be
taken as no viſible Chriſtians till they are rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
                  <p>8. That none that ſin groſly after baptiſm, are
upon their repentance to be received into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Church.</p>
                  <p>9. That it is not neceſſary to baptiſm of the
adult that they make any covenant, promiſe or
vow to God, nor to the baptiſm of Infants that
Parents or Proparents devote them to Chriſt by
entering them into an obliging Vow or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>10. That Baptiſm was not inſtituted to inveſt
the baptized in his <hi>right</hi> to pardon and life, but
only to enter him into the viſible Church, where as
a diſciple he may learn how to come to ſuch right
and pardon hereafter.</p>
                  <p>11. That the adult duely baptized have no right
to the Communion of the Church, though they
profeſs to continue their Covenant-conſent, and
none diſprove the truth of their profeſſion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:55406:175"/>
they have ſome higher qualification and
title.</p>
                  <p>XV. Of the Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p>1. That the Lords Supper is but an ordinance
for young or carnal Chriſtians; but they that have
the Spirit muſt live without it, as being above out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſigns and ordinances: And ſo of the Lords
Day.</p>
                  <p>2. That the Bread broken and Wine poured
out to be eaten and drunk, are not the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Sacramental body and blood of Chriſt delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

it his advantage to call himſelf <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Catholick,</hi>

will be a work ſo long as may tire the Reader: I will
therefore firſt give ſome notice of them tranſiently and

ſuppoſed to be the Cauſes, and ſhew how uncapable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
means are of being terms of real Union and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,

worſe than by <hi>Few,</hi> and in ſome not all ſo bad.
The ſins of many hath more guilt than of one: Their
ill ſucceſs is like to be greater: Thoſe will fall in
with the multitude, who would deſpiſe a ſingular tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter.
The Donatiſts prevailed in <hi>Africa</hi> by their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
It ſeemeth by their Biſhops in their Councils, that
they were the <hi>greater</hi> part: It is not impoſsible for the <hi>far
greater number</hi> to be the <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi> But yet the guilt of
<hi>ſingularity</hi> is more upon a <hi>ſingle Separatiſt,</hi> or <hi>few,</hi> that
dare ſeparate from the whole, or moſt of the Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> VI. 2. The <hi>Biſhops and Paſtors</hi> are liable to the

Elders were the Chief.</p>

and his followers, <hi>Maximinus,</hi> and the <hi>Donatiſts, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorius,

up the Councils at <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Arrinene, Sinnium, Milan,</hi>

cannot expect that he ſhould take my word.</p>

to be Schiſmaticks, than in the <hi>People,</hi> becauſe they are
ſuppoſed to know more the <hi>Good</hi> of <hi>Concord,</hi> and the
<hi>Means,</hi> and the <hi>Miſchiefs</hi> of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Cauſes</hi> and
<hi>Remedies:</hi> And it is <hi>their Office</hi> to be the <hi>Preachers</hi> of
<hi>Unity and Peace,</hi> and to ſave the People from the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
which would draw them into ſuch guilt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> VIII. Biſhops and Paſtors have <hi>greater tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
to Schiſm than the <hi>People,</hi> and therefore have been
ſo frequent in the guilt: eſpecially Pride and Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in them hath ſtronger Faith. And 1. <hi>Striving</hi> who
ſhall be <hi>Greateſt,</hi> and have <hi>Rule;</hi> 2. Who ſhall be
thought <hi>Wiſeſt</hi> and moſt <hi>Orthodox,</hi> have been the cauſe
of moſt of the Schiſms in the world: And 3. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
(eſpecially with the <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>People</hi>) it hath
been who ſhall be thought the <hi>Beſt</hi> and <hi>Holieſt</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
But the two former have done much more than
this, <hi>Goodneſs</hi> being that which corrupt nature doth
not ſo much contend for, or the reputation of <hi>Holineſs,</hi>
as for <hi>Greatneſs</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> the commoner baits of
Pride. Therefore <hi>Controverſies,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and

Controverſies, which Ignorance cheriſheth (as it did
with the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Monks, that turned Anthropomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites.)
But a <hi>ſmattering</hi> in Learning, which amounts
not to ſolidity, and a ſettled mind, is the common cauſe
of Hereſies and Schiſm, while praters muſt needs be
taken for wiſe, and to know more than others, while
they know nothing as they ought to know.</p>

ſpreadeth far, and liveth long: Becauſe it muſt coſt
men dear to underſtand it; and humane nature is ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,

accuſed of greater crimes; 2. And when it tendeth to

He poured out the Spirit of Love and Concord,
miraculouſly at firſt on his Diſciples, making them of
one heart and mind, even to a voluntary Community
of their goods: He prayed that they all might be
<hi>One in him:</hi> He hath appointed his Miniſters to preach

He hath inſtituted <hi>particular Churches</hi> for the exerciſe

1. They muſt be men of more eminent knowledge

the People once perceive that they are equal to them,
they will deſpiſe them, and turn Preachers, and ſet
up for themſelves: 2. And then ſuch Miniſters being
not able to deal with Sectaries and Hereticks, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
the Cauſe of God, and the adverſaries will carry
away the Hearers: And it will be eaſie to bring ſuch
perſons into Contempt, and then the Truth will ſuffer
with them: God fitteth men to do the work that he
will bleſs them in: Not that every Congregation
muſt needs have ſuch an eminent man; for a great
Light will ſhine to other Pariſhes, and an able man
in one Pariſh may be ready to help the next, and to
confute Gainſayers, and may keep up the Credit of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55406:191"/>

to them that they think live a more ſtrict and pious,

zealouſly and frequently preach up the <hi>neceſſity</hi> and

Preacher know how to deal with the <hi>Perſons</hi> as well
as with the Cauſe: and that is not to rail at them,
and render them ſhamefull and odious whom he would
win, nor publickly to expoſe them to contempt, much
leſs to ſlander, abuſe or oppreſs them; But with Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
managed with meekneſs, love and tenderneſs to
convince them, and make them feel that all cometh
for their own good, from unfeigned Love; as <hi>Muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
won the Anabaptiſts by feeding and relieving them
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55406:191"/>
in Priſon, till they ſought to him for inſtruction, and were
diſpoſed to hear it. Nature flyeth from hurtful things and
perſons: Had the Enmity been put at firſt between the
Woman and the Serpent, <hi>Eve</hi> had not been ſo eaſily
ſeduced. Too many Biſhops and Preachers go about
to cure Schiſm as a man would bring Birds to the Net,
or Fiſhes to the Bait, by ſhouting and throwing Stones
at them; or as one would get the ſwarm of Bees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Hive by beating them; or as one that would
get a Wife by deriding and railing at her; or as a
Phyſician that would get practice by mocking his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
inſtead of medicining them. Men know better
than ſo, how to bring an Oxe to the Yoak, or a Horſe
or Dog to hand, or to tame any Bird or Beaſt that is
wild and frightful. It's true, that as a Malefactor is
hanged for the good of the Common-wealth rather
than his own, ſo a deſperate ſeducing Heretick or
Divider may be juſtly rendered as contemptible as he
deſerveth, to keep others from being deceived by him:
But all that we hope to win muſt be otherwiſe uſed.
Reproach and diſgrace maketh the Medicine ſo bitter
(which ſhould be ſugared) that with one of many it
will not go down. Scorn and reviling is the way to
drive them further from us.</p>

Diſſenters, while they worſhip God with ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
from them, in their own Aſſemblies, is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
prevention of worſer Schiſm. Thus ſome
peaceable Biſhops kept peace and love with the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians,</hi>
when others by contrary means made more
Schiſms; (As <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſaith <hi>Audius</hi> by intemperate

What hurt will it do me, to let people hear another
Teacher, whom they preferre before me, and can

Croſsing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what hurt is it to let others meet and

worſhip God without them? But when Preachers have
not <hi>perſonal worth</hi> to keep up their Reputation, and
then rail at thoſe that do not value them, they do but
make themſelves more vile: And when they are ſo
proud, that if people leave them, and preferre ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they cannot bear it, but think to remedy it by
making odious or vilifying thoſe that undervalue them,
they do but as all proud men do, even croſs and more

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> XI. There is one ſort of men that have written
many things excellently for Peace, even the <hi>Socinians,</hi>
who being Hereticks, have thereby done much harm.
Divers of them have laid down in general thoſe Rules
and Terms which might much have furthered the
Churches Peace, if the ſame things had been written
by men of Name and Reputation. What <hi>Acontius</hi>
was, or what <hi>Rupertus Meldenius</hi> was, I am not ſure;
ſome ſay they were Socinians, and ſome deny it: But
I am ſure, if they were heretical, their excellent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
for Love and Peace may riſe up in judgment
againſt Orthodox Perſecutors, Schiſmaticks, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilers:
Many that are <hi>known</hi> to be <hi>Socinians,</hi> have
written much for peace; and Satan hath made great
advantage of it, to bring all earneſt motions for peace
into ſuſpicion: ſo that a man can now ſcarce write for
the retreat of Church-warriours, and for the quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our conſuming flames, but he is preſently ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to be guilty of ſome Hereſie, and to have ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
need of Charity or toleration himſelf; Like the
Fox, that having loſt his Tail, would have all Foxes
tails cut off. Or if it be about any point that Papiſts
are concerned in, that a man calleth men from erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Extremes, to Truth and Peace, he is preſently
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55406:193"/>
ſuſpected to be of the mind of <hi>Caſſander, Wicelius, Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
or ſuch as they: Even <hi>Jacob Behmens</hi> writing
ſo much for <hi>Love,</hi> and againſt <hi>Wrath,</hi> hath made ſome
ſuſpect a Treatiſe that is written for any extenſive
Chriſtian Love: Could Satan but engage a man of ill
fame to preach and write fervently for any funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
point of Religion, I am afraid with many it
would make it ſuſpected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> XII. It is alſo of great moment for the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or remedying of Schiſm, to chooſe a <hi>ſit ſeaſon</hi> to
manage the remedies. Were not men very proud and
ſelfiſh, the fitteſt ſeaſon would be times of Civil peace
and proſperity: And indeed a common peace of many
Countreys will hardly be well proſecuted in any other
times; becauſe it needeth ſedate minds, and quiet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe,
and friendly communication; which warrs
and exaſperations are againſt: Nor is it a fit time to
heal a particular perſon, when he is fined, impriſoned,
perſecuted, or oppreſſed: For his ſenſe and paſsion will
ſtop his ears, and drive him further from thoſe that
he ſuffers by: (ſo far are they miſtaken who take
violence and ſeverity to be the way). But yet <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity</hi>
hath greater hinderances of Love and Peace
than <hi>Sufferings:</hi> for then uſually the lovers of the
World (called in Scripture <hi>the Enemies of God</hi>) as
they <hi>ſtrive</hi> moſt for wealth and power, do obtain it;
and being made Lords and Prelates, they think there
is no ſure and honourable Peace, but by all mens ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
to their wills and dictates: Pride never know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the way of Peace, but truſteth to inſulting paſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
violence, which cureth Schiſm, as Brandy will
do a burning Feaver: which may rarely be lodged in
ſuch frigid matter as may accidentally cure it, which
ordinarily would kill: And a Schiſmatick may be ſuch
a timerous worldling, as that ſuffering may drive him
into outward complyance: But Conſcience ſo reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55406:193"/>
God, as to count man and all that he can do as
nothing. Religion is a worſhipping and obeying God
as God: and whoever preferreth any mans Power or
Intereſt before him, ſo far hath no true Religion
at all.</p>
               <p>But if a ſufferer be to be cured, it muſt not be by
him by whom he ſuffereth, but by another that pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
him and lamenteth his ſufferings. But uſually
Pride and carnal Confidence in Proſperity hinder men
from that condeſcenſion and moderation which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
neceſſary to Love and Peace: Wantonneſs
and Contention are the uſual fruits of greatneſs, full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and worldly eaſe: ſo that Civil Peace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
are too often ſtrangers; and being dryed in
the Sun-ſhine we are crumbled to duſt. And it is Gods
ordinary way to caſt contentious Wranglers into the
Furnace, and melt them till they may be caſt into one
mold: <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Hooper</hi> were reconciled in Priſon.
When men that fell out are all taken Captives by a
common Enemy, they are ſooner reconciled. When
men all ſuffer for the ſame common Cauſe, and are
together in Gaols, or Baniſhment, or reproach, then go
trie whether they will hearken to peace. It was the
great ſhame of the Engliſh Fugitives in Qu. <hi>Maries</hi>
dayes to fall out at <hi>Frankford</hi> in their Exile. In a
word, both Proſperity and Adverſity have their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
helps and hinderances of Concord; but uſually,
times of common Civil Peace, are the hopefulleſt times
to treat for a common Religious peace; but for <hi>ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
quarrelling <hi>parties,</hi> common ſuffering is a better
time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> XIII. Whoever will be the Inſtruments of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Schiſms, muſt neceſſarily preſerve his Reputation
with thoſe that he would heal, or at leaſt with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſort of religious perſons: For if once he be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ill ſpoken of, the beſt things which he ſaith,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55406:194"/>
will be deſpiſed: If he be a Prince, if he be common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reputed a ſound and a good man, all that he doth
will have a good interpretation: But if he be taken
either for an enemy to Piety, or to the Doctrine which
prevaileth, all that he doth will be ſuſpected for acts
of malice. <hi>Conſtantius</hi> is praiſed by <hi>Hilary</hi> himſelf and
many others, for a man of laudable diſpoſition and
converſation; and yet his being for the <hi>Arians,</hi> made
all ill taken that he did, and he did much that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
it: <hi>Theodoſius</hi> junior and <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> were very
pious Emperours, and great lovers of Peace, and ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly
laboured to have kept the Biſhops from Schiſm
and Church-warrs; but being ſuppoſed to favour
moſt that party which the others called Hereticks, all
that they did was ill interpreted, and ſuſpected to be
in favour to the Hereticks. It is therefore very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that a Peace-making Prince be down-right
honeſt and impartial, and ſhew himſelf conſcionable
in all his Actions, and a lover of Mankind, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
to none, but a ſpecial favourer of the good,
and an enemy to Wickedneſs, Debauchery and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
in all. For this will make people love and truſt
him, without which nothing will be done.</p>
               <p>And what I ſay of Princes, I muſt ſay of Paſtors
and Preachers: If a man be never ſo zealous for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
if he be commonly ſuppoſed to be an <hi>ignorant</hi>
man, or a <hi>wicked</hi> man, or an <hi>unconſcionable crafty Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician,</hi>
or a <hi>Heretick,</hi> or dangerouſly <hi>erroneous,</hi> or
one that is partial, or hath any ill Principles or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
or a Perſecutor, or whimſical Fanatick, all his
Endeavours are like to do but little good: The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
love and honour that Arch-biſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> Biſhop
<hi>Davenant,</hi> Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fenner,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Watton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stoughton,</hi> &amp;c. had with all ſorts of ſober
men in <hi>England,</hi> made thoſe conciliatory, moderating
Principles to be regarded, which from other men
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55406:194"/>
have been received with ſuſpicion, if not contempt
and ſcorn.</p>

but that of <hi>Rupertus Meldenius</hi> cited by <hi>Conra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus

and uſed, <hi>viz. Si in NECESSARIIS ſit
UNITAS, in NON-NECESSARIIS LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERTAS,
in UTRISQUE CHARITAS,

Liberty in things unneceſſary,</hi> and <hi>Charity in both,</hi>
would do all our work.</p>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> XV. Or briefly, all muſt be done, 1. By the
<hi>LIGHT</hi> of Reaſon and Sacred Truth adapted to
the Underſtandings of the people, and ſeaſonably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
with good advantage to convince them. 2. By
the <hi>LOVE</hi> of Paſtors, Rulers and Diſſenters, heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
coals of Fire on their heads. 3. By the <hi>POWER</hi>
of Magiſtrates, encouraging men of Truth, Piety
and peace, and reſtraining men from propagating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
Errors, and all ſorts from violating the Laws
of Humanity, Chriſtian Sobriety and Charity, and
the publick peace, and not permitting them on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Religion openly to revile and abuſe each
other, ſo as to keep up mutual hatred and diabolical
Calumny, and by licentious tongues to wrong each
other.</p>

Duties of all men that will herein ſucceſſefully
ſerve the Church: for it is not every man that is fit
for ſo excellent a work, though every man be bound
to it in his place: The ſad Experience of the World
aſſureth us, that hitherto few skilful and effectual Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
have been found.</p>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> II. In ſhort, all men that will promote the
Churches concord, whether Magiſtrates, Paſtors or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
muſt obſerve all theſe following things, as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
means, which if they be wanting, yea but one of
them, the Churches will be ſo far diſquieted, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed.</p>
               <p>1. The foreſaid ſimple Terms of Union muſt be
underſtood and received, and falſe and enſnaring terms
muſt be avoided.</p>
               <p>2. Magiſtrates muſt preferre Chriſts intereſt before
their own, and ſee that their own lyeth in preferring
his: and muſt value conſcionable upright men, though
diſſenters in tolerable caſes, and not encourage their
unconſcionable enemies. And muſt keep peace among
the Clergy and among all.</p>
               <p>3. Men muſt be taught to place their Religion in
worſhipping God in Spirit and Truth; and to ſtudy
the power and practice of Godlineſs, Sobriety, Juſtice
and Charity, more than Opinions, ſelf-exalting or Will-worſhip:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55406:195"/>
and to love their Neighbours as themſelves,
and do as they would be done by.</p>
               <p>4. Men muſt learn of Chriſt to ſee the amiableneſs
of Sincerity and Holineſs under many differences and
weakneſſes, and ſo love what is amiable, and bear with
what is tolerable, and pardon what is pardonable in
all: and to receive the weak, even in the Faith, but
not to doubtfull Diſputations: and to ſpeak more of
the Good that is in upright men than of the Evil:
yea never ſpeak evil of any man till they be certain
of the truth: nor then till they be well ſatisfied, that
it is like to do more good than harm.</p>
               <p>5. Men muſt labour to know themſelves, and be
acquianted with their own fallibility and defectibility,
mutability and inſufficiency, and to remember how
much they have to be pardoned and tolerated, and ſo to
caſt the firſt ſtone at themſelves; to fly from Pride,
and know how unmeet they are to be the Rule of
all mens Judgments and Practices, or to ſeem ſo wiſe,
as that none ſhall be tolerated that differ from them,
nor ſpeak publickly to God, but in the words which
they preſcribe.</p>
               <p>6. Men muſt not be too ſtrange to one another, nor
keep too diſtant; for neerneſs and acquaintance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileth,
and diſtance cheriſheth falſe reports and
ſuſpicions, and men take liberty to hear, think and
ſpeak ill of ſtrangers behind their backs, which fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity
would cure.</p>
               <p>7. None but Volunteers muſt be taken for true
Chriſtians, nor admitted to holy Communion, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Seals of Pardon and Life.</p>
               <p>8. To uſe more a friendly diſcourſing way for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Diſſenters, than diſgracefull, paſsionate, mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
diſputations, (Though dangerous ſeducers muſt be
confuted by neceſſary diſputation.)</p>
               <p>9. To abhorre Envy and Emulation (the Off-ſpring

of Selfiſhneſs and Pride) and not to grudge at
other mens eſteem, that are preferred before us; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
that Preachers and Paſtors envy not the prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of other Teachers, nor murmur at their liberty,
honour or ſucceſs; but rejoyce with <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 1.
that Chriſt is preached, though it be by Contentious
men, that do it in Envy and Strife, to adde affliction
to the afflicted.</p>
               <p>10. To dread Perſecution and unjuſt violence to
men of Conſcience, and not to force them to ſin and
damnation, by bearing down Conſcience in unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
things.</p>
               <p>11. To be well furniſhed with holy Reaſon and
Love, and for Miniſters to be confined to the uſe of
theſe, from all uſe of Violence by the Sword; and
kept to their proper work and Government by the
Word and Church-keyes.</p>
               <p>12. To rebuke and frown away malignant and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Calumniators, Whiſperers, Cenſurers and Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters.</p>
               <p>13. To teach the People wherein the uniting Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Religion doth conſiſt, and what a ſin it is
to be cenſorious and ſeparate cauſeleſly from others,
and repreſent their different Opinions, Modes and
Circumſtances of Worſhip unjuſtly odious, to ſtirre
up other mens hatred and ſeparating diſtaſtes: and
how great a ſin and danger Schiſm or Diviſion is.</p>
               <p>14. To avoid all needleſs novelties and ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and to keep to <hi>Vincent. Lerinenſis's</hi> Meaſure, of
holding to that which <hi>hath ever been received as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
by the whole Church,</hi> and was the primitive
Faith and Religion.</p>
               <p>15. To avoid contending about meer <hi>ambiguous
words,</hi> and ever to agree of the ſence of all the terms
before you enter on further diſputation: and to ſuſpect
ſuch ambiguity in all debates.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:55406:197"/>
16. As Magiſtrates muſt be juſt and impartial, ſo
people muſt be taught to obey them under Chriſt, in
all lawfull things belonging to their Office, and that
as a part of their Obedience to God.</p>
               <p>17. Peace-makers muſt be men of Piety and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Lives, that may honour their works, and not by
ſcandal harden adverſaries, nor lay Stumbling-blocks
before the weak: and ſuch as ſtudy to do good to all.</p>
               <p>18. They muſt ſubmit to men of the loweſt and
weakeſt ranks, and not deſpiſe them, and the ſtrong
muſt bear the Infirmities of the weak, reſtoring the
fallen with the ſpirit of meekneſs, remembring that
they alſo may be tempted.</p>
               <p>19. They muſt not expect ſuch a degree of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
on Earth as is not to be expected, leſt for want
of it they be tempted to murmur at God, doubt of
Religion, and make the breach wider by unjuſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities
againſt the weak.</p>
               <p>20. When any are accuſed of Hereſie or Scandal,
they muſt be ready with patience to give ſatisfaction
to others, to the Churches, to Rulers, to Equals, or
Inferiors, Referring them to their Profeſsion of Faith,
and anſwering what is charged on them, and willingly
amending what they are convinced is amiſs.</p>

that is, both <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> and be really the
King of all the World: And herein they are of three
Opinions as to the <hi>Subject</hi> of this Power, and of three
Opinions as to the <hi>degree.</hi>

1. One party ſay that the <hi>ſumma Poteſtas</hi> is in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

General Council,</hi> or in the <hi>Pope and Council agreeing;</hi>
3. And another party hold that it is in a <hi>General
Council alone,</hi> yet ſo as that the Pope is the <hi>Head</hi> of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55406:198"/>
the Univerſal Church, as the chief Prelate, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Governour, though ſubject to the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Judicial Power of the Council.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> V. And as to the <hi>Degree</hi> of Power, 1. Some
hold that the Pope is the <hi>Monarch of all the Earth,</hi>
having the chief Power of both Swords, and that
the World is his Kingdom, as Gods Vicegerent.</p>
               <p>2. Others hold, that he hath <hi>directly</hi> only the <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Power,</hi> but <hi>indirectly</hi> and <hi>in order to Spirituals</hi>
he hath alſo the <hi>Temporal power</hi> (of the Sword): Or,
as the moſt hold, that in his <hi>own Territories</hi> he hath
<hi>both Powers</hi> as to <hi>Perſonal exerciſe;</hi> but in <hi>other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi>
he can himſelf only <hi>execute</hi> the <hi>Church-power,</hi>
but he may <hi>command Kings</hi> to execute the <hi>power of
the Sword</hi> for <hi>Religion,</hi> according to his and his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
decrees: and may force them to it by <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi>'s,
and releaſing their Subjects from the Bonds
of Fidelity, and giving their Kingdoms to others: As
ſome ſay, that the King may not be <hi>perſonally</hi> Judge
in the Courts of Juſtice, but he may <hi>make Judges,</hi>
and force them to their duty, and depoſe them if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.
This differeth little from the former: The
Monarchy is nevertheleſs abſolute, though Kings be
the Popes Officers or Lictors.</p>
               <p>3. But ſome few hold that the Pope and Biſhops
have no Power of the Sword at all, nor of forcing
Kings to uſe it; The Controverſie was hotly handled
when Popes and Emperors were in Warrs: The Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
written on both ſides are publiſhed by <hi>Goldaſtus,</hi>
to which <hi>William Barkley</hi> and ſome others in <hi>France</hi>

call the Pope <hi>A King;</hi> The Name of a <hi>Church</hi>

where they will ſtill find that he never inſtituted ſuch
a <hi>Roman Monarch.</hi> The Papiſts contrary Aſſertion
will never convince the World, when the Book it
ſelf is open before them. They will there find no
one man that ruled all the reſt; no one to whom
Appeals were made: no one that ever claimed ſuch a
power; much leſs that ſettled any ſuch at <hi>Rome;</hi> or
that ever a word was left by Chriſt to direct the
Church to center in the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> Nor that
ever the Apoſtles preached this to the Churches, which
they muſt needs have done, had it been eſſential to the
Church Catholick, or half as neceſſary as the Papiſts
make it.</p>

held the Papacy to be of humane Inſtitution: Proved
briefly; 1. Becauſe they ever held the Popes power
to ſtand on the ſame Foundation with the other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs:
But they ever held the other Patriarchs to be
of Humane Inſtitution; which needs no proofs to men
of Reading. 2. Becauſe they ſet up <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
firſt next him, and then equal to him, and then above
him: which they had never done, had they taken the
Papacy to be of Divine Inſtitution: For they never
pretended any ſuch foundation for the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinoples</hi>
power; and they were never ſo deſperate
as to ſet up Mans Ordination above Gods. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they took his Power to be limited by the Laws

prove that all the Chriſtian Church or World is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Pope, if he had but ten Subjects, becauſe
all the reſt are no part of the Chriſtian Church or
World: as a mad man proved that all the World
was his, becauſe he thought his Houſe and Land was
all the World. But Chriſt will not ſo eaſily loſe his
Church, nor be diſputed out of his Inheritance by ſo
groſs a fallacy: If you argue [None are parts of the
Chriſtian Church but the Popes Subjects: All the Popes
Subjects unite in the Pope: <hi>Ergo,</hi> all parts of the
Chriſtian Church are united in the Pope,] You muſt
prove your <hi>Major</hi> to Chriſt better than ever you did,
before he will be ſo depoſed from his Kingdom, and
loſe thoſe whom he ſo dearly bought. The Biſhop of
<hi>Conſtantinople, Alexandria, Epheſus, Canterbury,</hi> may

ſay the like, that none are Chriſtians but their Subjects,

               <p>And as for the firſt three hundred years under Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
Emperours, their own Writers confeſs the Church

2. And that it was not the Pope that preſided at
<hi>Nice;</hi> 3. And that thoſe Councils were but <hi>Imperial,</hi>
and not truly <hi>Univerſal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if all the Church ever had been ſubject to the
Pope, as being at firſt (except <hi>Abaſſia</hi>) almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, it doth not follow, that
it will ever be ſo again when it is diſperſed into ſo
many Kingdoms of the World: The <hi>Jeſuites</hi> at firſt
were all under the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
at firſt all under one Prince, but they are not
ſo now: Is it likely that ever all Chriſtian, Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
and Heathen Kings will ſuffer all their Chriſtian
Subjects to be under the Government of a Foreign
Prieſt?</p>
               <p>But their own Writers agree, that the Apoſtles at
firſt were diſperſed into many Countreys beſides the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and that <hi>Ethiopia</hi> was converted by
the Eunuch mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 8. initially (its like before
<hi>Rome,</hi>) and fullyer by St. <hi>Matthew:</hi> And you may
ſee in <hi>Godignus, Alvarez, Damianus a Goez,</hi> and others,
full evidence that they were never Subjects to the
Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I conclude then, 1. That <hi>Rome</hi> is not owned this
day as the head of Unity by all Chriſtians: 2. That
it never was ſo taken for the Governing and Uniting
Head; 3. And that the reaſon of the thing fully
proveth that it never <hi>will be ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I may adde, that indeed it is not known among
themſelves who are the conſenting Subjects of the
Pope, or Members of their Church: It is indeed <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,</hi>
or a Church not <hi>knowable.</hi> For, 1. They
are not agreed, nor ever like to be, what is the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
qualification of a Member of the Church: Or
what that Faith is that muſt make a Member: Some
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55406:203"/>
ſay, it muſt be the Belief of all the Creed explicitely;
others, of ſome few Articles; others, that no more is
neceſſary <hi>ad eſſe than to believe explicitly that God is,</hi>
and that he is <hi>a Rewarder of good works,</hi> and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the Church is to be believed: Of which ſee
<hi>Fr. a Sanct. Clara</hi> in his <hi>Deus, Natura, Gratia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. And their forcing men into their Church with
Tortures, Fire and Sword, leaveth it utterly uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
who are Conſenters, and who are in the Church
as Priſoners, to ſave Limbs and Life.</p>
               <p>And if they ever recover <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland,
Germany,</hi> and the other Reformed Churches, it muſt
be by the Sword, and Warrs, and Violence, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
by force of Argument: And if they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
us all (which is their hope and truſt) it will not
follow, that men are of their <hi>minds,</hi> becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
or dare not contradict them, no more than becauſe
they are dead.</p>
               <p>Experience, Reaſon and Scripture then do fully
prove to men that are willing to know the truth, that
the <hi>Univerſality</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> will never be united to
the Roman Papacy: Yea, that this Papacy is the
greateſt of all Schiſms, 1. By ſetting up a falſe Head
of Union; and 2. By cutting off or renouncing three
parts of the Chriſtian World, even all Chriſtians ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Subjects of the Pope.</p>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> I. WHether or how far ſuch Forms <hi>may
conſiſt</hi> with Union, is a Queſtion that
I am not now debating, any further than ſhall be
anon intimated by the way. But that they will never
become the <hi>Bond of Union,</hi> or be <hi>received by all,</hi> and
that to make any ſuch thought <hi>Neceſſary</hi> to univerſal
Unity, is Schiſm, I am eaſily able to prove.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> II. And this needeth no other proofs than
what are given againſt uniting in the Papacy, in the
former Chapter. As, 1. <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and other humane
Inſtitutions being not of God but Man, the whole
Church can never unite in them, 1. Becauſe they
will never <hi>all agree</hi> that <hi>any men</hi> have true Authority
given them by God, to make <hi>new Church-Officers and
Forms</hi> that ſhall be neceſſary to the Unity or Concord
of the Church Univerſal.</p>
               <p>2. They will never agree <hi>who thoſe</hi> men are that
God hath given ſuch power to, if they did ſuſpect that
ſuch there are. A Prince hath no Power out of his
Dominions.</p>
               <p>3. They will never agree, that if man made ſuch
Forms or Offices, they may not <hi>unmake</hi> them again if
they ſee cauſe; or that their Acts bind all their <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity</hi>
never to reſcind or change them.</p>
               <p>4. They will never find that all the Chriſtian
World ever agreed herein, and ſo in all Poſterity is
obliged by their Anceſtors.</p>
               <p>5. Much leſs will any ever prove that the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was Divine.</p>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> III. If any ſay, that the Apoſtles ſettled this
Form by the Spirit, the Univerſal Church will never
believe it: For, 1. No Scripture ſaith ſo: 2. No true
credible Hiſtory ſaith ſo: 3. If the Apoſtles ſettled
<hi>Patriarchs,</hi> it was either as <hi>their</hi> own Succeſſors, or as a
<hi>new Office:</hi> And it was either by joynt conſent, or
man by man, each one apart: But 1. Had they ſettled
them as their Succeſſours, they would have ſettled
twelve or thirteen; But there were but five ſettled at
all, beſides ſome new petty Patriarchs (as at <hi>Aquileia</hi>
when they caſt off <hi>Rome.</hi>) 2. No Writer tells us of
any meeting of the Apoſtles to agree of ſuch a Form.
3. No nor that ever they ſettled them. 4. Hiſtory
aſſureth us that they were ſettled only in One Empire,
and not in the reſt of the World. 5. And that the
Emperour and Councils of that Empire made them.
6. And therefore when they were at firſt but three
they added at their pleaſure two more, <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
and <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 7. And none of all theſe pretend to
Apoſtolical Inſtitution and Succeſſion but <hi>Antioch,</hi> that
claimeth to be St. <hi>Peters</hi> firſt Seat, and <hi>Rome</hi> to be
his ſecond, and that but as Biſhops, (when that alſo
is a frivolous pretenſe.) <hi>Alexandria</hi> claimeth ſucceſsion
but from St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from that St. <hi>James</hi>
who (ſaith Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and others) was none of
the Apoſtles, and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> from none at all,
though above the reſt. Councils (as <hi>Conſtant.</hi> and
<hi>Chalced.</hi>) profeſsing that the Fathers and Princes made
them what they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> IV. It is certain, that the Chriſtian World is
not now united in <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> nor ever was, nor ever
will be. The Patriarchs of the reſt of the Empire are
all now broken off from the Church of <hi>Rome: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,
Alexandria, Antioch</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> are all
againſt him: The Eaſt had four, and the Weſt but
one, and are now at odds condemning each other.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55406:204"/>
The reſt of the world have none, and had none. And
it is commonly confeſſed, that as men ſet them up, ſo
men may pull them down again. Yea, even in the
old Empire many Churches were from under all the
Patriarchs, as is commonly known.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> V. And how ſhould theſe Patriarchs unite all
the Church? It muſt be either by meeting or at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
As for their meeting, Princes that are ſome
Mahometans, and ſome Chriſtians, of divers Intereſts
and Minds, will not ſuffer it: And neither by meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or diſtance can we be ſecured that they will agree,
when even under one Emperour that laboured to unite
them, they were among their Clergy like the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
of ſo many Armies, diſtracting (and at laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying)
the Empire by hereticating and perſecuting
one another. Thoſe that have divided and undone
that Empire, are never like to unite the Chriſtian
World.</p>

humane Forms of Churches or Church-government;
and ſo of ſuch an Epiſcopacy as is not neceſſary to the
being of the Church. There are here three diſtinct
queſtions before us: 1. Whether the Paſtoral Office
be neceſſary to Church-unity? 2. Whether Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Epiſcopacy be neceſſary to it? 3. Whether
Dioceſan Biſhops diſtinct from Archbiſhops be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to it? And you may adde a fourth, Whether Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops
be neceſſary to it, (not diſputing now the
lawfulneſs of any of all theſe?)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> VII. 1. Of the firſt I have ſpoken before:
No doubt but Chriſts univerſal Church hath ever had
Teachers and Paſtors as the moſt noble organical
part; And a Body may as well be without a Stomack,
Liver or Lungs, as the Church be without them.
And to a particular Church as <hi>political, organized,</hi>
or Governed, they are a <hi>conſtitutive</hi> part. But I have
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55406:205"/>
before ſhewed reaſons to doubt whether yet it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to <hi>ſalvation</hi> to every <hi>individual Chriſtian</hi> to
know that the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> is an <hi>inſtituted Office,</hi> and to
own ſuch: But this little concerneth our Cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> VIII. 2. <hi>Parochial Epiſcopacy,</hi> that is, the
preeminence and government of one Presbyter called
<hi>a Biſhop</hi> over the reſt in every <hi>ſingle Church,</hi> was early
introduced to avoid the diſcord of the Presbyters and
the Flock: In the time when <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Epiſtles were
written, he tells us, That <hi>every Church had One Altar,
and one Biſhop with his fellow-Presbyters and Deacons.</hi>
Whether this was of Apoſtolical Inſtitution, or a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Corruption, is diſputed in ſo many Volumes
(by <hi>Petavius, Sancta Clara, Faravia, Whitenitto,
Downham, Hammond, Hooker, Bilſon,</hi> &amp;c. on one
ſide: And <hi>Gerſom, Bucer, Beza, Cartwright, Salmaſius,
Didoclane, Jacob, Blondel, Parker, Paul Baine,</hi> &amp;c.
on the other,) that I think it not meet here to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
my thoughts. But that it is not eſſential to a
Church, and that all the Church will not unite in it,
appeareth as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> IX. 1. They are not united in it now: The
Reformed Churches in <hi>France, Belgia, Helvetia,</hi> and
many other parts, are againſt ſuch Biſhops as <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and a <hi>diſtinct Order.</hi> And in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi>
and <hi>Ireland, New-England,</hi> &amp;c. they are by ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
and by others not.</p>
               <p>2. Former Ages have had many pious Chriſtians
againſt them, eſpecially in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and among the
<hi>Waldenſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The School-men and other Papiſts are not
themſelves agreed, whether Biſhops and Presbyters
are diſtinct Orders.</p>
               <p>4. The Church of <hi>England</hi> even while Popiſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
it, and ſaid they were but <hi>one Order,</hi> as you may
ſee in <hi>Spelman Aelfreds</hi> Laws or Canons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:55406:205"/>
5. <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Eutychius Alexandrinus</hi> tell us how
and why Epiſcopacy was introduced at <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
and that the Presbyters made them there.</p>
               <p>6. The <hi>Scots</hi> were long governed without them,
(as <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Beda</hi> tell us.) And their <hi>Presbyters</hi>
made the <hi>firſt Biſhops in Northumberland;</hi> as <hi>Pomera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
a Presbyter made thoſe in <hi>Denmark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. Almoſt all the Churches in Eaſt and Weſt as
far as I can learn, have caſt off Parochial Biſhops (of
ſingle Churches) and in their ſtead ſet up <hi>Dioceſans</hi>
over multitudes of <hi>Pariſhes</hi> without any Biſhops un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them, but Curats only.</p>
               <p>8. While there is no hope of all agreeing whether
it be a Divine Inſtitution, and that of eſſential neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
there is no probability that ever the Univerſal
Church will unite in them.</p>
               <p>9. The Dioceſans we find will never yield to
them.</p>
               <p>10. The reception of them will not unite the
Church were it agreed on, it being more and greater
matters that they differ about.</p>
               <p>I confeſs that the ancient reception of them was ſo
general, and the reaſon of the thing ſo fair, that I
am none of thoſe that accuſe ſuch Epiſcopacy as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
or Schiſmatical, but rather think it conduceth
to prevent Schiſms: But, 1. I am ſatisfied that it will
not be agreed to by all, 2. Nor ſerve for univerſal
Concord were it agreed on; 3. And that it is Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
to make them more neceſſary than God hath
made them, and to cut off Chriſtians or Churches that
cannot receive them.</p>

that the word Presbyter every where in Scripture ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
a Biſhop:</hi> And if ſo,</p>
               <p>1. Men will know that the Apoſtolical Form was
for every Congregational Church to have a Biſhop of
its own.</p>
               <p>2. That no Biſhop had more ſetled Congregations
than one: For no ſuch Congregation could worſhip
God, and celebrate the Sacrament of Communion, as
then they conſtantly did, without a Miniſter; And one
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55406:207"/>
Biſhop could be but in one place at once, and ſo without
Curates, could have but one Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>3. And Men will be inquiſitive, <hi>By what Authority</hi>
Subject Presbyters, and Dioceſan Biſhops and Churches
were introduced after Scripture-times? in which they
will never receive univerſal ſatisfaction. If it be ſaid
that the Apoſtles gave Biſhops Power to make a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
order of Presbyters, and to turn Pariſh or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational
Churches into Dioceſan, and ſo to alter the
firſt Forms of Government, when they were dead; this
will not be received without proofs, which never will
be given to ſatisfie all: Nay, it will ſeem utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable,
and Men will ask,</p>
               <p>1. Why did not the Apoſtles do it themſelves, if
they would have it done? Was not their Authority
more unqueſtionable than theirs that ſhould come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
If it be ſaid that there were not qualified Men
enow, it will,</p>
               <p>2. Be asked, Were there not like to be then greateſt
Choice upon the extraordinary pouring out of the
Spirit?</p>
               <p>3. Do we not find in <hi>Corinth</hi> ſo many inſpired gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
perſons in one Aſſembly, that <hi>Paul</hi> was put to limit
them in their Prophecying, yet allowing many to do it
one by one? And <hi>Acts</hi> 13. there were many Prophets
and Teachers in <hi>Antioch:</hi> And at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> more, and
at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Acts 20. and at <hi>Philippi,</hi> Phil. 1. 1, 2.
there were many Biſhops or Elders; And ſuch Deacons
as <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> &amp;c. would have ſerved for El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
rather than to have none.</p>
               <p>4. Doth not this imply, that after-times that might
make ſo great a change, may alſo do the like in other
things?</p>
               <p>5. And that Dioceſans and ſubject Presbyters be but
humane Inſtitutions, and therefore Men may again
change them?</p>

               <p>1. Some Dioceſans have Dioceſſes ſo ſmall, that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline

               <p>2. Some Dioceſans exerciſe the Church Keys of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication

delegate them to Presbyters, (and thereby tell the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that Presbyters are capable of them.) Others (which
is the Caſe with us in <hi>England</hi>) do commit them to
Lay-Chancellors, who Excommunicate and Abſolve by
Sentence, commanding a Prieſt to publiſh it.</p>
               <p>3. Some Dioceſans may, if they pleaſe, allow the
Pariſh-Prieſt to be <hi>Epiſcopus Gregis,</hi> and to exerciſe ſo
much of his true office in his Pariſh, as ſhall keep up
ſome tolerable Purity, Order and Diſcipline, themſelves

think that Forms of Church-Government are mutable,

Prudence may change other Rites, Circumſtances and
Orders, ſo it may do this: And ſome Papiſts are of this
mind; Read <hi>Card. Cuſanus de Concordia,</hi> and <hi>Gorſon de
Auferibilitate Papae;</hi> And the <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops at <hi>Trent,</hi>
were for the dependance of Biſhops on the Pope, as the
Maker of their Order, or Giver of their Power. And
if ſo, it is not capable of being neceſſary to Catholick
Unity, which may it ſelf be changed. And moſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
and Papiſts hold, that Men may turn Dioceſan
Biſhops again into Parochial, if they ſaw cauſe. And

Union before there was any General Council: The

Brethren who then were abſent, about the world.
The Popes and his Cardinals may ſay they are a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

               <p>1. If it be the Laws of <hi>paſt Councils,</hi> then one

proveth, that they have been ſo far from being the
cauſes of Concord, and Preventers or Healers of
Schiſms, that they have been one of the moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
cauſes of diviſion and diſtraction. Having proved
this in a peculiar Treatiſe, (<hi>A Breviate of the Hiſtory of
Biſhops and Councils,</hi>) I muſt not here repeat it. The
Council of <hi>Nice</hi> did beſt: But as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was fain
to keep Peace among the Biſhops in perſon, and burnt
their numerous Libels againſt each other, ſo wiſe men
think he might another way have better ſuppreſſed
<hi>Arianiſm,</hi> and prevented the many contrary and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Councils, which this one did by one word occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and have prevented the Perſecutions which <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi>
and <hi>Conſtantius</hi> exerciſed: And had the time of
<hi>Eaſter</hi> been left at liberty, perhaps it had as much made
for Peace.</p>
               <p>What the firſt Council at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> did, the

tell us, whoſe character of the Biſhops (not <hi>Arians</hi> as
ſome talk) ſhould not be read without tears by any,
whence he learned the danger of Councils, and reſolved
never to come to more.</p>
               <p>What all the Baſtard Councils did at <hi>Ariminum,
Sirinium, Alexandria, Milan,</hi> &amp;c. I need not tell.</p>
               <p>And what Schiſm and Bloodſhed was occaſioned by

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55406:212"/>
Church Hiſtory. It is true indeed, that the <hi>Neſtorians</hi>

in many following: But whether mutual un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
might not have made a better end, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to a Thouſand years experience, and to the nature
of the Hereſies there condemned, which ſeem to be
much formed in and by ambiguous words, which a
good Explication might have better healed, than Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's
and Bloodſhed. Of this I ſpake before (and
often.) The <hi>Neſtorians</hi> ſaid, that <hi>Mary</hi> was not to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Mother of God, but of Chriſt. The Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
ſaid the contrary: when the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
never meant that ſhe begat the
<hi>Godhead,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of this more before.</note> and the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
that ſhe begate him that <hi>is God.</hi>
Where then is the difference but in words, one ſpeaking
of the <hi>Abſtract</hi> (Deity) which the other never
meant?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Neſtorians</hi> were charged with holding <hi>two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
in Chriſt, inſtead of two Natures: which yet
<hi>Neſtorius</hi> plainly denieth, but <hi>Cyril</hi> charged it on him
by conſequence, becauſe he refuſed the name <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
on the foreſaid account; thinking that denomination
<hi>a ratione formali,</hi> is moſt apt. And it ſeems one took
Nature in the ſame ſenſe, as others took <hi>Perſon,</hi> meaning
the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eutychians</hi> aſſerted <hi>one Nature</hi> only, but they
meant that Chriſt had but <hi>one Nature,</hi> as undivided,
(which the Orthodox granted) but denied not that
the Godhead and Manhood were <hi>diſtinct.</hi> And what
was the difference then, but whether the <hi>undivided God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
and Manhood ſhould be called one Nature, or two;</hi>
which truly in one ſenſe was two, and in another one.
The like was the <hi>Monothelites</hi> Hereſie (for and againſt
which were many Councils) about one or two <hi>Wills</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:55406:212"/>
and <hi>Operations,</hi> no more diſagreeing than as aforeſaid,
about the ſenſe of [<hi>One</hi>] and [<hi>Two.</hi>] And had
not a wiſe Explication, and patient Reconciliation, done
better ſervice, than Curſing did, whoſe doleful effects
(Hatred, Hereticating and Schiſm) continue to this
day.</p>
               <p>Should I come to the Councils about Images, and that
at <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> that decreed the <hi>Tribus Capitulis,</hi> and
the multitudes ſince that have depoſed Emperors and
Kings, raiſed Wars, ſet up Popes, and Anti-Popes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Alas how ſad a Hiſtory would it be, to convince us that
Councils of Biſhops have cauſed moſt of the Schiſms,
Church-Tyranny, Rebellions and Confuſions in the
Chriſtian world. And if the Popes have been reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or depoſed, or Schiſms at <hi>Rome</hi> partly ſtopt
by any, the flame hath quickly more broke out; and
condemned Popes have oft got the better of them: And
if one Council hath ſaid, That the Pope is reſponſible,
another hath determined the contrary: If <hi>Baſil</hi> and
<hi>Conſtance</hi> decreed, That a Council be called every ten
years, it was not done, but was a mockery in the event.
In a word, Councils of Biſhops have been but Church-Armies,
of which at firſt the Patriarchs were Generals,
and afterwards Popes and Emperors, and came to fight
it out for Victory, the ſequel being uſually Schiſm and
Calamity. And muſt this be the only way of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Peace?</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Vniverſal Church will never unite in many
pretended Articles of Faith, not proved to
be Divine: nor in owning unneceſſary doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Opinions or Practices as Religious, or
Worſhip of God; notwithſtanding the pretenſe
of Tradition.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> I. I Need ſay no more for proof of this than is
ſaid in the firſt Part. If Preachers ſay that
this or that is an Article of Faith; If Popes ſay it; If
Councils ſay it, this ſaying will never unite all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in the belief of it. It is no belief of God whoſe
object is not revealed by God, and perceived ſo to
be, and received as ſuch. That the ſacred Scriptures
are written by Divine Inſpiration, Chriſtians are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
agreed; But that Popes, Prelates or Councils
ſpeak by Divine Inſpiration, even when they expound
the Scriptures, all Chriſtians neither are agreed, nor
ever will be; And till a man perceiveth that it is God
that ſpeaketh, or that the word ſpoken is Gods Word,
he cannot believe it with a Divine Faith, which is
nothing but believing it to be Gods Word, and truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it accordingly. God is true, but men are Lyers,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> II. Before we can receive any thing as Truth
from Man, we muſt have evidence that it is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed:
And that muſt be, 1. Either from the nature
of the thing, and its cauſes; 2. Or from ſome teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of God either concomitant (as Miracles
were) or ſubſequent, (in the Effects;) 3. Or from
our knowledge of the <hi>Veracity, Authority, Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
and Infallibility of the Inſtrument or Speaker.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55406:213"/>
If therefore any Church or company of men ſhall tell
us, that this is a Divine Truth or Article of Faith,
no more of the World can be expected to believe
them, than are convinced of it by one of theſe three
proofs: The firſt is the caſe of natural Revelation, and
not now queſtioned: The Second none but the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> do plead for their own belief, <hi>viz.</hi> that they
work Miracles, and therefore are to be believed in
whatever they affirm to be the Word of God. <hi>Knot</hi>
againſt <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> and others of them do ultimately
reſolve their Faith, or their proof of the truth of their
Religion into the Miracles wrought in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> by which God teſtifieth his approbation of
their Aſſertions: Other Chriſtians that may have
more miracles than Papiſts, yet reſolve not their proof
of Chriſtianity into them, but lay more ſtreſs on other
Evidence, and particularly on Chriſts and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
miracles atteſting the holy Scriptures and Goſpel
to be of God. And when we can find juſt proof of the
Papiſts Miracles, we ſhall be willing to ſtudy the
meaning of them: But hitherto we have not found
ſuch proof. If any Council in <hi>Rome, France, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
or <hi>England</hi> ſhall ſay, <hi>Theſe are Divine revealed
Truths, and as ſuch, you muſt believe, ſubſcribe or ſwear
to them,</hi> the world will never agree in believing them,
when no ſober man is bound to believe them, but as
humane, uncertain and fallible witneſſes, according to
the meaſure of their Credibility.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> III. Long experience fully proveth this: No

Faith.) That which the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> ſaid, was
denyed by the Councils at <hi>Sirmium, Ariminum,</hi> &amp;c.

                  </gap>alſhoods,
or Uncertainties on the Churches, is a notorious cauſe
of Schiſm: For what can you expect that men of
Sobriety and Conſcience ſhould do in ſuch a caſe?
Diſcern the certainty of the thing they cannot; nor
can they believe that all muſt needs be true, that is
ſaid by a Synod, a Convocation or a Parliament: And
they dare not lie, in ſaying they believe that which
they do not: And to take all for Schiſmaticks that
dare not deliberately lie, or that ſet not up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

men as Lords of their Conſcience inſtead of God, is
Schiſmatical, unchriſtian and inhumane.</p>
               <p>And as mens mere <hi>wills</hi> ought not to rule their
underſtandings, nor the will of Synods, of Biſhops,
or others, to be the rule and meaſure of our wills, ſo
though we were never ſo willing to believe all to
be true that Councils of Biſhops or Princes ſay, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

We <hi>cannot</hi> believe what we liſt. To know or believe
without evidence of truth, is to ſee without light.
Falſe Hypocrites may force their tongues to ſay that

be not to be <hi>done,</hi> yet all things to be <hi>done</hi> as
<hi>commanded by God,</hi> muſt firſt be <hi>believed</hi> to be <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> VI. But it's one thing to ſay, <hi>This is Gods
Command;</hi> and another to ſay, <hi>This is our Command.</hi>
The firſt none will agree to, that ſee not evidence to
believe it. The ſecond is, 1. Either <hi>according</hi> to Gods
Command (to drive Men to obey it.) 2. Or <hi>beſide</hi> his
Command. 3. Or againſt his Command.</p>
               <p>1. Thoſe Laws of Men which are <hi>according</hi> to
Gods Laws, thoſe only will obey who diſcern them
ſo to be, on that account: Therefore it muſt be in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

               <p>2. Thoſe that are but <hi>beſides Gods Laws,</hi> Men
ſhould obey, ſo far as they can find that the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
have power from God to make them; And how
few ſuch will be matter of Univerſal Concord?</p>
               <p>3. Thoſe that are <hi>against Gods Laws,</hi> no good
Chriſtians will knowingly conſent to.</p>

what great diverſity of capacities and underſtandings
there be in the world, ſo that even in common matters
that are ſtill before our eyes, at leaſt in many or moſt,
few perſons long agree: In matters of Fact at any
diſtance, or matters of Prudence, Husband and Wife,
Parents and Children, Maſter and Servants, daily differ:
Mens faces ſcarce differ more than their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
It is only in few, plain, eaſie things, that all Men
are agreed: And are ever all Chriſtians like to agree
in many humane, dark opinions? Or will it be taken
for certain to all Men, becauſe it is ſo to ſome of clearer
underſtandings? or becauſe a ſelf-confident Impoſer ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vehemently

aſſerteth it? They know not themſelves,
they know no Man, that preſume to unite the Church
this way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> VIII. Therefore the Popiſh numerous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
<hi>de Fide,</hi> are but ſo many Engines of Schiſm made
on the pretence of declaring Points of Faith. If they
were Articles of Faith before, they may be <hi>mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>est</hi> to
be ſo in the Divine Revelation, that is, the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures:
But for the Council to tell a Man, [<hi>This or
That is in the Bible, but we cannot ſhew you it there, nor
can you find it if you ſearch, but you must take our
words as infallible:</hi>] This is not a center that the
Chriſtian world will ever unite in.</p>
               <p>And if it be an Article of Faith, either the Church
held it before the Council declared it, or not: If they
did, then it was known without a Councils Declaration.
And what need a Council to declare that which all the
Church did hold before, and was in poſſeſſion of? But
if not, then either it <hi>was an Article of Faith before, or
not.</hi> If it was, then the Church before held not that
Faith, and ſo was Heretical, Corrupt, or wanted Faith,
and ſo by their own reckoning (who will not endure
the diſtinction of eſſentials from the reſt) was no
Church. If not, then the Council declared that to be
an Article of Faith, which was none: It muſt <hi>be ſuch,</hi>
before it can <hi>be truly declared</hi> ſuch; elſe a falſe Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that it <hi>was ſuch,</hi> did now <hi>make</hi> it ſuch: But if
they had openly profeſſed, That by <hi>Declaring</hi> it an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
they meant the <hi>Making</hi> one, they muſt prove,</p>
               <p>1. That they are Prophets, and have new Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
even of Faith.</p>
               <p>2. And that the Scriptures were not ſufficient mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the Churches Faith to the end of the
world.</p>
               <p>3. And that the Churches Faith is alterable and
creſcent, and the old Church had not the ſame Faith
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55406:215"/>
which the preſent Church hath. And will the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
world any more agree in ſuch abſurdities, than in
a Quakers of Familiſts profeſſing, that he ſpeaketh by
Inſpiration? If the Members of the Council before
they came thither, were no wiſer nor honeſter than
other Men, nor their words more credible, how ſhall
we know that when they are there, they are become
inſpired, and their words are Gods own words?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if it be ſaid,</hi> That they neither make new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith, nor declare what is in Scripture by Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
but declare the Verbal Tradition of the Apoſtles; <hi>I
ask,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. If ſo big a Book as the Bible, contain not ſo
much as all the Churches Creed;</p>
               <p>2. Where hath this Traditional Faith been kept till
now? If by <hi>all</hi> the Church, then it was held, poſſeſſed
and known before that Declaration: If but by part of
the Church, then it was but part of the Church that
had the true Faith, and one part was of one Religion,
and another part of another.</p>
               <p>And which part was it that kept this Tradition?
And how come we to know that they were righter
than the reſt, that had it not? If it was <hi>Rome</hi> only,
then they had a Faith different from the reſt of the
Churches; And how ſhall we know that they are not
as true and ſound as <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how hath this Tradition been carried on, and
kept right? Was it by <hi>Writing,</hi> or by <hi>Word?</hi> If by
<hi>Writings,</hi> why are they not cited, ſeen and tryed?
Other men can read as well as Popes and Councils: If
<hi>unwritten,</hi> was it by publick Preaching, or private
Talk? If the former, then it was commonly known
and declared, before the Council declared it. If by
private Talk, how ſhall we be ſure,</p>
               <p>1. That they were honeſt men that would keep
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55406:216"/>
private the Publick Faith, eſpecially being Preachers
that by office were to publiſh it.</p>
               <p>2. And that it hath been well remembred and carried
on without alteration. And were it preached or whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered,
mans memory is ſo frail, and words ſo uncertain,
that for the Church, or a piece of the Church to carry
down from the Apoſtles from Fathers to Children ſo
many Articles, (more than are in all the Bible) and
ſo hard and myſterious, and by many now controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and this not by writing, and to be ſure that no
miſtake hath been made by oblivion, or miſexpreſsion,
this is a thing that the Church will never unite in the
belief of.</p>
               <p>And was it in a <hi>ſet form of unchangeable words,</hi> that
all theſe Articles (or Expoſitions) were carried down
till now, or not? If yea, we ſhould have had that Form
deliver'd us, as we have other Forms (<hi>the Creed, Lords
Prayer,</hi> &amp;c.) If not, how ſhall we know that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Children had the ſame underſtanding of the
matter, and changed not the Faith by change of words?
And it's like that all the Churches, ſince the Apoſtles,
delivered not theſe Articles down in the <hi>ſame words,</hi>
when in ſeveral Countries and Ages they ſpake not the
ſame language. And it is a wonder that they would
never write their Faith, for their Children to learn,
when the <hi>Jews, Deut.</hi> 6. and 11. were commanded to
teach their Children, by writing the Law upon the very
Poſts of their Houſes, and their Gates: And it is a
greater wonder, that Parents and Children ſhould
through ſo many Generations and Countries have ſo
unerring ſur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> a memory.</p>
               <p>And it is ſtrange how their own Commentators come
to differ about the ſenſe of Thouſands of Texts of
Scripture, if the Churches Tradition have publickly
and notoriouſly delivered down the meaning of them.

If not, how Councils come to be the infallible

long torn the Church, and made multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
tear themſelves, and foam out Reproach, yea, and
Blood againſt each other, will preſently meet the very
Title of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> with a charge of Pride againſt

more than all the Churches in the World? And pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to charge them all with ſo great Error, as not to know
the terms of Chriſtian Concord, nor the way of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Peace?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I anſwer, 1. Is the Church now United in any
of theſe terms or ways? Are they all <hi>Papiſts?</hi> Are
they all of the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> or <hi>Armenian, Abaſſine,
&amp;c?</hi> Are they all <hi>Lutherans,</hi> or <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> &amp;c? If not,
why ſhould you conclude that ever they will be? Or
that any of theſe are congruous terms of Concord,
and that the ſame that doth not heal, will heal them?
Will not Chriſtians be the ſame as now?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> II. They never were United on any of theſe
terms. I have proved that they were never all <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:55406:217"/>
And it will be eaſily granted of the reſt (that they
were never all <hi>Greeks, Lutherans,</hi> &amp;c.) And that
which never did unite the Church, never will do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> III. If you think all muſt be united in any
of theſe wayes, which of them is it? And why that,
rather than any of the reſt?</p>
               <p>1. Muſt they all be of the <hi>Greek</hi> opinions? You ſee
that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> condemn them for <hi>Schiſmaticks:</hi> And
other Churches lament their manifold Corruptions:
And the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries long ſince divided from
them. We have here in <hi>London</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> Church new
built, and Tolerated; and their work is done ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
and unreverently, that they have uſually not
twice the number of the officiating or preſent Prieſts
who join with them.</p>
               <p>2. Muſt they all be <hi>Papiſts?</hi> Never was more Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Cruelty uſed to propagate and prop up any
Church under Heaven; and yet they cannot prevail
for Univerſal Subjection. Nay, many Kingdoms and
Countries are fallen from them, while they uſed ſuch
means to keep them, inſomuch that by many of the
ſoundeſt Churches, they are taken for no better than
Antichriſtian Hereticks. And even the <hi>Greek</hi> Church
ſeparateth from them, and pronounceth them <hi>Schijma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
and Excommunicates them every year; And they
can never obliterate the Hiſtory of their horrid Schiſms
and Uſurpations, and inhumane Butcheries, which will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienate
many from them. Will all the world ever agree
to the Dominion of one Uſurper? Will they all believe
the Monſter of Tranſubſtantiation? Will they all
agree, That all the Senſes of all men are deceived, who
think that they ſee and taſte Bread and Wine, and there
is none? And that it is neceſſary to Salvation, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all our Senſes, and the Scripture, that oft calls
it Bread after the Conſecration, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. Will all
agree, That God, who cannot lie by Supernatural
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55406:218"/>
Revelation, is the Father of all the lies to Senſe, that
perceive real Bread and Wine, and deceiveth them all
by his Natural Revelation? Will all men believe. That
every lying, fornicating, proud and covetous Prieſt,
even many Thouſands of them, can work Miracles at
their pleaſures every day in the week, by making
Bread no Bread, and turning it into Fleſh and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

in Heaven, hath yet heavenly Fleſh in the Sacrament.

they anathematize the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which think
that Chriſt hath <hi>Fleſh</hi> in Heaven, and in the Euchariſt,

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55406:218"/>
let thoſe that would pervert the word [<hi>Craſſitudinem</hi>]
note, that he doth not diſtinguiſh of Chriſts <hi>fleſh</hi> and
<hi>ours</hi> as two ſorts, and ſay, <hi>extra carnem Craſſam,</hi> but,
deny him to have <hi>fleſh,</hi> and ſay, <hi>extra craſſitudinem carnis,</hi>
as an eſſential property of fleſh: And one of theſe
Councils the Papiſts own.</p>
               <p>Will all Chriſtians agree that every Prieſt muſt firſt
make his God, and then eat him? or that he muſt
communicate alone without communion with the
People? or that he muſt worſhip Bread and Wine as
his God? or that he may give a half-Sacrament of
Bread without Wine, contrary to Chriſts Inſtitution,
the Apoſtles Doctrine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and all the Churches
conſtant practice till of late. And that inſtead of a
Commemoration he offereth a real preſent Sacrifice
for the quick and dead? Will all agree to their Image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip?
Why then did ſo many Councils condemn
it? Will all agree that the Aſſemblies pray in an
unknown tongue? He is mad with errour who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
that ever the Church Univerſal will receive
all theſe and the reſt, which pretended Infallibility
maketh to be uncurable Errours in the impenitent
<hi>Roman</hi> Sect.</p>
               <p>3. And briefly as to the reſt, there is no <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt</hi>
believeth that ever all the Churches will receive
the <hi>Lutherane</hi> Conſubſtantiation or Church-Images?
Nor any <hi>Lutherane</hi> that believeth that ever all the

even here in <hi>England</hi> honoured by many (that yet
diſown it as a note of Schiſm,) and reproached with
the bittereſt ſcorn and accuſations by others.</p>
               <p>Indeed the <hi>Behmeniſts,</hi> the Quakers and ſome Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts
have ſaid, that all the Churches would at

                  </gap>ers,
I have opened before. What the Anabaptiſts do, by
differing from almoſt all other Chriſtians, is known.
What the Dioceſans have done in Councils, and by
ſilencing others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> enow have ſhewed. What In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents
and their way have done towards Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and Separations, it is in vain in this Age in
<hi>England</hi> to recite: And many wiſe men think, that
the Presbyterians over violent rejecting of all Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
ſetting up unordained Elders, and National
Churches as headed by National Aſſemblies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are
diviſive and unwarrantable; As the ſame men think
their making by the <hi>Scots</hi> Covenant the renouncing
of the Prelacy to be the teſt of National Concord,
alſo was.</p>
               <p>And who can think that Eraſtianiſm, depoſing the

will not ſtill more divide than heal?</p>

take in almoſt all ſuch parties: but not <hi>as ſuch,</hi> by
receiving any of their Errours, but as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who
<hi>agree</hi> in the <hi>common Eſſentials</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Piety.</hi>
We can unite <hi>with ſober Anabaptiſts,</hi> but not by <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
Anabaptiſts. Chriſtïanity</hi> is our Religion, and
with all that hold the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, we
can hold eſſential Unity: And with thoſe that hold
the Integrals moſt purely, we have more and neerer
Concord than with the reſt, that have more errours:
And if any of theſe parties be ſounder than the reſt,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55406:219"/>
we love and honour them above the reſt, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> IX. Now it is ſuppoſed, that if a point of
Order be omitted; If the Election day by Fire or
Plague, or War, be overpaſt; If the Recorder be dead,
or refuſe his Office, that this doth not totally Null the
Charter: One choſen a week after, in caſe of neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
may have the Power: Or if that Years Election
ſhould hereby be made void, the Charter is not void,
but will the next Year authorize the Perſon choſen.
Interruption will not hinder this. And if one that had
not a juſt Election, or Inveſtiture, ſhould intrude this
Year, the Charter will authorize the next notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Or if the Recorder that inveſted the laſt was an
Intruder, the next may yet be truly authorized: Or if
the Charter were, that every former Mayor ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
the next, it would not hinder a Succeſsion, if a
former had uſurped: For the Charter ſtill reviveth it,
and is ſuppoſed to appoint ſuch means as are ſufficient,
if a circumſtance fail.</p>
               <p>So is it in the preſent Caſe: If a Biſhop were an
Uſurper, conterfeiting his own Ordination; or if a
Presbyter pretend himſelf a Biſhop, or to have Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
Power when he hath not, or if an unjuſt
Choice be made, the next Man hath ſtill a due way of
entrance; yea, and want of ſuch a point of Order,
when it is not fraudulently contemned or refuſed, Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
not the Office Power. Order is for the thing
ordered, and for the common good, and not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
againſt it. If the <hi>Phariſees</hi> that ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi>
Chair were to be heard, and the High-Prieſts that were
then unlawfully called (out of the true line, and buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Office of the <hi>Romans</hi> for money) were to be
ſubmitted to in their Office, much more a Chriſtian
Paſtor truly qualified by God, and choſen by the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55406:222"/>
Flock, and approved by <hi>Senior Paſtors,</hi> though there
were ſome point of Order wanting.</p>
               <p>

taught us, <hi>That He will have mercy, and not ſacrifice;
and that the Sabbath was made for man, and not man
for the Sabbath; and</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Apollo <hi>are for the

the Poor,</hi> that muſt be done by the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi>
which cannot be done according to all the Points of
an <hi>Ordering Law of Man;</hi> ſo is it here: It is meet
for the ſafety of Mens Health, that none practiſe <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi>
but a <hi>Licenſed Phyſician;</hi> But in Caſes of Neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
(when Phyſicians are wanting) every one that
hath skill may uſe it, and an able Man may be a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
unlicenſed, rather than ſee Men periſh whom he
may help. It hath been my own Caſe: In a great and
poor Town where was no Phyſician, came an <hi>Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Pluriſie;</hi> had they been neglected, moſt had dyed;
Neceſsity conſtrained me to adviſe them, and they all
recovered: Thereupon their Poverty and Importunity
conſtrain'd me to practiſe Phyſick many Years (only
<hi>gratis</hi>) and God by it ſaved the lives of multitudes;
ſhould I think, in this caſe of Neceſsity, that I ſinned,
becauſe I took not a <hi>Licence,</hi> (which reſolving not to
continue the Practice, I could not do:) So I have
known ſome skill'd in Law, that have help'd many by
Council, though they were no Lawyers.</p>
               <p>So none may take up Arms as a Soldier without the
King's Commiſsion: But in caſe Traytors and Rebels
ſuddenly endanger King and Kingdoms, or Enemies
invade the Land, every Man is a Soldier by the Law of
Nature; which alſo enableth every Man to defend his
Life, Purſe, Houſe, Parents, Neighbors, againſt Thieves
and Murderers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:55406:222"/>
The Law of the Land ordereth, That the Poor be
kept by the Pariſhes from Begging, and that we relieve
not Beggars otherwiſe. But if the Pariſhes through
Poverty or Uncharitableneſs neglect them, the <hi>Law of
Nature</hi> bindeth us to relieve them, rather than ſee them
periſh.</p>
               <p>All Laws, for the meer <hi>Ordering</hi> of any Duty, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that the <hi>Duty muſt be done,</hi> and that as tendeth to
its <hi>proper end,</hi> and not that on pretence of <hi>Order</hi> it be
<hi>undone.</hi> If the Coronation of a King be not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
regularly, he is <hi>King</hi> nevertheleſs by <hi>Inheritance,</hi> or
<hi>Election;</hi> and he is <hi>King</hi> before his <hi>Coronation. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi>
is valid before God, by <hi>mutual conſent,</hi> before the
<hi>Matrimonial Solemnization;</hi> and where this cannot be
had, it is no Duty. If a Prieſt would not marry Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
unleſs they will make ſome <hi>unlawful Promiſe,</hi> or <hi>do</hi>
ſome <hi>unlawful thing,</hi> it is lawful (and may be a Duty)

do accidentally make it unlawful: And in ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
the ſinful courſe of Prieſts may make this an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Caſe. And no reaſon can be given, but that here
it may be ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> XI. Many Caſes may fall out in which no
Ordination, by Impoſition of Hands, or preſent Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
may be neceſſary to this Office.</p>
               <p>1. In Caſe a Company of Chriſtians be Caſt upon a
remote Iſland, where no Ordainer can be had, and yet
ſome of them are qualified Perſons: It is ſinful for them
to forbear Gods Publick Worſhip, therefore they muſt
chooſe the fitteſt perſon to perform it, <hi>viz.</hi> Preaching,
Prayer, Praiſe, Baptizing, and the Lords Supper: And
that Election ſufficiently deſigneth the perſon, that
from Chriſts Charter ſhall receive the Miniſterial
Power, and be obliged to the Duty (if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:55406:223"/>
2. In Caſe the Perſon be remote, and the Ordainers
and he cannot meet, or Perſecutors, or Tyrants, or
other Accidents, hinder their Meeting, he may be Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
by <hi>Letters,</hi> without any other Ordination: It
is well known that this hath of old been practiſed, and
Biſhops have ſent ſuch Letters of Ordination, to thoſe
abſent Perſons that have fled from Ordination, and ſo
made them Biſhops. And it being but the deſignation
of the <hi>recipient Perſon</hi> on whom <hi>Chriſts Law</hi> ſhall
confer the Office, that they have to do, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to be given why they may not do it effectually by
writing.</p>
               <p>3. In Caſe that Death or Perſecution hath left none
to Ordain, that are within reach of the Perſon to be
Ordained: If Ordination by Dioceſanes were ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neceſſary, yet in thoſe Kingdoms or Countries where
there is none, it cannot be had; as in <hi>New-England,</hi> and
lately in <hi>Britain,</hi> in <hi>Belgia, Helvetia,</hi> and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Some may ſay,</hi> You ought to go for it, though as far
as from <hi>America</hi> hither, and to ſeek it Beyond the Seas,
and in other Lands, or ſtay till it may be had. <hi>But I
anſwer,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. In ſome Countries the Governors will not ſuffer
Dioceſane Ordination.</p>
               <p>2. Words are ſoon ſpoken, but to ſail from <hi>America</hi>
hither, and that for every Man that is to be Ordained, is
not ſoon done; ſome have not health to bear it at Sea;
ſome have not money to pay for the Voyage
charge.</p>
               <p>3. It is a ſinful loſs of a Years time, in which they
might do God much ſervice.</p>
               <p>4. A Years Voyage by Sea to and fro, may hazard
their Lives, and ſo fruſtrate all their end.</p>
               <p>5. Some Princes and States forbid their Subjects to
be Ordained in Foreign Lands, as we forbid <hi>Romiſh</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:55406:223"/>
Ordination, leſt it draw a Foreign Power on
them.</p>
               <p>6. It is not lawful to deny God his Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and our ſelves the benefit, by ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay.</p>
               <p>7. It is contrary to the temper of the Goſpel, which
ever ſubjecteth Ceremony, Rites and External Orders,
to Morals, and to Mans good, and the great
Ends.</p>
               <p>8. And it is a wrong to the honour of the <hi>Divine
Nature,</hi> for Men to feign, that the Great, Wiſe, and
Merciful God, layeth ſo great a ſtreſs upon a <hi>Ceremony,</hi>
or <hi>Rite,</hi> or outward <hi>Order,</hi> as to damn Souls, and deny
his own Worſhip, where it cannot be had.</p>
               <p>4. And this Ordination is not neceſſary, in Caſe the
Ordainers be grown ſo wicked, or heretical, as that
they will ordain no good and orthodox Men, but only
ſuch as are of their own ſinful way.</p>
               <p>5. And in Caſe the Ordainers require, as neceſſary,
any one unlawful thing, Subſcriptions, Profeſsion, Vow,
or Practice.</p>
               <p>If any ſay, That God will never permit us to fall
under ſuch Neceſsities, they muſt prove it; and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
diſproveth it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> XII. And if in all ſuch Caſes <hi>no Ordination</hi>
be neceſſary, much leſs is <hi>Dioceſane Ordination</hi> neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in all Caſes and Places: As,</p>
               <p>1. In Countries where no Dioceſanes are, or are
near.</p>
               <p>2. In Countries where they or their Ordination is
not endured by the Governors.</p>
               <p>3. In Countries where the People being in judgment
againſt it, will have no Paſtor ſo Ordained: It is not
better to have none at all.</p>
               <p>4. In Countries where <hi>Wars</hi> do hinder it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:55406:224"/>
5. When the Dioceſanes themſelves will not venture
to Ordain, for fear of ſuffering for it.</p>
               <p>6. In Countries where the Biſhops are ſo corrupted,
that they refuſe all that are truly fit.</p>
               <p>7. Or where they refuſe all whom the People either
chooſe, or will conſent to; and the Biſhops and People
cannot agree on the ſame Man.</p>
               <p>8. Or wherever the Dioceſanes impoſe unlawful Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,
Promiſes, Profeſsions, Subſcriptions, Vows,
Oaths, or Practices, without which they will not Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain.</p>
               <p>On ſome or other of theſe accounts, a Romaniſt
would not be Ordained by a Greek, or Proteſtant, or
<hi>Armenian,</hi> &amp;c. and a Greek, or Proteſtant, would not
be Ordained by a Papiſt; ſuppoſing ſomething to be
unlawful.</p>
               <p>9. But when a Parochial Biſhop may be the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainer,
in ſuch Caſes, the Validity will not be denied
by moſt Epiſcopal Divines.</p>
               <p>10. And it is truly as valid in ſuch Caſes, when,
1. Senior Presbyters, 2. that are authorized by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
3. eſpecially that are chief Paſtors in Cities,
and have Curates under them, do Ordain, though ſome
deny to call them Biſhops.</p>
               <p>11. As the <hi>Eraſtians</hi> think that the Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
may deſign the perſon, by the Peoples conſent,
without any other Ordination; ſo <hi>Muſculus</hi> and ſome
other Proteſtants think, that a fit perſon deſigned by the
Magiſtrate, and accepted by the People, need not
queſtion his Call to the Office; And it's hard to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them.</p>
               <p>12. If the Opinion of many Papiſts, and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
hold true, That a Biſhop differeth not from a
Presbyter in <hi>Order</hi> (or Office) but in <hi>Degree,</hi> as the
Foreman of a Jury, or the Preſident of a Synod <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:55406:224"/>
Colledge, or Council of State, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then I ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
but the Magiſtrate may make a Biſhop of a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,
as he may make a Preſident of a Colledge, or a
Mayor of a Corporation: For then the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but in the <hi>Accidents</hi> of the Office, and the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Governor of the Church, as far as the Sword is to
govern, and ſpecially the determiner of meer <hi>Accidents</hi>
and <hi>Circumſtances, circa ſacra,</hi> why may he not ſet one
Presbyter in degree above the reſt? Did not all the
ſtrife of Emperors for the power of inveſting Biſhops,
ſignifie this much againſt the Popes oppoſition? Both
ſides granted that the People and Clergy were to be
the Chooſers of a Biſhop. And it was the old Canon,
that no Biſhop ſhould remove from Seat to Seat; ſo that
only <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and no <hi>former Biſhops,</hi> were made
Biſhops of any particular City, (or Deacons, or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons
ſometime at <hi>Rome.</hi>) By which it appeareth,
that the Emperors power of Inveſtiture amounted to a
Negative voice, in the making of a Biſhop. The
Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſent <hi>Levites</hi> to teach the People, and
<hi>Solomon</hi> choſe who ſhould be the High-Prieſt: And
when the <hi>Romans</hi> after ſold the Office, Chriſt bids the
cleanſed Lepers, <hi>Go and ſhew themſelves to the High-Prieſt,
and offer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> XIII. The Caſe of the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
nullified by the Papiſts, and whoſe Miniſters Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and Authority is denied by them, is as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>I. The old <hi>Bohemians</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes</hi> had different
degrees of Paſtors, of which the Superior were called
<hi>Conſeniors</hi> and <hi>Seniors</hi> of one Order, who preſided
among the Elders, but took not the Government of the
Flocks out of their hands, nor ruled without them, and
were chiefly above others in judging what Elders (or
Miniſters) were to be removed from leſſer places to
greater: whoſe Form of Government, moſt like the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55406:225"/>
Ancients, you may ſee at large in the Deſcriptions of
<hi>Laſcitius</hi> and <hi>Commenius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. The Churches called <hi>Lutherane,</hi> (<hi>Denmark,
Sueden, Saxony, &amp;c.</hi>) have for the moſt part ſome
Epiſcopacy called <hi>Superintendency;</hi> but their Biſhops
take not the power of the Keys from the Paſtors of
the ſeveral Pariſhes. And they take not the power of
Ordaining to be proper to the Biſhops: For the Biſhops
of <hi>Denmark</hi> were made ſuch by <hi>Bugenhagius Pomera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
a Presbyter; which they ſuppoſe doth null their
Succeſsive Power.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have Dioceſane Biſhops and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
by them, and as good a Succeſsion, at leaſt of
Regular Ordination, as <hi>Rome</hi> hath had.</p>
               <p>III. The Churches called <hi>Presbyterian</hi> in <hi>Holland,
France, Scotland,</hi> and other Countries, have Ordination
by a Synod of the Paſtors of particular Churches, of
which ſome are the chief Paſtors of Cities, and have
Curates, or aſsiſting Presbyters, and therefore are ſuch
Biſhops as the <hi>Scripture, Ignatius, Tertullian,</hi> yea, and
<hi>Cyprian</hi> deſcribe: ſo that,</p>
               <p>1. They think that as in Generation a Man beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
not an Ape, or Dog, but a Man, and an Horſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
begetteth an Horſe, and every thing propagateth its
own <hi>ſpecies;</hi> And as Phyſicians make Phyſicians, and
Lawyers make Lawyers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So Paſtors make Paſtor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
as far as belongeth to an Ordainer; that is, preparing
and determining the Receiver whom God ſhall give
the Power to, and oblige to the duty of that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
               <p>2. But yet in the ſame <hi>Order</hi> they think they have
a true Epiſcopacy as to degree, firſt, in the foreſaid
City Paſtors that have Curates; ſecondly, in the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of the Synod.</p>
               <p>3. And they think that thoſe Writers, Papiſts and
Proteſtants, are in the right, who expound the word
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55406:225"/>
[<hi>Presbytery</hi>] which laid hands on <hi>Timothy,</hi> of a Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Presbyters, and therefore that ſuch have power
to Ordain.</p>
               <p>4. And they think that if after their faithfulleſt
ſearch, they ſhould in this be miſtaken againſt their
wills, God will not therefore diſown their Churches,
Miniſtry and Worſhip, no more than he will reject the
Prayers of private Chriſtians for their Errors and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections.</p>
               <p>IV. Thoſe that at preſent are called <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> who were (about 2000 Ejected and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1662. <hi>Aug.</hi> 24.)</p>
               <p>1. Many of them, (yea, moſt that were above 44
years old) were Ordained by Biſhops, (of whom I
am one.)</p>
               <p>2. The Generality of the reſt lived, when by the
Rulers that had ſuch poſſeſsion as they could not reſiſt,
Dioceſane Ordination was forbidden, and another ſet
up, and we heard not of five Biſhops in <hi>England</hi> that
did Ordain, and hardly knew how to procure it of
theſe. And the Oath of Allegiance might have coſt
both the Biſhop and the Ordained their Lives, or Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
at leaſt, in the Times of Uſurpation.</p>
               <p>3. They were Ordained by a Claſsis, or Synod
of Miniſters, of whom ſome were chief City Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
that had Curates, (which ſaith <hi>Grotius, de
Imper. Sum. Pol.</hi> were a ſort of Biſhops) and they
had a Preſident.</p>
               <p>4. Some were not ſatisfied with this, and were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
Ordained by the depoſed Biſhops.</p>
               <p>5. Some deſired Confirmation of their Ordination
aforeſaid by the Synods, from ſuch Biſhops as owned it,
and had it (from Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> at leaſt, of others I am
uncertain.)</p>
               <p>6. The Generality of them that had any Parſonages
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55406:226"/>
or Vicarages, or any endowed Cures in <hi>England,</hi> from
the Year 1646, till the time that the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
was Diſſolved, had a formal authorizing Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Approbation from the ſaid Aſſembly, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Synod (choſen by the Parliament;) of which
the Catalogue in their Ordinance ſheweth us, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Biſhops were, by the Parliament, choſen Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
If any or all refuſed to be there, the Countrey
Miniſters knew not that, but juſtly took them to be
parts of the Synod: And though this was not an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
by Impoſition of Hands, they ſuppoſed that it
was as valid to authorize them, as the Acts before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
of ſome ancient Biſhops, who ordained abſent
Men. And the main Body of the late Ejected Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
(very few excepted) were thus called, confirmed,
approved, and put in, having alſo the Conſent or
Election uſually of the Patron, and the People, and the

Times were only Ordained Deacons, and took the
Synods Letters of Approbation, for the ſubſtance of an
Ordination to be Presbyters, but wanting the Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ſubmitted to Dioceſane Ordination, when the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſanes
returned (of whom Dr. <hi>Manton</hi> was one.) Yea,
divers ſubmitted to be Re-ordained by the Dioceſanes
that had been Ordained Presbyters before. This is the
<hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> Caſe, except ſome few <hi>Independents,</hi> that
were not for formal Ordination, at leaſt ſo much as the
reſt: yet even of them, ſuch as had Benefices in <hi>Anno</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> XV. To all this I muſt add, That by the
Dioceſanes Silencing multitudes of thoſe Miniſters,
whom the moſt Religious accounted the moſt able, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
powerful Preachers (in the days of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
King <hi>James,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> I. beſides the 2000
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55406:226"/>
Silenced in the beginning of King <hi>Charles</hi> II.) the
People that were moſt ſerious in matters of Religion,
were (except a few) ſo alienated from the Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanes,
that moſt of the ſtricter Religious Sort, would
not chooſe a Miniſter that was for them and their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,
and ſo it would have made a more dangerous
Schiſm than was made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> XVI. And as to the preſent ſtate and
practice of the <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> (premiſing that I ſpeak
only of <hi>meer Nonconformiſts</hi> as ſuch, and not Men of
other Principles and Parties that Conform not, as <hi>Jews,
Turks, Socinians, Papiſts, Familiſts, Quakers,</hi> &amp;c.) let
it be underſtood,</p>
               <p>1. That they take all the <hi>Pariſhes</hi> and <hi>Congregations</hi>
of <hi>true Chriſtians</hi> that have <hi>true Paſtors</hi> to be <hi>true
Churches of Chriſt:</hi> And they take <hi>ſuch Miniſters</hi> as
Conform, to be notwithſtanding that <hi>true Miniſters,</hi>
though culpable; and therefore they ſeparate not from
any <hi>ſuch Churches</hi> as no Churches, or from <hi>ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
as none.</p>
               <p>2. They take particular Churches aſſociated under
Dioceſanes, Archbiſhops, and Nationally under one
King, and repreſented in one Convocation or Synod,
to be ſtill true Churches, and ſuch as may be lawfully
communicated with; and theſe Dioceſane, Provincial
and National Aſſociations to be laudable as they are
meer Aſſociations for Concord, and though culpable in
ſome other reſpects, yet ſuch as good Chriſtians may
lawfully live under ſubmiſsively, and in peace.</p>
               <p>3. They think it lawful to preach and adminiſter
the Sacraments in the Pariſh Churches, and have theſe
17 years been caſt out, and kept out much againſt their
wills, and laboured, and hoped, though in vain, for
Reſtoration.</p>
               <p>4. It is not Communion with any Chriſtian Church
in Faith, Love, or Holy Worſhip, or any thing of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55406:227"/>
Gods Inſtitution, no nor any thing of Mans command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but what they believe God hath forbidden them,
which they deny. To deny to take many Covenants,
Oaths, Profeſsions, or to do ſome Practices which upon
their beſt enquiry they verily believe to be great Sins,
this is not ſeparating from any thing of God.</p>
               <p>5. They do not depart from the Churches, but are
caſt out. The Miniſters are Silenced and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>cted, as
they verily believe, for not ſinning and hazarding their
Souls. Miniſters and People are expreſly by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
of the Church, Excommunicated <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> (which
is <hi>ſine ſententia judicis</hi>) if they but ſay that there is
any thing in the Conformity, which a good Chriſtian
may not with a good Conſcience do: The Canon is
viſible and plain; ſo that they cannot poſsibly avoid
being caſt out, and think that the Ejecters are the
Schiſmaticks.</p>
               <p>6. When they are thus caſt out, or driven away,
they yet hold diſtant Chriſtian Communion with all
Chriſtians in one univerſal Church, one Spirit, one
Lord, one God, one Faith, one Baptiſmal Covenant, and
one Hope, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. But local Communion they can
have but in one place at once; and none are ſaid to
ſeparate from all the Churches, where they are not
preſent.</p>
               <p>7. The King by his Licence allowed them for a
time to hold their own Aſſemblies; and the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
themſelves ſwear the Oath of Supremacy, and take
the King to be Supreme Governor in all Cauſes, and
over all Perſons Eccleſiaſtical and Civil: And yet then
accuſed the Licenſed of Schiſm.</p>
               <p>8. Though there be ſome things in the Liturgy
which the Nonconformiſts dare not Declare Aſſent and
Conſent to, (and therefore ſuffer,) yet they hold it
lawful both to join in Hearing, Prayer and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with the Pariſh Churches and Conformiſts, in the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55406:227"/>
Lords days Worſhip and uſe of that Liturgy; and
many of them do ſo ordinarily: And others do not
hold it unlawful, but are hindered by Preaching them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
where they can, which they dare not forbear:
And the People that hold it lawful, yet hold that better
is to be preferred when they can have it. And he that
preferreth a Miniſter which he findeth moſt Edification
by, doth not therefore ſeparate from all others, becauſe
he is abſent from them.</p>
               <p>9. The Nonconformiſts have in their appointed
Treaties for Concord, offered to uſe the Liturgy with
ſome Emendations, and to ſubmit even to the preſent
Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and other parts of the Church-Government,
as is expreſſed in the Kings <hi>Declaration
about Eccleſiaſtical Affairs.</hi> By which (viſible in
Print) it may be ſeen how far they were from ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
inclinations, but it could not by the Biſhops, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
               <p>10. But it is true withall, that many of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People having conſtantly preferred that which
they thought they were bound to prefer, and ſeeing
their former Paſtors caſt out and ſilenced, thought they
ought notwithſtanding to adhere to them, and grew
into ſo hard thoughts of the Biſhops that ſilenced them,
(about 2000 at once) that they are more alienated
than before from them and their Aſſemblies; as <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtoms
Joannites</hi> were at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> till the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of <hi>Atticus</hi> and <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

old publick Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> XVII. It is commonly confeſſed by their
ſharpeſt Accuſers, that the Nonconformiſts do well to
forbear all that can be proved to be ſinful: And if
they prove not Conformity ſinful, they are content to
ſuffer as real Schiſmaticks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> XVIII. We all agree of the neceſsity of a
continued Succeſsion in the Univerſal Church, of the

ſame Faith, Religion, and Miniſterial Office which we
profeſs and poſſeſs: We have <hi>no one new Article of

and Adminiſtrations cannot paſs as valid, unleſs the
<hi>particular Miniſter</hi> can prove, that he had Canonical
Ordination from one that had the like, and he from
one that had the like, and he from another that had the
like, and ſo up to the Apoſtles; this we ſuppoſe irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
ſchiſmatical, falſe, and of malignant tendency
againſt the Church and Intereſt of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> XIX. Mr. <hi>Henry Dodwell</hi> is the Man that
hath newly and copiouſly promoted this Schiſmatical
Error, in a Book pretended to be againſt the Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts
Schiſm, but diſowned by the Conformable
Doctors themſelves, (many of them.) And indeed,
notwithſtanding the tedious wordineſs of it, it hath lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in it, in compariſon of <hi>Janſenius</hi> long ago, fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
by <hi>Voetius.</hi> And though I told him over and
over firſt, that if he did not anſwer <hi>Voetius, and my
diſpute of Ordination,</hi> we ſhould take him but to labor in
vain, as to our uſe, yet hath he taken no notice of either
of them at all. If he intend it in any following Book, it
is but fraudulent to ſend out this great Volume firſt, to
do his work before he gave any notice of what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſaid againſt him. Muſt we write the ſame things

               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> XX, His Deſign and Schiſmatical Doctrine is
thus laid.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>1. That the ordinary means of Salvation, are, in
reſpect of every particular perſon, confined to the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Communion to the place he lives in, as long as
he lives in it.</p>
                  <p>2. That we cannot be aſſured that God will do for
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55406:228"/>
us what is neceſſary for Salvation on his part, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than by his expreſs promiſes that he will
do it.</p>
                  <p>3. Therefore we must have interest in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>4. Therefore we must have the Sacrament by which
the Covenant is tranſacted.</p>
                  <p>5. Theſe as Legally valid, are to be had only in the
external Communion of the Viſible Church.</p>
                  <p>6. This is only the Epiſcopal Communion of the
place we live in.</p>
                  <p>7. The Validity of the Sacraments, depends on the
Authority of the perſons by whom they are admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred.</p>
                  <p>8. No Miniſters have Authority of adminiſtring Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
but only they that have their Orders in the
Epiſcopal Communion.</p>
                  <p>9. This cannot be from God, but by a continued
Succeſſion of perſons orderly receiving Authority from
thoſe who had Authority to give it them, (viz. Biſhops)
from thoſe first times of the Apoſtles, to ours at
preſent.</p>
                  <p>10. That the Holy Ghost is the Inſtituter of this
Order, and to violate it, by adminiſtring without ſuch
Ordination, is to ſin against the Holy Ghoſt, the Sin that
hath no other ſacrifice, and promiſe of pardon.</p>
                  <p>11. That the Ordained have no more or other
power, than the Ordainers intend or profeſs to give
them.</p>
                  <p>12. That it is certain, that the Biſhops of all former
Ages intended not to give Presbyters power of Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Adminiſtring out of their Subjection: <hi>Ergo</hi>
they have it not.</p>
               </q>

To gather all the Confuſions, Contradictions and
Abſurdities of that wordy Volume, would be tedious,
and little profitable to the Reader; only theſe three
things in general I tell ſuch as may be in danger of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
by it.</p>
               <p>1. That he never agreeth with his Adverſaries of
the <hi>ſtate of the queſtion,</hi> nor ſo much as <hi>explicateth the
terms,</hi> nor doth any thing beſeeming a Diſputant, to
make himſelf underſtood.</p>
               <p>2. That not only by <hi>denied</hi> (falſe) <hi>Suppoſitions,</hi>
he maketh all his Diſcourſe uſeleſs to the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,
but alſo at the firſt giveth them their Cauſe, and
confirmeth them.</p>
               <p>3. That while in his Preface he diſowneth Popery,
it is the very ſting of their Argumentation which he
uſeth: And that which yet by conſequence overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not only the Churches, Miniſtery, Sacraments and
Salvation of the Proteſtants, but of all Chriſtians on
Earth, and of none more certainly, than of the Papiſts:
All which I undertake, when called, to prove.</p>

ambiguous confounding terms: For a few;</p>
               <p>1. He that layeth ſo great a ſtreſs on Epiſcopacy,
never tells us what he meaneth by a Biſhop; when he
ought to know, that with the chief of his Adverſaries
the Controverſie is very much in that: For (as <hi>Grotius
de Imper. Summ. Pol.</hi> and many others) they take
the chief Paſtor of every Pariſh-Church (eſpecially
that hath Curates under him) for a
Biſhop;<note place="margin">See my Laſt Book againſt <hi>Johnſon</hi> of this.</note> at leaſt if he be Paſtor of a
City, or Town ſo called of old (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>)
when others deny him to be a Biſhop
that hath not <hi>many Altars</hi> or <hi>Pariſhes</hi> under him.</p>
               <p>2, Some take him for a Biſhop that is but the prime
Presbyter, or different from the reſt but <hi>Gradu, non or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi>
call'd <hi>Epiſcopus Praeſes:</hi> And others deny him to

               </p>
               <p>3. Some take him to be a Biſhop, that hath no <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,</hi>
but <hi>Deacons</hi> under him, and that in a <hi>ſingle</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly

By the tenor of his diſcourſe, the Reader may
ſuſpect that he meaneth ſome Univerſal Society of Men
on Earth, under ſome one viſible humane Head, either
Monarchical, or Ariſtocratical, or Democratical, a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign

But, if ſo, Proteſtants (we at leaſt) deny
any ſuch, thinking this the prime eſſential difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us and the Papiſts, (the ſecond being whether
the Pope or his Council be this Head;) and he never
tells <hi>who this</hi> ſuppoſed <hi>Head</hi> is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:55406:230"/>
So he frequently talketh of neceſſary Communion
with a <hi>particular Church,</hi> and never tells us what he
meaneth by it: Nor can I gather often, whether he
means a Dioceſane Church, or a Provincial, or a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
But I perceive that he meaneth not a Parochial;
when yet he knew that the Adverſaries take thoſe for
particular Churches.</p>

<hi>Letters</hi> may do it on the abſent, beſides other differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>2. And ſome take thoſe to be obligatory Canons,

are not agreed what Canons are valid: And the

Many, beſides Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> ſay, That the Popes Canon

               <p>1. What proof hath he of Sacraments (beſides
Sacrifices) before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s days? And was there
then no pardon of ſin?</p>
               <p>2. Were Women damned that were not circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?
Or were the uncircumciſed Children in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
none of the Church?</p>
               <p>3. Were not Infants in the Covenant of Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Circumciſion entered them, into the Covenant of
<hi>Iſraels</hi> peculiarity?</p>
               <p>4. Why did <hi>Abraham</hi> think there had been Fifty
righteous perſons in <hi>Sodom? And in every Nation he
that feareth God, and worketh righteouſneſs, is accepted
of him,</hi> Acts 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:55406:232"/>
5. Though Sacraments under the Goſpel convey
greater benefits, can he prove that it placeth greater
neceſsity of them, than the Law did?</p>
               <p>6. Seeing Chriſt was not baptized till about thirty
years old, was he not Holy, and the Churches Head
before?</p>
               <p>7. Can he prove that the Apoſtles were ever bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed?
Or were they not before true Chriſtians?</p>
               <p>8. The Apoſtles had not the Lords Supper till near
Chriſts death, and yet had part in him before.</p>
               <p>9. <hi>Was</hi> Paul <hi>of this Mans mind, that ſaid,</hi> He was
not ſent to baptize, but preach, and thanked God that he
had baptized ſo few.</p>
               <p>10. <hi>Is not that Promiſe true,</hi> That whoever believeth,
ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life; and that the
pure in heart ſhall ſee God, <hi>&amp;c? And will want of a
Sacrament then fruſtrate all?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. He preſumeth to ſay, <hi>That God is obliged to make
good the Sacraments of thoſe that have but a preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Miniſtery, ſeeming to have Epiſcopal Ordination, when
they have not.</hi> And is not the reaſon as ſtrong from the
Peoples impoſsibility of avoiding the danger, when
they can have no Sacraments, or none but from Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
that had not Epiſcopal Ordination?</p>
               <p>12. What if the Succeſſion have been interrupted
long ago in <hi>Armenia, Egypt, Syria,</hi> or elſewhere? Are
all damned that were born ſince? Or which way ſhall
particular perſons there remedy it, they cannot ſend to
<hi>Europe</hi> for Ordainers?</p>
               <p>13. If Laymen (as <hi>Frumentius</hi> and <hi>Edeſius</hi>) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
perſons in <hi>India,</hi> are they all damned that dye after
Converſion, for want of an ordained Prieſt, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
               <p>14. If Baptiſm give the firſt ſanctifying Grace, then
none but unholy perſons are to be baptized; and that
is <hi>impenitent, unconverted</hi> Infidels, or wicked men.</p>

our <hi>progreſſive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>16. The Sacraments are to Chriſtianity, what So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Matrimony is to Marriage; which is valid before
God upon private conſent, but is neceſſary for order,

Church Title ordinarily depends on Baptiſm, but God
knoweth and accepteth heart conſent.</p>
               <p>17. God ſaith, <hi>Elſe were your Children unclean, but
now are they holy,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 14. Therefore it is not
the Sacrament that <hi>firſt</hi> maketh them holy. And the
ſeed of the Faithful have ſuch Promiſes as we make
good againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>18. Children may dye before they can be baptized,
and are they by that natural neceſſity damned?</p>
               <p>19. If a Man live where the Prieſts will not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize,
or give the Lords Supper, but on condition that
we profeſs ſome falſhood, or commit ſome ſin, (as in
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>) Muſt we commit that ſin, or
be damned, for want of the Sacrament?</p>
               <p>20. Doth not this lay a neceſſity upon all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
in <hi>Italy, Spain, France, Auſtria, Batavia, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi>
yea, <hi>Mexico, Peru,</hi> &amp;c. to leave their Countries,

without ſinful Conditions, and may have it from
Men of right ſucceſſive Ordination? And how ſhall
all theſe be able ſo to travel? And where will they find
that Land on Earth that will anſwer their expectation,
and can and will receive them all?</p>
               <p>21. What if a thouſand honeſt weak Men miſtake,
and think, that the things impoſed as neceſſary to their
Sacramental Communion, are great Sins, and it be
not ſo, (as our Doubts againſt Conformity are thought
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55406:233"/>

prove that all ſuch are damning Errors, for want of

to any, or all Men, by denying them the Sacrament?
Is this the ſenſe of their having the Power of the

<hi>Romans,</hi> on ſuch accounts, already Unchurch all the

Hereſie, uncalled Popes, uncapable ones, and manifold
Schiſms have oft interrupted his deſcribed Succeſſion at
<hi>Rome:</hi> And ſo Turks and Heathens have matter given
them againſt us all. Already by ſuch kind of Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Principles, there are few parts of the Church on
Earth, that are not by others Unchurched, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church
not others: But yet it is but few of them that
have proceeded to that Anabaptiſtical height, as to nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
all their Sacraments, and to expect that almoſt all
the Chriſtian world ſhould be again baptized. Yea,
this is far more Schiſmatical than common Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm:
For the Anabaptiſts with us Re-baptize not them
that were baptized at age by ſuch Miniſters as this
Writer, and ſuch others degrade; much leſs do they

                  <p>None of theſe terms will unite a National

               <p>§ I. THE ſame Reaſons which prove that none of

may agree in Popery, but all the Chriſtian world will
not: And as a great part hath agreed in <hi>Arianiſm,</hi>
(called Chriſtians,) and a great part in <hi>Neſtorianiſm,</hi>

as now many Churches of the Proteſtants agree in

not in any of theſe (though the eldeſt ſort of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,

acknowledge and agree in:) But yet that which never

               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:55406:235"/>
§ II. Yet I have before enumerated divers Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
which are needful and uſeful to the Concord
of a particular Church, which are not ſo to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal:
As that all the Members have the ſame Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
Paſtors, the ſame Tranſlation of the Scriptures
read to them, the ſame Verſions and Tunes of Pſalms,
when they meet together, the ſame place and day, and
hour of meeting: Becauſe theſe in the nature of the
thing are neceſſary to Concord, and avoid Diſcord and
Confuſion. And if divers Churches aſſociated, or all
in a Kingdom, or divers Kingdoms, can agree in the
ſame convenient modes and circumſtances (as the
ſame Tranſlation of the Bible ſo far as they have one
language, the ſame day of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> Anniverſarily to
Commemorate Chriſts Reſurrection, as they do weekly
on the ſame firſt day, and ſome ſuch like) it will be
laudable, ſo it be done by voluntary conſent, as a thing
of convenience, and not of neceſſity, and without ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannizing
over one another, or perſecuting or deſpiſing
thoſe that differ, or turn it into an Engine of Rents
and Schiſm, by making it neceſſary to their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
which is the unhappy end of moſt humane im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of indifferent unneceſſary things. He that
thinketh he hath hit on the fitteſt Ceremonies, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ites
or Modes, is ſeldom ever content with liberty to uſe
them, but he muſt force all others if he can to his way,
and take away the liberty of all that differ from him:
We ſee it by ſad experience, that men think their Forms
and Ceremonies caſt out, if all may not be compelled
to uſe them, though many think them ſinful; and they
had rather have none of them, than have them upon
terms of meer liberty; leſt they be diſgraced by the
diſuſe or contradiction of thoſe that do forbear the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.
And ſuch men are never content with Union and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
in Gods own Inſtitutions, and in circumſtances
that are <hi>in genere</hi> neceſſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:55406:236"/>
§ III. But ſome men are ſtiff in the Schiſmatical
Opinion, that though Churches of many Kingdoms
may charitably differ in Ceremonies, and indifferent
things, yet none in the ſame Kingdoms ſhould be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
ſo to differ (of which I ſpake before.) But,</p>
               <p>1. Chriſt hath given us no ſuch different meaſures
of our Charity, Forbearance or Communion.</p>
               <p>2. The old Churches were quite of another mind,
as <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> ſhew in ſeveral inſtances. And
it is known that in the ſame Empire, every Biſhop had
power to uſe his own Liturgy, and other Modes, (as I
inſtanced in the Canon that requireth every man to
bring his Form firſt to the Synod to be tryed, and in
the contention between <hi>Baſil</hi> and the Church of <hi>Neoce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarea,</hi>
and the ſtrife about <hi>Gregories</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s
Liturgy, and ſuch like.)</p>
               <p>3. It was the Paſtors and People of the ſame Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> that St. <hi>Paul</hi> giveth the Precepts of Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Receiving Diſſenters in things indifferent to.
And ſtill mark, that he wrote not only to the Laity, but
to the Rulers, (as is evident,) and therefore forbiddeth
them ſuch narrowing impoſitions; being himſelf alſo
a chief Paſtor, (an Apoſtle) and ſo declareth his own
judgment, as one that would himſelf make no ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
impoſitions.</p>
               <p>§ IV. We deny not but ſome Churches have a
while continued in laudable Concord, notwithſtanding
ſuch enſnaring Impoſitions. But,</p>
               <p>1. It hath been but for a time, and this Worm
hath fretted them, and it hath ended in their great
detriment at leaſt.</p>
               <p>2. And it was not <hi>by theſe means,</hi> but by <hi>better
cauſes,</hi> notwithſtanding theſe diſeaſes: ſo that as we
anſwer the Queſtion, Whether a Papiſt may be ſaved?
ſo do we anſwer the Queſtion, Whether ſuch Churches
may have proſperous Concord? <hi>viz.</hi> 1. If the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55406:236"/>
of Chriſtianity in Papiſts, and of Communion in
ſuch Churches, be practically held, ſo as to be more
powerful than their Contraries. 2. But not by their
Contraries, but by overcoming them, one may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and the other have peace; even as we anſwer the
Queſtion, Whether a Man may live that taketh Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,

according to its malignant nature. 2. But yea, if it be

when he is but for the Body.</p>
               <p>§ III. But Experience hath ſtill confuted them, and
that which one Age (or year) thus built, the next
hath ordinarily pull'd down. Not but that orthodox
pious Princes are an unſpeakable bleſſing to the Church,
and the want of ſuch are ordinary cauſes of ſin,
diſtraction, and miſery: But ſuch muſt know and do
their proper work, and not ſerve the pride and humor
of ambitious ignorant Clergymen, nor be their Lictors
or Executioners, nor lend them the Sword to execute
their wills.</p>
               <p>§ IV. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> defended the Orthodox (yet of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
greatly at their unpeaceableneſs, and at laſt
tempted to favor ſome <hi>Arians,</hi> meerly becauſe being

but his Son pull'd down what the Father had ſet up.

                     </gap>the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi>
and another ſet them up. One Emperor pull'd
down Church-Images, and another ſet them up, and
General Councils changed with them. And ſo on
in many other inſtances. If this forcing courſe were
now generally taken, how many Kingdoms would fare
the better for it? or now do? not four ſixth parts
of the world that are Heathens: nor above the fifth
part of ſix that are Mahometans: not moſt of the
other ſixth part that are Papiſts: The Presbyterians
like it not in <hi>England:</hi> The Prelatiſts are not for it
where the Presbyterians rule. How few Countries are
juſt of our mind? and therefore in how few would it
pleaſe us, or accommodate us.</p>
               <p>§ V. And thoſe that are of the ſame mind in the
main, yet rarely long agree in all things. I have before
proved, and the notorious ſtate of Mankind proveth,
That there is ſuch a wonderful diverſity of mental
capacities and apprehenſions, that the beſt will never all
agree in any, but <hi>few plain certain things.</hi> To endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
by right means to bring all men to be wiſe, and to
agree in all right Thoughts, Affections and Practices, is
very good: But he that will reſolve to tolerate no Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
(much more diſſent about ſuſpected unneceſſary
things) ſhall be a heinous oppreſſor of mankind, even
of Chriſtians for being but men. How few Subjects
muſt ſuch a Prince expect to have, that will cut off all
that are not of one intellectual complexion?</p>
               <p>§ VI. And, as is aforeſaid, when men think that
God obligeth them to diſſent, the more honeſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable
they are, the more reſolutely they will bear
all ſufferings, and never yield to man, againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of their Duty to God; ſo that if you begin to
puniſh ſuch, there is no ending, till you have killed
them, baniſhed them, or kept them cloſe Priſoners. And
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55406:238"/>
let all ſober Magiſtrates think, what Counſellors ſuch
Clergymen are to them, that would have them,</p>
               <p>1. Chooſe out the moſt Conſcionable and Religious
for their Puniſhments.</p>
               <p>2. And not ceaſe till they have deſtroyed them.</p>
               <p>§ VII. And doth not this tend to drive out true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
and Religion from the Land, when men that
have no Conſcience, ſhall paſs for the obedient lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Subjects? And ſuch being capable ſtill of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
ſhall poſſeſs the Churches, and be Rulers of
the reſt; and then what can we expect, but that ſuch will
uſe Religious Diſſenters as their Enemies, and reproach
them with all malicious names? And O what a ſtate is
ſuch a Land in!</p>
               <p>§ VIII. And (you are not infallible, Councils
have erred) what if it ſhould prove, That theſe you
deſtroy are in the right, and you muſt be judged of
God as Perſecutors? Let not Spleen or Pride make you
fearleſs of ſuch a ſin and judgment.</p>
               <p>§ IX. Yea, if they ſhould prove in the wrong, yet
you may be Perſecutors, if the Error be ſuch that good
men ſhould bear with in each other; and God is the
Avenger of all the wronged and oppreſſed. And it is
not diſregardable that they do and ſuffer all for him,
though they miſtake, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>He that
eateth, eateth to the Lord; and he that eateth not, to the
Lord he eateth not:</hi> It is God that he intended to obey
and pleaſe. And one hath need to look well about him,
before he deſtroy ſuch. I dare ſay, That that man
hath truly no Religion, that preferreth it not before
the pleaſing of men, and all worldly intereſt; for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is our devotedneſs to ſerve and pleaſe God: And
God is not taken for that mans God, that preferreth
any thing before him, (as I ſaid before.)</p>
               <p>§ X. However it is certain, That thus to ſet
Princes in a conſtant Conflict againſt Conſcionable
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55406:238"/>
godly men, is liker a <hi>War againſt God and Conſcience,</hi>
than any way to Peace and Concord. The <hi>Law</hi> will
not yield, and <hi>Conſcience</hi> will not yield; and God will
keep up a Succeſſion of Conſcionable men in the world,
when Popes and Perſecutors have done their worſt:
And humane frailty and ſin will keep up a Succeſſion
of ſo much weakneſs, as that the beſt, much more the
weakeſt, will have vain Scruples, Ignorance and Errors,
which Priſons or Penalties will not cure; yea, uſually
greatly increaſe the malady by Exaſperation; and wiſe
men will foreſee a probability of the end, before they
begin. Hypocrites may yield to ſave their skins, but
the truly Conſcionable will not: For to yield to what
they think to be ſin, is, in their judgment, wilfully to
chooſe damnation.</p>
               <p>§ XI. Let not the Clergy Tyrants ſtill cant their
vain Objection, [<hi>Then Conſcience will be a pretence for
any Villany, which was not made to be a cloak for ſin.</hi>]
For it is not liberty for any Villany that we are pleading
for: who knoweth not that <hi>abuſed Reaſon</hi> is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
and plea for almoſt all Villany in the world?
What then? Muſt not Reaſon be regarded? The uſe
and honor of it kept up, while man is man? And all
men have leave to plead Reaſon in their Cauſe: And
yet not all tolerated that Reaſon is pretended or abuſed
for. And what <hi>Reaſon</hi> is to <hi>Man,</hi> that <hi>Conſcience</hi> is to
<hi>Religious Men.</hi> Some Evils are ſo great and inconſiſtent
with the publick good, that it is better all thoſe were
baniſhed or deſtroyed, who pretend either <hi>Conſcience</hi> or
<hi>Reaſon</hi> for them, than that they ſhould be Tolerated;
and theſe are <hi>intolerable</hi> Evils. But what man thinks
that it is ſo with all <hi>Error</hi> or Faults? much leſs with
all things <hi>indifferent,</hi> which ſome men have a mind to
exerciſe their maſterſhip in commanding. Put firſt the
queſtion to ſober Conſcionable men; Is it more to
common good, and intereſt of Honeſty and Conſcience,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55406:239"/>
that all the Perſons in a Nation be impriſoned, baniſhed
or killed, that dare not ſwear, ſay and practiſe all that
is impoſed on them, than that the Impoſitions be altered
or they forborn?</p>
               <p>§ XII. And I muſt again ſay; That this Church-Tyranny,
as moſt other ſin, is moſt againſt the <hi>Own<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rs</hi>
of it: For if the faults of godly men that ſcruple to
ſubſcribe to Popes, Patriarchs, Dioceſanes, Synods, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies,
or Ceremonies, are not to be Tolerated, how
much leſs a proud and perſecuting Clergy, or ſuch as
abuſe or exclude Church-Diſcipline, or by ſloth, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
carnal Lives, do wrong their Office, and betray
the Flock?</p>
               <p>§ XIII. And again I remember them, That Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
muſt govern the Flock, much like as men do their
Wives: And let men but try how far weak and paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Wives muſt be Tolerated by them that will not do
or ſuffer worſe, and here practiſe accordingly.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>§ I. THere need not much more be ſaid of this; it
is already proved, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf
hath in his Law, made the terms of the Union and
Communion of his Members: As the ſame <hi>Nature</hi> that
<hi>formeth</hi> all our members in the womb, is alſo the <hi>placer</hi>

               <p>§ II. Indeed no man ought to be Excommunicated
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55406:239"/>
otherwiſe than by Miniſterial <hi>Declaration</hi> and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
how far he hath firſt departed from Union, and
cut off or Excommunicated himſelf. An impenitent
Fornicator, Drunkard, Perſecutor, doth cut off him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from the favor of God, and his part in Chriſt, and
the rights of his true Church: Therefore the Paſtors
may <hi>declare</hi> that he doth ſo. And if it become a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
either <hi>de facto,</hi> whether he be ſuch an one;
or <hi>de jure,</hi> whether this be true; the Paſtors are the
proper Judges, ſo far as to reſolve the Conſciences of
the Flock, whether they muſt avoid that man, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate

ſave only by <hi>declaring</hi> and <hi>judging</hi> that they wilfully
ſeparate themſelves; and therefore requiring the People
to avoid them, and binding them over to anſwer their
ſin at the Bar of God: The reſt is the <hi>Devils work,</hi>
and <hi>the impenitent Sinners,</hi> and not the Paſtors of the
Church.</p>
               <p>§ III. And what is ſaid againſt the Magiſtrates
unſeaſonable force, will moſtly hold againſt ſuch undue
Excommunication. 1. If the perſon believe that he
is caſt out for not forſaking his duty to God, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
that he is counted worthy to ſuffer for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſake, remembring that Chriſt ſaid, <hi>They ſhall caſt
you out of their Synagogues:</hi> And this will bring no
man to Repentance.</p>
               <p>§ IV. And, 2. Then the Paſtors will fall under the
imputation of <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Perſecution,</hi> and be taken
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55406:240"/>
to be Haters and Hinderers of Conſcionable men, and
<hi>grievous Wolves that devour the Flock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ V. And, 3. The Parties Excommunicate, will
think that this doth not excuſe them from <hi>the duty of
worſhipping God;</hi> and therefore they will aſſemble by
themſelves for ſuch worſhip; and there they will think,
<hi>That they are a better Church than thoſe that caſt them
out;</hi> and perhaps may Excommunicate their Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municaters,
as the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi>
have done by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> Or, more
likely, deſpiſe their Cenſure, and go on, unleſs the
Sword be drawn to ſuppreſs them, (to which only
ſuch Excommunicaters uſe finally to truſt:) And then
what will follow, I have ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>§ VI. And indeed we need no greater proof of
the ineffectualneſs of Excommunication in ſuch caſes,
than the open confeſſion of the Uſers of it; who, if
they have not an Act for <hi>Horning</hi> (as they call it in
<hi>Scotland</hi>) or to impriſon the Excommunicate, or
puniſh him by the Sword, confeſs that their Sentence
will be contemned: which is moſt true.</p>
               <p>§ VII. Yet ſad Experience further aſſureth us,
That Papal Anathematizings, yea, and thoſe of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Councils, have been no ſmall cauſe of Schiſm, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions
and Rebellions: The Hiſtory of this would fill
a Volume. Alas! what did the Councils of <hi>Epheſus,
Conſtantinople, Chalcedon,</hi> and many others, by their
Anathemas? The ſtate of <hi>Syria, Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Abaſſia,</hi>
&amp;c. of thoſe called <hi>Jacobites</hi> and <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> tells us to
this day: And theſe Thunderbolts have been the
Popes great Engines, to beat down Kings, and batter
Kingdoms. It is the admiration of the world, next to
the ſucceſs of ignorant <hi>Mahomet,</hi> That a company of
old Uſurpers (many of them ſucceſſively being noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
wicked men, and ſo judged by Councils, and
their moſt flattering Hiſtorians) ſhould conquer Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55406:240"/>
Kingdoms and Empires, by ſitting at home, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>urſing men, and telling them, [<hi>St.</hi> Peter <hi>is angry
with them, and will keep them out of Heaven, if they
be not obedient to the Pope.</hi>] But men that will be the
Slaves of Sin, deſerve to have their Reaſon ſo forſaken,
to make themſelves the Slaves of Subjects.</p>
               <p>§ VIII. Yet we are far from thinking, That
juſt Excommunication is of no uſe; God would not
have the Church of Chriſt to ſeem no better than the
world; it is a Society gathered out of the world by
the ſanctifying Word and Spirit, and as holy devoted
to the moſt holy God. And he would have the Church
Viſible, to be viſibly the womb of the Triumphant
Church, or the Sheepfold of Chriſt, containing ſuch as
have a ſeeming or viſible right to ſalvation, however
Hypocrites do intrude: And therefore the Keys of the
Church ſhould be much of Kin to the Keys of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
ſo that he that is taken in or ſhut out, may ſeem to
the Chriſtian judgment of probability to be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
or ſhut out of a right to ſalvation. And therefore
as impenitent wicked men ſhould not be deluded in
vain hopes, by being received to Church Communion;
ſo neither ſhould godly men, for pardoned or tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
infirmities, be ſhut out of the Church, while God
continueth their viſible Title to ſalvation; much leſs a
Lay-Chancellor, or a Biſhop, Excommunicate Chriſts
Members, for not paying their Fees, or for not kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Sacraments, or for not ſubmitting to unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Impoſitions, or for holding ſuch Things unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
or ſuch like. This way will never heal our breaches,
or unite the Churches.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>§ I. THis is proved in what is ſaid before: For a

or Life; though <hi>many</hi> Sins be <hi>worſe:</hi> For he that
wilfully commits one, virtually committeth many:
And, as St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Breaketh the whole Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ II. Yea, though the <hi>matter</hi> of the Sin ſeem

               <p>§ III. A peaceable Man will <hi>live quietly</hi> in a
Church that hath many Sins and Errors; but he dare
not deliberately own or juſtifie the leaſt. I ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with no Church on earth, if I thought all

               </p>

that breaketh one of the least of his Commandments, and

God,</hi> Matth. 5. As he that truly believeth God in one

will obey all that he knoweth to be his Command,

               <argument>
                  <p>Vnlimited Toleration will wrong and divide
the Church.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§ I. ALL ſober Men are ſo far agreed in this, that
I need not ſay much of it; no doubt there
are intolerable Errors and Sins. And though Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>
and others ſay,<note place="margin">See Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi>'s late <hi>Plea for Toleration,</hi> in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Atax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iae Obſtaculum,</hi> Renouncing Unlimited To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration.</note> 
                  <hi>It is not Hereſie, unleſs
it be wilful, and we ſeldom know the
wilfulneſs of another;</hi> Yet in truth,
1. It is not only <hi>formal ſubjective
Hereſie,</hi> which maketh the Man an
Heretick, which we muſt reſiſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain,
but alſo <hi>material objective Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie;</hi>
whatever be the Divulgers mind.
2. And alſo there is a wilfulneſs which
is <hi>Privative,</hi> when the Will doth not its duty to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
Truth and Error, as well as a poſitive willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to err (which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>That few or none
can have:</hi>) And no mans will is wholly innocent in
any culpable Sin or Error.</p>
               <p>§ II. Doubtleſs mans Conſcience is not properly
his <hi>Lawmaker,</hi> nor his <hi>Law,</hi> (though ſome unaptly ſay
ſo) but only his diſcerning of that which is his Law;
no more than the Lawyers eye, or reaſon, or skill, is the
Law of the Land. And therefore to have an erring
Conſcience, taking that for Gods Law which is not, is a
Sin (where it was poſſible to know it.)</p>
               <p>§ III. And therefore Gods Law is not <hi>ſuſpended,</hi>
but <hi>violated</hi> by mans Error; God hath not as many
ſorts of Law as men have Opinions of it, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
in Error. If a man ſhould think that God
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55406:242"/>
bindeth him to kill, ſteal, ſlander, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this would not
make any of theſe no ſin, but it would be no ſmall ſin
in him, that would father ſuch wickedneſs on the moſt
holy God, and on his Law. If an erring Conſcience
think that God forbiddeth our duty to Princes, Parents,
Children, Neighbors, Juſtice, Charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This would
not diſſolve any of his Obligations, but be an added ſin
in ſlandering God: Far be it from any ſober man to
think, That the Magiſtrate muſt let all men do all the
Evil which they will but pretend God and Conſcience
for.</p>
               <p>§ IV. Nor is the Papal Doctrine true or tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
That Prieſts onely are for mens Souls, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
but for their Bodies, and Temporal Concerns; and
ſo that the Prieſt is as much higher than the Prince, as
the Soul is than the Body. Indeed the Miniſter of
Chriſt is to manage only the <hi>Word,</hi> which worketh on
the Soul by the way of Senſe, and not of the Sword;
but yet it is to be finally for the good of Souls, that the
Magiſtrate uſeth the Sword: As the voice toucheth
the Ear, ſo doth the Sword the Fleſh for the benefit of
Souls, either the ſinners, or other mens. And verily
he that ſaith otherwiſe, and placeth the <hi>bonum publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi>
which is the end of Government, meerly in the
bodies proſperity, diſhonoureth and debaſeth Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and ſetteth Princes lower than Prieſts, Parents or
Friends. Godly men that believe the vanity of things
Tranſitory and Corporeal, would have as low an
eſteem of the Means, as of the End, and ſo of all
Civil Rules, if they believed this. But he that is the
King, as well as the great High-Prieſt of the Church,
for holy Ends, and for mens Salvation, hath made
Princes his Officers ſubordinate to him for thoſe Ends,
as well as Paſtors. I will not ſtand here to confute one
or two <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Divines that have written againſt me, for
ſaying, <hi>That Princes and Magiſtrates are now the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55406:243"/>
Officers, and have their Power from Him, into
whoſe Hands all Power in Heaven and Earth is given.</hi>
Sober Thoughts in wiſe Chriſtians will ſave me that
labour.</p>
               <p>§ V. And he that ſaith, <hi>By me Kings reign,</hi> and
will have <hi>Kings</hi> to be the Churches <hi>Nurſing-Fathers,</hi>
will not take it for an excuſe of their neglect, to ſay,
We were authorized onely for mens Bodies: It is not
equally for all that have Bodies, nor for bodily Ends,
but to ſee to the execution of Gods Law, by their Bie
Subordinate Laws; and Gods Laws all look to higher
Ends.</p>
               <p>§ VI. And he that ſaid, <hi>They are the Miniſters of
God to us for good,</hi> meant <hi>true and durable good,</hi> no
doubt: And when he ſaith, <hi>That they are a Terror to
evil doers,</hi> he meaneth ſuch as is contrary to <hi>the well-doing</hi>
which they muſt encourage. And is <hi>Piety</hi> and
<hi>Chriſtianity</hi> none of that? He doth not except Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
Idolatry, Oppoſition to God, Chriſt, Holineſs,
Heaven, Juſtice or Charity, from the number of <hi>Evil
Works,</hi> which are the worſt of them. It is therefore
certain, That Princes may and muſt puniſh many ſins
againſt the Firſt Table, and ſuch againſt the Second
as would ſhelter themſelves under pretence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>§ VII. But all the doubt is, <hi>What bounds here to
ſet, where it is ſo dangerous to go too far.</hi> And it is
one of the moſt neceſſary Caſes of Conſcience, which a
Chriſtian Prince hath to ſtudy and reſolve; in which
he muſt neither hearken to a proud, envious, idle,
worldly Clergy, nor to injudicious Zealots, nor to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious
Hereticks, but avoid Extreams.</p>
               <p>§ VIII. In ſhort, what I have before ſaid, deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the Caſe.</p>
               <p>1. He muſt Tolerate no one Sin how ſmall ſoever,
which is within his Cognizance and Juriſdiction, which
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55406:243"/>
he can indeed cure by righteous means, which will do
more good than hurt.</p>
               <p>2. Thoughts, Heart Sins and Secret Sins are not
within his Cognizance.</p>
               <p>3. To do the work of Parents, Paſtors, Tutors, or
Phyſicians, is no part of the Office to which he is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
and authorized.</p>
               <p>4. But he may drive on all theſe to do their duties
by due means.</p>
               <p>5. It is unlawful to ſeek to cure a leſſer Evil, with a
greater: That is to be numbred with the things which
the Prince <hi>cannot</hi> do, which he cannot do by <hi>lawful
means,</hi> or ſuch as <hi>do more hurt than good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. The Miſchiefs before enumerated againſt the
Princes Safety and Honour, and againſt Love, and
Juſtice, and Conſcience, and Religion, are ſo great,
as that no Severity muſt be uſed which procureth them,
and doth not a greater good.</p>
               <p>7. The puniſhing of ſmall Faults by great Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
is Injuſtice, and Unlawful.</p>
               <p>8. Abundance of Infirmities, and humane Frailties
and Errors, are ſuch as muſt be endured, ſo they be but
by <hi>Doctrine, Love</hi> and <hi>gentle Reproofs, rebuked</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned,</hi>
without Puniſhments Eccleſiaſtical or Corporal;
elſe there will be no Love or Peace.</p>
               <p>9. Preachers muſt not be ſuffered to perſuade Men
from the Faith, Love or Obedience of God in Chriſt,
againſt any Article of the Creed, or Petition of the
Lords Prayer, or Precept of the Decalogue, or any eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
part of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>10. If ſuch ſpeak a damnable Error or Hereſie by
Ignorance or Heedleſneſs, they muſt have a firſt and
ſecond Admonition, and they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> repent. But if they
forbear not upon. Admonition, they do it <hi>ſtudiouſly</hi> and
<hi>wilfully;</hi> and ſuch are to be Silenced till they Reform,
becauſe the Preaching of one that oppoſeth an <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:55406:244"/>
Point of <hi>Religion,</hi> will do <hi>more harm than good,</hi>
except among <hi>Heathens,</hi> or where no better Preachers
can be had.</p>
               <p>11. It will not be unmeet for the Rulers to draw
up either a Catalogue of <hi>integral</hi> Points of <hi>Religion</hi> of
great moment, which all ſhall be forbidden to Preach
or Diſpute againſt; or elſe a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of <hi>Errors</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to ſuch, which none ſhall have leave to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate:
But it is not every one that violateth the Law,
that is to be forbidden to preach Chriſts Goſpel; but
leſſer pecuniary Mulcts, may be ſufficient puniſhment
to many; and the bare denying them preferment or
maintenance, and caſting them among the diſowned
<hi>that are but tolerated,</hi> may be better puniſhment, and
more effectual in caſe of tolerable Faults, than the
more ſevere.</p>
               <p>12. Rulers ſhould do much more to reſtrain from
Evils, than to conſtrain to Religious Duties: And thoſe
Evils are of theſe ſorts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Such as blaſpheme God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Such as draw the Hearers Souls into dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Error or Sin.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Such as tend to overthrow the Honour and
Safety of the Governors.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Such as tend directly to breed Hatred in
men againſt each other, and kindle the fire of Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Enmity.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Such as draw men from the common duties
of Juſtice towards Neighbors, or Relations, into Fraud
and Injury.</p>
               <p>13. It is the greateſt part of the Magiſtrates duty
about Religion,</p>
               <p>Firſt, To ſee Gods own Laws kept in Honour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And to keep Peace by Church Juſtices
among Clergymen and People, that are apt to take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
from Religion, to abuſe and calumniate one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:55406:244"/>
14. Yet Rulers may and muſt compel Perſons that
are groſly ignorant or erroneous, to hear what can be
ſaid againſt their Error, and for their Inſtruction: As
Parents (ſo Magiſtrates) may compel Children (and
Subjects) to be Catechized, and to hear Gods Word;
and may compel them to hear ſuch Teachers as have
the Rulers Licence, either as <hi>Approved,</hi> or <hi>Tolerated</hi> to
Teach.</p>
               <p>15. Men ought not to be compelled to <hi>receive the
Sacraments of Baptiſm or the Lords Supper,</hi> by the
Sword or Force; becauſe it is to receive a <hi>ſealed Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of Sin, and Donation of Christ and Life;</hi> which
<hi>no unwilling perſon hath right to,</hi> or doth receive: For
to ſay <hi>I am unwilling,</hi> is to ſay <hi>I receive not;</hi> and ſo the
reception of the outward ſign is Hypocriſie, Prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and taking the Name of God in vain.</p>
               <p>16. Yet thoſe that being <hi>Baptized,</hi> and at Age, <hi>avoid
Communion,</hi> are, after Admonition, to be taken for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volters
ſo far, and to be declared ſuch as ſo far caſt
themſelves from the Communion of the Church: And
the Chriſtian Magiſtrate may well deny them many
Priviledges in the Commonwealth, which he ſhould
appropriate to ſound perſevering Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>17. Places in Government, Truſt, Burgeſs-ſhip, and
Votes in Elections of Governors, and ſuch like, are beſt
appropriated to the Approved part of Chriſtians, and
ſome the Tolerated; but never granted to Apoſtates,
proper Hereticks, or any that are intolerable.</p>
               <p>18. Paſtors of the Churches ſhould not be <hi>conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to give the Sacrament of Baptiſm,</hi> or <hi>the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
to any one againſt their Conſciences; becauſe,</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is their Office to be <hi>Judges,</hi> who is to be
Baptized, and to Communicate. This is the power of
the Keys.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If they may not judge of the very Act
which they are to perform, they have not ſo much as
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55406:245"/>
that <hi>judicium diſcretionis,</hi> which belongeth to every
man as a man, and ſo muſt act brutiſhly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If they may adminiſter againſt Conſcience
when they think it Sin, the ſame reaſon would hold
for all men to ſin, whenever a Ruler commandeth them
that judgeth it no Sin: what Bounds ſhall be ſet againſt
abſolute blind Obedience?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whereas the <hi>Objection</hi> is from Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
As, [<hi>Then every Paſtor may deny Men Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>]</p>
               <p>I anſwer, 1. So every Tutor, Phyſician, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may
abuſe his Truſt.</p>
               <p>2. Therefore men muſt have care whom they
chooſe and truſt.</p>
               <p>3. There are better Remedies than ſinful ſlavery in
the Miniſter, even conſulting with Synods of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
or where Biſhops rule, appealing to them.</p>
               <p>4. The perſons that expect the Sacrament, may
have it from ſome other Paſtor that is willing. It is
a leſs inconvenience that a ſingle perſon remove, or elſe
communicate in another Aſſembly, than that the Paſtor,
whoſe Office is to uſe the Church Keys, be enſlaved to
ſin againſt his Conſcience.</p>
               <p>5. We ſuppoſe that of ancient right, the Church is
not to have a Paſtor over them, whom they conſent
not to: Therefore if the Church find themſelves
wronged by the Paſtors Fact, they have their Remedy.
They may admoniſh the Paſtor, and if he hear not,
tell the Biſhop, Synod or Magiſtrate (for I am not now
determining the caſe of ſuperior Biſhops, but tell what
is the actual Remedy where ſuch bear Rule:) And if he
hear not the Church, Synod, Biſhop or Magiſtrate, they
may deſert him, and chooſe a fitter Paſtor, and yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Excommunicate nor Silence him, but the ſame
man may be more ſutable to another Flock which
will deſire him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:55406:245"/>
They that object Inconveniences in this motion,
ſhould conſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That a Miſchief and Sin is worſe than an
Inconvenience.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That there is nothing deſirable here
without Inconveniences, which may furniſh an unwiſe
Contender with <hi>Objections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, That they that cry up the Canons and
Traditions, Cuſtom or judgment of Antiquity, Biſhops,
Councils, Fathers, and the Catholick Church, ſhould
not haſtily ſet their own Wit or Authority againſt them
all, who for 600, if not nearer 1000 years after
Chriſt, did not only judge that Biſhops muſt come in
by the Peoples Election and Conſent, but that he was
to be accounted an Uſurper, and no Biſhop of theirs,
that had it not.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, And we have reaſon to think St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
and the <hi>Carthage</hi> Council of Biſhops, as wiſe as the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors,</hi>
who, in the Caſe of <hi>Martial</hi> and <hi>Baſilides</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
deſcribed judged, <hi>that the People ought to forſake
an uncapable ſcandalous Paſtor, though other Biſhops (even
he of</hi> Rome) <hi>abſolved him: And that the chief power
of chooſing or forſaking was in them, and if they did
otherwiſe, it was not the contrary Sentence of Biſhops that
would excuſe them before God.</hi> It is eaſie to ſay [<hi>St.</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian
<hi>erred, and we are in the right and this would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
all Government:</hi>] But neither the perſons that
object, nor their Reaſons, have ever yet ſeemed to me
ſufficient, to make me prefer their judgment even in
this before <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and the <hi>African</hi> Fathers.</p>
               <p>XI. In all probability FREE SACRAMENTS
adminiſtred by ſuch Miniſters of Chriſt as by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Magiſtrates Licence are either <hi>Approved</hi> or <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,</hi>
would heal moſt of all the Diſcords about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in <hi>England,</hi> I mean, <hi>Sacraments not conſtrainedly,
but freely given and received.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:55406:246"/>
I ſhall tell you why I think ſo, by inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>1. The Thing call'd <hi>Strict Presbytery,</hi> [<hi>with a
power of Claſſes and National Aſſemblies, compoſed of
Ordained and Unordained Elders, as a Judicature, whoſe
Excommunication is to be enforced by the Magiſtrates
Sword</hi>] is approved by few of my acquaintance in
<hi>England:</hi> But thoſe that <hi>Prelatiſts</hi> cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
here, commonly are Miniſters that deſire but the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of ſo much of their proper Office, and the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and a <hi>Man,</hi> as not to be forced to
adminiſter Sacraments againſt their knowledge and
conſcience to the uncapable, becauſe a Lay-Chancelor
or a Dioceſane that knoweth not his Neighbours and
Flocks ſo well as he, ſhall ſay that they are worthy, and
command him to renounce his knowledge in obeying
them. And if God had made all ſuch Miniſters to be
only the Lay-Chancellors, or the Dioceſanes Agents or
Servants, to Baptize, and give the Lords Supper only in
the Chancellors or Biſhops name as a Meſſenger, and if
it be done amiſs, that not we, but the Chancellor or
Biſhop ſhould anſwer it to God, then we could joyfully
thus obey them. But while we believe, That we muſt
anſwer our ſelves for our own actions, and that we
muſt Baptize, and give the Lords Body and Blood, in
Chriſts Name, and not the Biſhops, we dare not obey
Men before God, nor renounce our own judgment in
the matters of our own Office and Truſt: Therefore
it would ſatisfie us, had we but freedom in our Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
action, not to go againſt our Conſcience, however
blind malice would make the world believe, that it is
ſome Papal Empire, even over Princes, that we deſire.
Nay, we deſire, That if the Magiſtrate will allow us
Pariſh-Churches, and Maintenance, and Countenance
in our work, that any perſon that cannot remove his
dwelling without great detriment, and cannot be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55406:246"/>
in our Order of Worſhip and Communion, but can
receive more Edification from another Miniſter, may
have leave to join in Communion with any other <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved</hi>
or <hi>Tolerated Church,</hi> keeping the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi>
and <hi>Peace:</hi> Why ſhould I envy anothers deſires or
benefits? Or think it hard, that any can profit more
by another, than by me? Or why ſhould I be againſt
it?</p>
               <p>And we deſire (not that the People may be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers,
or Church-Governors, or have the power of the
Keys, but) that if any Flock cannot be ſatisfied, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
full hearing, to reſt under the conduct of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
they may freely choo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e another, and remove us.
And for my own part, as I never did, ſo I wonder how
any ingenious Miniſter can obtrude himſelf on any
People, and pretend to be their Paſtor againſt their
wills. As my Conſcience condemneth it as againſt God
and them, ſo I confeſs my Prudence is againſt it for my
ſelf, and I am not ſo baſe as to endure ſuch a life.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>And as for the Party called</hi> Independant, <hi>I have
reaſon to think that it is the main of that</hi> Toleration
<hi>which they deſire. For Mr.</hi> Philip Nye, <hi>who led them
more than any one man known to me, did purpoſely
write to prove,</hi> That the Chriſtian Magiſtrate may ſet
up Teachers, all over his Dominions, whom the People,
upon his Command, are bound to hear: But that to take
any for their Paſtors, he thought they might not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled.</p>
               <p>3. And even the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> would be contented
with the ſame liberty, if they be but near as peaceable
as Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> was, who wrote for even <hi>Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>chial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi>
and perſuaded the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> to it: Though
few ſo far followed him, moſt, I think, would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with <hi>Free Sacraments,</hi> in which I include the
<hi>Euchariſtical Lords-day worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ X. And what harm will this do, where Love
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55406:247"/>
prevaileth, and where Pride and Envy make not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
Prieſts to think all wrong them, that do not Adore or
Idolize them, or give them more than is their due?
What harm will it do me, if an hundred of my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
hear and prefer another man, by whom they can
profit more than by me? What if they worſhip God
in other (ſound) words, or in Cloaths of another
make or colour, as long as they are reſtrained from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling,
and the breach of Peace? Are they any better
in my Auditory with cenſuring or diſſenting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>dg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
hearing me againſt their wills, than where they
can freely join in Love and Peace? If a bad or weak
Miniſter grudge at all that go to an able Conformiſt
in the next Pariſh, few wiſe men will think that he
doth it more for God, or for his Brothers Soul, than for
himſelf: and yet that perſon breaketh the Canon that
goeth to the next Pariſh, as well as he that goeth to a
Nonconformiſt. And why ſhould we be more impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
with this man, than with that?</p>
               <p>§ XXI. <hi>The Pamphlets that are ſpread abroad
for Rigor and Severity of late, under the pretence of
Conformity, do many of them ſavor ſo rankly of
Church-Tyranny, and a bloody Mind and Principles,
and are made up of ſuch Reaſons, as give us juſt cauſe
to ſuſpect, that more of them are written by</hi> Papiſts,

and holy, and the</hi> Papiſts <hi>much preferred before them
ſaying,</hi> [<q>That for one infallible old Gentleman at
<hi>Rome</hi> we have Thouſands of Hot Spirits in <hi>England,</hi>
that pretend to more of the Divine Perfections than
ever he did: For if the Holy Ghost doth perſonally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwell
in <hi>Sectaries,</hi> then they are perſonally poſſeſſed with
all the glorious Attributes of the Godhead, <hi>pag.</hi> 26.
<hi>And</hi> 28. The Idolatry of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> will be as excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
at the great day of Accounts, as the unreverent
Rudeneſs, and ſuperſtitious Sowreneſs of the <hi>Sectary.
And p.</hi> 29. The groſs Uſurpation and Invaſion of the
Prieſtly Office by <hi>Sectaries,</hi> to erect Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> throws
more dirt upon the Chriſtian Religion, than the groſſeſt

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I know none ſo worthy of the Name of
<hi>Sectaries</hi> as the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that damn all Chriſtians ſave
themſelves, and feign themſelves onely to be <hi>all the
Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It's like by theſe <hi>Sectaries,</hi> he meaneth thoſe that
are not <hi>Re-ordained,</hi> or have not (uninterrupted) Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Ordination. And if all ſuch Reformed Churches
are ſo much more dirty and injurious to Chriſtianity,
than the groſſeſt Errors of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> it's better be of
the Papal Church, than of them.</p>
               <p>3. Doth pretending to the help of <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> in
<hi>Praying,</hi> and <hi>Preaching,</hi> and <hi>Living,</hi> arrogate more
than pretending to <hi>Papal Infallibility</hi> in the Office of
an Univerſal Monarch, and <hi>Judge of the ſenſe of all
Gods Word?</hi> The word [<hi>Perſonal</hi>] I have heard uſed
by none but this, and ſuch Accuſers: But what he
meaneth by it, who can tell?</p>
               <p>Firſt, If it refer to the <hi>Perſon of the Receiver,</hi> how
can the Holy Ghoſt dwell in any man, and not dwell
in his <hi>perſon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, If it refer to the <hi>Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
what Chriſtian, before this man, did ever doubt, (that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55406:248"/>
took the Holy Ghoſt to be God) whether the <hi>Perſon</hi>
as well as the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, be every
where? Doth not the Scripture ſay, <hi>That the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
dwelleth in Believers?</hi> Rom. 8. 11. 1 Cor. 3. 16.
2 Tim. 1. 14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>God dwelleth in us,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.
12. 15, 16. And <hi>that we are an habitation of God by
the Spirit,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 22. Is <hi>Gods Word</hi> worſe than
<hi>Popery?</hi> Or is not this to reproach <hi>God and his Word,
and Spirit,</hi> more than the Reformed Churches do by not
having Biſhops, who are accuſed by Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> to ſin
againſt the Holy Ghoſt?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, But if [<hi>Perſonal</hi>] ſhould mean the mode
and title of Union, as if by <hi>Hypoſtatical Union</hi> like
Chriſts, the Holy Ghoſt and Believers be made <hi>one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
who are thoſe <hi>Sectaries</hi> that hold ſuch a thing, who
ſhew the ſtate of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Religion? And this is one
of the men that cry out againſt <hi>Toleration,</hi> and tells us,
that [<q>
                     <hi>There can be no ſtability of Government in</hi>
England, <hi>till there be a ſettlement in Religion; No
ſettlement of Religion, but by uniting Affections; No
uniting Affections, but by unity of Religion.</hi>
                  </q>] And ſo
on: Therefore Rulers muſt force all to be of one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>Next to the thought of the Heathen and Apoſtate
Nations caſe, it is one of the ſaddeſt to me, that Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and People that have too little ſtudied ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ſhould lie under the temptation and horrid abuſe
of Clergymen, that write and talk at ſuch a rate as
this man doth.</p>
               <p>1. Will he maintain, That there is <hi>no Union of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
wherever men are not of <hi>one opinion, form or
mode,</hi> in every <hi>Circumſtance, Rite</hi> or <hi>Ceremony,</hi> or every
accident or integral of Faith? Are any two men in the
world then of <hi>one Religion,</hi> any more than of one viſage
or ſlature, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. If this man had Rulers that differed from him, as
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55406:248"/>
much as he doth from the Nonconformiſts, would he,
and could he, preſently change his judgment? or would
he falſly profeſs a change, leſt he ſhould not be of one
Religion with his Prince? or rather muſt it not be <hi>he,</hi>
or <hi>ſuch</hi> as he, that muſt be the ſtandard of that <hi>one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to all?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Doth he believe, That Priſons or Flames will
make men <hi>of one Affection?</hi> Would ſuch uſage win
himſelf to love the judgment and way of thoſe that he
ſuffered by?</p>
               <p>4. Or if men of many Opinions and Affections be
forced into the ſame Temple as a Priſon, doth their
corporal preſence make them of <hi>one Religion and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?</hi>
It is a doleful thing to hear Preachers of the
Goſpel cry out for Blood, Flames, or Priſons, to make
whole Kingdoms of <hi>one Religion,</hi> confeſſing how unfit
they are to do it themſelves, who have undertaken the
Office that ſhould do it: Woe to the Princes, Church
and People, that have not wit and grace to eſcape
the ſnares of ſuch ignorant Tyrannical Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors.</p>
               <p>Abundance more ſuch Pamphlets have lately endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to deſtroy Love and Peace, and infect the Land
with Malice and Cruelty.</p>
               <p>§ XII. The <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine and Laws for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminating,
and burning Hereticks, is the top and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of this hypocritical wickedneſs, which murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Gods Servants, and depopulateth Countries, on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Charity, Unity and Government. And when
ſo many Princes became guilty of ſerving this bloody
Clergy, (that never knew what manner of ſpirit they
were of) it was Gods wiſdom and juſtice to permit the
ſame Councils of Biſhops, and the ſame Popes, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
their Depoſition, which decreed their Subjects ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
(<hi>Lateran. ſub Innoc.</hi> 3.) what can be
more contrary to Nature? to Humane Intereſt? or to

the Doctrine, Example, and Spirit of Chriſt? And
whoſe blood is ſafe, while ſuch blood-ſucking Leeches
are taken for the Rulers of the world, and the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
of Souls?</p>
               <p>§ XIII. All this, I perceive, is on occaſion of
<hi>Objections,</hi> but ſuperadded to what I fullier ſaid before,
<hi>Part II. Chap.</hi> 8. But I ſtill ſay, That <hi>Toleration</hi> muſt
have its due bounds, and not extend to intolerable
Doctrines, Practices or Perſons.</p>
               <p>To proceed then, Every one that will, muſt not be
Tolerated to be a publick Paſtor and Preacher, no not
of the Truth. For ſome inſufficient men may by that
<hi>manner</hi> bring a ſcandal or ſcorn on the ſacred Doctrine
and Worſhip of God; and taking Gods Name pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely
and in vain, is worſe than ſilence: much leſs
ſhould men be ſuffered to preach or diſpute down anys
Point of Chriſtian Faith or Duty.</p>
               <p>§ XIV. In a word, The Prince that will
eſcape the dangerous Extreams of Licentiouſneſs, and
oppreſſing Perſecution, muſt.</p>
               <p>1. Have an eye to the Holy Scripture, and Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Inſtitution, and to the Law of Nature together, as
his Rule.</p>
               <p>2. He muſt make the true publick Good, which
lieth in mens ſpiritual welfare, his end.</p>
               <p>3. He muſt make the promoting of Obedience to
God and his Laws, the chief work of his Office and of
his own Laws.</p>
               <p>4. He muſt abhor and avoid all carnal Intereſts,
contrary to the Intereſt of Chriſt, and mens
Souls.</p>
               <p>5. He muſt do all with Caution from a Spirit of
Love, and a Care to preſerve mens fear of God.</p>
               <p>6. He muſt take heed of Partiality, or hearkning
to the counſel either of Atheiſts, prophane men, or of
an ignorant, proud, and cruel Clergy: And muſt
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55406:249"/>
hearken to wiſe, pious, conſiderate, peaceable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
Counſellors, and avoid the examples both of
<hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and be neither an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor
nor a Corrupter.</p>
               <p>§ XV. And to conclude, good and wiſe men
may well know their duty, whom to <hi>ſilence</hi> and <hi>eject,</hi>
and whom to <hi>tolerate,</hi> if they are but true to God, by
this one Rule: They may, by hearing all the caſe and
knowledge of the Perſons, diſcern <hi>whether that mans
Preaching,</hi> conſideratis conſiderandis, <hi>is clearly like to
do more good or harm: and do accordingly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then they muſt not judge of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>harm,</hi> by
carnal ſinful luſts and intereſts, and by the counſels of
ſelfiſh partial men, but by wiſe and juſt reaſon, guided
by the Word of God.</p>
               <p>§ XVI. And in all doubtful Caſes, chooſe the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
ſide; and when the danger of <hi>overdoing</hi> is the
greater (as in caſe of <hi>Perſecution</hi>) rather do too little,
than too much: And prefer not Ceremonies before
Subſtance, nor tything Mint, Anniſe and Cummin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Love, Truth and Judgment, and the great things
of the Law: And be ſure that you learn what this
meaneth, <hi>I will have mercy, and not ſacrifice,</hi>] that

               <p>1. All Tranſlations are the work of imperfect fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
men; we have none made by the Spirit as work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
infallibly in the Apoſtles, (unleſs, as ſome think, the
<hi>Greek</hi> of St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel be a Tranſlation.) The
pretences of Inſpiration of the Seventy two that are
ſaid to be the Authors of that <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlation of
the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> is not yet agreed on in the Church;
nor whether it was more than the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> which
they Tranſlated. The Authority and Reaſons of
<hi>Hierome</hi> ſtill much prevail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> II. And the Vulgar <hi>Latine,</hi> moſt valued by
the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> is yet ſo much matter of Controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, that when <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> had ſtabliſhed a
corrected Edition, <hi>Clement</hi> the 8th altered it in many
hundred places after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> III. And all Proteſtants acknowledge the
imperfection of all their own Tranſlations, <hi>Engliſh,
Dutch, French,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And in the ſame Church of <hi>England,</hi> we have the

the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> one ſometime directly contrary to the other,

to be ſure that he hath a Copy of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and
<hi>Greek</hi> Text, which he is certain is perfectly agreeable
to the autography or firſt draught: And the multitude
of various Readings put us out of all hope of ever ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
certainly ſo perfect a Copy: All therefore have
the marks of humane frailty, which cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> V. And no wiſe and good man ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately
deny this, and ſo juſtifie falſly every humane
ſlip. But yet there is no ſuch difference among Copies
or Tranſlations, as ſhould any way ſhake our foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or any point neceſſary to ſalvation doth depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
For in all ſuch points they all agree.</p>
               <p>Sect. VI. <hi>Object.</hi> But if Copies and Tranſlations
differ and err, how can we make them our rule of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſay again, They agree in as many things
as we need them for, as a Rule of Judgment: And
where they differ, it being in words of no ſuch uſe, and
moment, that hindereth not our being Ruled by them
where they agree. The Kings Laws may be written
in divers Languages for divers Countries of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
And verbal differences may be no hinderance to
their regulating uſe; no more than the King himſelf
doth loſe his authority, if his hair turn white.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We muſt ſubſcribe, That we believe all Gods
Word to be true, and all the true Canon of Scripture
to be his Word, and that we will faithfully endeavor

Though we have good cauſe to judge beſt of our own

               <argument>
                  <p>The Catholick Church will never unite in the
ſubſcribing to any mens whole Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
on the Bible.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. I. THis is yet more evident than the former.
1. They do not at this day, nor ever did
agree in any mens Commentary: They have great
reſpect to the Commentaries of ſome of the Ancients,
and others, but ſubſcribe them not as infallible: Though
the <hi>Trent</hi> Oath of Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> ſwear men not to expound
the Scriptures otherwiſe than according to the agreeing
Expoſition of the Fathers; it is well known,</p>
               <p>1. That they never told and proved to us, who are
to be taken for Fathers, and who not.</p>
               <p>2. It's known that few of them have written large
Commentaries, and fewer on all the Bible, if any.</p>
               <p>3. That they oft differ among themſelves.</p>
               <p>4. And the beſt have confeſſed their own Errors.</p>
               <p>5. And more have been found erroneous by others,
and are by us at this day.</p>
               <p>6. Yea, they have caſt out, and condemned one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
as the Caſe of <hi>Nazianzene, Epiphanius, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom,
Theophilus Alexand. Cyril,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and
many more beſides <hi>Origen</hi> ſheweth.</p>
               <p>6. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> ordinarily take liberty to differ from
the Commentaries of divers of the moſt Renowned of
the Fathers.</p>
               <p>7. And the learnedſt men of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves
do differ from one another.</p>
               <p>8. And no General Council that pretend to be the
Judge of theſenſe of the Scripture, durſt ever yet ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to write a Commentary on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:55406:252"/>
9. No nor any Pope; nor any by his appointment,
or a Councils, is written by any other, and by them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
as infallible. By all which, and much more, it
is evident, That ſubſcribing wholly to any Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
will never unite the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> II. And no wonder, when that, 1. God
hath compoſed the Scripture of ſuch various parts, as
that all are not of the ſame nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

but ſome are harder than the reſt to be underſtood, and
many hundred Texts are ſuch, that a man that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
them not, may be ſaved. 2. And Paſtors as well
as People, are of various degrees of underſtanding, and
all imperfect, and know but in part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> III. Yet are good Commentaries of great
uſe, as other teaching is; but not to be ſubſcribed as
the terms of the Unity or Liberty of the Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> IV. Nay, thoſe particular Expoſitions which
General Councils (the Pretenders to deciding judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
have made, are not to be ſubſcribed as infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
as I have before proved by the quality of the

                  <p>A Summary Recital of the true Terms of

Schiſm.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Sum of all that is ſaid of Schiſm and Unity,
is this.</p>
               <p>§ I. Schiſm is an unlawful ſeparating from one, or
many Churches, or making Parties and Diviſions in
them, and is cauſed uſually, either</p>
               <p>1. By unskilful, proud Church-Tyrants, Dogmatiſts, or
Superſtitious Perſons, by departing from Chriſts inſtituted
terms of Concord, the Chriſtian Purity and Simplicity,
and denying Communion to thoſe that unite not on their
ſinful or unneceſſary ſelf-deviſed terms, and obey not their
enſnaring Canons or Wills; or malignantly forbidding
what Christ hath commanded, and excommunicating and
perſecuting men for obeying him.</p>
               <p>2. Or elſe by erroneous proud ſelf-conceited perſons, that
will not unite and live in Communion upon Chriſts inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
terms, but feigning ſome Doctrine or Practice of
their deviſing to be true, good and neceſſary, which is not;
or ſomething to be intolerably ſinful that is good or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
do therefore caſt off their Guides, and the Communion
of the Church as unlawful, on pretence of chooſing a better
neceſſary way.</p>
               <p>§ II. 2. The neceſſary means of <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Church
Concord,</hi> are theſe.</p>
               <p>1. That every Catechized underſtanding perſon,
profeſſing Repentance, Belief and Conſent to the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal
Covenant, and the Children of ſuch dedicated by
them to Chriſt be Baptized. And the Baptized ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55406:253"/>
Chriſtians having right to Chriſtian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
till their Profeſſion be validly diſproved by an
inconſiſtent Profeſſion or Converſation; that is, by ſome
Doctrine againſt the Eſſence of Chriſtianity, or ſome
ſcandalous wilful ſin, with Impenitence after ſufficient
Admonition: And that no man be Excommunicated,
that is not proved thus far to Excommunicate himſelf:
And that the Catechized or Examined perſon be put
upon no other profeſſion of <hi>Belief, Conſent</hi> and <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi>
as interpreting the Sacramental Covenant, but of
the <hi>Articles of the Creed, the Lords Prayer</hi> and <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi>
underſtood; and the general belief of, conſent
to, and practice of all that he diſcerneth to be the
Word of God.</p>
               <p>2. That in Church Caſes and Religion,</p>
               <p>I. The Magiſtrate have the onely <hi>publick judgment
whom he ſhall countenance and maintain, or tolerate, and
whom he ſhall puniſh, or not tolerate nor maintain:</hi> and
never be the Executioner of the Clergies Sentence,
without, or againſt his own Conſcience and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>II. That the Ordainers (being the ſenior Paſtors, or
a Biſhop or Preſident with other Paſtors, which is to be
left to the concurrent judgments of themſelves, and the
people) be the Judges of the <hi>fitneſs of the Ordained per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to be a Miniſter of Chriſt,</hi> and the ſaid Paſtors in
their reſpective particular Churches, be the <hi>Key-bearers,</hi>
or <hi>Judges,</hi> who is to be <hi>Baptized, and admitted to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in the Church, and who not;</hi> and not conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Baptize, or to give or deny Communion there, by
the judgment of others againſt their Conſciences,
(though in caſe of forfeiture, or juſt cauſe, they may
be removed from that Church, or from the ſacred
Office.)</p>
               <p>III. That the <hi>People</hi> of that Church be the <hi>private
diſcerning Judges, who ſhall be their Paſtors, to whoſe
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55406:253"/>
conduct they will truſt their Souls;</hi> if not ſo far as to be
the <hi>firſt Electors,</hi> at leaſt ſo far as to have a <hi>free conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
or <hi>diſſenting power;</hi> and they be not forced to truſt
their Souls with any man as a Paſtor againſt their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences:
And that <hi>every man be the private diſcerning
Judge of his own Duty to God and Man, and of his ſin
forbidden;</hi> and of his own ſecret Caſe, whether he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in God and Chriſt, and purpoſe to obey him, or
whether he be an Atheiſt, or Infidel, or ſecretly wicked,
and ſo fit or unfit for Baptiſm and Communion; ſo that
though he be not to be <hi>received without the judgment
of the Paſtors,</hi> yet he may <hi>exclude himſelf, if conſcious
of incapacity;</hi> and therefore that none be forced by
corporal Penalties or Mulcts, to be Baptized, or to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.</p>
               <p>3. That the Chriſtian Magiſtrate make three ſorts
of Laws, one for the <hi>approved and maintained Churches
and Paſtors;</hi> another for the <hi>Tolerated;</hi> and a third
ſort for the <hi>Intolerable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. And that a ſufficient number of the ableſt, ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,
and worthieſt Miniſters, be made the publick,
approved, maintained Preachers and Paſtors. And
where Pariſh Bounds are judged neceſſary, that all
perſons living in the Pariſh be conſtrained to <hi>contribute

Temple, and Poor;</hi> and to <hi>hear publick Teaching,</hi> and
to <hi>worſhip God,</hi> either in that or ſome other <hi>Approved</hi>
or <hi>Tolerated</hi> Church, within their convenient reach or
neighborhood.</p>
               <p>II. And that the <hi>Tolerated</hi> Miniſters (tryed and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed)
have protection and peace in the publick exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of their Miniſtery, though not <hi>Approbation</hi> and
<hi>Maintenance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. But that the <hi>Intolerable</hi> be reſtrained by ſutable
reſtraints.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>That the Approved and Maintained Miniſters be

ſo far as by diligent ſtudy they are able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
them; and more particularly of the Chriſtian
Religion ſummarily contained in the Sacramental Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and in the ancient Creeds received by the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Church, the Lords Prayer, and the Decalogue, as it is
the Law of Chriſt, and expounded by him in the Holy
Scriptures: And that they will be faithful to the King

the Flocks in holy Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Life, labouring to promote Truth, Holineſs,
Love, Peace and Juſtice, for the ſalvation of mens
Souls, the edification of the Church, and the glorifying and
pleaſing of God our Creator, Redeemer and Sanctifier.</p>
               <p>And that the ſaid Maintained Miniſters be tyed by
the regulating Laws which determine <hi>only ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
as</hi> in genere <hi>are neceſſary to be agreed in for Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,

Bounds, what Tranſlation of Scripture to uſe, what
Verſion of Pſalms, what decent Habit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not put to
<hi>profeſs Approbation</hi> of all theſe, but required <hi>to uſe
them,</hi> and cenſured if they do not.</p>
               <p>5. That the <hi>Tolerated</hi> Miniſters ſubſcribe all the
ſame things, except theſe laſt <hi>Regulating Laws for Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of Order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. That either a Catalogue of Errors and Sins be
drawn up in the Law which no Miniſter ſhall preach;
or elſe it be left to the Judges to diſcern when any is
proved to preach againſt any neceſſary Article of his
ſubſcribed Profeſſion: And it is meet that the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
prohibited to the <hi>Maintained Miniſters,</hi> be larger
than that prohibited to the <hi>Tolerated,</hi> ſome Errors being
<hi>tolerable,</hi> which are not <hi>approvable.</hi> And it is not the
<hi>firſt fault</hi> that ſhould <hi>ſuſpend</hi> or <hi>ſilence</hi> either of them,
but <hi>obſtinacy</hi> after a <hi>firſt and ſecond admonition.</hi> Yea,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55406:254"/>
many <hi>leſſer Errors</hi> muſt be puniſhed only with <hi>congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Mulcts,</hi> or <hi>Rebukes,</hi> or after that with loſs of <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,</hi>
that are not to be puniſhed with <hi>Silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. That no other Teſt, Profeſſion, Covenant, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
or Promiſe be required of any, as neceſſary to
Miniſtery or Communion, which may become dividing
Snares and Engines: But only that where Papal Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
or any other <hi>Uſurpers, claim</hi> it dangerous to the
Church and Kingdom, the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of that <hi>Papacy</hi> or
<hi>Uſurpation be expreſly renounced by all that will have
Maintenance or Toleration;</hi> yet not on this pretence
making every claim of Patriarchs, Archbiſhops, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
Councils, or Synods of Presbyters, which others
think to be a Uſurpation, to be ſo dangerous as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
and ſo the renunciation of them as neceſſary; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſuch exiſtent perſons claim not ſuch Power, nor
make ſuch Laws, for depoſing Kings, and murdering
or exterminating Diſſenters: which if they do, they
muſt be expreſly renounced: elſe the keeping out <hi>uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
practice</hi> is enough.</p>
               <p>8. The Chriſtian Magiſtrate muſt <hi>keep Peace</hi> among
all, both the <hi>Approved</hi> and <hi>Tolerated,</hi> and not ſuffer
any <hi>unpeaceable Preaching</hi> or <hi>Diſputes;</hi> which tend to

keep frequent Synods for Correſpondency to theſe
