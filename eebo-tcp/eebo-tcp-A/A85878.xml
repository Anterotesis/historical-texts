            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>(As his bedfellow often ſaid)</l>
            <l>All yellow.</l>
            <l>So that he did full ſore complaine</l>
            <l>Unto his Copeſmate of his paine;</l>

            <l>This was a queint device, but he</l>

A ſucking Mathematician may lap in <hi>Sands, Helyn, Drake, Forbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher,</hi> and the reſt, but it is not manlik alwaies to be fed with a ſpoon; they muſt get Quadrants, Cycles, Epycicles, and rules of their own, if they will be good Carpenters; or if there be an obſtacle, or prohibition <hi>in ſubjecto,</hi> that is at home, (diſability) then let them get as good a Maſter as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had, and uſe his purſe, as Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> did his own.

dark night. The Incenſe of the place is worſe to the Lungs, then that of Brimſtone in the other. Cottidian <hi>Tobacco</hi> horrifying the twilight of the Cell, and making each man look like a Devill to a viſiting friend, yet hiding our own durtineſſe in his proper velope of obſcurity, and naturall vizard of hot miſt. The friendly Offices this Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian plant (for ſince the late Imbargos, we take no Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh nor before) affords the conſtant plyars of it, are its Salves and remedy againſt the damps of the Cellar, where fire and water are part of the tormentors, eſpecially when they come to be paid for. As about <hi>Bloomsbury,</hi> and the utmoſt parts of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> they cry and ſing water up and down the ſtreets; ſo here, beer and ſmoak are ſung in to the pittifull receivers, who muſt drop a tear before they taſt, either the ſilver of the eye, which procures for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, or elſe the very gold and blood of the heart, which is <hi>ready John.</hi> Here (ſtrange to tell) we drink fire, that is, ſmoak, handſomer then water: for our beer is by word of mouth to one another but our fire is never out of our own mouth, nor to be participated but when we never care what becomes of it, or whither it goes. As in <hi>Hell,</hi> it is thought the Devills are the leſſe tormentors; ſo here, our fellow Priſoners lie heavieſt upon us, and are to a new commer, worſe then new flies to a ſore leg. The Fees of your brethren, and their expectations, or rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancies, being greater then the Jaylors.

As in the one, Murder may not have the ſame fiery Chair with mansſlaughter; buggery not the ſame ſtool with

Fornication, (if this be not rather a purgatory gueſt)
nor may pocket-picking be in the nethermoſt pit with Sacriledge. So neither with us do the debts of the lower Forme preſume to mingle with thoſe of the higher.
Round <hi>O.

Something in the hole (for it is filthy comming in, and worſe getting out) is like the cuſtome of Conjurers and Witches, who are neer of blood to the Devill. For as <hi>Necromancers</hi> are ſafe in their circles from the Spirits they raiſe up: ſo theſe ſonnes of blackneſſe and darkneſſe chalk out every night the <hi>dimenſion</hi> of their undiſquieted lodgings, and lye in white incloſures, with never a rag over or under, which they undenyably ſleep in; and that chalk is as dangerouſly wip'd out, as that in the Cellar.
Soly in theſe Ivory beds our <hi>Knights</hi> of the <hi>Inner hole,</hi> as conſpicuous, if you could ſee them, as the Knights Templars within their Iron Paliſadoes in monumentall ſtone. And to ſay the truth, I know not which bodies are harder. If I were to chuſe a <hi>Perdue</hi>-man for my life, I would take him forth from theſe Probationers. And if he lie not <hi>à nocte in noctem,</hi> as cloſe as a Spaniell, or a Setting-Dogg, let him live on nothing but the quick proviſions of his body, without the reliefe of the Almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Basket for ever.</p>
               <p>The whole place may be aptly called, a diminutive <hi>Babel,</hi> where are all Tongues ſpoken by perſons in as great a confuſion; every one is a <hi>builder,</hi> and every one <hi>ruin'd; lime, ſand,</hi> and <hi>ſtone,</hi> in theſe words are every day call'd for, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Intereſt,</hi> the <hi>Principle,</hi> and <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:</hi> theſe are ſpoken, not underſtood and reply'd to.

So then, the <hi>Epitome</hi> of the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe</hi> is a Priſon. It is the All-Nation Office without a miſtake. It is the <hi>Babel,</hi> not of diſperſion, but collection, and from all <hi>corners</hi> of the earth we meet in the hole.
It is an Ark of men, not of beaſts: a Cage, not of birds, unleſſe of <hi>Tom Browns,</hi> and yet all theſe are taken.

               <head>A Serjeant.</head>
               <p>A Serjeant is in one reſpect a Gentleman, for he wears a Man, or rather a Yeoman, a creature of a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell kind, who is at a rate to fetch and carry, when he hath found, he ſpits in his mouth at the charge of the creditor, and dammage of his prey, which he mumbles 
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118016:23"/>
more roughly, then a water-Dogge a Duck. They are men-ſetting-doggs, and are as oft beaten as rewarded.
The two Counters are their <hi>Aſylum</hi> and refuge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where the Sheriffe is their <hi>Romulus:</hi> For thoſe walls like his, muſt not be leapt over. In his own life he is a <hi>Libertine,</hi> and denies it to all others: ſixe daies in the week are for his own uſe, but the ſeventh he hateth, becauſe of his own reſting, and not arreſting: Nothing on that day is a more deadly ſight to him, than a prey, that he in vain waited for on Saturday: He curſes no Acts but one (and that was the moſt noble) of ſpoyling his ſport on Sundaies.
Howſoever he may ſeem to the publick Government, for you may mark him back and breaſt like a City Coach, he is an hypocrite, for he hath two faces, that is, his Yeoman, and his own; then he hath two carriages, one in his mouth, and another in his hand; he arreſts you in the name of <hi>O. P.</hi> and out of hand with the mace of <hi>C. R.</hi> His Coat is party quartered, with the Harp and Croſſe on the outſide, and the Lyon, and Luces in the inſide, without a <hi>Chriſto auſpice</hi> to this, or <hi>Honi Soit,</hi> or <hi>God with us</hi> to the other. His ſtation is much like that of Wiſdomes (in the <hi>Proverbs</hi>) in the <hi>corners of the ſtreets,</hi> where if he catch his prey, he is ſtraight-way upon the top of the houſe. His firſt device, after his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, is his priſoners credit, which for a while he will ſmother, in ſome ſmoaky houſe neer his Counter, which is all a Priſon, but the name, and for the nature of it more unmercifull. Having hous'd you (for then he hath a hundred buſineſſes) he leaves you to his man leech (the Yeoman) who is to ſuck you till the blood comes, and pumpe each ſide of you, to know what waters your poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets draw, if he finde your ſilver ſucker out of caſe, and that you have no mettall men to mend it (that is a friend at Maw) he is in ſuch haſt to go to his Serjeant, as if the Devill drove him. In ſhort, they will after a five ſhillings draining of Sack, be in plain tearmes with you, and

for ſeven ſhillings a day, give you leave to lodge a ſpit and a ſtride of the Counter, which is the cheaper lodging of the two, and the leſſe offenſive, by the want of their ſociety. In what Schooles of inhumanity they have been bred, I know not, but I conceive u'm to be in tuition to the fallen <hi>Angells,</hi> who with their own integrity, have put off all love to mankind.
Their Ambuſcadoes and blind ſtaires are no leſſe incentives to cruelty, being commonly ſculking holes about the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers at all the barrs, or in Beaſt-markets, where with their brother Drovers, they drink till their own markets call them away. He is only qualified in <hi>Roſe</hi>-Wine not water, and love the miter for the Sacks ſake: ſouc'd perchance in a charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pickle, you ſhall have him more man, and reaſonable when he is dead drunk, and out of his ſenſes. Then, and then only, the Yeoman is Maſter, by the politick diſtance of his place, kept ſober againſt his will: But for the unmercifull uſage of the next man, it were good to make man like Maſter, and ſo adventure an eſcape (if you could) into Priſon, and leave them for the reckoning: It would confound them in their hair-brain'd ſearch more, then if they met the creditor that feed u'm, who with two brethren of their own coat, will bring them (if they have good fortune) at once to the priſon, and their bail their own Priſoners To conclude the men are of Gods making, and their own marring, their Office per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive for a time till <hi>Doomſday,</hi> which they love, for the reaſon aboveſaid, alike with Sunday, becauſe it puts an end to all arreſts; then perchance they may find the mercy of the <hi>Superiour Jayle,</hi> and the kind Officers thereof, who will put them into the hole (if it will hold u'm) where they ſhall feed upon the fragments and almeſ-basket of <hi>old Nick,</hi> and have hot dyet for their old charity in <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Whether one</hi> Chriſtian <hi>may arreſt another, as is uſual in</hi> New <hi>and</hi> Old England. <hi>Aff.</hi> As to my ſelfe, there is <hi>evidentia facti,</hi> it is done, nor will I diſpute the <hi>fieri debuit</hi> of it. Let the Creditors examine their own &amp; my neceſſities, and judge of the equality.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I ſay, (and yet it is not obſerved) that in <hi>Turky,</hi> under an <hi>Anti-Chriſtian Prince,</hi> it is <hi>contra</hi>-Apoſtolick counſel to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>Now we are all Chriſtians, (God be thanked) and fellow ſufferers (God be praiſed) and may ſue one another to the end of the Chapter.</p>
                  <p>But all generall rules have ſome exception. Therefore in caſe thy Brother be not worth a groat, throw no more mony away upon him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If he deſire mercy, ſhew as little as you can, becauſe as you mete, ſo it ſhall be meaſured to you.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Take heed of your ſuppoſed friend, the Gaol, leſt that which you imagine is your politick compulſory for the debt, do not poyſon the debtor, and ſo <hi>actio moritur cum perſona.</hi> that is a <hi>habeas Corpus</hi> that will <hi>exanimate</hi> a creditor. But to prevent ſuch a Ghoſtlineſſe in mine, I <hi>remov'd</hi> to better air, that I might ſo preſerve my ſelfe to be their faſt friend:
Wherefore in ſuch a caſe take ſomewhat, and work not for a dead horſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In <hi>New England,</hi> if your eſtate will reach to it, you muſt pay as far as it will go, take what you can finde after eight years ſequeſtration, there is ſcarce a ſweep left for a Kite.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In old <hi>England</hi> they make over their Eſtates to defraud 
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118016:26"/>
their Creditors. The Eſtate I had was an Office (<hi>durante vitâ</hi>) would he were whipp'd that made it over.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I but your wife may have ſomething (God forbid elſe)
but there's a reaſon for that, before this of Creditors, the proviſons of ſo neer a relation (not being counted cheats)
but Law, and Joyntures, and Matrimoniall ſettlements (even in <hi>his duris temporibus</hi>) have eſcaped others-gate clutches, then <hi>Creditors.</hi> In fine, all Caſuiſts count it lawfull, under the arreſt of two friends, to be his <hi>Wives Almes-man,</hi> his <hi>Creditors</hi> day-labourer; that is, to keep your ſelfe from ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the firſt place: and in the next to diſcharge a good conſcience to others.

                  <head>Querie the third.</head>
                  <p>WWhether it is more proper or convenient to a Priſoner to <hi>ſing Pſalmes,</hi> or <hi>drinke Sack?</hi> Ad partes.</p>
                  <p>I ſay firſt, the Query was ill put, and it was ill done to put any difference betwixt Sack and Pſalmes, the two great cordialls and conſolatories of human neceſſities ſhould be kept in inviolable friendſhip, they are like man and wife, not to be ſeparated <hi>under a curſe</hi> (nay not in Priſon theſe)
This indeed (beyond Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> diſpenſation) does without mutuall conſent, reſtrain, and interpoſe betwixt thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed pairs: But by Pſalmes they ſing themſelves together, and by Sack keep up the tune. Now whether the <hi>Hymn</hi> ſhould precede, or the <hi>Hymenaeal,</hi> there's the point. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to reconcile theſe two ſeeming different Siſters, like the two Univerſities, I will ſay only this. <hi>Diſtingue tempora et ſummus eris, &amp;c.</hi> as the Schoole ſaies, <hi>In ſenſu diviſo, non compoſito.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for example. Before the Sermon, even in a Priſon, and ſo after, a Pſalm is moſt proper, though Sack to the <hi>Miniſter</hi> (for ſpirituall Corroboration) is very comfortable, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after, if it exceed not the Church-Wardens pinte.</p>
                  <p>But if the Priſoner came lately from his obdurate <hi>Creditor,</hi> or be in the <hi>Collar,</hi> or at his <hi>ſhort commons,</hi> then to call the Pſalme of <hi>All people,</hi> were the next way to leave the poor 
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118016:26"/>
man never a bit. Therefore I doe moſt peremptorily conclude, that a <hi>Pſalm</hi> is not any way needfull at ſuch a time, or a very long Grace, for fear of a neighbour thief with a ſhorter.
Sack then (if you had it) is moſt proper, and according to the rules of Phyſick, very diſgeſtive: but <hi>we preſcribe rules, not mony,</hi> you muſt <hi>recipe</hi> of that <hi>Q. S. e'en where you pleaſe.</hi> And for your Apothecary, we come in again, go to the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> the <hi>halfe Moon, Sun,</hi> or the <hi>Devill,</hi> if it be not too chargeable with a waiter to go ſo farre.</p>
                  <p>According to the practice of that admirable Phyſician, Doctor <hi>Butler,</hi> and prime Grobian of that faculty, and the Sectaries of that opinion, there is hardly any room for <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> at any time of the day: For <hi>ter in Die</hi> (that is <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidie</hi>)
Sack is preſcribed, that is, <hi>ante caenam</hi> (which we render according to our Engliſh way of eating) before dinner:
Then <hi>in ipſo prandio,</hi> that is in the moment of dinner, though not in the moment of eating, unleſſe you eat, <hi>more Senatorio,</hi> like an Alderman, and then you may put <hi>Sack</hi> into <hi>Cuſtards</hi> and <hi>mince Pies;</hi> or elſe <hi>more bonorum ſoc.</hi> and ſo put Claret into your Surloyn of Beef, and ſo the caſe varies. Then third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which is the ſumme of all the buſineſſe, and (unto which few Priſoners can arrive) it is allowed, and <hi>perpetuall proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> upon it, that <hi>Sack</hi> (without <hi>Falſtaffs</hi> diſcovery of Lime in it) is to be taken <hi>poſt prandium</hi> likewiſe, without limitation; 'tis <hi>Putlers</hi> caſe, and I will not contend in <hi>Sack</hi> with ſo eminent a <hi>Doctor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall not make any long and tedious deciſion of this ſcruple (having at this time a cold) which makes me unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of balling or ſinging either, and requires more appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely ſome butter'd Sack. But notwithſtanding I ſhall not be ſway'd <hi>in deteriorem partem</hi> in my concluſion, by any perſonall partiality, and bodily inclinations. I ſay therefore, as it was anſwered to me, ſcrupling, whether he ſhould beſt call the Lords day (for that name did not reliſh him) <hi>Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth</hi> or <hi>Sabboth?</hi> friend, you may <hi>Say-both.</hi> So as for <hi>Sack</hi> and <hi>Pſalms,</hi> ſing not the 119 Pſalm, for that is too long a conſcience, unleſſe thou art arreſted for the Hebrew Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet.
Nor drink a Runlet of Sack, unleſſe thy grief be ſo bigge, that thou muſt venter to break thy belly, or thy heart will break.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:118016:27"/>
The <hi>wiſeſt of Kings</hi> allowed Sack to a ſad heart, even to a very plentifull doſe, for he adviſes to drink untill <hi>a man forget his ſorrow,</hi> which will hardly be done by a halfe pint.</p>
                  <p>A little wine is preſcribed in the perſon of <hi>Timothy</hi> to the whole Clergy, ſo that wine taken in a <hi>moderate way</hi> (not ſo <hi>uberiouſly</hi> as to quarrells, talking of Divinity beyond our capacity, or going into the houſes of the women in the ſtreets)
is <hi>Canonicall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pſalmes are as <hi>authentick</hi> by the practiſe of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> who by that rare Church Muſick (for they knew not <hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Sternhold</hi>) ſung themſelves out of the Priſon, &amp; the Priſon into a <hi>Church,</hi> which the ſinging Pſalmes of our daies do not bring about. But this younger Siſter of ſingle vowes hath ſung out that elder of Inſtruments. <hi>So</hi> that to ſing Pſalmes with <hi>Paul</hi> and his <hi>Brother S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>las</hi> is not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any Priſoners now, thoſe extraordinary gifts ceaſing with their perſons, and but for a time reſiding on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for the time came when <hi>Paul</hi> under the perſecution of <hi>Nero</hi> ſung his own Dirge, and ſo to execution.</p>
                  <p>To conclude to my fellow-Priſoners, of <hi>Pſalmes</hi> you may have plenty, uſe more of them, of <hi>Sack</hi> you ſeldome have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, uſe leſſe; but of every lift of the hand to the head, have an <hi>I lift my heart to thee,</hi> and it is well enough: When you are in the midſt of your mirth, forget not that you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to ſit down by the <hi>waters of Babylon;</hi> and if you would have leſſe of <hi>Meribah,</hi> drink leſſe of the <hi>Merum:</hi> But drink ſome, ſomething proportionable to the allay of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, for fear your turning wholly <hi>Rechabites</hi> (refuſers of the <hi>Creature-comfort</hi>) ſhould lapſe into <hi>Ichabods,</hi> and die the ſonnes of deſperate ſorrow and diſconſolation: which <hi>Deus avertat,</hi> and ſo I put an end to theſe <hi>Queries,</hi> would I could as ſoon to your <hi>Ceremonies.</hi>
