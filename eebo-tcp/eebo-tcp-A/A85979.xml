            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

him and all his company, and not leave a man of them
alive. When <hi>Abſalom</hi> and his party heard this, they
generally approved it as the better way, and preferd
<hi>Huſhai's</hi> counſell before <hi>Ahithophels; Abſalom and all
Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> And in the words which I have read, the
reaſon is rendred of this their unanimous approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it; <hi>For the Lord determined to defeat the good
counſell of Ahithophel that he might bring evill upon Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom.</hi>
And thus yee ſee the occaſion and coherence
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113220:5"/>
and ſumme of the words; They hold forth unto us
two things ſpecially; Firſt, Gods action; Secondly,
Gods intention: His act was the defeating of <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thophels</hi>
counſell; his intention was to bring evill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Abſalom:</hi> the one made way for the other; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the intention ſoone followed execution, he did
bring evill upon him and his partakers. That which
is tranſlated, <hi>determined,</hi> is in the Originall, <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi>
and ſo in the Greek, when it is ſaid, <hi>his good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,</hi>
the meaning is not that it was ſo morally, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively,
it was wiſe counſell and conduced to his
ends and <hi>Abſaloms,</hi> and it had been good for <hi>Abſalom</hi>
to have followed that counſell. When he ſaith <hi>evill,</hi>
he meaneth deſtructive evill: in the Greek they read,

of the words for the preſent.</p>
            <p>From the connexion of theſe words with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
wee may learne that there is nothing in man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent,
neither his judgement nor his affections,
but there is a ſecret divine operative power that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verruleth
all ſorts of men, and turneth their minds
this way and that way, as God ſeeth good to turne
them in mercy or in judgement to themſelves or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Here are two Counſellors the one againſt the
other, and at the firſt <hi>Ahithophels</hi> counſell was liked,
and after <hi>Huſhai</hi> had ſpoken, it was diſliked, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
and <hi>Huſhai's</hi> counſell was preferd before, <hi>for
the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> A place parallel to this wee have,

that it ſhall not be in the power of men or Devils to
croſſe him in any thing, but his will ſhall be done and
not theirs, and his counſell ſhall ſtand at all times,
maugre all their preſumption. But here a queſtion
will be about ſin and error, whether this do not make
God the author of that. I anſwer, no; he is not the
Author, but the Ordinator, or he that ordereth ſin,

none to doe evill, but reſtraineth many; he withheld
<hi>Ahimelech</hi> that he ſhould not ſin againſt him;<note place="margin">Gen. 20. 6.</note> and he
keepeth back his ſervants from preſumptuous ſins;
he reſtrain'd <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren when they would have

kild <hi>Job;</hi> and having ſuffered evill to be done, he
draweth good out of evill, and often turneth even the

<hi>David</hi> was right ſerv'd, when he was puniſhed in the

For the uſe of this point: firſt, it ſerveth for the
confutation of ſome errors; I will name but two;
firſt, of thoſe that deny the divine providence, as if
God minded not the things below;<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 29.</note> theſe erre, not
knowing the Scriptures, nor the power and wiſdome
of God; they abundantly declare, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo high that is above it,<note place="margin">Pſal. 113.</note> nor any thing ſo low
that is beneath it;<note place="margin">Ludibria &amp; joci naturae.</note> that great Creator thinketh it not
below his divine Majeſty to move all things as he
doth;<note place="margin">Scal. in exerc.</note> and it is a vaine thing to thinke that it is any
trouble to him, as it would be to men; as he created
all things without any ſervile labour, or any labour,
onely by his Word;<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 3.</note> ſo he upholdeth all things by
the word of his power; and being an univerſall Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and omnipotent, it is as eaſie to him to rule all the
world as one man, and to diſpoſe of all things, as it
was to create them, and by the ſame wiſdome that he
did the one, he doth the other.</p>
            <p>The other error touching <hi>free will,</hi> tendeth to lift
up nature and the vain heart of man, as if it were in
the power of men to repent, and beleeve, and ſpeake

            <p>Secondly, Obſerve what humane wiſdome is, and

even civill and worldly wiſdome, is the gift of God,
which he hath given unto the ſons of men, and is of

need of a great deale of wiſdome to finde out the
truth: and to doe Juſtice in warre it is neceſſary;
therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Pro. 20. 18.</note>

of a great deale of arrogancy in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, When there was an inceſtuous perſon
in <hi>Corinth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.</note> that had his Fathers wife, the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
had him not before a Juſtice to have him impriſond
or otherwiſe puniſhed by the Magiſtrate, but they
informed the holy Apoſtle of him, and he tooke or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that he ſhould be cenſur'd by the Church, that he
might be brought to repentance, and ſaved. And
Chriſt, <hi>in whom were all treaſures of wiſdome,</hi> was for
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> and would have him to have all that was due
unto him; but in caſe of treſpaſſe between brother
and brother, after graduall admonition, he ſaith, <hi>Tell
the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if he will not beare the Church, let him
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113220:10"/>
be unto thee as a Publican, and an heathen.</hi> Where by
<hi>Church,</hi> cannot be meant the <hi>Sanedrin,</hi> greater or leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer;
for thoſe Councels conſiſted of unbeleeving
men, which refuſed Chriſt the Head of the Church,
and perſecuted his members; and it is not likely
that he would have Chriſtians to tell one anothers
faults to unbeleevers, and ſo expoſe themſelves to
deriſion and abuſes; and ſure he would not have them
accounted as heathen, and no Church-members,
that would not heare ſuch a Councell. The name of
<hi>Church</hi> is appropriated to Chriſtian Congregations
throughout the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles; and neither
one Juſtice or the whole Bench is ever called <hi>the
Church</hi> in the Scripture. And compare that place in
<hi>Mat.</hi> 18. with that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 25. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 58.
and there will appeare a manifeſt difference between
civill Officers and Church-Officers. In <hi>Luke,</hi> the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
Magiſtrate is called <hi>the Magiſtrate;</hi> in both pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>the Judge;</hi> and he ſpeaketh of his Officer, and of
the priſon, the place of puniſhment for malefactors,
plainly putting a difference between thoſe Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of the Common-wealth, and Church-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>
            <p>Compare place with place, and conſider; for our
part, we give unto the civill Magiſtrate, as much as
the word of God giveth them, and if any give more,
the more ſhame for them, there is more flattery than
honeſty in it; for my own part, I had rather be under
government, than put to governe: if I did not ſpeake
as I think, I durſt not ſpeake it in this place. My rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is becauſe of the burden, and the account to be
given to Chriſt for miſcariages, for every Steward
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113220:10"/>
muſt give account of his ſtewardſhip; the civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
of his,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 17.</note> and Church-governours of theirs;
and if the ſame men will take both temporall and
ſpirituall government upon them, they will have
ſuch an account to make in that day, as few are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of for the preſent. Therefore let all be adviſed
what they doe, and take heed how they leane to the
wiſdome of naturall men, what parts ſo ever they
have: in things of this nature rather hearken to thoſe
that are religiouſly wiſe, and judicious, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious;
ſo Chriſt ſhall have his right, and the civill
Magiſtrate ſhall have no wrong, but power and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
though without trenching upon the Churches
right, and God be glorified, and many treſpaſſers
ſhall be brought to repentance, and their ſpirits ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the day of the Lord Jeſus, which was that
which the holy Apoſtle aymed at in all Church-cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and which we ought all to ayme at, in the feare
of God. And thus much touching the act of God in
defeating the good counſell of <hi>Ahithophel,</hi> the great
Politician of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I come to the proceſſe of the judgement
againſt <hi>Abſalom,</hi> a queſtion may be touching that
which <hi>Huſhai</hi> did, whether it were lawfull or no.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, it was a military ſtratageme, and he had
inſtruction from <hi>David</hi> to doe what he did.<note place="margin">Judg. 20.</note> And in

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113220:11"/>
               <hi>Huſhai</hi> was to deale with, it was no time for plain
dealing: not that it is lawfull for men in warre to
ſay and doe any thing: there are certain cautions to
be obſerved.</p>

There muſt be reſpect had to Honour and Honeſty.
There is no compariſon between that which <hi>Ahitho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel</hi>
did, and that which <hi>Huſhai</hi> did: there was cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but honeſt cunning; for it was in a good cauſe,
and for the publick good: it was to ſave <hi>David</hi> and
the godly partie with him, and he ſhewed fidelity to
his friend that confided in him. Let there be a faire
interpretation of his words, and a favourable judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
given of his doings, and that which <hi>Huſhai</hi> did,
is rather imitable than culpable, and may be done in
the like caſe without offence to God; and it may be
obſerved in the text, that God owned that which he
did, as his act and deed; had any ſerv'd <hi>David</hi> as <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhai</hi>
did <hi>Abſalom,</hi> it had been wicked: the wicked may
not doe that to the righteous, which the righteous
may do to them:<note place="margin">Pſal. 109.</note> the righteous may pray againſt the

the righteous may and ought to deſpiſe the wicked,<note place="margin">Pſal 15. 4.</note>
but the wicked may not deſpiſe the righteous:<note place="margin">Pſal. 13. 4.</note> the
righteous may hate the wicked, as <hi>David</hi> did, but the
wicked cannot hate the righteous without ſin: it is

               <hi>they that hate the righteous ſhall be deſolate;</hi> it is
never ſaid, <hi>they that hate the wicked ſhall be deſolate:</hi> a

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 105. 14.</note>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:113220:11"/>
               <hi>and to doe his Prophets no harme, and he reproved
Kings for their ſakes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zach. 2. 8.</note> he that toucheth the righteous,
<hi>toucheth the apple of his eye:</hi> to thoſe that ſpeak evill of
them,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 5.</note> it is threatned that they ſhall give account at
the day of judgement. God would have them know
that he puts a difference between the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and
<hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 11. 7.</note> and he would have all to know that he putteth
a difference between the righteous and the wicked;<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 16, 17.</note>
therefore we are to judge the beſt of that which <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhai</hi>
did for the righteous againſt the wicked, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
juſtifie it, than condemne it.</p>
            <p>I come now to the end for which the Lord defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the counſell of <hi>Ahithophel,</hi> that is, <hi>that he might

            <p>I might hence deliver, That <hi>God will ſurely bring
evill upon thoſe that doe evill,</hi> but then I ſhould enter
into a large field, and now I have not time to expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
ſo much; I ſhall therefore keepe me to that
which is punctually pertinent to the Text, and to the
preſent occaſion: and the point is this; That <hi>God
will finde a time and way to bring evill upon thoſe that
riſe up againſt the righteous, and are the authors and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors
of an unjuſt war, and that without reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
Abſalom</hi> for birth, was the ſon of a King, and
one of the beſt Kings that ever reign'd; for perſon,
he was extraordinary; in all <hi>Iſrael</hi> there was none to
be ſo much praiſed as <hi>Abſalom</hi> for beautie, from the
ſole of his foot, even to the crowne of his head, there
was no blemiſh in him;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 14. 25.</note> for his attendance, it was
Prince like, he had chariots and horſes, and fifty men
to run before him; for fair carriage and winning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113220:12"/>
he exceeded other Princes, to ingratiate
himſelf with the people, ſo as he was the Favourite
of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> but aſpiring to be King before his time,
and to drive his wicked deſigne, raiſing an unjuſt war
in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God determined to bring evill upon him,
and did it; coming forth to battle againſt <hi>David</hi> in
his own perſon, God ſo ordering it, that riding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
an Oke, his head light within a thick bough, ſo
as he could not get it out again, and the beaſt he rode
on going away, he hung between heaven and earth,
till <hi>Davids</hi> ſervants came and ſmote him dead; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the judgement of God upon him for his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe;
the tree caught him, the Mule left him,
<hi>Joab</hi> darted him, the young men ſlew him, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
earth't him, and there lay <hi>Abſalom, the young man
Abſalom,</hi> his Highneſs beautifull <hi>Abſalom,</hi> in a deep
pit, with a great heap of ſtones caſt upon it. <hi>Ahitho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel</hi>
was his Counſellor, and fomented the war, to
make way for that which he intended againſt <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom;</hi>
God defeated his counſell, which <hi>Ahithophel</hi> ſo
took to heart, that thereupon he went home and
hanged himſelf, and there lay <hi>Ahithophel,</hi> with a hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
about his neck. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that took part with
<hi>Abſalom</hi> were routed and ſlaine, and there lay 20000
of them dead corpſes: the ſword devoured them,
and the wood devoured more than the ſword; and
though <hi>Amaſa</hi> eſcaped in the battell, and was after
ſpared through <hi>Davids</hi> clemency, yet he was ſoone
cut off by the deadly hand of <hi>Joab,</hi> who ſmote him
under the fifth rib, and ſhed out his bowels on the
ground, and there lay the Generall. <hi>Sheba</hi> alſo after
this being ſeditious, and rebelling againſt <hi>David,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:113220:12"/>
they ſoone took from him his head, and caſt it over
the wall. <hi>Saul</hi> riſing up againſt him unjuſtly, when
he was his ſervant, and purſuing him without cauſe,
he came to an ill end, and <hi>Doeg</hi> and other of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

            <p>Not to ſpeak of heathen Kings and Armies that
warred againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and fell before them, of which
yee may read frequently in the Scripture, it came
thus to thoſe that cauſed civill warres in <hi>Iſrael,</hi>

and rather take armes againſt all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> than
deliver thoſe wicked men, that Juſtice might be done
upon them, and evill taken away, but they paid deare
for it in the end, it coſt many thouſands of them

off through the juſt judgement of God upon them,<note place="margin">Chap. 21. 3. 6.</note>
in ſo much as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> bewaild the breach. <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>

his time,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 13.</note> though he had the ods by far for number of
men, 800000 againſt 400000, he was overthrowne,
and it is juſt with God that it ſhould be ſo:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe of their unthankfulneſſe to him,
when they are not content with their eſtate, but ſeek
to advance it by unlawfull meanes, and the better
their condition, the greater their ingratitude. <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thophel</hi>
lived well enough under <hi>David,</hi> in great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme,
and could not ſerve a better Maſter. <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi>
lived like a Prince, &amp; his Father was at firſt but a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113220:13"/>
Shepheard that follow'd the Ewes great with young,
and yet he was not content, but would be greater by
violence. And as no Son had a more indulgent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo no people had a better King than <hi>David;
He fed them according to the integritie of his heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 78. 72.</note> 
               <hi>and

it was execrable ingratitude in them all to riſe
up againſt him, and they were worthy to ſuffer all
they ſuffered, and more; and ſo others that take the
ſword without a juſt cauſe and calling.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Pſal. 146. 8.</note> The <hi>Lord loveth the righteous,</hi> and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged

            <p>Thirdly, War is of all evils of this life the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt;
the firſt of thoſe foure judgements mention'd,
in <hi>Ezekiel:</hi>

               <hi>The great evill:</hi> experience ſheweth

is too much for them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Their fall and deſtruction is furthered
by the prayers of the righteous, that call upon God
in their trouble,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 35.</note> who will ariſe in due ſeaſon, and

but the lot of miſ-fortune (ſo he expreſſeth it) light

God is the ſame that he was, and loveth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and hateth iniquitie as much as ever he did;
he is the Lord of hoſts, and the God to whom ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance

all men according to their workes.</p>
            <p>The adverſary party ſay, they are for the King.</p>

            <p>Secondly, If any be for the King in a way for his

with what comfort can they help the ungodly, and
ſuch as ſeek the extirpation of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

they doe as they would have them, when they fight
againſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and againſt the moſt zealous <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants:</hi>
but their Countrey is little beholding to

Church, for any ſervice they have done to him, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

            <p>But many will ſay, they ſtand for the <hi>Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Book,</hi> and they will fight for that as long as they
can ſtand on their legges. A reſolution fitter for the
vulgar <hi>Welch,</hi> than for underſtanding <hi>Engliſhmen;</hi>
for that book was never of Gods making, and no wiſe
man will venture his life, and ſhed his bloud, for any
book made by man, were it never ſo good, for he can
look for no reward of God for it; therefore though
ſome that be wiſe may talke for it, yet it is folly to
fight for it. But it hath been often ſaid, <hi>Take away
the Common Prayer Book, take away our Religion.</hi> Nay,
our Religion is in the Bible, there is our God, and
our Chriſt, and our faith, &amp; our Creed in all points.
The whole Bible was S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

<hi>Pſalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and his prayers, and the Lords
Prayer, and other prayers, by which wee may learne
to pray; we have ſtill the Lords ſongs, the ſongs of
<hi>Sion,</hi> ſung by many with grace in their hearts, <hi>making
melody to the Lord,</hi> though without Organs; there we
have all the Commandements, though they be not
read ſo often as they have been; but when they were
ordinarily read, were they better kept? Were the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
the ſeventh, the fourth, better kept then in
<hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> then they are now? Sure I hope, as ſome
other Commandements, ſo the Sabbath is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
kept now. Our Court-Prelates made the King
Lord of the Sabbath, and themſelves Lords of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule:
Compelling Parents, and Maſters, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and Magiſtrates, to ſuffer their ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

dance, if they had a mind to it, and to prophane a

Gods Prerogative: God muſt ſtand to their courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
how much of the day he muſt have: <hi>had it not been

that were for the book of ſports, would not indure

and that is the old way; that which they call the new

Chriſt,<note place="margin">Gov. without Croſſe and Surpleſſe.</note> they had no ſet forme of prayer; they buried
without the book, and baptized, and adminiſtred the
Lords Supper, and prayd and gave thankes without
it; ſo as the alterations are for the better, and none
have juſt cauſe to clamor againſt them, much leſſe to
fight.</p>
            <p>Though there be leſſe painting, there is more light;
though there be leſſe ceremony, there is more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
though there be leſſe ſuperſtition, there is

therefore be patient and content. Beloved, it is <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
Religion that we contend for,<note place="margin">Pſal. 110. 1.</note> &amp; <hi>Davids</hi> Lord,
even the Lord Jeſus, the Son of <hi>David,</hi> that he may

ſide not with them, but rather help the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113220:17"/>
and to returne to his Parliament, and ſit there in

There was a good Motto written over the gates at

<hi>Suavis victoria, amor populi,</hi> the ſweet victory is
the love of the people; to win that, then come and
welcome, the ſooner, the better. If a King will come
like a King, with royall attendance, he will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
with all love and joy, and honour will be done
unto him by all ſorts; but if they perſwade him to
come like an Enemy, with martiall attendance, with
wicked company, skilfull and ready to plunder and
to deſtroy, ſo as good people muſt ſtand to their
mercy, that have no mercy; other Cities will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
as one did in that caſe;<note place="margin">Con:</note> 
               <hi>Wee will rather live Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
than die ſlaves.</hi> Pray for his Majeſtie, that his
heart may be turned the right way, for his own good,
and the Publick. Let thoſe that have miſ-led him,
and animated him to proceed in this war, beware leſt
evill purſue them till they periſh. Let the young
<hi>Germane</hi> Princes beware, who have rewarded evill
for good unto this Nation. Let all that have been
active againſt the righteous in a hoſtile way, be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the examples in this Text,<note place="margin">Ahithophel.</note> and Story. Behold
the man that made not the Lord his ſtrength, but
truſted to his own wiſdome, and the arme of fleſh,
his counſell being defeated, he went home and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf.<note place="margin">Abſalom.</note> Behold the man that was proud of his
hair, and beauty, and favour, and friends, and exalted
himſelf, and cauſed an unjuſt war, without any reſpect
of his perſon, he was caſt in and buried in a pit. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the men that took part with the ungodly againſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:113220:18"/>
the righteous, and ſought to ſhed innocent bloud,
they were beaten, and periſhed by the ſword: even ſo
let all the enemies of the King and Parliament be as
that young man <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and that old Fox <hi>Ahitho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel,</hi>
and thoſe infatuated <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that followed
them; but let thoſe that are found faithfull to God,
and their Countrey,<note place="margin">Judg. 5. 31.</note> 
               <hi>be as the Sun when he goeth forth

            </p>
            <p>Now it is obſervable, that that which God did to
<hi>Ahithophel,</hi> and ſo conſequently to <hi>Abſalom,</hi> was the
effect of <hi>Davids</hi> prayer and requeſt to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15. 31.</note> 
               <hi>O Lord, I pray thee, turne the counſell of

he defeated his counſell. The point hence is this,
<hi>That prayer with the uſe of the means, is prevalent againſt
thoſe that riſe up againſt the righteous.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 18. 2.</note> 
               <hi>David</hi> us'd the

victorious, and won much by making no delay, but
purſuing his conqueſts; but withall, <hi>David</hi> pray'd,
and thereby prevailed mightily, as we ſee, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
of God a great matter. Three circumſtances
illuſtrate the work of God mention'd in the Text.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That he defeated <hi>Ahithophel,</hi> famous <hi>Ahitho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel,</hi>
that was ſo renowned for his policy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That he defeated the <hi>good counſell</hi> of

               <hi>Moſes crying to the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 14. 15.</note> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſaw the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

the Iſraelites prevail'd againſt Amalek.</hi> When a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

               <hi>and the Lord ſmote the Aethiopians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

When multitudes came againſt <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chro. 20. 3.</note> 
               <hi>he feared
and ſet himſelf to ſeeke the Lord, and proclaim'd a faſt:</hi>
As a man he feared, as a godly man he ſought the
Lord, as a godly King he proclaim'd a faſt, and his
enemies were miraculouſly overthrowne. When
the mightie Hoſte of <hi>Senacherib</hi> came againſt <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time, he ſent to the Prophet <hi>Iſaijah,
To lift up a prayer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 19. 4, 5</note> and he prayed and made his ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to the Lord, and in the morning foureſcore
and five thouſand were all dead corpſes, being ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by an Angel of the Lord. Thus the righteous
have prevailed mightily againſt their enemies by
prayer to God.</p>
            <p>The reaſon is,<note place="margin">Zach. 2. 8.</note> the Lord is their God, and they
are deare unto him, and he hath undertaken their
protection,<note place="margin">Exod. 23. 22.</note> and to be an enemy unto their enemies,
and he hath ſet them this courſe to call upon him,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 15.</note>
and to ſeek his face in their trouble, and it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
with promiſe:<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 6.</note> and he hath ſaid, <hi>He will
not fail them, nor forſake them;</hi> and he the rather hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them,<note place="margin">John 8. 47.</note> becauſe they heare him, and will glorifie
him for that he doth for them,<note place="margin">Pſal. 140. 6.</note> being ſenſible of his
mercy, and of their own unworthineſſe.</p>
            <p>This ſheweth the happie priviledge that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
have above others.<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> 
               <hi>The prayer of the righteous
availeth much,</hi>
               <note place="margin">James 5. 15.</note> 
               <hi>if it be fervent;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 15. 8.</note> yea, <hi>the prayer of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
is his delight.</hi> It is not ſo with the wicked,
when they pray and cry to God,<note place="margin">Pro. 15. 29.</note> the Lord is far from
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:113220:19"/>
the wicked.<note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 41.</note> 
               <hi>Davids</hi> enemies <hi>cryed, but there was none
to ſave them, even to the Lord; but he anſwer'd them not;</hi>
they are in no ſuch eſteeme with God, they have no
ſuch intereſt in him,<note place="margin">Prov. 28. 9.</note> they will not heare him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he abhorreth their prayers,<note place="margin">Zach. 7. 11.</note> and will not heare
them;<note place="margin">Jer. 14. 12.</note> no, <hi>when they faſt, he will not heare their cry.</hi>
Therefore godly men have this way a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of their enemies, though their outward ſtrength
be much ſhort of theirs.</p>
            <p>When <hi>David</hi> went out againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 17.</note> it was
thought a bold adventure, conſidering the diſparitie
between thoſe two for bulk of body, but calling on
the name of the Lord, and truſting in him, he ſoone
laid the gyant along.<note place="margin">Pſal. 57. 1.</note> When <hi>Saul</hi> purſued him, he
prayd unto the Lord, and made him his refuge, and
his enemy had no power to do him hurt; when he
was neere unto him,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 23. 27, 28.</note> and ready to ſurprize him, <hi>he
was taken off,</hi> through the providence of God, by
newes that the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> invaded the Land, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
from purſuing after <hi>David.</hi> When <hi>Abſalom</hi>
prepared a great Army againſt him, he prayed and
prevailed. <hi>Ahithophel</hi> looked upon <hi>Davids</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as a weak company, and undertaketh with twelve
thouſand to vanquiſh him: but the man that was ſo
confident, becauſe of the ſtrength of the enemy, and
the weakneſſe of <hi>David,</hi> never thought what power
<hi>David</hi> had with God by prayer; but behold, though
his Army was weak, his prayer was ſtrong, and God
hearing his prayer, wrought for him, and defeated
his enemy. And it is ſaid of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> that being in
the field,<note place="margin">Vbi eſt Deus Theodoſij?</note> &amp; having the worſt, he lighted off his horſe,
and kneeled downe and ſaid, <hi>Where is the God of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius?</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:113220:19"/>
And after that his enemy fell before him;
his prayer was ſhort, but fervent, and faithfull.
This maketh much for the comfort and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all the Lords ſervants, that in theſe times
follow <hi>Davids</hi> way; it is a way very prevalent for
defence and offence. There is the more comfort in
the preſent example, becauſe he prayd &amp; ſped thus,
after he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted an atrocious ſin in the matter
of <hi>Vriah:</hi> the fact was ſoule, and the aggravation of
it may be taken from the Parable of <hi>Nathan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.</note> and the
ſentence that proceeded out of the mouth of <hi>David</hi>
himſelf againſt himſelf, little thinking then that he
had been the man that had done ſo wickedly againſt
ſo honeſt a ſervant as <hi>Vriah</hi> was. When I think of his
killing that man, it putteth into my mind <hi>Alexanders</hi>
killing of <hi>Caliſthenes,</hi> and of his words to one that
magnified his Conqueſts,<note place="margin">Sen: Nat. q. l. 6. c. 23.</note> He ſlew, ſaith he, many
thouſands of the <hi>Perſians;</hi> and <hi>Caliſthenes,</hi> ſaith the
opponent: and ſaying further, He killed <hi>Darius</hi> that
had a great Kingdome; and <hi>Caliſthenes,</hi> ſaid he that
anſwered him. And again, ſaying, He conquered all
from the Ocean, and exceedingly inlarged his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
the opponent ſtill anſwereth, but he kild <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſthenes.</hi>
So if one would magnifie <hi>David</hi> for his pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and zeale for the houſe of God, and for his valour
and exploits; ſome may anſwer as that opponent did,
and object his killing <hi>Vriah:</hi> He ſlew <hi>Goliah,</hi> that
Monſter, that was ſuch a terror to the Army of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el;</hi>
and <hi>Vriah,</hi> may an opponent ſay: He kill'd many
<hi>Philiſtims,</hi> that they ſung, <hi>Saul his thouſand, and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
his ten thouſand;</hi> and <hi>Vriah,</hi> may he ſay; and if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his victories he alledged, tending to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:113220:20"/>
this might ſtill be oppoſed, yea but he kill'd
his ſervant <hi>Vriah</hi> the <hi>Hittite:</hi> yet notwithſtanding
the atrocity of the fact, and all the anger about it,
and all the threatning of him and his houſhold, in
his adverſitie he cryed to God when his enemies roſe
up againſt him, and his prayer was heard. At his lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end,<note place="margin">1 King. 1. 15.</note> he could ſay, that <hi>the Lord had redeemed his
ſoule out of all adverſitie.</hi> This much illuſtrateth the
grace of God, and may ſtrengthen our conſolation
in theſe times. Surely there is hope for <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland,</hi> wee have had and have ſo many praying
dayes, and have ſo many praying men, praying Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
praying Souldiers, praying Parliament
men, a praying Aſſembly, and other praying Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and praying people, and we have had comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
experience of the good effects &amp; events of our
prayers, ſpecially after our extraordinary Faſts.
After that which was kept before the battell at <hi>Naſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi>
when the Armies were to be ingaged, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
lay at ſtake, and wee were in diſtreſſe and feare,
wee ſought the Lord, and he heard us, and wee had a
great deliverance, and a glorious victory; and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
after when our Army marched towards <hi>Taunton,</hi>
then ſtrongly beſieged, and were to ingage againe,
wee prayed, and the Lord gave a gracious returne to
our ſupplications; the good people in thoſe parts
were relieved by our men, and a formidable Army
of the enemy was routed. Wee have ſundry times
ſeene the ſalvation of God, when there have been
failings on our part, and great advantages on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, and when we have been in a low condition,
and the enemies in the height of their ſtrength and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:113220:20"/>
confidence, the Lord of Hoſts hath appeared for us,
the God of our ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath favour'd our righteous
cauſe, and brought out adverſaries to confuſion.
After the extraordinary Faſt kept for <hi>Scotland,</hi> wee
ſoone had intelligence of a great overthrow given to
<hi>Montroſſe,</hi> God did great things for our brethren of
that Nation, whereof we have cauſe to rejoyce; they
are our brethren and confederates of the ſame faith
with us, and have deſerved our prayers and good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
for them, by their prayers for us in our
trouble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the great ſervice they have done to this
Kingdome, and to the Church of God amongſt us;
they ſhewed zeale and courage, and quicken'd us
when wee in a manner had loſt our ſelves, and there
was little life in us; they have been inſtruments to
promote the Reformation which wee have; that
Church was famous in the Reformed Churches, for
doctrine, worſhip, government, and diſcipline, when
ours was in an ill name for corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; that Church
had the honour to be in the Antitype to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi>

and they have had the happineſſe to keep their
Church without hereſie, or ſectaries, for above fifty
yeares; and <hi>greater love than this hath no man, than to
lay downe his life for his friend,</hi> and that they have done
for us; and many thouſands in and about the Citie,
that now ſit warme, might have <unclear>ſit</unclear> cold, had it not
been for <unclear>them</unclear> and had they been overthrown, their
fall, would have been our fall; therefore wee have
cauſe to pray for them, and to rejoyce that God of
his <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> hath heard their prayers and ours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:113220:21"/>
It will be ſaid by our adverſaries, that they pray
too, and why may not they be heard as well as wee?</p>
            <p>It is true, they pray, ſome of them to our Lord,
and ſome to our Lady, as they call her: ſome ſay,
<hi>Our Father,</hi> ſome, <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> and <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> and
ſome make uſe of their Beads and Crucifixes when
they pray; and many revile and curſe the godly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
yea they curſe them bitterly that have come out
to help the Lord againſt the mightie: the generalitie
of them read ſomewhat in a book, but how many of
them pray in the Spirit? Certainly, there is great
difference between their praying, and the praying on
this ſide, and there is great difference between the
men that performe prayer on both ſides, and thoſe
they pray for: and were their praying in ſome reſpect
better than it is, their cauſe is nought, and their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are too like the <hi>Abſalomian</hi> Army to proſper;
they are riſen up againſt the righteous, and help the
ungodly to deſtroy godly men, and are bloudy-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as they were, and being like them in other vices,
they will be like <hi>Abſalom</hi> to a hair, as I may ſay, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
long hair, as he did, not regarding what S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi>
ſaith,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.</note> that <hi>it is a ſhame for a man to weare long hair;</hi>
making it a ſhame rather not to weare it long. In
ſome reſpects many of them are worſe than the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalomians,</hi>
namely, for ſuperſtition and damme-ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
therefore God will not heare them,<note place="margin">J<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r, 14. 12.</note> no when
they faſt, he will not heare their cry. To us, there is
more ground of hope for good, becauſe there is
more of <hi>David</hi> in our Commanders, and many of
our Officers and Souldiers, and in thoſe that have
ſent them forth for the defence of our Religion,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:113220:21"/>
and Lawes, and Liberties, and of thoſe that ſtand for
them, and wee have ſeene that God hath heard our
prayers, and proſperd our Armies in all parts of the
Kingdome: Wee have had great incouragement
from heaven, and what if we have not obtained yet a
ceſſation of the warre, no more did <hi>David</hi> in the
war between the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> and him? though he
prayd at firſt and conſtantly,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 3. 1.</note> yet <hi>there was long warre
between the houſe of Saul and the houſe of David;</hi> but he
obtained, that he grew ſtronger and ſtronger, and the
houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> weaker and weaker; and the like wee
have obtained to our comfort, through Gods great
mercy, notwithſtanding our ſinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> One circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
more we are to take notice of, and that is, that
as <hi>David</hi> prevailed ſo with the Lord by his prayer,
after that he had ſinned againſt him,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 13.</note> ſo it was after
his repentance,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> &amp; humble confeſſion of it unto God;
after that he was in <hi>ſtatu quo</hi> with him, upon as good
