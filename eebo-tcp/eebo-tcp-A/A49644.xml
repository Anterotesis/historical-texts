            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Publisher to the Reader.</head>
            <p>MEeting with this <hi>Letter,</hi> I thought it worth the
publishing, as a means (in the <hi>interim</hi> till the
Book it self be Answered) to give the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> and of that Book, some cause
to lessen their great Opinion of him, and it, and the Cause it
maintains. For indeed after that, <hi>Juel, Mornay, Morton,
Potter,</hi> and other of the prime Protestant Controvertists,
had been found so guilty of this Fault of <hi>False Quotations,</hi>
and been so cryed out upon by our (Catholick) Writers for
it, and the Protestant Cause had suffered so much shame and
prejudice by it, who could have expected it in Dr. <hi>Jeremy
Taylor,</hi> a man so Eminent among them for Place, Learning,
and Abilities in Controversie, and who therefore it might
be presumed would not discredit himself, or his Cause, by
Quoting any thing upon Trust, or Varying from his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
either <hi>Words,</hi> or <hi>Sense?</hi> Or though he might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curious
in this kinde, when he wrote onely as a <hi>Private</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
or in a book of <hi>Devotion,</hi> (as <hi>ex. gr.</hi> when in his Book
<hi>Of the Life of Christ,</hi> he tells a story out of S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> and
cites the very Book and Chapter, How <hi>S. Herminigilda
chose to dye rather then she would receive the B. Sacrament from
the hand of an Arrian Bishop:</hi> when many Punies of our
Clergy, nay, many of our ordinary Women could have told
him, that the person there mentioned by S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> was
not <hi>Herminigilda,</hi> a <hi>Woman,</hi> but <hi>Herminigildus,</hi> a <hi>Man,</hi> and
Prince of <hi>Spain:</hi>) Yet in such a Work as this, to which (as
himself saith) <hi>he was appointed by a Synod of the Protestant Irish
Bishops,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Preface.</note> and published with design to Convert all the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
of that Nation; and entertained with that applause
here in <hi>England,</hi> as it hath been already in a short time twice
or thrice Re-printed; who could think but he would have
been most exact in his Quotations? which therefore since
he hath not, but sometimes quoted Books that never were,
or that, in the places quoted, have not any least syllable to
the purpose they are quoted for; and frequently quoted
<pb facs="tcp:30587:3"/>
them in a <hi>Sense</hi> they never dreamt of; yea, and divers times
by adding, curtailing, or otherwise altering them, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted
the very words themselves, (of all which the ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Letter</hi> will give sufficient instances:) What can be said,
or thought of it, but that had it been possible for him to
have upheld his Cause otherwayes, he would never have
used such sinister practices?</p>
            <p>If it be said, that divers of the Exceptions are little mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial;
be it so: but then the least that is, will be a false or
wrested Quotation, and help to shew the insincerity of the
Author.</p>
            <p>If it be said, that divers of them are perhaps but Errors
of his <hi>Pen,</hi> or of the <hi>Press</hi> onely; it may be so: but till they
appear to be so, they are justly charged.</p>
            <p>In fine, if it be said, that many of them are not so much
as pretended to be <hi>False,</hi> but <hi>Wrested</hi> onely; 'tis true: but
then, 1. <hi>These</hi> also will be of avail to my end <hi>as well,</hi> though
not <hi>as much</hi> as those that are <hi>false.</hi> 2. Of <hi>False</hi> Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and where cannot be supposed any Error of his <hi>Pen,</hi> or
the <hi>Press,</hi> there are enow (though all the other had been
omitted in the Letter) to my end; namely, for instance in
some of the chief onely, these six and forty, <hi>viz.</hi> 8. 12. 14.
16. 17. 26<note n="a" place="margin">Pol. Virg.</note> 27.<note n="b" place="margin">Id.</note> 28. 29. 30. 31. 32. 34. 36. 46. 47. 50. 53.

150. 152. 153. 155. 156. If any one therefore shall take
upon him to justifie Dr. <hi>Taylors</hi> Quotations; to save labour
and time, let him in the first place justifie these, or which
six of them he thinks the most justifiable, and try it first in
them, and by their success, let judgement be made of all
the rest. <hi>Vale.</hi>

               <p>1. AGainst unwritten Traditions taught by the Church,

absolutely,<note place="margin">Cont. Hermog.</note> [<hi>I adore the fulness of Scripture; if it be not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
let</hi> Hermogenes <hi>fear the woe that is destin'd to them that
detract from, or adde to it:</hi>] when had he set down the words
sincerely, it would have appear'd, he spake onely of one
point taught by that Heretick painter, not without, but
against express Scripture: <hi>viz.</hi> that God made the World
of some preexisting matter. [<hi>Igitur in principio fecit Deus
coelum &amp; terram.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 1.</note>

God made Heaven and Earth. I adore the fulness of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30587:4"/>
Scripture,</hi> (meaning, of this Text, as to this point) <hi>which
manifests to me both the maker, and the things made. And in
the Gospel, I finde the Word, both the minister and arbiter of
God. But whether all things were made of some subjacent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I never have yet read. Let Hermogenes's shop shew that it
is written: (viz.</hi> his Doctrine, that the World was made of
some matter) <hi>If not written, let him fear that woe, &amp;c.</hi>

saying thus, <hi>[Without doubt it is a most manifest argument of
infidelity, and a most certain sign of pride, to introduce any thing
that is not written, &amp;c.</hi>] Whereas in two of the places quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">De verâ fide.</note> S. <hi>Basil</hi> hath no such words; and in the third, he spake
onely of certain particular Heresies devised by Hereticks,
not without, but against express Scripture, and which S.
<hi>Basil</hi> there confuted, not by Scripture alone, but by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
also. [<hi>Whilst I was to fight against divers factions of

sometimes unwritten, &amp;c. But if our Lord be faithful in all
his words, &amp;c. without doubt it is a most manifest argument of
infidelity, either to detract from the things that are written, or
to introduce any thing that is not written, seeing our Lord hath
said, My sheep, &amp;c. wherefore we also, as heretofore we have
ever had that determined in our mindes, to avoid all voice or
speech contrary to the Doctrine of our Lord,</hi>

                  <hi>so at this time, &amp;c.</hi>]
But in all his discourse, he hath no such words, as the Dr.
quotes for his, [<hi>to adde any thing to the Faith that is not
there found.</hi>]</p>
               <p>3. To the same purpose, he quotes <hi>Theophilus Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ep. Pasch. 2.</note> [<hi>It is the part of a devilish spirit, to think any thing to be
Divine, that is not in Scripture;</hi>] when he spake likewise
onely of a particular Heresie that <hi>Origen</hi> had devised of his
own proud head, against express Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> that Christ
was at one time or other to lose his Kingdom. [<hi>I cannot
know with what temerity,</hi> Origen <hi>feigning such things, and
following, not the authority of Scriptures, but his own error,
&amp;c. But being ignorant, that it is an instinct of a devilish spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
to follow the sophismes of humane mindes,</hi> (which words
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30587:4"/>
the Dr. craftily left out) <hi>and to think any thing Divine,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
Scripturarum authoritatem, <hi>without the Scriptures au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. To the same purpose, he quotes S. <hi>Athanasius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De incarn. Christi.</note> [<hi>The
Catholicks will neither speak nor endure to hear any thing in
Religion, that is a stranger to Scripture, it being,</hi> immodestiae
vecordia, <hi>to speak those things which are not written:</hi>] when
he spake it likewise onely of a particular Heresie, contrary
to Scripture; <hi>viz.</hi> That Christs flesh was consubstantial to
the Godhead. [<hi>If therefore ye be Disciples of the Gospels,
speak not against God iniquity, but walk by the Scriptures.
But if ye will prate things dissonant from the Scripture, why do
ye contend with us, who endure not either to speak or hear any
thing beside what is written. What is therefore the madness of
your immodesty, that ye speak things which are not written, and

the Dr. craftily left out) <hi>as who presume to say, that the
flesh (of Christ) is consubstantial to the Deity?</hi>]</p>
               <p>5. Against our veneration of the Images of Christ,
and his B. Mother, and Heavenly Saints, he quotes <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
[Without all peradventure,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">L. 2. cap. de orig. error.</note>

the Idols of the Heathen Gods: as his whole discourse
afore and after manifests; which it would be too long to
set down.</p>
               <p>6. To the same purpose, and in the same fraudulent

the Christians, not onely shun the Temples, Altars, and Idols of
the Gods, but go more readily to death, lest with any excess or
impiety they should altogether pollute that which they most rightly
believe of God the Creator of all things.</hi>]</p>
               <p>7. Against our giving the Communion in one kinde, he
saith, [<hi>The Primitive Church did Excommunicate them that
did not receive the Sacrament in both kindes,</hi>] and quotes for
it the Canon, <hi>Comperimus:</hi> when the Canon spake not of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30587:5"/>
                  <hi>receiving</hi> the Sacrament by the Communicants, but of the
consummating of the Sacrifice by the Priest; as appears
by the reason given, [<hi>Because the division of one and the same
Mystery (or Sacrifice) cannot be without great Sacriledge:</hi>]
and by the title of the Canon, [<hi>The Priest ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Body of Christ without his Blood.</hi>]</p>
               <p>8. To the same purpose he quotes S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> [<hi>He who
receives the Mystery otherwayes then Christ appointed,</hi> (that is,
saith the Doctor, in one kinde, when he hath appointed it
in two) <hi>is unworthy of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>] where to wrest it to
his purpose, he first corrupts the words, for S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith
not, who <hi>Receives,</hi> but who <hi>Celebrates</hi> it, plainly meaning
the Priest alone: nor doth he say, <hi>otherwayes then Christ
appointed,</hi> but <hi>otherwayes then it was given by him.</hi> 2. He
corrupts the sense, with his ridiculous gloss devised out of
his own brain, without any least colour of ground for it in
the place; nay, S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> gives another reason for it:
[<hi>Quia sine disciplinâ traditionis, &amp; conversationis, qui acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt,
rei sunt, &amp;c. They who come, without the discipline of
tradition, and conversation, are guilty, &amp;c.</hi>

nor did he mean, that he could multiply any new Articles,
or put them into the Creed, that were not alwayes of Faith,
and implicitely at least contained in holy Scripture: as is
manifest, 1. from the reason given by him, [<hi>For in the Creed
are put those things which universally pertain to Christian
Faith:</hi>] which words are fradulently left out by the Doctor.
2. From his express Doctrine, in his <hi>Resolvendum:</hi> [<hi>There

               <p>15. To prove our corrupting the writings of the ancient
Fathers, he saith, <hi>That when not long since we printed</hi> Origen,
<hi>we left out that whole 6. Chap. of S.</hi> John, <hi>and</hi> Origens <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
upon it, and so maim'd the Author, for the same cause,</hi>
that is, because <hi>Origen</hi> argued there against Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
A meer slander; as is manifest by the very Protestant
Editions; for in the Edition of <hi>Basil</hi> by <hi>Froben, Anno</hi> 1545
there was no Commentary at all upon <hi>John:</hi> And in a later
Edition of <hi>Basil,</hi> 1620. his Comment upon <hi>John</hi> is set out
in the same manner as it is in our Catholique Editions, and
no other; <hi>viz.</hi> without any Comment either upon the 5, 6,
or 7. Chap. of that Gospel.</p>
               <p>To the same purpose, he quotes our <hi>Index Expurgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,
in which in S.</hi> Chrysostoms <hi>Works printed at</hi> Basil, <hi>these
words,</hi> [The Church is not built upon the Man, but upon
the Faith,] <hi>are commanded to be blotted out; and these,</hi>
[There is no Merit, but what is given us by Christ.] <hi>And
the like,</hi> he saith, <hi>we have done to S.</hi> Ambrose, <hi>and to S.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,
<hi>and to them all: insomuch that</hi> Ludovicus Saurius <hi>the
Corrector of the Press of</hi> Lyons, <hi>complained of it to</hi> Junius, <hi>that
he was forced to blot out many sayings of S.</hi> Ambrose <hi>in that
Edition of his Works which was printed at</hi> Lions, 1559. <hi>so that
we think it not sufficient, to feign some convenient sense, when
they are opposed in Disputation, but the words which make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us we wholly leave out of our Editions: Nay</hi> (saith he)
<hi>we correct the very Tables or Indexes made by the Printers
or Correctors, &amp;c.</hi> A notorious slander, as appears, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> was not appointed till the
end of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which was in <hi>Anno</hi> 1563.
and therefore that could put no force upon <hi>Saurius</hi> for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30587:6"/>
maiming S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1559. 2. Because the <hi>Index
Expurgatorius</hi> extended not to any Writings or Works of
the Fathers, but onely to the Indices, or marginal Notes,
or other corruptions made by Protestants: as is confessed
by his own Author <hi>Junius,</hi> that published the <hi>Index;</hi> for in
his Preface to that Book, he makes this Objection, [<hi>But
here the Fathers are not purged:</hi>] and answers it, 1. <hi>That
yet by the purging of later Authors, the truth of Doctrine and
History, is in many places expurged. 2. That what they dare
not with the Fathers, they practise upon us,</hi> (Protestant Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Writers) <hi>and with their little forks they thrust out
our Annotations in the Margin, and Sayings in the Indices,
although consonant to the Fathers minde. For example</hi> (saith
<hi>Junius) In the Index of S.</hi> Chrysostom <hi>printed at</hi> Basil, <hi>this
is commanded to be blotted out,</hi> [The Church is not built
upon the Man, but his Faith.] <hi>And likewise this,</hi> [There is
no merit, but what is given us by Christ.]</p>
               <p>17. To the same purpose, he quotes <hi>Sixtus Senensis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 13.</note> as
saying to Pope <hi>Pius V.</hi> [<hi>Expurgari, &amp; emaculari curasti

to the Creed,<note place="margin">Pag. 14. <hi>Part. 2. act.</hi> 6. c. 7.</note> he quotes the Ephesine Canon, [<hi>That it
should not be lawful for any man to publish or compose another
Faith or Creed, then that which was desined by the Nicene
Council, &amp;c.</hi>] when that Canon did not mean, adding Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
to the Faith defined by that Council (for how could
the supreme power binde its own hands, or make that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
for another General Council, which the Council of
<hi>Constantinople</hi> had already done, in adding divers Articles to
the Nicene Creed?) but publishing any Creed repugnant,
by adding, or detracting, to the Nicene.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:30587:7"/>19. To prove that the Council of <hi>Constance</hi> declared
not for the Popes Supremacy,<note place="margin">Pag. 15.</note> he quotes <hi>John Gerson,</hi> as
saying,<note place="margin">De pot. Eccl. Consil. 22.</note> [<hi>That the Council</hi> of Constance <hi>did abate those
heights to which slattery had advanced the Pope: and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Council they spoke such great things of the Pope,
which afterwards moderate men durst not speak:</hi>] whereas he
saith no such words, nor had any meaning against the
Popes Supremacy; for this is all he saith, [<hi>Fallor, si non ante
celebrationem hujus S. Constantiensis Synodi, &amp;c. I am decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
if afore the celebrating of this holy Council of Constance,
this Tradition</hi> (which slattery suggested; <hi>viz.</hi> that the Pope
was supreme Monarch even in Temporals, that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Law, could take away mens rights from them, &amp;c.)
<hi>had not so possessed the mindes of the most, that he that should
have taught the contrary, would have been noted or condemned
of Heretical pravity. Take a sign of this, that after the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
and practice of the same Council, there are found who
fear not to assert openly such things.</hi>]</p>
               <p>20. He puts down these for the words of the Council
of <hi>Trent,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sess. 21. c 4.</note> [<hi>Although the ancient Fathers did give the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
to Infants, yet they did not believe it necessary, &amp;c.</hi>]
whereas the words of the Council are not with any such
Antithesis, but thus onely: [<hi>Nor therefore is antiquity to be
condemned, if sometime they used that custome in some places.
For as those most holy Fathers had a probable cause of their so
doing, according to the condition of that time; so truly, it is
without question to be believed, that they did it with no necessity
of salvation.</hi>]</p>

                  <hi>So it is acknowledged
by our own Durantus, (viz.</hi> That the Fathers of the Primitive
Church made Prayers also, and offered for the Patriarchs,
Apostles, Martyrs, B. Virgin, &amp;c, who never were in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30587:9"/>
Purgatory:) where if he mean likewise (as he must, or it
was impertinently urged) that <hi>Durantus</hi> acknowledges that
they prayed for them as for the rest of the dead; and
namely, <hi>that God would shew them mercy, or pardon them:
Durantus</hi> saith no such thing, but the direct contrary. [<hi>Truly
in</hi> Epiphanius, <hi>and</hi> Cyril, <hi>and the Canon of the Greeks, is
read, that they offered Sacrifice to God, for the Patriarchs,
Apostles, Martyrs, &amp;c. which signifies the same as in our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
[Communicantes, &amp; memoriam venerantes, gloriosae

for the Martyrs, &amp;c.] <hi>it is not understood that we commend
them to God, but we commemorate them for their glory, and
to give God thanks for the glory he hath bestowed on them. ...
The Priest prayes nothing for them, but rather prayes them, that
he may be helped by their prayers, &amp;c.</hi>]</p>

                  <hi>That Pope</hi> John
22. <hi>not onely taught and declared the Doctrine,</hi> (that before
the day of Judgement, the Souls of men are kept in certain

also what others said: for these are <hi>Sixtus Senensis</hi>
his words. [<hi>It is said, that Pope</hi> John 22. <hi>subscribed to their

               <p>33. To prove that S. <hi>Augustin</hi> doubted of Purgatory,<note place="margin">Pag. 30.</note> he

be enquired, and possibly it may be found so, and possibly it may

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30587:9"/>
which S. <hi>Augustin</hi> speaks of Purgatory directly, but of
grief for the loss of temporal good things too much loved,
burning some just men here, and perhaps hereafter too. In
Enchiridion, [<hi>For, this</hi> wood, hay, and straw,<note place="margin">C. 68.</note> 
                  <hi>may not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdly
be interpreted, such affections to secular things, although
lawfully had, as they cannot be lost without grief of minde. But
when this grief burns, if Christ have in the heart place of the
foundation, (that is, that he who is so burnt, had rather want
those things which he so loves, then want Christ) he is saved
through fire. ... For the grief of the lost things which he
loved, burns him, but consumes him not, being guarded by the
stability of the foundation.</hi>

                  <hi>That some such thing</hi> (such a
burning grief for loss of temporal things) <hi>is done, even after
this life, is not incredible; and whether it be so or not, may be
enquired, and either be found, or lie hid, that some faithful
men, are later or sooner saved by a certain Purgatory fire, by
how much they more or less loved perishing goods.</hi>] And much

               <p>36. He saith,<note place="margin">Pag. 33.</note> that <hi>the Greek Church did alwayes dissent
from the Latines in this particular,</hi> (touching Purgatory) <hi>and
in the Council of</hi> Basil, <hi>publisht an Apology directly disappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Romane Doctrine of Purgatory. And that, how after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they were press'd in the Council of</hi> Florence <hi>by Pope</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius,
<hi>and by their necessity, how unwillingly they consented,
how ambiguously they answered, how they protested against ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that half consent put into the Instrument of Union; how
they were yet constrain'd to it by their Chiefs, being obnoxious
to the Pope; how a while after they dissolved that Union, and
to this day refuse to own this Doctrine, are things so notoriously
known, that they need no further declaration.</hi>] All which
things are so notoriously false, as there needs no further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of the falsifying spirit of this Doctor. But for the
other falsities I must wave them, my business at present be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
onely to note his false Quotations: and such are these,
out of the Councils of <hi>Basil</hi> and <hi>Florence.</hi> For as to the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30587:10"/>
Council of <hi>Basil</hi> I have examined it over, and can finde
no such Apology as he speaks of, published by the Greeks
in that Council. And for what he saith of the Council of
<hi>Florence,</hi> there is not onely not one word of it true, but
the direct contrary passed in that Council. In the very first
meeting at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> the Latines proposed the Catholique
Doctrine in writing thus: [<hi>There is a Purgatory,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. Conc. Flor.</note> 
                  <hi>that is, the
Souls of such as dye in Venial sin are purged in the world
present</hi> (meaning temporally, after death, and afore the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
world after the day of judgement) <hi>by fire, the Church
also helping by the Priests prayers; and moreover those Souls
are delivered from pains by Sacrifices, and Alms.</hi> ...] To
which the Greeks, by their Prolocutor, the Bishop of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
instantly answered thus; [<hi>Whatsoever you have said, and
the testimonies of holy men that you have recited, the Greek
Church receives and reads, and there is little difficulty betwixt
us in this point,</hi> (meaning, onely about those words, <hi>by fire:)
but we shall give our answer in writing, &amp;c.</hi>] And ten dayes
after, they gave it, in these words: [<hi>The Italians</hi> (or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans)
<hi>confess</hi> (or believe) <hi>a fire, both in the present world,
and Purgatory by it, and in the world to come, but not Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
but eternal. ... But the Greeks, hold a fire in the world
to come onely, and a temporary punishment of Souls, that is,
that they go into a place dark, and of grief; but that they
are purged, that is, delivered from that dark place and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by Priests Prayers, and Sacrifices, and by Alms, but not by
fire.</hi>] About a fortnight after, the Italians brought their
Proofs for their Doctrine, (touching the purgation by fire)
to which the Greeks delayed to answer. After, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
was removed to <hi>Florence,</hi> and the point of the procession
of the Holy Ghost had been there long debated and
brought to an issue, the Pope called to the Greeks to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
the other points which remained, touching Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the unleavened Bread, Purgatory, the Supremacy of
the Pope, the Addition of <hi>Filioque</hi> to the Nicene Creed,
and the Consecrating of the Eucharist by words depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
The Greeks answered, [<hi>For leavened or unleavened
Bread, let them be indifferent. Touching Purgatory</hi> (meaning
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30587:11"/>
the fire) <hi>we neither divided for that, nor is it necessary; let
there therefore be an Union, and we will treat of that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>]
Afterward the Greeks proposed to treat, about
Consecrating in unleavened Bread, the Popes Supremacy,
and the additament of <hi>Filioque:</hi> But for Purgatory, and
Consecration by Prayer, nothing should be said. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines
answered, there could be no Union, unless those two
controversies were added. The Greek Emperor not yeilding
to it, the Latines proposed, that in the definition should be
only mention of Purgatory; touching the Consecration it
might be transacted <hi>viva voce.</hi> The Pope said, [<hi>we are united
in that for which the division was made,</hi> (meaning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the Holy Ghost) <hi>and is this which hath no harm in
it, an impediment to us? Was not the point of Purgatory often
examined at</hi> Ferrara? <hi>ought it not to be put in the definition, as
a Doctrine of our Church.</hi>] But because the Greek Emperor
said he was willing to hear touching the Primacy of the
Romane Church, and consecrating in unleavened Bread,
those points were debated.</p>
               <p>Afterward, (say the Greek Bishops) <hi>we met at the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,
and examined the Proposals of the Latines, and found
them five, all equal and right:</hi> 1. <hi>Of the Procession.</hi> 2. <hi>Of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened
Bread.</hi> 3. <hi>Of the Popes Primacy.</hi> 4. <hi>Of the Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament.</hi>
5. <hi>Of Purgatory. And we urged mightily the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
saying, we receive all, let an end be determined to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.
What controversie have we touching Purgatory? We
doubted of this, because they said the Saints see God without
any medium, and that the Souls of penitent sinners are purged
by prayers. This thing therefore delayed us; but we embracing
these things also piously, pressed the Emperor, to bring the work</hi>
(of Union) <hi>to an end. But he would not.</hi> Afterward, the
Emperor calling together all the Greek Bishops, the rest of
the Bishops endeavoured to draw the Bishop of <hi>Ephesus</hi>
(who was the onely stickler against the Union) to agree
with them. The Bishop of <hi>Ephesus</hi> argued against the
procession from the Son, and that the Creed needed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
addition, nor application, and many other things, until
it was evening: But I finde not that he argued against
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30587:11"/>
Purgatory. Afterward there was a Congregation appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
of the Greek and Latine Prelates, to draw up the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of the Definition; which being shown to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
he objected against the Title of it, (because in
the name of the Pope alone) and the form of the Article
touching the Popes Supremacy, <hi>Secundum dicta Sanctorum.</hi>
These being amended, the Instrument was agreed on.
Thus far the Records of the Council. By all which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
how notoriously false was all that as the Doctor
here alledged touching the Greek Church denying Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</p>
               <p>37. As a clear testimony of Antiquity,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 34. Ad Demetrian. sect. 16.</note> expresly destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

if he had spoken it absolutely, or of Christians and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
in general; when he spake it of impenitent Pagans
onely: and so the words relate not at all to Purgatory, or
Souls dying in Venial sin, but onely to the Hell of the
damned, and Souls dying out of Christs faith; such as <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrian</hi>
was, to whom he then wrote. [<hi>Hortamur, &amp;c. We

he set them down. [<hi>I know the concussion, and excussion, the

that,</hi> [I am the God of Abraham, &amp;c.] <hi>which afterward
Christ expounded to the less intelligent; so the Church, by the
Spirit of truth, hath explicated some things, which are had
obscure in the holy Scriptures.</hi>]</p>

was not ancient;</hi> when <hi>Henriquez</hi> saith no
such thing.</p>
               <p>48. To prove,<note place="margin">Pag. 38.</note> that in <hi>Peter Lombards</hi> time, Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation
was so far from being an Article of Faith, or a
Catholique Doctrine, <hi>that they did not know whether it were
true or no;</hi> and after <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> had collected the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of the Fathers in that Article,<note place="margin">L. 4. Sent. dist. 11. lit. A.</note> he confess'd, <hi>he could
not tell whether there was any substantial change or no;</hi> he
quotes these words: [<hi>If it be enquired what kinde of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
it is; whether it be formal, or substantial, or of another
kinde, I am not able to define it. Onely I know that it is not
formall; because the same accidents remain, the same colour
and taste. To some it seems to be substantial, saying, that so
the substance is changed into the substance, that it is done essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially.
To which the former authorities seem to consent. But
to this Sentence, others oppose these things: If the substance of
Bread and Wine be substantially converted, &amp;c.</hi>] And saith,
they are a plain demonstration, that in his time, this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
(of Transubstantiation) was new, not the Doctrine
of the Church. Which is a notable falsifying of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
and the Doctor (if he read him) could not chuse but
know he quoted him directly against his meaning. For
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30587:13"/>
there were two Questions: one, whether the substance of
the Elements be converted into the substance of Christs
Body and Blood? and this question alone pertains to what
we believe in the point of Transubstantiation. And this
question <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> had treated of afore, and resolved
positively,<note place="margin">Dist. 9.</note> 1. <hi>That it is undoubtedly to be held, that under
the visible species, the Flesh of Christ which he took of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
and the Blood which he shed for us, is received by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked:</hi>
and the contrary he counted a Heresie. The next
Section,<note place="margin">Dist. 10.</note> he entitles, <hi>De Haeresi aliorum, &amp;c. Of the Heresie
of others, who say that the Body of Christ is not upon the Altar,
but in sign.</hi> And thus he speaks of it: [<hi>There are other,
transcending the madness of the former</hi> (Hereticks,) <hi>who mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
the power of God by the model of natural things, do
more audaciously and dangerously contradict the truth, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that in the Altar, is not the Body or Blood of Christ, nor
the substance of Bread and Wine converted into the substance
of Flesh and Blood: who take occasion of erring, from the words
of truth, whence began the first Heresie</hi> (against this truth)
<hi>among Christs Disciples;</hi> [It is the Spirit that quickens, &amp;c.]
<hi>And they cite those words of S.</hi> Augustin, [Non hoc corpus
quod videtis, &amp;c.] <hi>And there are other sayings also, ministring</hi>
fomitem <hi>to their madness.</hi> [The poor ye have alwayes with
you, but me not.] <hi>These and other</hi> (sayings) <hi>the aforesaid He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
use in maintenance of their Error.</hi>] Then he sets
down his Proofs to the contrary, which were the Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Fathers in that Article: which having set down,
he concludes thus; [<hi>By these, and other more, it is manifest,
that the substance of the Bread is turned into the substance of
the Body, and the substance of the Wine into the substance of
the Blood.</hi>] Having thus dispatched that first question, in
the next Section (which is that which the Doctor quotes)
he comes to a second, which is a meer School nicety, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>manner</hi> of this substantial change; whether it be
formal, or substantial, or of some other kinde? And touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that, he useth the words quoted by the Doctor, [<hi>I am
not able to define it, &amp;c.</hi>] Nay, and even in that too, he
quotes him fraudulently to abuse the Reader. For these
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30587:13"/>
words which he sets down, as <hi>Peter Lombards</hi> argument
against the <hi>modus substantialis,</hi> were onely set down as an
Objection, to which he there gives an answer, which the
Doctor conceals. [<hi>To which may be answered in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
that <hi>the Body of Christ is not said to be made, in that
sense as if the Body which was form'd in the Virgins womb
were form'd again, but because the substance of Bread or Wine,
which afore was not the Body or Blood of Christ, is by the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Word made his Body and Blood.</hi>] And a little after:
[<hi>Therefore after Consecration, there is not the substance of
Bread or wine, although the species of Bread and Wine remain.</hi>]
And to one that should object against this, how this can
be? he answers briefly, [<hi>A mystery of Faith, may</hi> salubriter
<hi>be believed, but may not</hi> salubriter <hi>be searcht into.</hi>]</p>

maintains not, but the contrary; for his first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
there is, [<hi>The substance of Bread and Wine are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into the substance of Christs Body and Blood.</hi>] And in
the very next words, the Doctor himself saith, that <hi>Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
saith, That by reason of the authority of the Church, it is
not to be held.</hi> How then did he hold it? All that he there

which unless he took not the words out of the Decree him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

<list>
                     <item>1. Whereas the Decree recites three Errors, and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
as the causes of it; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The maintaining it
necessary to communicate the people under both kindes;
and the practice of that innovation. 2. The maintaining
that the Eucharist ought to be given, after supper. 3. Or
otherwise to people that were not fasting: [<hi>Whereas in
some</hi> Countreys,<note place="margin">partibus.</note> 
                        <hi>some temerariously presume to assert, that the

                        <note place="margin">passim.</note> 
                        <hi>and do</hi> ordinarily <hi>communicate the Lay
people under the species of wine; also affirm, that the people
ought to be communicated after supper, or otherwise not fasting,
&amp;c.</hi>] He recites it as made against the first onely, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
the other two fraudulently, under a line of pricks.
[<hi>Whereas in certain parts of the world, some temerariously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that the Christian people ought to receive the Sacrament
of the Eucharist under both kindes of Bread and Wine, and do
every where communicate the Laity, not onely in Bread but in
Wine also.</hi> ... Hence it is that the Council decrees and

                     <item>2. That he sets down the Decree, as containing an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
and direct opposition to the institution of Christ, and
practice of the Primitive Church, for communicating the
people under both kindes. [The Council decrees and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
against this error, (of giving the Chalice to the Laity)
that <hi>although Christ instituted after supper, and administred
this venerable Sacrament under both kindes; yet this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. ...
And although in the Primitive Church this
Sacrament was received of the faithful under both kindes.</hi>]
Here is the acknowledgement, both of Christs Institution
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30587:15"/>
in both kindes, and Christs ministring it in both kindes, and
the practice of the Primitive Church to give it in both
kindes; yet the conclusion from these premises is, [<hi>We
command that no Priest communicate the people under both
kindes.</hi>] The opposition is plain, &amp;c. Thus far he. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in the Decree, there is no such thing: for these are the
words of it. [<hi>Although Christ instituted after supper, and
administred this venerable Sacrament to his Disciples under
both kindes, yet this notwithstanding, the laudable authority of
holy Canons,</hi>

                        <hi>and the approved custom of the Church, observes,
that this Sacrament ought not to be Consecrated after sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
nor received of the faithful not fasting, (unless in case
of the Article of death.) And as this custom, was reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
introduced, to avoid some dangers and scandals; that
although in the Primitive Church this Sacrament was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
under both kindes; afterward it came to be received under
the species of Bread onely by the Laity, it is to be had for a Law,
which is not lawful to reject or alter without authority of the
Church.</hi>]</item>
                     <item>3. That he sets down these as the words of the Decree,
[<hi>We command under the pain of Excommunication, that no
Priest communicate the people under both kindes:</hi>] whereas in
the Decree are no such words; for this is all it saith,
[<hi>Wherefore to say, that it is sacrilegious or unlawful to observe
this custom or Law, ought to be judged erroneous; and they that
pertinaciously maintain the opposite of the Premises, are to be
expelled as Hereticks</hi>]<note place="margin">arcendi.</note>

because the Apostles did all of them drink of the
Chalice.</hi> When he resolves it not dogmatically, but onely
argues it in way of discourse; nor doth he give any such
reason, [<hi>Because the Apostles, &amp;c</hi>] nor saith any thing there
but what is verified in the Priest celebrating, or in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant
in either kinde onely. [<hi>The sense is manifest, that
now</hi> (his) <hi>flesh is broken, because in the Chalice is the blood
that flowed out of</hi> (his) <hi>side. And therefore very rightly is the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:30587:15"/>

<hi>communicated: But the whole man who consists of two
substances is redeemed, and therefore he is saginated with the
flesh and blood of Christ together. And therefore they are well

not a little altered and mangled by him in the very words.

succeeding to one another in the same See: and so it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

saith, <hi>priorum,</hi> of <hi>former</hi> Bishops, or predecessors,
in that See, he translates it, of the <hi>ancient</hi> Bishops. 4. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that these words, would make nothing to his purpose,
he wrests them to it with a Gloss; [<hi>None is before or after
other, none is greater or less then another,</hi>] and then inferres,
<hi>that these words do fully declare, that the Roman Bishoprick
gave no more power to the Pope, then Christ gave to the Bishop
of the smallest Diocess:</hi> when he could but know that his
gloss and inference, had not onely no foundation in <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi>'s
words, but were directly contrary to the whole
substance and drift of the Epistle; it being an answer to a
Letter of Complaint of the Archbishop of <hi>Arles</hi> to the
Pope, against the Archbishop of <hi>Vienna,</hi> for invading the
rights of the Church of <hi>Arles,</hi> for ordaining some neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Bishops, upon pretence of some Breve or Rescript
of Pope <hi>Anastasius, (Symmachus</hi> his predecessor) wherein
he had contraried the Grants of former Popes to the
Church of <hi>Arles;</hi> and desiring from the Pope redress in it:
and he promises to redress it, and gives for his reason the
words quoted by the Doctor, because it was not well done
of <hi>Anastasius,</hi> to contrary the Acts of his predecessors:
all which proves, that the Roman Bishop was superior to
those Archbishops of <hi>Arles</hi> and <hi>Vienna,</hi> and had jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
over them, and that <hi>Symmachus</hi> himself thought so.

this in contempt of the authority of the Fathers urged by
<hi>Nilus,</hi> against the Pope's Supremacy; when there was no
such thing. For the objection of <hi>Nilus</hi> there urged was
not from Fathers, but from Reason; and it was onely to
prove that the Pope ought to be subject to the Canons of
holy Fathers, because he had his Dignity from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

he were unworthy to be honoured as a Father, if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd
the Fathers. To which reasons <hi>Bellarmin</hi> answer'd,
<hi>That the Pope had not his Dignity from the Fathers, and that
if he made Canons, he could not binde himself; and that if
he be honoured as a Father by all, he hath no Fathers in the
Church, but all Children; and therefore he cannot be subject to
them; and that he contemns not the Fathers, &amp;c.</hi>]</p>

to encourage the Bishops to deliver their Sentence without
fear of excommunication; and he interprets the words
not to mean, as if the Bishops were exempted absolutely
from being judged by their Superiors, but onely in such
cases as that, which were undetermined by the Church.

                  <hi>It is taught by</hi> Navar, <hi>that though the
Church calls upon sinners to repent on Holy-Dayes, and at
Easter, yet by the Law of God they are not tyed to so much, but
onely to repent in the Article or danger of Death; and he saith
that for this,</hi> Navar <hi>quotes Pope</hi> Adrian, <hi>and Card.</hi> Cajetan,
<hi>and affirms is to be the sense of all men:</hi> When <hi>Navar</hi> hath
not a word to any such purpose, in the number quoted. And
<hi>n.</hi> 27. (where he purposely speaks of this matter, and was
perhaps meant by the Doctor) <hi>Navar</hi> neither affirms it to
be the sense of all men, nor teaches it himself, nor quotes
P. <hi>Adrian,</hi> or Card. <hi>Cajetan</hi> for it; but onely teaches, <hi>That
though a man ought all the while that he is in mortal sin to take
care to repent of it; according to S.</hi> Thomas <hi>and the common
opinion, and namely Card.</hi> Cajetan; <hi>yet he is not bound to it
by a Precept obliging to new mortal sin, unless at that time
when it occurs to his memory as to use, (that is, to desire or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
it, to commit or omit it) according to the common opinion.
Nay, nor at that time neither, for those reasons for which</hi> Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<hi>and</hi> Cajetan <hi>affirm it.</hi> And at length concludes, that
<hi>according to all, we are bound to procure an act of contrition, in
imminent danger of death, and whensoever we are to administer
or receive any Sacrament,</hi> (which all are bound to, at Easter,
or once a year) <hi>nay, and whensoever there is any great necessity
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:30587:22"/>
of the people which requires servor of prayer to provide against
it, according to Pope</hi> Adrian.</p>

<hi>that men are bound by the commandment of God, to an

onely denies, that they are bound to it on Holy-dayes, and
affirms, that by the common opinion of all, the time in
which a man is bound to it by any <hi>special</hi> commandment
given by God touching contrition, (which word, <hi>special,</hi>
the Doctor leaves out) is the imminent danger of death:
but then addes, that <hi>besides the Article of death, there are
other times in which we may be bound to an act of contrition,</hi>
(meaning, when we are to administor or receive any Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)

                  <hi>Tolet, Maldonat,</hi>
&amp;c. as teaching, that if a man he never so little sorrowful
for his sins, it is sufficient with the Sacrament to obtain
pardon for the greatest sins: whereas they spake not of any
little intention or degree of sorrow absolutely, but within
the species of contrition; which contrition no sorrow can
be, as they teach, unless it be a detestation of sin above all
things detestable.</p>

common with Christ, that she may be truly and properly said, to
have given and offered the price of our Redemption, as he had
afore cited out of S. <hi>Jerome,</hi> and other Fathers, therefore also

[That is to be premised, that the holy Fathers do attribute so
much to the <hi>B.</hi> Virgin, that they will have her to be some cause
of our Salvation: not by satisfying or satis-giving for sin, son
that belongs to Christ alone, but by impetrating it for us. <hi>So</hi>
Irenaeus; <hi>She was made the cause of Salvation to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.

words, thus.</hi> [Therefore because the Virgin, by her Prayers,
contributed somewhat to our Salvation, truly in my opinion
that seems to be sufficient, that she may be called, a Cause,
Auctress, or Mediatress of our Salvation, as others who also
