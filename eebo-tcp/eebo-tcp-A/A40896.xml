            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE RELATION Of the State of IRELAND as it now ſtands vnder the preſent perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Papiſts.</head>
            <head type="sub">THe many falſe and uncertain Reports of the State of <hi>Ireland</hi> hath much abuſed the truth of things, and ſo poſſeſſed the Readers with a praejudicate opinion, that men are almoſt aſhamed to relate a truth, although never ſo certaine. I will not trouble the Reader with any fictitious Battell fought betwixt this and that great Lord, nor flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Countrimen with the good ſucceſſe the Proteſtants hath had of late againſt the Romiſh Rebels. Only you ſhall here underſtand, the true and reall Eſtate of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as it now ſtands; being the juſt and moſt true Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of a Letter ſent from thence by a Gentleman now reſident in <hi>Cork,</hi> vnto a worthy Marchant of this City.</head>

               <salute>WORTHY SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am ſorry that my pen cannot preſent vnto you my ſervice, accompanied with better news, then that which the miſery and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this diſtreſſed Kingdome at this inſtant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords. The inſolency of the papiſts is now grown to that height of miſchiefe, that it ſpares neither
<pb facs="tcp:62408:3"/>
man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> woman, nor child, but moſt cruelly puts all to the ſword, affording no quarter at all vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny condition. The Proteſtants of Dublin had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till within theſe few days ſome hopes of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from their moſt inhumane and barbarous cruelty, but now of late are ſo circumvented by the rebellious forces, that they or wee can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive very ſmall hopes to eſcape their cruelty, vnleſſe there bee ſome ſpeedy reply to relieve them, they have taken away from them all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of way for reliefe: ſo that they muſt either be enforced to yeeld unto them, or give them preſent battell, which we conceive they are moſt vnable to doe.</p>
            <p>The narrow ſeas they have ſo blockt up, and ſtopped, that there is no poſſible means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey any releaſe vnto them by ſea, and their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have ſo ſurrounded it by Land, that they are driven to a great and miſerable penury, both for want of victuall, and all other proviſion whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. A buſhell of wheat was ſold within the walls of that City a week ago for 23. s. and meat they can ſcarce provide at any rate; for the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is ſo vigilant round about them, that without great hazzard men cannot make any attempt to ſupply them with neceſſaries, the danger of the enterprize cannot countervaile the benefit of the ſupply.</p>
            <p>Long they cannot hold out, but we hope, and doe expect every day aſsiſtance, and reliefe from his Majeſty, the which unleſſe it ſpeedily come,
<pb facs="tcp:62408:3"/>
it will be fruitleſſe, and to no purpoſe at all; for all will be ruinated, and as we may juſtly expect by their former dealings, be brought to extream and utter confuſion.</p>
            <p>The calamity of this Kingdome is generall, and I doubt not but that you have bin ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed already with all the proceedings of the Papiſts there.</p>
            <p>About a fortnight ſince their forces pitched before the City of <hi>Armagh</hi> (where by the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant care, and religious preaching of Doctor <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> Archbiſhop of that See, were great ſtore of well diſpoſed Proteſtants, and zealous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of true Religion, true in heart both to their God and King) they were not long before they did take that City; but after their entrance, their carriage was ſo inhumane, that no age can parallell it.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants at the ſurrendring of the Towne deſired Quarter, and that they might be diſmiſſed thence with their lives and liberties and with that ſmall conveniency of moneyes to provide them neceſſaries, which they could convey along with them.</p>
            <p>This more then barbarous enemy, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty after bloud, and breathing nothing but murther, and deſtruction denyed vnto them all Priviledges of Armes whatſoever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:62408:4"/>
but immediatly after their entrance began to fal upon the prey, putting the Inhabitants to moſt cruell and fearefull deaths, raviſhing their wives before their husbands faces, killing their poore Infants, and with many moſt opprobrious lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages. After they had thus butchered the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, they began to pillage and plunder the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and what they could not themſelvs make uſe of, they made moſt ſhamefull havock and waſte of. They were not content with the lives of the inhabitants of that city, wherby they ſlew about the number of 160. but after their inhumane dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with their perſons and poſſeſsions, their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice extended to the very buildings of that City, fearing leaſt poſterity in after-times ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any benefit by them, they ſet all the houſes on fire, and have ſo deſtroyed them, that in all that great City there now remains not one hous to demonſtrate where the City was. You cannot perceive where the city did ſtand, but by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable ſpectacle of the ruins, which can ſcarce be called ruines, being now made levell vnto the very ground. Thus do they proceed in miſchief, and in this miſerable eſtate the poore diſtreſſed inhabitants of this Land are plunged, the integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their minds and conſciences being the only cauſe of this their great and heavie calamity. You cannot expect that I ſhould certifie you any thing concerning our trade here, you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how poore it muſt needs be by the extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the times. I was forced my ſelf to leave
<pb facs="tcp:62408:4"/>
               <hi>Dublin,</hi> foreſeeing the danger that they were like to be in very ſuddenly. I am now in <hi>Cork,</hi> and am as yet ſafely ſheltred vnder the carefull protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the right Honourable the Earle of <hi>Corke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> whoſe care is very vigilant, and induſtrious to preſerve all who do betake themſelvs vnto his cuſtody. We expect the enemy to aſſault vs, but if they do come, I hope we ſhall find ſuch good proviſion to entertain them, and ſuch a company of faithfull and honeſt hearts to manage that proviſion, that we hope we ſhall be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our ſelves from their oppreſſion and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. I hope the Lord will fight for vs, whoſe cauſe and right wee do maintaine: I am afraid I have troubled you too long with ſuch vnwelcome newes, but I thought it a part of my ſervice to let you vnderſtand in what caſe we ſtand at this preſent, I hope we ſhall ſee better dais, for theſe times are very miſerable. Thus ceaſing to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you any longer, I reſt</p>
