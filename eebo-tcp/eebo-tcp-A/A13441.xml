            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AN honest, well-knowing and well-knowne Souldier, (whose name for some Reasons I conceale) dwelt lately in <hi>VVestminster</hi>), in the round Woolstaple, he was a man onely for Action, but such Action as Loyalty did alwayes iustifie, either for his Prince, Countrey, or
<pb facs="tcp:11761:4"/>
their Deere and neere Freinds or Allies; in such noble designes Hee would and did often with courage, and good Aprouement em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy himselfe in the Low-Countreys, having alwaies with him a little blacke Dogg, whom hee called <hi>Drunkard</hi>; which Curre would (by no meanes) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer forsake or leaue him. But lately in these French Warrs, the Dogg being in the Isle of <hi>RHEA,</hi> where
<pb facs="tcp:11761:4"/>
his Master (valiantly figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) was vnfortunately slaine, whose death was grieu'd for by as many as knew him; and as the Corps lay dead, the poore louing Masterlesse Dogg would not forsake it, vntil an English Souldier pulld off his Masters Coate, whom the Dog followed to a Boat, by which meanes he came backe to Westminster, wher hee now remaines. Vpon whose fidelity, (for the
<pb facs="tcp:11761:5"/>
loue I owed his deseased Master) I haue writ these following lines, to expresse my Adiction to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerb, <hi>Loue me and loue my Hound</hi>; I haue a little rubb'd our Gull-gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Roarers ouer the Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combes, and withall I haue not forgotten our nose-wise Prescisians: If the Dogg <hi>Drunkard</hi> doe a little snap at them, I hold it their wisest way to be silent and put it vp, but if they

            <p>I read in <hi>Anthony Gueuaroa</hi> his <hi>Golden Epistles,</hi> that the Great <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> buried his <hi>Horse</hi>; that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Augustus</hi> made a stately Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument for his <hi>Parrot</hi>: and that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liogabalus</hi> did embaulmne and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombe his <hi>Sparrow.</hi> Happy were those Creatures in dying before their Masters: I could with all my heart haue been glad that <hi>Drunkards</hi> fortune had been the like, vpon the condition that I had payd for his Buriall.</p>
            <p>But to speake a little of the nature of Beasts, and of the seruice and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie of Dogges toward their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters:
<pb facs="tcp:11761:22"/>
               <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> writes, that the Elephant whereon <hi>Porus</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian King road in the Battle against <hi>Alexander,</hi> when the King was bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten downe to the ground, that the Elephant drew his Master with his Trunke out of the danger of the Fight, and so sau'd him.</p>
            <p>A Groome of the Chamber to French King <hi>Francis</hi> the first, was murdered in the Forrest of <hi>Fountein Belleau,</hi> but the said Groome had a Dogge, who afterward (in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the King &amp; all the Court) did teare the Murderer in peeces.</p>
            <p>Amongst the Watermen at the <hi>Black-Friers,</hi> there lately was a little Bitch that Whelped or Litter'd in the Lane vnder a bench, the Men perceiued that she had more Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies then she could sustaine, did take three of them and cast them into the Thames, (the water being high) but the next day, when the water
<pb facs="tcp:11761:23"/>
was ebd away, the Bitch went downe the staires, and found her three drowned Puppies, when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently she dig'd a deepe pit in the ground, and drew them into it one after an other, and then scrap'd the grauell vpon them and so hid them.</p>
            <p>I could produce and relate many of these examples and accidents, but they are so frequent and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, that almost euery man hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther known or heard of the like: But chiefely for the Dogge, he is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest aboue all Beastes, and by and from Dogges our Separatists and <hi>Amsterdamians,</hi> and our Precise dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisers of all honest and laudable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations may see their errors; For of all the Creatures, there are most diuersitie in the shapes and formes of Dogges; of all which, there are but two sorts that are vsefull for Mans profit, which two are the Mastiffe, and the little Curre, Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
<pb facs="tcp:11761:23"/>
or House-dogge; all the rest are for pleasure and recreation; so likewise is the Mastiffe for Beare and Bull: But the Water-spaniell, Land-spaniell, Grey-hound, Fox-hound, Buck-hound, Blood-hound, Otter-hound, Setter, Tumbler, with <hi>Shough</hi> and <hi>Dainty,</hi> my Ladies deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Fisting hound; all these are for pleasure, by which we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that Man is allowed lawfull and honest recreation, or else these Dogges had neuer bin made for such vses.</p>
            <p>But many pretty rediculous as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persions are cast vpon Dogges, so that it would make a Dogge laugh to heare and vnderstand them: As I haue heard a Man say, I am as hot as a Dogge, or, as cold as a Dogge; I sweate like a Dogge, (when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Dogge neuer sweates,) as drunke as a Dogge, he swore like a Dogge: and one told a Man once,
<pb facs="tcp:11761:24"/>
That his Wife was not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeu'd, for she wonld lye like a Dog; marry (quoth the other) I would giue twelue pence to see that trick, for I haue seene a Dog to lye with his Nose in his Tayle.</p>
