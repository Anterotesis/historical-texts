            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>COnſidering the unſuccesfull Attempts of ſeverall Authors who have adventur'd upon this difficult part of <hi>Meteorology,</hi> I was ſufficiently diſcourag'd from expoſing to publick view thoſe Collections, which I had ſometime made concerning the Cauſes and Properties of Winds. But afterward, by reaſon of my reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a place principally concern'd in Naval Affairs (where I had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent opportunities of converſing with the moſt experienc'd of our Sea-Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains) I began to compare the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of their Voyages, with the
<pb facs="tcp:56342:3"/>
writings of the moſt celebrated of the Ancient, and Modern Philoſophers; which I judg'd the only expedient to arrive at a more perfect Hiſtory of Winds. I have omitted nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable which was taken notice of by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> whoſe Sagacity in theſe enquiries was the greateſt that the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian World could boaſt of: But the ſucceeding Ages, which with their nice Speculations endeavour'd rather to amuſe, then ſatisfy the minds of men, made little Progreſſe in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of Nature; till our Voyages to the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and the great encreaſe of Navigation for theſe Hundred years laſt paſt, furniſht us with ſo many new diſcoveries, and improvements in all Natural know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (eſpecially, in what relates to the Motions of the Winds and Seas)
<pb facs="tcp:56342:3"/>
that we are every day forc'd to regret the inſufficiency of thoſe Theories which we receiv'd from the Schools of the Ancients; ſince the Courſe of the <hi>Generall</hi> or <hi>Trade-Wind,</hi> the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Monzoons,</hi> the ſeverall ſorts of <hi>Briſes</hi> in the <hi>African,</hi> and <hi>American</hi> Climates (which are certainly the moſt conſiderable <hi>Phaenomena</hi> that belong to an exact Treatiſe of Winds) were as remote from the knowledge of their moſt inquiſitive Naturalliſts, as the places where they happen, from <hi>Athens</hi> or <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt confeſſe the incomparable <hi>L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Verulam</hi> has given us much light, in his Diſcourſe on this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though he ſeems to have been little Curious in the Collections of Forreign Parts; without which, we muſt ſtill have remain'd ignorant of
<pb facs="tcp:56342:4"/>
the largeſt Portion of the Univerſe: But I can boaſt of little aſſiſtance from others, more then ſome Hiſtoricall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of the <hi>Trade-Winds</hi> and <hi>Hurricanes</hi> taken from the learned <note n="*" place="margin">De Motu Moris &amp; Ventorum.</note> 
               <hi>Iſaac Voſſius,</hi> which I made uſe of, as finding them moſt agreable to the Relations of our Sea-Voyages, and beleiving them Generally true. I muſt likewiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my obligations to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>Mr. Boyle,</hi> for his advice upon ſeverall occaſions, particularly, in the experiment mention'd pag. <hi>134,</hi> concerning the Qualities of Winds.</p>
            <p>I have indifferently made uſe of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Peripatetique</hi> or <hi>Epicurean</hi> Principles, as they ſerv'd beſt for the Explication of the preſent <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon:</hi> For though at this day, ſome with the greateſt applauſe embrace the
<pb facs="tcp:56342:4"/>
               <hi>Carteſian</hi> and <hi>Atomicall Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſes,</hi> yet what are the <hi>Atomicall,</hi> or <hi>Corpuſcularian</hi> Placits, but <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus</hi> or <hi>Epicurus</hi> in another Dreſſe, which we call the <hi>New Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy;</hi> not that it was Invented, but only Reviv'd, and Vindicated by the Moderns, from the Injuries and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Time.</p>
            <p>I have in the following Diſcourſe offer'd at a fuller Account both of the Regular, and Tempeſtuous Winds, the Land &amp; <hi>Sea-Brizes,</hi> and ſeverall other particulars which moſt writers had paſt by in ſilence: And though, as to the Hiſtoricall part or Matters of Fact, I may have committed ſome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; this muſt not altogether be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to my credulitye, but the great Diverſitie of Relations, and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Accidents, which alter the moſtconſtant
<pb facs="tcp:56342:5"/>
motions of the Currents and Winds. I have known ſome Maſters of Ships, who miſſed of the <hi>Monſoons</hi> at the uſuall ſeaſons of the year in their return from the <hi>Indies:</hi> and I have ſometimes met with different Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the <hi>Harmetan</hi> Winds, and the <hi>Tornados</hi> on the Coaſts of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:</hi> nor ſhall I undertake that every ſhip which has Croſt the Line, met with the <hi>Trade-Wind</hi> in the ſame Degree of Latitude: I have therefore deſcrib'd them as they generally happen, and though there may be ſome Variation, yet, for the moſt part, they very Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly depend on the courſe of the Sun. I may thus farre aſſure the Reader, that I have manag'd this Affair with all imaginable Caution, and ſeldome made uſe of any Account, but when ſeverall Relations did agree in the ſame parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
<pb facs="tcp:56342:5"/>
or when I found the perſons of the moſt unſuſpected integrity, and which had no intereſt to deceive. Then it was my ultimate Deſign to make the moſt advantageous uſe of theſe enquiries, as they might conduce to any improvement in Philoſophie: Albeit I may poſſibly be obnoxious to Cenſure, for diverſe Philoſophicall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions, which I have occaſionally made in the following Diſcourſes: Though I have for the moſt part rather Alluded to Severall, then Adherd to any One <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> Yet ſince all Diſquiſitions of this kind are but Conjectural, and no exact Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to be expected in Phyſiologicall Sciences, I might challenge the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of my own thoughts, reſerving for others the ſame Libertie, to abound in their own ſenſe, and to interpret Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as they pleaſe.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Though we conſult the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cits of the learned Ancients, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider alſo what we owe to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of latter times, yet I queſtion whether any Theory was ever yet ſtarted on this Argument, which will adequately reſolve the whole <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of VVinds; and we muſt never expect to confine their Originall to any <hi>one determinate</hi> Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the <hi>Graecian Philoſophers</hi> agreed in the ſame Definition of 
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56342:11"/>
Wind; till the Prince of the <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetiques</hi> was not only ambitious to eſtabliſh a <hi>New Hypotheſis</hi> of his own, but likewiſe undertook the confutation of his Maſter <hi>Plato,</hi> &amp; the reſt of his <hi>Predeceſſors:</hi> The <hi>Philoſophicall Monarch</hi> thought he could never raign ſecurely in the minds of men, unleſſe, like the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> he deſtroy'd all his Bretheren firſt.</p>
            <p>I have no intention to diſparage the Authority of the Ancients; but I cannot be ſo injurious to the many noble productions of our preſent Age, to think that all <hi>Science</hi> is only to be ſought for in the <hi>Urns</hi> of the <hi>Dead:</hi> we have a more intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Nature then heretofore, which diſplays her beautifull Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and every day affords new Diſcoveries of uſefull knowledge,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56342:11"/>
and further conducing to the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of <hi>Human life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we conſider the ſucceſſe that Philoſophy has met with in the VVorld, we ſhall find that thoſe Opinions, which obtain'd moſt in one Age, had their Fatall Periods, &amp; were as much exploded &amp; decry'd in the next; &amp; it's as impoſſible that any one <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> ſhould be calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Guſto of all perſons when the ſentiments of men are different as their complexions: I have therefore taken a larger compaſſe then the Generallity of writers, and deriv'd the Origines of Winds from <hi>ſeverall Cauſes;</hi> which I rather endeavour to prove from Accounts of our Sea-Voyages, and relations of Matters of Fact, then to refine on them by any nice ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my own.

               </note> a perſon not leſſe ſagacious in the contemplation of Nature, has prov'd in a late diſcourſe, that Air, without Heat, will be dilated to 13000 times the former extent, though with it <hi>Merſennus</hi> never arriv'd to an 100: And queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe in the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> without the aſſiſtence of Art, we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it Rarefiable by the Heat of the Sun, to incomparably larger Dimenſions then <hi>De Cartes</hi> allows it; at leaſt ſufficient to create very impetuous VVinds, which may be occaſion'd from any extraordinary expanſion of the Air: as we uſually obſerve, that in great conflagrations it blows manifeſtly freſher there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56342:18"/>
then it did before, &amp; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Gaſcoigny</hi> (at that time ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the Crown of <hi>England)</hi> are ſaid to have petition'd the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the burning of Heath in <hi>Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> which afterwards rais'd a VVind, very pernicious to their Vines.</p>
            <p>Another cauſe which generates Wind, is the <hi>Superoneration</hi> of the <hi>Atmoſphere. Democritus</hi> &amp; other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Atomiſts, ſuppoſing, if there were too many particles of matter crowded in little Space, they muſt neceſſarily juſtle, and arietate each other, thought VVinds to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the <hi>Strugling or Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Atoms:</hi> On the contrary, if there chance to be few Atoms in much ſpace, ſo that there be no Preſſure, or Coarctation in a free &amp;

ſpacious heaven, this (they ſay) begets <hi>tranquillity</hi> and a ſerene <hi>Temperature</hi> of the <hi>Heavens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, beſide this <hi>Superoneration,</hi> theſe Flatulent <hi>Emotions</hi> may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from any other Cauſe which alters the <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> of the <hi>Atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere;</hi> So that it will be ſufficient to generate Winds, if the Air be only <hi>denſer</hi> in <hi>one part</hi> then <hi>another,</hi> by the unequall diſtribution of vapours; Therefore we have common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a gentle Briſe breathing off from Ponds or Lakes, where the Cold more eſpecially condenſes the Air, at leaſt the Vapours ariſe in greater plenty from Humid Bodies. Thus we ſometimes ſee a larger collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of clouds in one Quarter, which being afterwards diſcharg'd in ſhowrs, there oftentimes follows a wind from the immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux
<pb facs="tcp:56342:19"/>

            <p>For the Currents of Air imitate the Motions of water, and by the juſt laws of <hi>Hydroſtatiques,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their reſpective gravity, mount higher or deſcend: ſo that there is a perpetuall inquietude, till it come to an exact <hi>Aequilibri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um;</hi> and what cauſe ſoever it be, which varys the <hi>Counterpoiſe</hi> of the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> muſt needs occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Winds.</p>
            <p>The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> cauſe which produces theſe <hi>Intermediate Winds,</hi> is <hi>Compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:</hi> when two, or more Clouds im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuouſly preſſing or falling upon each other, drive out a VVind from between them.</p>
            <p>The Pureſt &amp; moſt Aetheriall matter is not without ſome degree of Gravitation; though we want

For Humid bodys are ſoon agitated, and Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis'd by heat; as might appeare from that Vulgar, but very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Experiment, of the <hi>Aeoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile;</hi>

            <p>Suppoſe A, B, G, the Figure of the Veſſell, which you may fill with water to H: then, ſetting it on the Fire, the water, when thoroughly heated, will be Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd into Wind: and Iſſue out through the Neck K, with great violence. <figure/>

Some have us'd them inſtead of Bellows, and contriv'd <hi>Pneumatiek</hi> Inventions of this Nature to blow the Fire: Others have made them large enough, to turn the Wheels of ſpits; For the force of the Wind will be greater, or leſſe, Proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to the bigneſs of the Veſſel.</p>

The other is ſet down by Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> (to whom the learned world is ſo much obliged for his curioſity in all Naturall inquiries) and I ſhall inſert it from the pen of the Honourable Author. <hi>Some years ſince, neer the ſtrong fortreſs of Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cannon, where divers of the ſhips Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of England lying at Anchor, in a place where they apprehended no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from the Wind: there ſeemed ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly to aſcend out of the water, not farr from them, a black Cloud, in ſhape and bigneſs not much unlike a barrell: which was, not long after, followed (as the moſt experienc'd Pilot foretold) by ſo hideous a ſtorme, as forc'd thoſe ſhipps to goe to Sea again; and had like to have caſt them away: and this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count was written by the principall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to their Superiors in England,</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Peripatetiques,</hi> though by no encouragement from the Text of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> hold that the <hi>Repulſe</hi> or <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> which the hot and dry exhalations meet with by rancoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the cold Clouds, cauſeth their reſilition downwards, and impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

that oblique motion on the VVinds.</p>
            <p>But the moſt learned of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age have ſo little regard, for the doctrine of <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> as it's uſually maintain'd in the <hi>Schooles;</hi> that they endeavour to explicate this, and all other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances in Nature without it; and the <hi>Lord Verulam</hi> himſelf being averſe to this Caprice of the <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtic Doctors,</hi> declares the <hi>Reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion</hi> of Winds, from the <hi>cold</hi> of the <hi>Middle Region,</hi> to be of all other the vaineſt and moſt Irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Hypotheſis.</p>

The Prognoſtics of theſe, is a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and murmur of the woods; the ſhooting of Starrs; <hi>Halos</hi> about the Moon: All which indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a repletion of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> with exhalations, that afterwards deſcend and are converted into Wind: yet the cauſe of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe to the Earth, is, no repercuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from that <hi>Imaginary Antiperiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> but the <hi>Ingenit gravity</hi> of the vapors themſelvs; at leaſt the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and detruſion of the ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent Air; which I ſuppoſe to ly in ſeverall fleeces, or ſtorys one above another, and preſſe down the inferior; that when the VVinds chance to gravitate comparatively more then the vapors neer the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Earth, they, to preſerve the juſt <hi>Counterpoiſe</hi> of the <hi>Atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere,</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:56342:31"/>
muſt neceſſarily deſcend of their own accord.</p>
            <p>The gravity of <hi>Air</hi> (eſpecially <hi>Wind</hi> which is a body farre more Heterogeneous and impure) can be no paradox to the learned of our times; ſince the many noble diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions about the preſſure and weight of the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> made by Mr. <hi>Boyl,</hi> and other curious Perſons.</p>
            <p>Our Sea-men commonly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it to blow from that quarter, where they ſee <hi>one or more Clouds</hi> gather above the Horizon: Either that they <hi>preſſe</hi> more then at other times, or becauſe the matter of which they conſiſt is afterwards diſſolvible into VVinds.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Clouds, from the rupture and diſſolution of which wee are to expect ſuddain guſts, hang more

            <p>It appears from the precedent diſcourſes, that VVinds do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly emerge from the <hi>Aeolian Caues;</hi> but have a much ſublimer origine in the Kingdom of Meteors, being generated both in the <hi>Lower and Middle Regions;</hi> at leaſt conſiſt of the groſs Air, and vapors, that are driven from thence: and though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their relapſe to the earth, they are indifferently diſpos'd to what ever ſpecies of Agitation, yet gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they begin their march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that quarter, whither the moſt <hi>Violent Impulſe</hi> is made; at leaſt where they find the <hi>medium</hi> more <hi>yeilding,</hi> and fitteſt to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56342:32"/>
their motions. As ſometimes the Atmoſphere is <hi>thinneſt</hi> towards the <hi>South,</hi> which begets a <hi>North-Wind:</hi> other while in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and then the protruſion is likewiſe made <hi>Weſtward:</hi> Or if the whole current bend with too great violence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one point; it oftentimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyls back again, and begets a quite contrary Wind to the former. Thus wee often obſerve, that when one Wind ceaſes, the <hi>Oppoſite</hi> begins; &amp; the Atmoſphere, which in many things bears a great reſemblance to <hi>liquids,</hi> has theſe kind of fluxes &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxes like the Rivers and Seas: For Air is a body ſo fluid, and tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo eaſily ſuſceptible of them, and long retentive of the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; that if it once be ſet a going, it as a kind of perpetuall <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomat,</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:56342:33"/>
continues the motion, is drawn into conſort with the vapors, and it ſelfe converted into VVind. If we make a further enquiry into the cauſe of their motions, we ſhall find they proceed likewiſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diſpoſition of the <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and thoſe which have no du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Fonds,</hi> dwindle away and are ſoon exhauſted in their courſe: ſometimes they condenſe into <hi>Clouds;</hi> and otherwhile, being too much attenuated and refind, they vaniſh and diſſipate in the Air.</p>
            <p>Thoſe VVinds which are nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt their <hi>Locall Origines,</hi> blow har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt: eſpecially ſuch as are rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc't by other auxiliary Vapors as they paſſe. <hi>Acoſta</hi> obſerved they were always moſt turbulent neer the ſhoars and promontories of the

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56342:35"/>
of Wind. And we muſt needs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme it a great effect of their lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, who have employd ſo much time in ſuch empty and jejune ſpeculations.</p>
            <p>Yet not only the <hi>Peripatetiques</hi> have fail'd in their attempts: but we have as little ſatisfaction from <hi>Epicurus,</hi> or the <hi>ſevere Porch:</hi> &amp; may as juſtly queſtion whether the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories</hi> which ſhall be ſtarted hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, muſt hope for any better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. Yet I think wee may thus farr rationally conclude, that as the cauſes of Winds are various, ſo the reaſon of their <hi>Tranſverſe Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> is not always one and the ſame.</p>
            <p>I have frequently obſerved that <hi>not only the North, but moſt other Winds, ſeem many times rather ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to deſcend, then blow in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56342:36"/>
Perpendicular line to the Horizon:</hi> yet wee muſt acknowledge, that even thoſe which relapſe from the <hi>Middle Region,</hi> or are generated by the <hi>Rarefaction of Vapors</hi> in the <hi>Intermediate ſpace between the Earth and Clouds,</hi> have <hi>for the moſt part</hi> an oblique or Semicircular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for though their Ingenit weight would rather Praecipitate them to the Earth: yet they are either born up and repel'd by the continuall Effluxions of aſcending Steams; or at leaſt can deſcend no lower then where they come to the juſt counterpoiſe of the Air. So that if the Flatulent Vapors have gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enough (eſpecially after they are Condens'd in the Colder Region) to invite them Downward, and yet the reſiſtence of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56342:36"/>
in a great meaſure to check and retard their deſcent; this muſt neceſſarily divert them from their Precipice, inclining them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a <hi>mixt</hi> and <hi>Collaterall Motion.</hi> For though Winds are generally heavyer then the Air below, yet they are ſupported in it, during their Career; till by degrees fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downwards to the Earth, they at length ceaſe, or languiſh in their Courſe.</p>
            <p>Wee muſt note likewiſe, that the whole body of the Air, ſettles about the Earth in a ſphericall Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; ſo that the protruſion is made from all parts to the Center; that the Winds, being reſiſted by the Preſſure of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and the Earth or Sea below, move, as in a Channell, between
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56342:37"/>
both, wherefore they ſoare high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in a Serene Skye, when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Air, and Winds is much leſſe then in Cloudy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And the reaſon why they blow <hi>Obliquely</hi> (or which is all one) <hi>perpendicularly to the Horizon,</hi> is not to be ſuppos'd, becauſe the Vapors are naturally determin'd to any ſuch particular ſpecies of Agitation; but that, being dilated by the Sun, they require a larger ſpace, and find the <hi>Medium</hi> moſt diſpos'd to admit of their Motions in that manner.</p>
            <p>Laſtly thoſe VVinds which <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge</hi> from the <hi>Caverns under Ground,</hi> may ſometimes have that <hi>Tranverſe Motion</hi> impres'd on them from their Fountains, at the time of their Eruption. For thoſe Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56342:37"/>
ſpirits or Salts, being once mov'd in the Hollows of the Earth, by the Subterraneall warmth, are ſtill roving up and down, and reſtleſſe, till they get vent; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their releaſe protrude the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous Air, and propagate the ſame kind of Agitation in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever bodys occurre in the way: and then all <hi>Auxiliary Vapors</hi> will be ſure to have Immediate recourſe whither the ſtrongeſt current bends.</p>
            <p>But beſide theſe <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>Originall,</hi> there are other <hi>Secundary</hi> cauſes and Affections of VVinds: as, their <hi>Undulation; Repercuſſion from Promontorys; Oppoſition,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>VVee have thus farre enquir'd into the <hi>Progreſſive;</hi> but the <hi>Undula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Motions</hi> are no leſſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56342:38"/>
in VVinds: for they blow not in one conſtant fluor, or ſtreame, but in <hi>guſts,</hi> that have their <hi>ſtarts and intervals,</hi> intermitting like our pulſe; which is call'd the <hi>Undula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of VVind or Air, from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance it bears to the wavings and <hi>fluctuation</hi> of VVaters.</p>
            <p>Some of them are <hi>Indigenae, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> and others <hi>Adventitious</hi> to the places where they blow: yet the queſtion ſtill recurrs; for thoſe which are <hi>Externs,</hi> and either come from beyond Sea, or rove from farre countrys, have the ſame <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Origine</hi> with the reſt, though remoter from our obſervation.</p>
            <p>The motions of VVinds, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all other bodys whatever, are propagated in <hi>right lines;</hi> if nothing intervene to check and retard
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56342:38"/>
their courſe: but uſually ſo many impediments occurre, that are able to make reſiſtence in the way, that they ſeldome proceed in one uninterrupted Perpendicular from their fountains: Eſpecially in mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanous places, Forreſts, and other Eminencys, and inequalitys of Ground, but they are <hi>repuls'd</hi> and <hi>recoyl</hi> back again, and being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times impriſon'd in the ſtraits or Creeks of promontorys, they are toſt and banded to and fro like Tennis balls, till they find their paſſage out: ſo that after ſeverall diverſions it may happen at laſt, that a VVind may bee diſtracted to a quite <hi>different point</hi> of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe: and otherwhile ſo far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freinded by the <hi>advantageous ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the places where they blow,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56342:39"/>
that they run ſtreaming between two Mountains, as in <hi>a Channell or trough;</hi> and are guarded on all ſides from the inroads of other Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique VVinds and Air. Upon this account its no very unuſuall thing to have <hi>one</hi> VVind blow <hi>on the Top</hi> of a Mountain, and a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>in the Vally below.</hi> In the main Sea they keep the ſame quarter a long time, when nothing occurrs that can controle them: but neer mountainous <hi>Iſlands,</hi> or ſhoares, they whiffle up and down, and ſhift from one point of the Compaſſe to another, by ſeverall repercuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from the promontorys or hills; and theſe our Seamen call <hi>Eddy Winds:</hi> For as <hi>Water</hi> once diſmis'd from the Fountains head, is not only tinctur'd with the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56342:39"/>
it receiv'd from thence, but muſt afterwards conform to the courſe of the Channell or banks through which it glides: ſo the VVinds <hi>(which are Torrents, or Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets of Air)</hi> have their <hi>Maeanders</hi> and <hi>deflections</hi> in their Journy, and are in a great meaſure obnoxious to the ſituation of the Country's in which they blow: They alſo meet with frequent oppoſition, from the <hi>repletion</hi> of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> with multitudes of freſh Exhalations, that check, and croſſe them in their way; but eſpecially by their <hi>Rancounters with Contrary Winds;</hi> which muſt neceſſarily Engage, and ſtrive for maſtery, till one over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes: So that from two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry VVinds, there ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults a <hi>Third</hi> compounded of both

               <hi>Varenius</hi> perceiv'd the ſmoake iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing from the top of mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> to be Agitated and toſt up and down, as from the tunnells of chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys; which, though it lifts up its ſnowy head into the <hi>Second Region,</hi> yet it is not altogether exempt from the incurſions of Winds. However, <hi>Acoſta</hi> travelling o're the <hi>Peruvian</hi> hils, diſcover'd no violent motion of the Air; but rather an Aether ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis'd, and ignite, that it caus'd heavings &amp; convulſions in animals, ſo that they were forc't to thicken it with ſpunges, to prevent imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſuffocation.

infeſt the lower parts or neck of the Mountain.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Alps,</hi> and <hi>Pyreneans,</hi> or whatever hils beſide that are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with perennial ſnows, are alſo lyable to VVinds from their reſolution in the <hi>Summer;</hi> but the <hi>Peruvian,</hi> and ſome others which may be reckon'd as the Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cys of Nature, that threaten the sky, and overlook the Clouds with their prodigious height, are, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, never diſturb'd by tempeſts; though I queſtion whether any of our European world can pretend to this priviledge, yet the Grecian hiſtorians, who took all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys to advance the miracles of their country, relate of the <hi>Macedonian Athos;</hi> That it was Cuſtomary when they ſacrific'd on the top of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56342:43"/>
of the mountain, to inſcribe their names in the aſhes, and the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters are ſaid to have remain'd all the yeer round, without being in the leaſt defac'd by the VVinds.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Autumn,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally about the time of either <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox,</hi> are the moſt <hi>Flatulent ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> of the yeere.</p>
            <p>It's obſervable, the complexion of the Air is generally more ſilent at <hi>Midday,</hi> and in <hi>Soultry Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> when the Exhalations are too much attenuated to conſtitute Winds, which require a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable denſity and refrigeration: For this reaſon the South Winds u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually blow in the Night, the Air be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing over much <hi>refin'd</hi> in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the heat of the Day, till it condenſe again by the moderate <hi>cold</hi> of the <hi>night.</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:56342:44"/>
The <hi>Spring</hi> is generally more Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy then the <hi>Violent heats</hi> of <hi>Summer;</hi> both from the liquefaction of <hi>ſnows;</hi> and becauſe the pores of the Earth are then looſen'd, and the Vaporous effluxions releaſt from their former impriſonment, during the Froſt: and therefore thoſe VVinters which have <hi>leaſt froſt,</hi> and the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors ſuffer'd freely to tranſpire, are expos'd to the moſt boyſtrous <hi>Winds:</hi> as for example the laſt in the yeere 1670.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe in <hi>Autumn</hi> wee have commonly very bluſtring wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; moſt about the other <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox,</hi> when the Sun principally dilat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Air between the <hi>Tropiques,</hi> cauſes a more violent protruſion towards the <hi>Poles</hi> of the VVorld. Shall wee ſay that the luxuriant
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56342:44"/>
Rains which fall at that time of the yeare, affor'd more plentifull ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for VVind? Or is it by reaſon the reſervs of the Summer Vapors are condens'd by the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnall</hi> cold, when the heat of the Summer too much <hi>refines,</hi> and diſſipates the exhalations, &amp; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clemency of the <hi>Winter</hi> rather thickens them into Snow or Clouds. So that a juſt and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate condenſation is neceſſary to the conſtitution of VVinds: if it be too much, they degenerate into <hi>rain,</hi> &amp;c. if too <hi>little,</hi> they become <hi>Stagnant Air.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, from their <hi>Limits</hi> and <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> I deſcend to the more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Species:</hi> As the <hi>Generall</hi> or <hi>Tropicall</hi> VVind; the <hi>Provinciall;</hi> the Land and Sea <hi>Briſes;</hi> the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

ſorts of <hi>Eteſians</hi> and <hi>Monſoons</hi> in the <hi>Indian Seas,</hi> &amp;c. and ſhall from thence proceed to their Qualitys, and Prognoſtiques.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Generall</hi> or <hi>Trade</hi> VVind, continues all the yeare round with little variation. It is likewiſe call'd the <hi>Tropicall, Levantine,</hi> and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall <hi>Briſe:</hi> becauſe it blows con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly from the <hi>Eaſtern Points:</hi> and makes no farre excurſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Tropiques; commonly meeting our ſhips about the 30, 34, and in Summer oftentimes beyond the 36, degree of N.

            <p>On this ſide the line they ſit moſt at <hi>N. Eaſt;</hi> and on the other, at <hi>South East,</hi> or the points between the <hi>South and Eaſt.</hi> Now what
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56342:45"/>
Univerſall cauſe can afford ſuch immenſe magaſins of vapors? where can be the <hi>Locall origines</hi> of theſe perenniall VVinds which <hi>imitate the circulation of the Heavens?</hi> Or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily the diſciples of <hi>Copernicus</hi> will conclude that they depend on the diurnall <hi>motion of the Earth;</hi> which paſſing from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt,</hi> in the ſpace of 24 houres, may by that violent rotation ſeduce with it the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Air in one conſtant fluor or ſtreame; For wee obſerve that the <hi>Winds</hi> in ſome Seas change with the <hi>currents</hi> or <hi>tydes;</hi> and if ſo ſmall a force can vary the motions of the Air; how much more may wee expect from the rapid circumgyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole Terraqueous globe? <hi>De Cartes,</hi> ſpeaking of theſe <hi>Levant</hi> Winds in his diſcourſe of <hi>Meteors,</hi> ſays, <hi>Commode ratio de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duci

nequeat, niſi Univerſi fabrica ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mul explicetur.</hi> This opinion, I confeſſe, is wholly built on the <hi>Copernican Hypotheſis;</hi> yet if the Heavens move, and the Earth ſtand ſtill, according to the Vulgar and more receiv'd <hi>ſyſtem</hi> of the world, wee may render a no leſſe rationall account of the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> from other ſolid grounds.</p>
            <p>For, ſuppoſing the heat to be farre more intenſe to exhale and ſollicit vapors, between the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piques, when the Sun is <hi>Verticall,</hi> and the rays fall at right angles to the Earth: This muſt needs ſet vaſt multitudes of vapors a-float, both from Sea and Land, which may be ſufficient to furniſh mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for the <hi>Generall</hi> Wind: but then an objection may as eaſily bee
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56342:46"/>
ſtarted, why theſe Vapors, or Winds, ſtill keep in the <hi>road of the Sun?</hi> why ſhould they not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſlant aſide, and make their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions towards the <hi>Poles?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; the reſiſtence of the <hi>Atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere</hi> is greater; being remoter from the middle of the world, and the immediate juriſdiction of the Sun beams, that the winds are as it were wall'd in on both ſides, by the groſſer vapors beyond the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piques;</hi> and ſo forced to attend on the <hi>ſolar motions,</hi> where the channell is open, and the Air more <hi>yielding</hi> and refin'd by the continuall heat.</p>
            <p>Nay, <hi>even in our Seas,</hi> when no other Winds are ſtirring, you may often perceive a ſmall <hi>Air</hi> ſtill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the <hi>courſe of the Sun;</hi> and it's remarquable in dead calms
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56342:47"/>
that both the Fanes of ſhips, &amp; wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thercocks by land generally hang <hi>Weſtward.</hi> This may receive ſome Elucidation from a very obvious experiment of an iron bullet, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and drawn over the ſurface of water, that preſently invites the the ambient Air to follow the ſame courſe, as wee may diſcover by a feather, or other verſatil body ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended above the VVater; that will have an immediate tendency the ſame way, where the <hi>medium</hi> being attenuated by the heated iron becomes more pervions and rare: which methinks may be of ſome validity to explicate why theſe <hi>Univerſall Winds</hi> have that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant complyance and uniformity with the <hi>courſe of the Sun.</hi> They are likewiſe accompany'd with a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56342:47"/>
perpetuall motion of the Seas, from Eaſt to VVeſt: for the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of Air and water are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable companions, both in the <hi>South ſeas,</hi> the <hi>Pacifique, and Indian</hi> Ocean. And as the tydes are driven from the ſhoars, and returne in a thouſand <hi>Eddys,</hi> and tortuous <hi>Meanders</hi> from the land; In like manner the VVinds, though they chance to be frequently repuls't by the promontorys, and higher <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> that like ſhoars impede the <hi>Atmoſphericall</hi> currents, yet gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally between the <hi>Tropiques</hi> the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Seas and VVinds make their perennial progreſſe the ſame way.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56342:48"/>
that the waters immediately follow, as in a <hi>channell,</hi> from Eaſt to Weſt: But <hi>Voſſiius [De Motu Maris &amp; Vent.]</hi> on the contrary, do's as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly contend, that the <hi>Celeſtial</hi> beams doe, by dilating the waters, rather cauſe a greater turgency and protuberance on their ſuperficies; which therefore ſubſide towards the <hi>Occident,</hi> where the <hi>paſſage is more declive,</hi> till it be likewiſe elat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the approach of the Sun: From the ſame principles he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours the ſolution of the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Winds,</hi> that the Air riſes high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt where the Solar rays fall at more direct angles; and then, like the Seas, begin their courſe Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: of which he aſſigns no other cauſe then as before: <hi>Quia lege natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae, ab altioribus ad decliviora fit</hi>

            <p>I was lately enquiring of a very skilfull navigator, what variations he obſerv'd of the <hi>Trade</hi> Winds in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56342:49"/>
his voyages to the <hi>Weſt Indies.</hi> Who readily complying with my deſires ſent me this following account.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The <hi>Trade</hi> Winds have their Variations as well as others, though not ſo much: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Tropiques,</hi> where wee are at the greateſt certainty, they differ two or three points.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Their moſt certain points are the <hi>N E. by N. and N E. by E.</hi> I have obſerv'd both outward, and homeward bound, that as wee came <hi>Northerly,</hi> ſo wee had the more <hi>Eaſterly Winds</hi> in the ſame Latitude: As for example, outward bound, in the Latitudes of 20, 21, 22, and 23, neere the <hi>Tropique</hi> of Cancer, and in the Longitudes of 52. 53. and 54. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the ſaid Longitude at the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56342:49"/>
                  <hi>Meridian</hi> of London; I ſay, there wee found the Winds at <hi>E. N. E.</hi> and <hi>E. by N.</hi> and <hi>E.</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>E.</hi> and <hi>by S.</hi> and <hi>E. S. E.</hi> ſo likewiſe homeward bound, ſayling along the <hi>North</hi> ſide of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> in the <hi>ſame Latitudes</hi> above mention'd, neere the <hi>Tropique,</hi> wee found the Winds upon the <hi>ſame points,</hi> as a foreſaid, though there were 35 degrees of Longitude dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: but after wee have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed theſe Latitudes, and ſayling <hi>neere the line,</hi> wee ſhall then find the <hi>Trade</hi> Winds to incline more towards the <hi>N.

            </p>
            <p>But what I could not ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly collect from many reviews of our Seamens Journals, I find an Inquiſitive Perſon has obſerv'd in

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The <hi>S. Eaſt Winds</hi> begin to take place between the <hi>Aequator,</hi> and the <hi>Tropique</hi> of <hi>Capricorn:</hi> and the nearer you are to the Coaſt of Afric, they are the more <hi>Souther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> and as you approach to the Coaſt of <hi>Braſile,</hi> it inclines more and more to the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> And there is not only variation in reſpect of the <hi>Longitude,</hi> but likewiſe of the <hi>Latitude:</hi> So that neere the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator</hi> the VVind is more towards the <hi>South,</hi> then it is in the ſame <hi>Meridian</hi> neer the <hi>Tropique</hi> of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorn,</hi> where it it is conſtantly between <hi>S.</hi> E. <hi>by</hi> E. <hi>and S.</hi> E. <hi>by S.</hi>

what variations happen to the <hi>Generall Winds</hi> in reſpect to the degrees of <hi>Longitude:</hi> and for their <hi>Latitude,</hi> or diſtance from the <hi>Aequator,</hi> it's for the moſt part go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by the <hi>courſe of the Sun:</hi> which being Excentrical from the Earth, as it approaches, or devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates more or leſſe from one <hi>Tropique</hi> to another; ſo it alternately cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the ſame declinations in the <hi>Univerſall Winds:</hi> when it deflects towards the <hi>Northern ſigns,</hi> they likewiſe bend the ſame way: If the Sun be juſt about the <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall,</hi> they have the ſame Winds and tydes in the <hi>Pacifique,</hi> and ſo from <hi>Peru</hi> to the <hi>Moluccas:</hi> when it's in the Summer Solſtice, the <hi>Trade</hi> Wind reaches to at leaſt the 36<hi rend="sup">th</hi> degree of <hi>Boreal Latitude;</hi> and

            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only add, that the <hi>Levants</hi> blow much ſtronger by day then night, (as is well known to all Mariners who have ſail'd between the <hi>Tropiques)</hi> which ſhows that <hi>they</hi> rather depend on the <hi>Sun</hi> then

            <p>Theſe are the moſt Generall obſervations: but, as I before ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, the <hi>Trade</hi> VVinds looſe much of their ſoveraignty neare the ſhoars, and are frequently impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the intervention of <hi>Iſlands,</hi> and Croſſe Winds: and ſometimes the Promontorys and Land <hi>Briſes</hi> repell them from their Coaſts: yet theſe, or whatever extraneous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, can never alter the peren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial motion, but it ſtill recovers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: &amp; blowing from <hi>Africk</hi> to the <hi>American</hi> continent, and ſo through the <hi>South ſeas</hi> towards the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> &amp; from thence makes as it were a complete <hi>Tour</hi> round the world.</p>
            <p>The Ocean between <hi>Jemiac and</hi>

               <hi>Carthagene</hi> is oftentimes very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous: but neerer inclining to either ſhoars the fury of the <hi>Trade</hi> Winds is much abated, and for 20 leagues in length, at a place call'd the <hi>Keys of Cuba,</hi> it's interrupted by a Weſterly Wind that blows all the yeare round. So that it prevayles moſt in the <hi>Pacifique</hi> and other Spacious ſeas; where it runs ſtreaming without impediment along the liquid Plaines; that from <hi>New Spain</hi> to the <hi>Philippine Iſlands,</hi> they ſteer the ſame courſe, for 60 days together, and from the <hi>Cape of good Hope</hi> to St. <hi>Helens,</hi> it likewiſe conſtantly ſwells their ſayles with one ſecure and equall gale.</p>
            <p>Wee might likewiſe venture at a better account, then has hitherto been given, why the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Wind
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56342:54"/>
blows moſt commonly on this ſide the <hi>Tropiques;</hi> for the whole cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Air being carry'd from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt,</hi> it recoyls back again; and by reaſon of this repercuſſion, from about 30 degrees <hi>Latitude</hi> where the <hi>Trade</hi> VVind ceaſes, the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern</hi> begins. Here in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> uſually govern the ſpring, and wee have ſometimes variable VVinds, but generally the <hi>Weſtern</hi> ingroſſe the greateſt part of the yeare, which indeed are no more then the <hi>Tropicall</hi> VVind at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound: for not being able to return back againſt the ſtream (the <hi>Trade</hi> VVinds ſtill raigning in the <hi>Torrid Zone)</hi> it muſt needs bee diverted toward the Poles, and ſometimes produces the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and otherwhile the Laterals, <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South Weſt,</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:56342:54"/>
as the Angles are more direct or acute in their reflexion.</p>
            <p>Thus, from the ſame <hi>Latitude</hi> where the <hi>Trade</hi> Wind ends, there uſually begins a motion contrary to the courſe of the Sun, by which wee ſail from <hi>Weſt</hi> to <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and ſo much the more or leſſe, as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects towards either of the <hi>Poles.</hi> wherefore thoſe who navigate from the <hi>Moluccas</hi> to the <hi>Weſtern</hi> parts of <hi>America,</hi> being never able to hold on their courſe in the <hi>middle,</hi> and beare up againſt the <hi>Generall</hi> VVind, fetch a compaſſe beyond the <hi>Tropiques,</hi> ſometimes to 36, and otherwhile to 40; as the courſe of the Sun, and conſequently the <hi>Winds</hi> and <hi>Tydes,</hi> incline more or leſſe towards the <hi>North</hi> or <hi>South.</hi> And ſo thoſe that ſail from <hi>Barha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos

               <hi>denſity of the Atmoſphere may occaſion Winds.</hi> But whatever be the particular mode of their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they ſeeme to be univerſally govern'd by the <hi>motion of the ſun.</hi> When firſt he ſalutes our <hi>Horizon,</hi> they begin inſenſibly to fanne, and agitate the Air, blowing freſher by degrees, as the <hi>Celeſtiall</hi> heat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayles, and are higheſt at 12 of the clock; and ſo continue till 2 or 3, and then ſlacken, and (as it were) decline with the Sun.

and it would queſtionleſſe prove ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obliging to the learned world, to make a complete collection of ſuch obſervations, as might any way contribute to a more perfect hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Briſes.</hi> For example, firſt how they differ according to the ſeverall <hi>Latitudes</hi> and meridians, 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are perenniall, as between the <hi>Tropiques,</hi> or laſt only the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> Months, as moſt in the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Zones:</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> what obſtructions they meet with from the <hi>Univerſall Briſe,</hi> or other croſſe VVinds. And Laſtly the nature of the ſhoars, Currents, and hills where they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. In the foremention'd Iſle of <hi>Jamaica</hi> the Land Winds depend ſo much on the ſituation of the mountain, that they reach to all parts at an equall diſtance from

thence: and therefore an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon has obſerv'd in his voyage to the <hi>Caribbes Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid</hi>

            <p>In theſe parts of the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> the Sea Winds are cooleſt, and moſt refreſhing, which the people receive with their windows open, the fronts of their houſes being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally built on purpoſe for their reception; and they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no leſſe quickend by the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable gale, which is as great a Luxury to thoſe <hi>Regions,</hi> as ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with us; and ſo cheriſhing to the inhabitants, that ſick perſons,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56342:62"/>
if they can poſſibly creep out of their Hammocks or beds, neglect not this opportunity of reviving their ſpirits. In ſo much that wee may judge concerning the ſalubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of many <hi>African</hi> and <hi>American</hi> climats, from the nature of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> for thoſe which want the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſalutes of the <hi>Sea Wind,</hi> are ſcarce inhabitable by the exceſſe of heat.

ſtreamers in the Old or New world.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place wee muſt note, that the <hi>Terreinhos,</hi> and <hi>Briſes</hi> of all ſorts ſucceed a calme; wherein happily the matter of which they conſiſt, forms it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>They come in the day time from the Seaward; yet not always from one poinr of the compaſſe, but ſeverall, as the land lyes. On the coaſt of <hi>Carthagene</hi> from the Eaſt; on the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Trinidad,</hi> and ſo likewiſe at <hi>Guiana</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> from the <hi>North;</hi> At <hi>Jamaica South</hi> upon one ſide of the Iſland, and <hi>North</hi> upon the other.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Guiny</hi> (and from 6. degrees of <hi>N. Latitude</hi> to the <hi>Aequinoctiall,)</hi> the <hi>Sea Briſes</hi> arrive at S. S. <hi>W.</hi> to the S. <hi>W.</hi> Their beginning is at 9,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56342:63"/>
or 10 of the clock in the morning, and they continue till 10, 11, or 12, at night, blowing a freſh gale, which extremely cheriſhes the Natives &amp; white men.</p>
            <p>At 10, 11, or 12, at night they ceaſe; giving place to the <hi>Land Winds,</hi> which continue till morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from the <hi>North</hi> to the <hi>N.

This I was inform'd by a skillfull Maſter of a ſhip, who had made ſeverall voyages to <hi>Guiny;</hi> whom I ſhall have occaſion to mention more particularly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>On the coaſts of <hi>Malabar</hi> (if wee may rely upon <hi>Linſchoten,</hi> and <hi>Varenius</hi> (who pretends in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to have diligently conſulted the Sea mens journalls) from <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> to <hi>Aprill,</hi> which is the time of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56342:63"/>
their Summer, the <hi>Eaſterly</hi> Winds blow off the land, about 12 at night, &amp; continue till 12 at noone, reaching 10 miles into the Ocean; Then the <hi>VVeſtern</hi> make to ſhoar, as it were the former reflected back again; the Vapors and clouds being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately reſolv'd into VVinds, by the <hi>riſing, and ſetting Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Braſile, Madagaſcar,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Caribbe-Iſlands,</hi> they have no <hi>Land Briſe,</hi> eſpecially if the ſhoars lye low, as at <hi>Barbados,</hi> where the <hi>Generall</hi> or <hi>Levant.</hi> Wind blows from one end of the Iſle to the other; and ſervs inſtead of the <hi>Viracoins</hi> or <hi>Sea-briſe.</hi> Here (as I was inform'd by one of the chiefe Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who liv'd ſeverall years upon the place) it begins to riſe about 7, or 8 in the morning, riſing higher
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56342:64"/>
               <hi>with the Sun</hi> till 12, when it blows with a very ſtrong Gale; and ſo laſts at the ſame height till towards 3 in the afternoon, and then ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens at <hi>Sun ſetting.</hi> As the <hi>Trade</hi> VVind generally blows freſher by day then night.</p>

It would be further enquir'd into, whether there be any <hi>Terreinhos,</hi> but from high lands: for at <hi>Barbados</hi> they have rarely any <hi>Land Briſe,</hi> the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> being ſole Monarchs of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: but at <hi>Jamaica,</hi> which lyes not above 4 or 5 degrees from thence, and within the <hi>Tropiques,</hi> they have alſo the <hi>Land Winds</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly

every Night, which drive a way the <hi>Levants</hi> from their ſhoars.</p>
            <p>In other Places they want the <hi>Sea-Briſe:</hi> and for the moſt part, where the Ocean lyes VVeſterly between the <hi>Tropiques:</hi> as the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern</hi> Kingdomes of <hi>Afric; Gualata, Hoden,</hi> about <hi>Cape Verde,</hi> and the river <hi>Niger, Malaguta, Congo:</hi> ſo in <hi>America</hi> on the Coaſts of <hi>New Spain, Chiapa, Hondura,</hi> &amp;c. where the <hi>Trade</hi> VVind raigns perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and ſuffers not the <hi>Sea-Briſe</hi> to approach their Coaſts.

            <p>The <hi>Briſes</hi> in the <hi>Straights</hi> begin about 9, or 10 in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, blowing freſheſt at noon, and ſo gradually declining till 4 or 5, at laſt ceaſe in a Calme: which laſts till 10, 11, or 12, at night: VVhen begins the <hi>Land Briſe</hi> till 5 or 6; and then Calme, till the <hi>Sea Briſe</hi> comes in. This account I receiv'd from a Sea Captain well vers'd in all parts of the <hi>Levant:</hi> having ſerv'd under the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſeverall years in thoſe Seas.</p>
            <p>At the river of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> the VVinds commonly blow tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough; but in exceeding fair VVea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you ſhall have both the <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Sea Briſes,</hi> as in the <hi>Straights.</hi>

               <hi>Briſes of all ſorts are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in Summer, then Winter; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Tropiques, then in the Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Zones.</hi>

            <p>The Eteſians or Anniverſary VVinds <hi>are thoſe which blow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly at certain ſeaſons of the yeare.</hi> The moſt remarkable ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

begin in Summer about the riſe of the Dog ſtarre; and laſt 40 days, being preceded by their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromi,</hi> or <hi>Fore-runners</hi> 8, or 10 days.</p>
            <p>The account of <hi>Pliny</hi> is not much different from <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> as he computes their <hi>Eteſians,</hi> in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> book of his <hi>Naturall Hiſtory.</hi>

then the Foggs, and groſſe vapors of the <hi>North.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were call'd the <hi>Sleepy</hi> VVinds: <hi>Venti Delicati, &amp; Somni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culares;</hi> by reaſon they intermit in the night time, and riſe again with the Sun: happily becauſe the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors were then only ſufficiently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the celeſtiall beams, though in the night time they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and hover neare the Earth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too refrigerate and denſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute VVinds, till they are again quicken'd, &amp; put in motion by the approaches of the Sun.</p>
            <p>I am willing to acquieſce in the aforeſaid cauſe; and I believe wee in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> might owe our <hi>Eteſians</hi> to <hi>Groenland,</hi> and other parts of the <hi>Frozen Zones,</hi> becauſe wee have no conſtant viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

theſe being maſter'd by the ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heats of Summer, may give birth to their <hi>Eteſian</hi> Winds: which has this advantage over the other opinion, that it clears the difficulty, why they are ſilent in the night, and blow with freſher Guſts at Midday, when the Sun mounts higheſt in the <hi>Northern Hemiſphere.</hi> I ſhall only adde, not to mention ſeverall others of the modern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalliſts, that even * <hi>Cabeus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who was a perſon ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficiently Zealous in aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Towards the <hi>Adriatique,</hi> and many parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> they have <hi>Set Winds</hi> which arrive from the <hi>N.</hi> and <hi>N.

rather <hi>Southerly Winds;</hi> which <hi>Scaliger</hi> (who was beſt able to judge of his own Country) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be unwholeſome and Peſtilentiall.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Madrid</hi> for the moſt part of the Summer they have a <hi>Briſe</hi> from the <hi>Pyreneans,</hi> or the Adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <hi>Guadarama,</hi> which extremely allays the exceſſe of heat.</p>
            <p>You ſhall have different ſorts of Winds from the ſame Snowy mountain, blowing to ſeverall quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, according to the ſituation of the Countrys: As was obſerv'd in thoſe Countrys by the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd <hi>Cabeus: Saepe nobis Boreas, &amp; Borealibus Auſter Spirat:</hi> It being not unuſuall for them in <hi>Lombardy</hi> to feel a <hi>Northerly,</hi> and at <hi>Tirol,</hi> which is ſituate on the contrary

            <p>In <hi>Italy</hi> they can never fail of <hi>Ete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> from their own <hi>Appennines;</hi> and ſo happily on the ſhoare of <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarat,</hi> and the Indian Ocean, from mount <hi>Caucaſus:</hi> And where ever great Chains or ridges of Hills run along, as the <hi>Caucaſean</hi> or <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine,</hi> this very often renders an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of moſt <hi>Eteſians</hi> there about: Yet I queſtion whether many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors may not aſcribe too much to this one cauſe: for in ſome places they have <hi>Anniverſary Winds,</hi> that can never poſſibly have their riſe from the <hi>Reſolution of Snows.</hi> And, I believe, it would prove extremely difficult, to lay down any tolerable <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> of the <hi>Monſoons</hi> on the Coaſts of <hi>Afric,</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> from

            <p>Their Principall Efficient is the Sun: and though it will be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to explain the particular Mode, yet both the Currents and VVinds are moſt certainly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd by that <hi>Soveraign Planet:</hi> which alternately reſolves the Snows, and bringing Summer with it to either <hi>Tropique,</hi> attenuates the Clouds and Stagnant Air, which condens'd in the VVinter.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56342:75"/>
By this means, paſſing from one <hi>Hemiſphere</hi> to another, and Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Elementary World, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>finds</hi> or <hi>Provides</hi> materialls for the Anniverſary finds; which occaſions the <hi>Monſoons</hi> to blow with little variation, at the ſame ſeaſons of the yeare; eſpecially in the <hi>Indian</hi> Ocean, where the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are more conſtant, and fewer inequalitys, then in narrower Seas, where they never keepe the ſame quarter long, but are repercus'd from the Promontorys, and come down in Changeable Puffs, and Eddys of VVind; as both <hi>Drake</hi> and <hi>Candiſh</hi> found in the <hi>straights</hi> of <hi>Magellan;</hi> which renders the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage ſo very difficult into the <hi>South Seas.</hi> But were the whole Sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Globe of the ſame equall and

            </p>
            <p>In relation to their <hi>Qualities:</hi> I before rejected the <hi>Hot and Dry Exhalations,</hi> as too narrow, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to reſolve the innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of VVinds; for they conſiſt no leſſe of Omnigenous <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56342:76"/>
Salts</hi> and <hi>Mineralls,</hi> with other different ſpecies of matter; and we muſt expect their <hi>Qualities</hi> to be <hi>Various,</hi> as they have greater or leſſe <hi>Allays</hi> of ſuch Bodys.</p>
            <p>Some of them are <hi>Corroſive,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Suffocating</hi> and <hi>Peſtilentiall;</hi> they are ſometimes <hi>Hot,</hi> and then <hi>Cold</hi> from the <hi>ſame Quarter,</hi> and ſo ſucceſſively capable of all <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>Extremes,</hi> according to the Diverſity of their <hi>Conſtituent parts,</hi> or <hi>Mediums</hi> in which they blow. This might appear from many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Experiments: Let them paſs thorough a Tunnell or Pipe of a convenient length, but much wider at one end then the other, that it may give free admiſſion to the Air: in the cavity of which ſtrew ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſorts of <hi>Aromatics</hi> and odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56342:77"/>
herbs, ſuch as Thyme, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Violets, &amp;c. then let it be ſtuck in the wall of ſome houſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the open fields, with the larger end obverted to the VVinds, and the leſſer ſo plac'd to conveigh them into the houſe, (ſomewhat after the manner of the <hi>Italian Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiducts)</hi> and you ſhall have the whole roome perfumed with a pleaſant, and agreable ſmell: but inſtead of theſe, if you put in herbs or mineralls, with <hi>Virulent,</hi> &amp; <hi>Delete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> Qualities; you ſhall have ſome complaining of their heads; others ſeas'd with Lipothymies, and inclin'd to ſleepe, when the ſtupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factive fumes enter together with the VVinds, and ſurpriſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. The ſame we may conclude of all ſuch whoſe component par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56342:77"/>
are either noxious in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or make their entry through unwholeſome places, which are ſtord with Antimony, Mercury, or other Putrid and Arſenicall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors.</p>
            <p>I made diverſe tryalls of this nature, inſtead of common Water: I fill'd the <hi>Aeolipile</hi> with water diſtill'd from roſes, which genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted VVinds with a very gratefull Perfume; afterwards, I experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the ſame with ſeverall ſorts of liquids; I likewiſe caſt in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire,</hi> and then ſmall ſhavings of <hi>Juniper Wood,</hi> into the <hi>Aeolipile,</hi> that ſent out flatulent ſteams ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the bodys injected: which makes it evident that the <hi>Qualitys</hi> of VVinds are oftentimes deriv'd from their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56342:78"/>
particles.</hi> But as to the <hi>Medium</hi> through which they paſſe; I judg'd the uſe of the <hi>Aeolipile</hi> by no means ſuitable to my deſign in diſcovering their degrees of heat or cold; the Winds generated therein being actually hot before: ſo I caus'd to be made a Tinne pipe about 4 foot long, which I fitted to the noſe of a pair of bellows, and covering it with a mixture of ſnow and ice; perceiv'd the. VVind which paſs'd through the pipe to be very exceſſively cold: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Organs are not all ways equally diſpos'd, nor indeed are they ſufficient <hi>Criteria,</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd on in ſuch nice caſes, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made uſe of an <hi>Hermetically-Seal'd</hi> VVeather-glaſſe; and blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereon, found a very viſible
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56342:78"/>
alteration in the liquor of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-glaſſe, which being ventilated from the ſame bellows wrought no ſuch effect, before the Frigorific mixture was apply'd. I afterward heated the Pipe in the Fire, through which the Winds ſhould paſſe, and there came forth an exceeding Hot blaſt. So farre upon all accounts may the <hi>Diſpoſition of the Medium influence the Tranſient Winds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If wee further enquire upon what account Winds thus farre ſympathize with their <hi>Mediums:</hi> wee muſt acknowledge it to be no dreame of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall effluviums doe iſſue from all materiall concretes; And the Winds not only bear off with them thoſe particles which are already
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56342:79"/>
diſengag'd from their textures, but help to looſen others; that ther's ſcarce any Body ſo ſolid, which pays them not ſome tribute as they paſſe. Thoſe which have made no farre excurſions from their Fountains, cannot be much adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the way, and ſo preſerve their firſt <hi>Qualitys</hi> entire: But the <hi>Travelling</hi> Winds, that arrive from remote Countrys, and drive before them different ſpecies of Air, and mingle with other Heterogeneous exhalations in their paſſage, they are at laſt quite overcome by them; and ſo farre influenc'd by their long entercourſe with the <hi>medium,</hi> that they almoſt Univerſally borrow their <hi>Temperament</hi> and <hi>Propertys</hi> from thence. The Winds in <hi>Italy</hi> which blow over the groves of <hi>Myrtle</hi> doe often perfume the Air
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56342:79"/>
for many miles; and in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys where the Roſemary grows wild in the fields, the ſmell thereof has been carry'd a conſiderable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from their Coaſts. The <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> are accounted Soultry and troubleſome in <hi>Spain;</hi> yet on the ſhoars of <hi>Murcia,</hi> where they come off the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable and pleaſant. The <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montanas</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> are often more piercing then the ſharpeſt <hi>North Winds,</hi> either in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>France;</hi> becauſe they blow from the Snowy mountains. And I might inſtance in a remarque out of <hi>Captain James. The Southerly Wind was then coldeſt: the reaſon I conceive to be, for that it did blow off the Main Land, which was all cover'd with Snow, and the N. Winds came out of the Bay which was hitherto open.</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:56342:80"/>
I conclude, that VVinds have more frequently their <hi>Qualitys,</hi> from the Places or <hi>Mediums</hi> through which they paſſe, (or at leaſt from the <hi>Fountains</hi> that gave them birth) then from the <hi>Quarters</hi> which are reputed <hi>Hot</hi> or <hi>Cold,</hi> or otherwiſe qualify'd for producing ſuch Winds.</p>
            <p>As in <hi>Holland,</hi> and the lower parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> they have very often colder weather with the <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> VVinds, though from the <hi>South,</hi> then with the <hi>N.</hi> or <hi>N. E.</hi> which paſſe over the Sea, and mingle with the <hi>tepid</hi> vapors of the <hi>Ocean.</hi> The <hi>Southern</hi> Blaſts to us here in <hi>England</hi> are accounted nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious and Peſtilentiall; but to certain <hi>African</hi> Provinces, health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and Pleaſant. The <hi>Northerly</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:56342:80"/>
are coldeſt in our <hi>European World,</hi> and the <hi>Southerly</hi> on the <hi>other ſide</hi> of the <hi>Aequinoctiall.</hi> For the <hi>Arc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> and <hi>Antarctick</hi> VVinds muſt needs be of the ſame nature, blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from either of the Poles, where the cold is equally predominant. So that the <hi>Qualitys</hi> of many VVinds ſeeme not ſo much to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the <hi>Points of the compaſſe,</hi> as the <hi>Courſe of the Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Eaſtern Winds</hi> according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> are hot and dry: nor is their Siccity only remarkable in <hi>Greece, Paleſtine, Aſia</hi> the <hi>Leſſe,</hi> and moſt parts of <hi>Africk,</hi> where they make long marches over the parcht and barren ſands; but likewiſe in the more temperate climes of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> by reaſon they paſſe through <hi>Poland, Germany,</hi> &amp;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56342:81"/>
other vaſt tracts of Land; and laſtly arriving at our Iſle, they can ſuffer no conſiderable alteration in their qualitys, by ſo ſmall a paſſage over the <hi>Narrow Seas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are no very welcome gueſts to us in <hi>England,</hi> being omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous to our Gardens &amp; Fields, by blaſting the corn and fruits. I have known ſtrange deſtruction done in one Night, when they come late in the ſpring. Sometimes they not only blite the leaves and bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, but kill the Trees with their poyſonous breath. They bring after them ſwarms of Caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and other devouring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects; or thoſe dry and tabid miſts, which corrupt the lungs, and cauſe Epilepſys, Conſumptions, &amp;c. whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by driving before them the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56342:81"/>
Air from <hi>Holland,</hi> or however they contract that malignity in their natures. Nevertheleſs wee can make no Generall concluſions of their propertys from hence, which are chang'd by innumerable acidents. For though in theſe Countrys of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> they are inauſpicious both to animals and plants: yet in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> the <hi>Eaſtern Briſe</hi> is refreſhing, and healthfull above all other VVinds. In <hi>Arabia</hi> and thoſe <hi>Aſiatique</hi> regions they are exceedingly dry, by travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for many thouſand leagues over the ſandy deſarts; yet <hi>Blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> obſerves them to be rather hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid in <hi>Italy,</hi> and to occaſion a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting in the Air, where they blow immediately from the <hi>Adriatique Seas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:56342:82"/>
In relation to their degrees of heat, though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> declares they are much hotter then the Weſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wee find by experience that with us in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Eaſterly</hi> are at certain Seaſons of the yeare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding cold, and very often the moſt freeſing winds, eſpecially if they hang ſomewhat towards the <hi>North.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need aſſign no other cauſe, for the frigidity of the <hi>Easterly</hi> Winds, then that they have their firſt riſe from the Continent, where the <hi>Midland</hi> Air is much colder then the <hi>Maritime.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>South Winds</hi> are generally reputed <hi>Hot</hi> and <hi>Moiſt,</hi> on this ſide the <hi>Line,</hi> being heated in their entry through the <hi>Torrid Zone;</hi> or becauſe they conſiſt not of melted
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56342:82"/>
Snows, as the <hi>Northern,</hi> but of the <hi>Tepid</hi> and Sulphury ſteams from <hi>Africk,</hi> and other Sunburn'd climes.</p>
            <p>They paſſe over no Seas of any large extent, juſt croſſing the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean,</hi> and <hi>Britiſh,</hi> yet they moiſten and relax the Air, and cauſe wet weather by diſſolving the Clouds into rain, which are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſſipated and blown over by the impetuous <hi>Norths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet I think it very irrationall to conclude that all the <hi>Southerly,</hi> ſhould have their riſe from the <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid;</hi> or the <hi>Northerly</hi> VVinds, from the <hi>Frigid Zones.</hi> Since it is not unknown to the Curious that in part of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> they have very often <hi>Northerly</hi> VVinds (riſing as is ſuppos'd from ſome
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56342:83"/>
places about the <hi>Alps)</hi> whereof they are not at all ſenſible in other Countrys of <hi>France,</hi> through which they muſt of neceſſity paſſe, if they came ſo farre <hi>North.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> and in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean,</hi> they have oftentimes <hi>Southerly</hi> VVinds; when they blow from contrary points on the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Continent, which lyes more to the <hi>South.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe very few of the <hi>South</hi> Winds here in <hi>England</hi> ever took a longer flight then from the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, or the lower parts of <hi>France;</hi> and it can ſcarce be ſuppos'd that the ſame Numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Exhalations could ever travell from between the <hi>Tropiques,</hi> and not be ſpent in the way, long er'e they arrive at the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Coaſts;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56342:83"/>
yet happily by protruding the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient Air, and that ſucceſſively the Contiguous to it; the motion may at length be Propagated many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Miles beyond the reach of thoſe vapors which caus'd the firſt Agitation. So that it is not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that a VVind which began neer the <hi>Aequinoctiall,</hi> may by this means, be continued, even to the <hi>Poles</hi> of the VVorld. However I ſhall make no longer digreſſions concerning their <hi>Extent,</hi> but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the <hi>Qualitys</hi> which are vulgarly aſcrib'd to the <hi>Southerly</hi> VVinds.</p>
            <p>They are <hi>laxative, ſtupefactive, and peſtilentiall;</hi> They cauſe <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſies</hi> and pains in the head, and were therefore ſtyld <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by the <hi>Grecians:</hi> They render men <hi>Shaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grin</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:56342:84"/>
and <hi>melancholy,</hi> and in ſome of the <hi>Azores</hi> Iſlands, the children are ſaid to ſit dejected and leave their playing when they blow. For firſt they open the pores of our bodys by their heat, and then inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate the malignant influences; and the parts being pointed and volatile have not only an eaſy ingreſſion into our blood, but thaw and unlooſe the textures of ice and ſnow: Nay it's moſt certain, that iron it ſelfe takes the file much better, when the <hi>South Wind</hi> blows, then at other times.</p>
            <p>They many times cauſe a farre rougher Sea then the moſt Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous Winds from the <hi>North,</hi> Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily becauſe they blow more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quely, and rake the Surface of the Water; when as the <hi>Northerly</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56342:84"/>
deſcend, as from a precipice downwards, which immediately deads and weakens their force.</p>
            <p>They <hi>magnify</hi> viſible objects: As our Seamen obſerve their ſhips to appeare bigger at a diſtance, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in miſty weather, or when the <hi>South Wind</hi> blows. For the <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid</hi> and <hi>nebulous</hi> vapors of which they conſiſt, <hi>diſtort</hi> the viſual beams, and by refracting them to the <hi>Perpendicular,</hi> cauſe more rays of light to enter into the eye (which makes the object ſeeme larger) then otherwiſe would arrive at it in ſtrait lines.</p>
            <p>Many who are naturally inclin'd to <hi>Stammering</hi> in their ſpeech, do find their infirmity evidently worſe, when the Wind is toward the <hi>South:</hi> Probably becauſe the <hi>moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:56342:85"/>
of the Air, cauſeth a greater <hi>relaxation</hi> of the Nervs, and thereby a tremulous and unſtable motion of the muſcles, at that time. Which perhaps hath more power upon the <hi>Vocall</hi> muſcles, then others, becauſe they lye in the <hi>Road,</hi> and are more expos'd to the invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of whatever is breath'd in at the mouth or noſtrills, then others are. Whence alſo wee find the tongue more apt to falter (though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in a different manner) when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it is overmuch bedew'd with ſtrong and vaporous liquors.</p>
            <p>Smells are ſaid to be moſt <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant</hi> in theſe Winds, when the Air is humid and lax to convey the odoriferous particles. They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate the Spring; and cauſe the trees to bloſſome, and bud forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56342:85"/>
their time; and by this means exhauſt their ſpirits and nutritive juyce. They damp linnen and paper, though never ſo carefully guarded from the Air, cauſe fleſh to rot, and upon all accounts haſten <hi>putrefaction</hi> in bodys.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Weſtern</hi> have been Counted the mildeſt, &amp; moſt Auſpicious of all others; and were ſo highly in favour with the Poets, that they thought them worthy of the <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Age,</hi> and to refreſh the <hi>Elyſian</hi> groves. They are indeed cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Animals, they cauſe fertility in the Earth, and paint the flowry meades with all the verdant beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys of the ſpring. But though the Breathing <hi>Zephyrs</hi> are ſo much ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in <hi>Poems</hi> and <hi>Romances,</hi> and happily were kinder to the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56342:86"/>
Countrys of <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp; <hi>Greece,</hi> yet wee find no leſſe malignity in their natures from particular acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and climats, then what wee have obſerv'd of other Winds.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Jerſy</hi> (as I was late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inform'd by an ingenious Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of that place) they Taint and Blaſt all the plants and trees, except the white poplar (which flouriſhes beſt in thoſe Winds) and ſuffer nothing to grow a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the <hi>Weſtern</hi> ſhoare: when the <hi>Midland</hi> of the Country, and all other parts, even to the Brink of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> is very fruitfull and univerſally planted. They have an obſervation there; when it riſes on a ſuddain inſtorms, it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu's for 9 days or thereabout.</p>
            <p>They blow in this Iſle the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56342:86"/>
part of the year, but chiefly about the Aequinoxes; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in Autumn, when they are very boyſtrous, having nothing to checque their rage between that and <hi>America:</hi> and theſe they call the <hi>Michaelmas</hi> ſtorms. Beſide what is ſaid of this <hi>Iſland,</hi> the ſame effects are known in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and many parts of our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Coaſts, eſpecially towards <hi>Cornwal</hi> and the Lands End; but they render the <hi>Norman</hi> ſhoare inhabitable by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſand they blow over it: where are few or no Trees to be ſeen neer the Sea, and thoſe very ſhrubs. When they take a point of the <hi>North,</hi> they are worſt, but not long laſting.</p>
            <p>The greateſt VVinds which have been known of late years, were
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56342:87"/>
either <hi>Weſterly</hi> or from the <hi>Collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> points between the <hi>Weſt</hi> and <hi>North.</hi> One about the Death of <hi>Oliver Cromwell:</hi> And another fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for demoliſhing ſo many houſes and buildings which in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe places it levell'd to the ground. It did conſiderable Damage to moſt of the <hi>Colleges</hi> in <hi>Oxon:</hi> blew down two and twenty Elms in the Grove of <hi>Trin.

For many of thoſe houſes, which either by their ſtrength or ſituation, were able to reſiſt it's furious aſſaults, loſt their roofs, or had their chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys and barns blown down.

the <hi>Annals</hi> of our own Country will furniſh us with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſame nature, which would require as large a ſhare of credulity to believe them, if the rage of theſe <hi>Tempeſtuous</hi> Winds was not ſufficiently underſtood in moſt parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> though happily in remoter Climates, which are leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the great <hi>Diſturbers</hi> of the <hi>Northern World,</hi> they might ſeem fabulous. Some of which are ſolemny recorded in our Hiſtorys, that even exceed the <hi>Hurracanes</hi> of the <hi>Weſt Indies.</hi> Yet I have heard, that thoſe Winds, which we count very great ſtormes here in <hi>England,</hi> would be thought no wonder in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where they are accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to theſe violent Blaſts; and for this reaſon build their houſes uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56342:92"/>
with ſtone, exceeding thick, low, and with narrow win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. But not to be prolix in their Hiſtory; we might offer at the cauſe whence this ſtrang vehemence and impetuoſity of the N. VVinds does proceed. Shall we ſay from the great <hi>quantity</hi> of exhalations laid up in the Treaſuries of the <hi>North?</hi> or becauſe they find the reſiſtence leſſe toward the <hi>South,</hi> where the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> is rarified by the heat of the Sun, ſo that they glide without oppoſition through the yeilding Air, eſpecially in the day time, wherefore the aforeſaid <hi>Northerly Winds</hi> are obſerv'd to blow harder by <hi>day</hi> then <hi>night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are more Sonorous then other Winds, becauſe they rage with greater violence, and ſo make
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56342:93"/>
a ſtronger colliſion of the Air.</p>
            <p>I have thus farre conſiderd their nature in the remoter parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> where they are neareſt their Source: But after they have made a long Progreſſe <hi>Southwards,</hi> and are heated in their approaches towards the Sun, we find them in <hi>Africk</hi> to be farre different from what they were in <hi>Norwey</hi> or <hi>Iſland;</hi> and their qualityes no leſſe various then the Temperature of the Heavens. So likewiſe in <hi>America,</hi> (and as <hi>Acoſta</hi> obſervs more particularly of ſome Countrys in <hi>Peru,)</hi> the <hi>Norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Wind is counted unwholeſome, and the <hi>Southerly</hi> extremely cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing to men and beaſts: The firſt is not penetrating nor diſperſes clouds, as among us, but cauſes rain: and the <hi>South Wind</hi> is juſt qualify'd in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56342:93"/>
thoſe climes as the <hi>North</hi> is in our country's that lye nearer the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctic</hi> Pole: Nay, not only compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to different ſituations, and places, but the judgment to be made concerning the Qualitys of Winds, from the <hi>Quarters</hi> whence they blow, is very various and falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in relation to one and the ſame Latitude. Many of the hardeſt froſts, which have happend in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> began with a Southerly wind, (and then commonly are the more laſting and violent) which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs is generally much hotter then any other, which arrives at the <hi>Britiſh</hi> coaſts.</p>
            <p>I took notice, no longer ſince then the 11 of <hi>January</hi> laſt: that in the morning we had much rain (the wind being N. and N. E.) which
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56342:94"/>
ceaſing about noon, there followed, firſt a ſhowre of haile, and then a conſiderable fall of ſnow (the wind ſtill continuing at N. and N. E.) which was the moſt part of it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd by 3 or 4 in the afternoon: then the VVind vering to full South, it froze exceedingly hard for the time. So little certainty is there in obſervations of this nature, that we had Rain with a <hi>Northerly,</hi> and Froſt with a <hi>Southerly</hi> VVind in the ſame day. And not only thus, but it appear'd by the <hi>Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſe,</hi> to which I had recourſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion, that there was a very ſuddain mutation in the Air from heat to cold, when the Wind came about to the South, more then in the morning while it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued at <hi>N.</hi> and <hi>N. E.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:56342:94"/>
VVee muſt expect theſe ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Qualifications of VVinds, to happen even in the ſame Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate: ſince not only the Variety of their <hi>Component Particles,</hi> and the <hi>Fountains</hi> which gave them birth; but either the Cutting down Forreſts; Draining of Fenns: Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Currents of great rivers: Their Vicinity or Diſtance from the Courſe of the Sun: whether they blow off from Land or Sea, or Snowy Mountains; and a thouſand extraneous accidents are ſufficient to alter the Properties of Winds.</p>

            <p>Firſt: VVinds are <hi>Moiſt;</hi> either becauſe their <hi>Conſtituent parts</hi> are made up of <hi>Vapid</hi> and <hi>Aqueous</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles, ſuch as rain, dews, watry Clouds: or by reaſon they make long Voyages by Sea, or over great Lakes, Moriſh Countrys &amp; Fenns; and ſo are tainted with the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys of the <hi>Medium</hi> through which

they paſſe. Thoſe which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Melted Snows, have ſome ſmall allay of the <hi>Terrene,</hi> but approach neerer the <hi>Moiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Siccity</hi> of VVinds is from their <hi>Saline,</hi> and <hi>Terreſtriall parts:</hi> or that arriving from thoſe Parc'ht and Torrid regions neer the <hi>Line,</hi> they are exſiccated as they travell by the <hi>Ways</hi> of the <hi>Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not diſpute whether this has been cautiouſly enough minded by moſt writers, How many nice circumſtances are to be conſider'd in judging the <hi>Qualitys</hi> of VVinds; and how difficult it is, to make a juſt Eſtimate of their ſeverall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Heat and Cold. For there muſt not only be eſpeciall regard had to the <hi>Temperament</hi> of our <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> but to the <hi>Climes</hi> in which
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56342:97"/>
they blow; and ſeaſons of the year; Since thoſe which would ſeem hot at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to the winter <hi>Cold,</hi> ſhould the ſame happen in <hi>July,</hi> when wee had been long accuſtom'd to a <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent temperature</hi> of our <hi>Organs</hi> and the <hi>Ambient Air,</hi> would undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly appeare exceedingly <hi>Cold.</hi> Then wee denominate VVinds ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gelid or Hot, in reſpect of thoſe that uſually blow in ſuch Climats: as the <hi>Southern</hi> Blaſts with us here in <hi>England</hi> (though they are Colder then the Ambient Air) may be reputed Hot, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively to the <hi>N.</hi> or <hi>N.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56342:97"/>
conſider what Symptoms of Heat, they betray in relation to <hi>Weather-glaſſes,</hi> or the Winds that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly blow in ſuch Countrys: as likewiſe, what mutations hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by them in the Temperature of the Air: And afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare all theſe Circumſtances with the preſent diſpoſition of our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, leaſt wee determine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the poſitive Qualitys of VVinds, from only the Prejudices, and Hallucinations of <hi>Senſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſeverall Cauſes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of <hi>Heat:</hi> As their paſſage through <hi>Hot Regions;</hi> Or becauſe they conſiſt of the <hi>ignite</hi> and ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating <hi>Air,</hi> which infeſts the <hi>Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Zone;</hi> where the whole Maſſe is corrupted with ſuch intolerable heats, that the Winds which are
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56342:98"/>
either generated therein, or only pervade the <hi>Torrid regions,</hi> muſt needs, for ſome time, retain their temperament and Qualitys: till at length they looſe them in long voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and the calorifique particles languiſh and dwindle away by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, being oppres'd with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Heterogeneous exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their courſe. Then, I think it not improbable, but that the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar rays, or whatever parcells beſide of the <hi>Subtil</hi> and <hi>Aetheriall</hi> matter, may by mingling with them, actually advance the heat of VVinds. And <hi>Laſtly:</hi> The ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Damps ſuch as wee ſometimes diſcover in Colepits and Mines, and all other of the Minerall and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline Kingdomes, that finding no Vent, cauſe Earthquakes in the

wee ſuppoſe any thing <hi>Analogous</hi> to theſe under ground (where <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in her own Elaboratory often exceeds the greateſt Sagacity of <hi>Art)</hi> why may not the Tepid Steams and Vapors that aſcend from thence, be able to produce ſo conſiderable a degree of <hi>Heat</hi> in the Air, that might occaſion <hi>Scorching Winds?</hi> And happily the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters of Certain Mineralls with each other, in thoſe Paſſages where the VVaters flow, may likewiſe by their mutuall ferments, be the moſt probable cauſe of many <hi>Hot Baths &amp; Springs.</hi> Nevertheleſſe <hi>Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus,</hi> &amp; ſome other <hi>Naturaliſts</hi> of late, in the Number of which wee may reckon our Countryman Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> affirme that all VVinds whatever doe actually refrigerate,

and oftentimes ſo intenſly, that they prove the fitteſt inſtruments for the Congelation of Liquids: And I muſt confeſſe, it ſeldome falls under our obſervation, that in any parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> the VVinds are comparatively hotter then our <hi>Senſories,</hi> or the <hi>Ambient Air;</hi> yet in many Provinces of <hi>Afric</hi> &amp; <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> but moſt of all near the <hi>Perſian Gulf,</hi> where they come juſt off from the Burning Sands, they are intolerably hot and ſuffocating: as appears from the Relations of the <hi>Portugalls</hi> firſt Voyages to the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> where they felt <hi>Gales of the E.</hi> and <hi>N.

So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Gaſparo Balbi</hi> in his <hi>Travells</hi> ſpeaks of four perſons, that weary'd
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56342:100"/>
in their Journy, ſat down near the Banks of <hi>Euphrates</hi> to refreſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a while, and were all ſtifled by one of theſe <hi>Hot Winds.</hi> And wee have a more ſurpriſing Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative from <hi>Marcus Polo:</hi> that, when the King of <hi>Chermain</hi> ſent an Army of 16 Hundred horſe, and 5 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foot againſt the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Ormus,</hi> for not paying his Tribute, they all periſht by theſe Suffocating Blaſts. But if wee diſtruſt the integrity of theſe writers, <hi>Olearius</hi> in his <hi>Voyage</hi> to <hi>Perſia,</hi> deſcribes the intempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Air in thoſe Countrys to be ſuch; that with the <hi>North</hi> or <hi>Eaſt Wind</hi> they felt a Cold which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd them of their Limbs, and on the Contrary the <hi>S. Winds</hi> were ready to choak them with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of heat. But <hi>Della Valle,</hi> a

Nobleman of <hi>Rome</hi> (whoſe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity led him through moſt of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Kingdomes) reports, <q>that towards <hi>Arabia</hi> there was a VVind ſo ſcorching and Dry, that it left behind it like marks of Fire, wherever it came; and the exceſſive Heat forc'd them to keep their legs naked, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo red and inflam'd, that without the greateſt Torment, they could not endure to ſet them on the ground.</q> In ſome places of the Country, theſe <hi>Soultry Gales</hi> laſt from 9 in the morning, till noon; which are ready to ſtifle the inhabitants, and blowing immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from the <hi>Scorching Sands,</hi> the people many times lye in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to reſcue themſelves from the intolerable Heats. <hi>Della Valle</hi>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:56342:101"/>
ſays, that they are call'd in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls of <hi>Perſia, Bad Semum,</hi> i. e. <hi>Burning</hi> and <hi>Venemous</hi> VVinds.</p>
            <p>I have heard the like relations from many of our Sea Captains, who trade on the <hi>Arabian</hi> or <hi>African</hi> Coaſts: ſo that I think Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> or any other of the Modern <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralliſts</hi> had little reaſon to queſtion the Heat of ſome Winds: though in theſe parts of the world, where they travell not over ſuch <hi>Sandy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts,</hi> and are more remov'd from the ways of the Sun, they are more ſenſibly Cold.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Gelid</hi> Winds, I underſtand thoſe which are colder then our <hi>Senſories,</hi> or the <hi>Ambient Air.</hi> This Frigidity may happily proceed from the <hi>Nitrous</hi> particles of which they conſiſt, or whatever body elſe
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56342:101"/>
wee reckon to be the <hi>Primum Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidum;</hi> Or becauſe they have their <hi>Origine</hi> in thoſe <hi>Caverns</hi> under the Earth, where the Sun beams never penetrate, and no Subterraneall warmth is to be found. Monſieur <hi>De Cartes</hi> averrs that all <hi>Boiſtrous</hi> Winds, from <hi>whatever point</hi> of the Compaſſe they blow, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Meteor. cap.</hi> 2.</note> are Univerſally <hi>Cold and Dry:</hi> and wee find that any ſort of Air vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently mov'd by a Fanne or Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, does refrigerate; ſo that the Cold of Winds may ſomewhat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on their <hi>motion,</hi> or manner of affecting our <hi>Senſes.</hi> And ſince the <hi>Carteſians</hi> will allow <hi>Cold</hi> to be no poſitive <hi>Quality</hi> of it ſelf, but a mere <hi>Privation</hi> of Heat: then, either the abſence of their <hi>Subtil</hi> matter may cauſe the Frigidity
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56342:102"/>
of Winds; or elſe the occaſion thereof muſt be this, that they paſſe thorough the <hi>Gelid Regions</hi> which are never viſited by the <hi>Sun Beams.</hi> For as <hi>Thoſe</hi> which come from <hi>Aethiopia</hi> and other parts of the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> doe imbibe the Heat, and Sympathiſe with the nature of the places from whence they come; ſo queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the other that conſiſt of, or drive before them, the groſſe and Frigorifique Air from <hi>Groen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and other <hi>Northern Climates,</hi> muſt needs have conſiderable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays of the <hi>Mediums</hi> through which they paſſe. And within the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Circles, the abſence of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar rays for ſo many Months, do's ſufficiently conduce to the Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56342:102"/>
of Cold; ſince the Sun which us'd to correct the rigour and inclemency of the weather, is now baniſht from their <hi>Horizon,</hi> and the Air become Chill and Torpid by the long Predominance of the Cold. So that the VVinds muſt of neceſſity admit of very conſiderable alterations in their paſſage: and whether or no they conſiſt of Frigorifique particles; yet by their commerce and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with the Gelid Regions, they may draw, I know not what, Contagion from thence: As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in the foremention'd Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, how much the mixture of Snow and Ice, only by applying it to the outſide of the bellows, did ſoon infrigidate the <hi>Tranſient</hi> VVinds. For I am not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56342:103"/>
convinc'd, that <hi>Cold</hi> VVinds, proceed always from <hi>Nitre, Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniac,</hi> or other Frigorifique Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles; But ſometimes only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare ſo to us, by their particular Motions on our Senſories: As wee ſee any Air Ventilated from Fanns or Bellows, or our own breath darted with a very vehement im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe from the Mouth, appears <hi>Frigid;</hi> which if wee exhale ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and in another poſition of the lips, is rather ſenſibly <hi>Hot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus if VVinds may be ſtyl'd <hi>Cold</hi> from a ſimple <hi>Privation</hi> of <hi>Heat,</hi> and if only the want of ſome <hi>Subtil Matter,</hi> the abſence of the Sun, or other Calorifique Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, will reſolve the ſeverall <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> wee commonly aſcribe to <hi>cold;</hi> this will be ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56342:103"/>
the Refrigerative Winds; which may better be explain'd in this manner, then by the <hi>Poſitive Qualitie</hi> of the <hi>Peripatetiques,</hi> or the <hi>Nitrous,</hi> and other Frigorifique particles of the <hi>Atomiſts,</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcularian Philoſophers.</hi> I ſhall only add one circumſtance out of the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyl,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the cauſes of cold Winds. <hi>I have ſupected ſome Winds may be Cold only by conſiſting of, or driving before them, thoſe higher parts of the Air, that by reaſon of the longuid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion of the Sun beams in the Upper Region, is for the moſt part Cold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet, as I before declar'd, wee often commenſurate the <hi>Qualities</hi> of Winds, not only from their <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent Particles,</hi> or their juſt degrees of <hi>Frigidity or Heat,</hi> but ſometimes
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56342:104"/>
becauſe they are warmer then the <hi>Ambient Air,</hi> or the <hi>Winds</hi> that uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>blow</hi> in ſuch <hi>Climats;</hi> or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then thoſe <hi>membranes</hi> or <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorys,</hi> by which wee judge them. The VVinds which blow off from Sea, are farre <hi>Hotter</hi> then thoſe which come from Land. May not the <hi>Collucent Salts,</hi> which create ſuch a ſparkling and Coruſcation in Tempeſts, or other vehement Colliſion of the waves, be able to produce ſome heat in the Air and VVinds, being either actuall Flames or at leaſt making thoſe impreſſions on our Senſory's as if they were? Nevertheleſſe, ſince wee find by experience that theſe kind of <hi>Salts,</hi> with which the Sea water is impregnated, doe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>riſe</hi> up in <hi>vapors,</hi> nor being min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56342:104"/>
with liquids, any way advance their Heat; May there not be other <hi>Calorifick Effluviums</hi> (like the hot Steams in Colepits and Mines) that aſcend from the <hi>bottome</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> yet cannot ſo eaſily perſpire through the ſolider Superficies of the Earth; which renders the <hi>Maritime</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and VVinds hotter then the <hi>Midland?</hi> But whatever be the cauſe, it is moſt evident that all over <hi>Europe,</hi> the winters are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally milder in <hi>Iſlands</hi> then many places in the <hi>Continent</hi> which lye nearer the <hi>Sun.</hi> As in <hi>England</hi> then <hi>France;</hi> nay <hi>Scotland,</hi> though it be ſituate ſo farre <hi>North,</hi> has ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome more keen and piercing Froſts then <hi>Paris,</hi> or ſome Citys of <hi>Italy,</hi> which are infeſted with <hi>Terreſtriall Winds.</hi> So likewiſe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56342:105"/>
part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as in <hi>China</hi> where it runs to the <hi>Southwards</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> the winters are moſt exceſſively <hi>cold:</hi> &amp; in the 42 degree of <hi>Latitude,</hi> they have ice which laſts 3 or 4 Months together, by reaſon of the <hi>Land Winds.</hi> For this cauſe <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> though it lyes not ſo farre diſtant from the <hi>Aequator,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably colder then any parts of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> And at <hi>Virginia,</hi> as I have been inform'd, the <hi>Land Winds</hi> oftentimes ſurpriſe them with ſuch an <hi>Exceding</hi> ſharp Air, that one would think it impoſſible there ſhould be thoſe extreames of <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Cold</hi> in the ſame day. So on the Coaſts of <hi>Carolina</hi> and <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> where they have for the moſt part <hi>Midland Winds,</hi> the Colds are <hi>intolerable</hi> conſidering their no great
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56342:105"/>
diſtance from the <hi>Sun.</hi> When as the <hi>Sea-Briſe</hi> in moſt parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> is temperate and mild: I have heard, that in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Jerſy,</hi> the <hi>Myrtles,</hi> will live abroad all win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being cheriſht on every ſide, with the tepid vapors from the Sea; and that little ice they have is ſoon gone. It's alſo obſervable neare the Sea ſide here in <hi>England,</hi> as in the <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> that the Snow is generaly melted in leſſe then a weeks ſpace, and the Froſts not ſo laſting as elſewhere: Shall wee ſay the acrimony of the Sea vapors ſoon diſſolves the textures of the ice and Snow, or that they choak up and repell thoſe <hi>Frigori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique</hi> Corpuſcles, which are as the <hi>Coagulum</hi> to cement, and knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the parts of liquids? So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56342:106"/>
on the Coaſts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Complexion of the Air is much Hotter then in many other places of the ſame Latitude: and were it not environ'd with the Ocean, who would think <hi>Iſland</hi> inhabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that lyes directly under the Polar Circle?</p>
            <p>Yet this holds good only in the <hi>Temperate Zones:</hi> for in the <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid,</hi> the <hi>Sea-Briſe</hi> is refrigerative, and abating the exceſſe of heat; And contrariwiſe on the African Continent the <hi>Land-Winds,</hi> which travell o're the Burning Sands, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſuffocate the miſerable inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, which are roaſted into Ske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letons, and ſometimes looſe their Hearing and Sight by the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate <hi>Heat:</hi> Yet in part of <hi>Guiny,</hi> where the Neighbouring mountains
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56342:106"/>
defend them from the <hi>Eaſterly Winds,</hi> &amp; ſuffer the cool <hi>Sea-Briſe,</hi> to blow upon their Coaſts, how wonderfully are their Spirits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd with the delightfull gale? But though the <hi>Levants</hi> are ſo pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, when they come reaking off from the Sandy VVilderneſs, yet being Refrigerated in a long paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage o're the <hi>Pacifique Ocean,</hi> at the <hi>Caribbes,</hi> and the <hi>American</hi> Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, they become the cooleſt of all VVinds, and the greateſt bleſſing which Providence could ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on the <hi>New World,</hi> to allay the otherwiſe inſufferable heats of the <hi>Torrid Zone:</hi> Only part of <hi>Peru,</hi> though the Soyl be of it ſelfe fertile, and enrich't with all the bountys of Nature, yet on this ſide the Mountains, the <hi>Land-Winds</hi>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:56342:107"/>
render it ſterill and unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; when as <hi>Braſile</hi> enjoys a more Temperate Heaven, being bedew'd with the reflreſhing <hi>Briſe</hi> from the Adjacent <hi>Ocean.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe ſeverall inſtances it appears, that the <hi>Land-Winds</hi> muſt needs be more intenſely Heated, between the <hi>Tropiques,</hi> then in theſe parts of the VVorld, that lye ſo farre diſtant from the courſe of the Sun; And the Earth, being a denſe body, retaines the Calorifique impreſſions; when as the voluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the waves ſo often changes the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the water, that the ſame parts of the Ocean are not always expos'd to the <hi>Celeſtiall Beams:</hi> And though it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd that neare the <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall,</hi> the Surface of the Earth,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56342:107"/>
and conſequently the Winds that blow over it, are much warmer then in the Neighbourhood of the <hi>Poles;</hi> yet without diſpute the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an alſo is proportionably as much Hotter then our Seas; And though the <hi>Sea-Winds</hi> ſeeme Refrigera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive with them, which rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray very great Symptoms of Heat in theſe Countrys; yet I queſtion whether this, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, may not be underſtood <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively</hi> to the diſpoſition of our <hi>Senſories,</hi> and that of the <hi>Ambient Air.</hi> For, their <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> being farre more <hi>agitated</hi> then ours, and alſo accuſtom'd to a Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate exceſſively <hi>Hot;</hi> they muſt of neceſſity have different <hi>Percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> from us, who live in the <hi>Colder</hi> Regions of the VVorld.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:56342:108"/>
But beſide theſe <hi>Vulgar</hi> or <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Qualities</hi> of VVinds, they have almoſt infinite Variety in their Natures, according to the ſeverall <hi>Subjects</hi> they can operate upon; and their <hi>Propertys</hi> are various, as the different <hi>impreſſions</hi> which they make upon other Bodys. For thoſe which are <hi>Corroſive,</hi> in reference to iron, or ſtone, may prove <hi>Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall</hi> to men; and one and the ſame <hi>Quality</hi> have one denomination, as it relates to <hi>Beaſts,</hi> a ſecond to <hi>Birds,</hi> and a third to <hi>Inſects,</hi> according to the different <hi>Capacities</hi> of the <hi>Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient.</hi> Some Winds are obſerved to raiſe ſtrange diſturbances, and (as it were) Convulſions in Swine. And thoſe who keep Silk-worms, are ſaid to ſhut their Windows, and protect them from the <hi>South-Wind,</hi>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:56342:108"/>
which cauſes their ſicknes and death; but readily expoſe them to the <hi>North,</hi> which conduces as much to their vigour and health. So that we can never pretend to a perfect knowledge of their <hi>Qualities,</hi> unleſs we underſtood their <hi>relations</hi> to all <hi>other bodies</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p>But among the wonders of Winds, we muſt not paſs by the <hi>Harmatans</hi> of <hi>Guiny;</hi> which, for the time they blow, cauſe Wainſcoats and Planks to open and gape, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wide chaſms in the moſt ſolid and imporous wood. I could inſert many teſtimonies of this nature from credible perſons; ſeverall who lived in thoſe Countries, and not a few of our Seamen, have been witneſſes of their ſtrange ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: I ſhall inſtance in one relation
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56342:109"/>
which was communicated to me by Captain <hi>Peachy,</hi> who was long employd in the <hi>African</hi> Trade by the <hi>Royall</hi> Company.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The <hi>Harmetan</hi> VVinds, ſo called by the <hi>Natives,</hi> come but once a year, conſtantly in <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> about <hi>Chriſtmas;</hi> and bring a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unwholſome Vapour.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Their arrivall is for the moſt part at the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and they go no farther then the <hi>E. N. E.</hi> their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance is 4 or 5 days, not blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard, but with an eaſy gale: the Natives are full of Aches and Pains in theſe times, and care not for ſtirring out of doors.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Trees that are ſtanding, during their continuance, will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that you may put in your knife and ſheath: ſo will the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56342:109"/>
boards of the floors, when as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was nothing ſeen, and after they are gone, they cloſe up again to their wonted place.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This may proceed from their extreme <hi>Siccity,</hi> when they blow off the Sands, in that exceeding <hi>Hot Climate;</hi> as wee ſee boards chop and gape, that are kept over dry; and more in Chambers or Cock-lofts, then lower rooms; and ſo likewiſe moſt ſorts of wood, by lying long in the Sun, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſts their moyſture: The known remedy in ſuch caſes, is, to ſoak them thoroughly in water, by which means, they oftentimes ſwell again into their former dimenſions: ſo poſſibly may the trees, and planks in <hi>Guiny,</hi> when the <hi>Harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> are gone, and ſome Moyſter
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56342:110"/>
VVind ſucceeds, which brings with it a more Humid and relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Air. VVee have obſerv'd ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this nature in ſome of our very Drying <hi>March-VVinds;</hi> and therefore the workers of Muſicall Inſtruments commonly chuſe to dry their materials at that time of the yeare; which, as they think, renders them more <hi>reſounding</hi> &amp; <hi>harmonious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have not as yet had ſufficient opportunity to ſatisfy my ſelfe in one Curious enquiry which belongs to the Hiſtory of VVinds: only, thus much I have heard, that, when a certain VVind blows at <hi>Florence,</hi> the weavers of the fineſt ſilks leave off their work; finding by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that it quite ſpoyles the Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy &amp; Brightneſs of their Colours; ſo that they can by no diligence or
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56342:110"/>
invention ſeclude it out of their work-houſes, to hinder the ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof. It is a cold Wind, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps blowing off from the Snowy Hills, where it gathers thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding Salts, which alter the tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſuperficiall parts; and by cauſing new modifications of light, change the colours of ſilks. As the richeſt and moſt florid dyes of Scarlet are not only ſoon faded in a ſhowre of rain, but it has been obſerv'd, that they ſuffer prejudice, and looſe ſomewhat of their luſtre, if they be worne much in miſty weather: and ſo poſſibly certain ſpecies of <hi>Air</hi> or <hi>Winds,</hi> may be able to make the like kind of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on thoſe <hi>Florentine</hi> ſilks.</p>
            <p>VVee find by experience that ſome VVinds produce very odd
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56342:111"/>
effects in many ſorts of <hi>Animals</hi> and <hi>Plants;</hi> and others convey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Air ſpirits ſo ſubtil and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating, which diſſolve the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of <hi>Metals.</hi> That inquiſitive <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> in his <hi>Naturall Hiſtory of</hi> the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> gives us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the iron grates, which in thoſe parts were ſo much ruſted and conſum'd with the Winds, that by only preſſing them between your fingers they diſſolv'd into Powder. VVhich has likewiſe been obſerv'd of the Air about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> (whether from thoſe Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſalts, or the great quantity of Sulphur contain'd in the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coale) that it does not only ſpoyl Tapiſtrys, and beds, tarniſh the moſt poliſht ſilver plate, fowl linnen and paper, and ſully all ſorts
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56342:111"/>

I ſhall not undertake to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophiſe concerning the cauſe of the former <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> unleſſe wee were better acquainted with the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations of thoſe places in the <hi>Weſt Indies:</hi> Only wee are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently inform'd, that in ſome of the <hi>American</hi> Kingdomes, the Earth exhales very noxious vapours, that occaſion a ſtrange contagion in the Air; though impartiall Nature has recompenc'd this inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with many bleſſings which the <hi>Old World</hi> did never enjoy: In the plains of <hi>Peru</hi> they have a

VVind which kills men (if wee may give credit to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) without the leaſt ſenſe of pain and afterwards by it's extreme Subtlety and cold, preſerves them from Putrefaction. Since the firſt diſcovery of <hi>Almagro,</hi> great numbers of perſons have been found dead in thoſe <hi>Deſarts;</hi> ſome loſt their feet and hands, that were rotted by theſe Virulent Blaſts, which happend to the <hi>Generall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilla,</hi> and many others of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> who travelled into thoſe parts: Inſomuch that the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> who formerly us'd to paſſe over the Plains between <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Chile,</hi> rather undertake a laborious voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age by the Sea-ſide, then hazard the diſaſters which they might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe expect from theſe VVinds.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56342:112"/>
But, I inſiſt not upon inſtances, for which wee have no further evidence of truth, then the credit of the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: yet we muſt ſuppoſe that there is quite another <hi>Face</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> in thoſe remote Climates; therefore wee ought not to explode all things as <hi>falſe,</hi> that are only <hi>different</hi> from ſuch obſervations, to which we have been accuſtom'd in theſe parts of the world.</p>
            <p>The Winds neare <hi>Serra di Lyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> where the Neighbouring Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains abound with many putrid &amp; Sulphureous exhalations, breath out in ſuch venemous Blaſts, that they breed Peſtilentiall Feavers, and other diſeaſes in the inhabitants. So very conſiderable are their <hi>influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> not only in other regards, but to the benefit, or prejudice of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56342:113"/>
life;</hi> For a kind Temperature of the Heavens, Serene Air, and wholeſome VVinds, which is the <hi>Atmoſphericall</hi> dyet, are full as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Health &amp; welfare of Mankind, as good meat or Drinke.</p>
            <p>Thoſe likewiſe which have their <hi>Origines</hi> from ſuch Subterraneall Caverns, that exhale noxious Fumes, like the Killing Damps in deep pits or Mines, muſt needs by this means, mingle a great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, and <hi>adulterate</hi> the purity of the Air, when the virulent particles are carry'd and diſperſt by the Winds: what can wee expect but a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and unwholeſome vapour from ſuch places, as the <hi>Denne</hi> of <hi>Charon</hi> near <hi>Naples,</hi> where the deadly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom tranſpires inſenſibly through the pores of the Earth, and ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56342:113"/>
all Animals that enter at the mouth of the Cave. <hi>Empedocles,</hi> by ſtopping up one of theſe Poiſonous Caverns, and hindring the <hi>Eruption</hi> of the <hi>Winds</hi> from thence, is ſaid to have cur'd an <hi>Epidemick</hi> ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which they had occaſion'd in all the Citys thereabout, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in <hi>Plutarch</hi> he was afterward ſtyl'd <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56342:114"/>
which come from infected places, propagate the contagion, and bring <hi>death</hi> along with the <hi>infectious</hi> Air.</p>
            <p>Thus wee ſee VVinds are not all veſted with the ſame Qualities, nor alike friendly, or injurious to Human life; but they ſometimes are replete with thoſe Arſenicall and Deleterious Corpuſcles, that convey into our blood the ſeeds of diſeaſes; and otherwhile with ſuch agreable juices, that recreate and cheriſh our ſpirits, and contribute to longevity and Health.</p>
            <p>But the wonderfull effects of Winds are more obvious to <hi>reaſon,</hi> then perceptible by the juſteſt cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriums of <hi>ſenſe;</hi> ſince the <hi>inviſible Agents</hi> are diffus'd every where; and the Air is as the common <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> of all things, where
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56342:114"/>
ſo many different ſorts of <hi>Saline</hi> and <hi>Minerall</hi> ſpirits are continually Floating, and driven to and fro in the <hi>Atmoſphere:</hi> So that, I believe much of that <hi>Naturall Magic,</hi> by which diſtant Bodys act upon each other (though wee uſually aſcribe it to <hi>Occult Qualities,</hi> or certain <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathies</hi> and <hi>Antipathies</hi> in matter) to proceed from no other cauſe then the ſecret operations of Winds: For they are the <hi>Carriers</hi> of the Univerſe, and tranſport from one place to another, odors, diſeaſes, fertiliſing Salts, the ſeeds of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals and Plants, and moſt other things, of which wee can give no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how they came there; as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, that ſpring on the tops of houſes, or thoſe which are obſerv'd to grow on the walls of Caſtles, &amp;
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:56342:115"/>
Ancient Theaters; nay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times whole Groves and vaſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts have at firſt had no other <hi>Planters</hi> then the VVinds.</p>
            <p>But to attempt a full collection of all their <hi>Properties</hi> and <hi>Effects,</hi> muſt be the work of Poſterity; which poſſibly may require many ages e're it be brought to Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And to complete the many <hi>Deſiderata</hi> of this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> in an Univerſall Hiſtory of VVinds (For we have only the <hi>Out-lines</hi> of this vaſt <hi>Deſign</hi> in Sir <hi>Francis Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con)</hi> it would be adviſeable to make an exact <hi>Table</hi> or <hi>Ephemeris,</hi> for many years together, and ſo dayly compare the obſervations of their <hi>Prognoſtiques,</hi> the <hi>Quarters</hi> whence they blow, their <hi>Duration</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties;</hi> how farre they agree or
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56342:115"/>
differ from what has been already delivered in Books. Many of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are ſet down by the <hi>Lord Veru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam,</hi> but for the moſt part collected out of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> though with leſſe improvement then might have been expected from that illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious perſon. However, ſince the Learned World has been ſo long im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd on by Tradition; we ought, in the firſt place, to be throughly informed concerning all matters of <hi>Fact,</hi> and afterward conſider to what <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> they may beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late: and becauſe That muſt be the reſult of long experience, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, I can only commend this Province to thoſe curious Perſons, who have leiſure, either to make ſuch new Diſcoveries of their own, or detect the Vulgar Errors of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56342:116"/>
Times.</p>
            <p>It ſhould firſt be examin'd what influences they have upon <hi>Human Bodies;</hi> in relation to their <hi>Sickneſs</hi> or <hi>Health:</hi> and thoſe who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to Gowts, Catarrhes, infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Sight, diſtempers of the Lungs, Epilepſies, Deafneſs, &amp;c. might be able to collect obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this nature; what inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience they are ſenſible of from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſort of VVinds.</p>
            <p>Thoſe celebrated <hi>Aphoriſms</hi> of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> concerning their <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinall</hi> Qualities, ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; how farr they are found Experimentally true and conſonant to the obſervations of the Moderns: For if we rightly underſtood the different Temperatures of the Air, and VVinds, and how to apply
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:56342:116"/>
this remedy to many diſtempers, it might poſſibly prove the moſt ſuccesfull part of Phyſick.</p>
            <p>Next, as to the <hi>Diverſities</hi> which ariſe from the <hi>Quarters</hi> whence they blow: whether the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>North</hi> betray not in theſe Countries continuall Symptoms of <hi>Siccity</hi> and <hi>Cold;</hi> and the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> of <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Moiſture.</hi> Likewiſe, as to their effects upon <hi>Animals;</hi> Since the South has a thouſand Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant influences; and, according to our Engliſh Proverb, <hi>The Wind at Eaſt, is neither good for man nor beaſt.</hi> Then, which of them are moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable, or inauſpicious, to the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable</hi> life; what obſervations of this nature can be drawn from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griculture,</hi> and <hi>Gardening?</hi> which are thoſe VVinds that are moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56342:117"/>
to the Sowing and ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Corn, or moſt pernicious for breeding worms in plants, or for blaſting and deſtroying their fruits.</p>
            <p>VVhat directions this Doctrine might afford to <hi>Architects,</hi> in choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Situations</hi> of <hi>Dwellings:</hi> whether the Air of many houſes might not be meliorated by giving a freer admiſſion to the Winds; ſince it has been obſerv'd, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Dwellings here in <hi>England,</hi> which were environ'd with huge woods, or ſometimes had only a clump of trees ſtanding towards ſuch a Quarter, have been always obnoxious to ſicknes, till they happen'd to be cut down, and the places render'd pervious to the Winds: Sometimes only the chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a window, or door, from the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56342:117"/>
               <hi>South,</hi> and expoſing it to the <hi>North,</hi> has done as great a cure. It is well obſerv'd in the <hi>Relation</hi> of my <hi>Lord Howards</hi> voyage to <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> that, at <hi>Vienna</hi> they have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Winds, which if they ceaſe long in the <hi>Summer,</hi> the plague of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten enſues; ſo that it is now grown into a Proverb: that, if <hi>Auſtria be not Windy, it's ſubject to Contagion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, what advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be expected from hence to the Art of <hi>Navigation.</hi> Since, I am confident that more ſhips periſh, by our ignorance of the Winds &amp; Currents, then by any other Diſaſter which happens on the Seas: If the Maſters of ſhips were oblig'd to give in <hi>Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> of their voyages to all parts of the world; and theſe for many
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56342:118"/>
years compar'd with each other, we ſhould not only be able to collect a Complete Hiſtory of the <hi>Trade</hi> Winds, and <hi>Monſoons,</hi> and their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations in the ſeverall <hi>Latitudes</hi> and <hi>Meridians,</hi> (which would be of very great importance) but ſhould find, that there are many <hi>Anniverſary Tempeſts</hi> which might be very certainly foretold by the <hi>Seaſons</hi> of the yeare, and Proviſion made accordingly; Beſide other uſefull Circumſtances of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall</hi> Motions, and <hi>Reverſions</hi> of the Seas, according to the <hi>Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> (which hitherto moſt of our Seamen have thought to proceed purely from chance) might be reducible to ſo regular obſervations, that, beſide the great improvements which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56342:118"/>
from hence to Philoſophy, &amp; all Naturall Knowledge; it would be of no ſmall advantage to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Navigation.</hi> This noble Art is worthy of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers and Mathematicians, and the <hi>Mechanical</hi> part ought to be eſteem'd the leaſt, that ſhould accompliſh a skilfull Seaman. So that, men of letters ought not to diſpiſe this, as a rude and illiberall profeſſion; to which we muſt be beholding for the moſt <hi>conſiderable Diſcoveries</hi> of Nature.</p>
            <p>Then, as to their <hi>Continuance</hi> or <hi>Succeſſion:</hi> It has been noted that if the VVinds change <hi>conformably</hi> to the Motion of the Sun; as from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to the <hi>South,</hi> from the <hi>South</hi> to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> &amp;c. they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome return thither again, at leaſt
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56342:119"/>
for no long time: But, if their changes happen in a <hi>contrary</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the courſe of the Sun, as from <hi>Weſt</hi> to <hi>South,</hi> from <hi>South</hi> to <hi>Eaſt,</hi> &amp;c. they uſually revert back again to the former points, before they complete the whole Circuit of the Compaſſe: We have this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marque in my <hi>Lord Bacon;</hi> and he diſdain'd not to borrow ſeverall obſervations of this kind, from Husbandmen and Sheapheards; who are leſſe within doors, and more concern'd in all the viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of the yeare, whether or no they are like to expect kind ſeaſons for their Corn, and flocks. It might likewiſe be enquir'd into, what <hi>Prognoſtiques</hi> the <hi>Seamen</hi> have of the weather, in all parts of the world, where they have different ſorts
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56342:119"/>
of Tempeſts: I am inform'd, that they alſo commonly obſerve, when the VVind has been long in one Quarter, if it paſſe into a Quarter of the like <hi>Quality,</hi> it is ſeldome conſtant, but reverts to the former: as ſuppoſe the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> if it change to the <hi>North,</hi> it frequently returns, but if it paſſe by the <hi>South,</hi> and follow the Sun, the weather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably changes for ſome continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and not <hi>per Saltum,</hi> as if it ſhould skip from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> or from the <hi>North</hi> to the <hi>South,</hi> for then it's ſeldome holding. It is not my deſign to multiply inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this nature, I only offer at ſome few, to compare the Mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Weather,</hi> with thoſe of the <hi>wind;</hi> &amp; queſtionleſſe in a long tract of time, they might be reduc'd
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56342:120"/>
to ſome more certain rules, then thoſe in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or <hi>Pliny;</hi> at leaſt better calculated for an Iſland; which being invaded on all ſides by the Sea-vapors and Winds, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome enjoys the ſame ſerene Face of the Heavens, for any long time together; but is generally farre more obnoxious to all chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of weather, then the Continent.</p>
            <p>Next, what certainty there is in any <hi>Aſtrologicall</hi> Predictions, as by the <hi>Age,</hi> or <hi>Phaſis</hi> of the <hi>Moon, Appearance,</hi> or <hi>Conjunction</hi> of the <hi>Starrs,</hi> &amp;c. The Riſe of the <hi>Orion</hi> is more particulariz'd in Authors; but ſeems to be rather a <hi>Concomitant</hi> of other cauſes, then of it ſelfe, the <hi>Efficient</hi> of VVinds.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe, what information we might receive from all ſorts of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56342:120"/>
Trades: of what concernment it might be for Vintners to have their Cellar-VVindows expos'd to this, or that VVind; ſince <hi>Michael Angelus Blondus</hi> in his book of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,</hi> affirms, that the <hi>Eaſterly,</hi> and <hi>Paduanus</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of VVinds, that the <hi>Southerly,</hi> have a very ſenſible operation on the VVines in the Cask. I have heard that ſome of the <hi>Vertuoſi</hi> who pretend to great skill in ordering of Cidar, find by experience, that certain Winds ſet it a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting more then others, and render it turbid and thick; ſo that when they perceive them coming to ſuch a Point of the compaſſe, they critically obſerve the juſt time for botling it, to prevent theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences. Rules have been
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56342:121"/>
preſcrib'd to Drudgſters, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecarys upon this account, for the preſerving their Medicines: and happily ſome remarks might be taken from Cabinet-makers, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and other <hi>Mechanicall</hi> Artiſts, in the drying and ſeaſoning their Materials, that might conduce a fuller Hiſtory of VVinds.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it would be no leſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to the Advancement of <hi>Naturall</hi> knowledge, to detect the <hi>Falſity</hi> of thoſe Aſſertions, which have been long receiv'd in the world, from the great <hi>reputation</hi> of their <hi>Authors.</hi> As for example, thoſe which are ſet down by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> in the ſecond of his <hi>Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,</hi> and in the book of <hi>Problems,</hi> where he endeavours to explicate ſeverall <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the Air and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56342:121"/>
               <hi>Winds;</hi> as in the firſt <hi>Section. Probl.</hi> 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 19. 23. and in the <hi>Twenty ſixth Section.

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56342:122"/>
in <hi>Pliny</hi> that relate to this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, might be conſiderable, were they not ſuſpected to be generally falſe: But ſince the too great <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Antiquity,</hi> has impos'd ſo many <hi>Vulgar Errors</hi> on the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous world; it will be the moſt generous deſign, firſt to free our minds from thoſe prejudices we have taken up from <hi>Tradition,</hi> and upon this foundation to ſuperſtruct a more Reall and <hi>Experimentall</hi> Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>I have only mention'd ſome few obſervations of that infinite Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with which this fruitfull Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument will entertain the Curious: And ſo from their <hi>Cauſes</hi> and <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi> proceed to the <hi>Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiques</hi> of Winds.</p>
            <p>Firſt we might enquire what
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56342:122"/>
the <hi>radiant, ſanguine, pallid, nubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> or other Appearances of the <hi>Sun,</hi> ſignify to the predictions of VVinds.</p>
            <p>What the <hi>Age</hi> or <hi>Eclipſe</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> the picked, or obtuſe figure; the greater reſplendency of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar</hi> Horns, or the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of it with other Planets: likewiſe <hi>Halos</hi> about the Sun, or Moon, the ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or twinkling of Starrs, &amp;c. whether theſe may be accounted <hi>Prognoſtiques</hi> of VVinds? In like manner, if the Sun ſeem big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then ordinary, or dart more refulgent Beams; or if it riſe in a Cloud of the ſame Colour, &amp;c. All theſe different <hi>Appearances</hi> of the Heavenly Bodys proceed chiefly from <hi>refraction,</hi> the viſual rays be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtorted by the Denſity of the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:56342:123"/>
Medium: and the collection of thoſe <hi>rorid</hi> and <hi>nebulous</hi> vapors in the Air, that cauſe theſe unuſuall perceptions in our ſenſe, may firſt generate <hi>Halos,</hi> and afterward deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend in <hi>Tempeſts,</hi> or VVinds.</p>
            <p>Some prognoſticate from <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi> and <hi>Eclipſes:</hi> and it would be farther worth our remarque; what connexion there is between certain ſpecies of <hi>Thunder</hi> or <hi>Lightnings,</hi> and <hi>Wind;</hi> what predictions may be taken from the <hi>colours, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and as it were Severall ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys, and <hi>ranges</hi> of <hi>Clouds,</hi> or the ſuddain appearance of any <hi>Single</hi> one above the <hi>Horizon,</hi> in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſerene and peacefull sky, as wee obſerve in <hi>Tornados.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others have been no leſſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious from the ſuddain palenes of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56342:123"/>
               <hi>Fires,</hi> from the <hi>roaring</hi> of the Sea, from the reſounding of <hi>Echos,</hi> or a noiſe heard from the ſhoars, which happens many times before the <hi>Levants</hi> blow in the <hi>Mediterranean;</hi> or if there be a Murmur in the Mountains, or Clouds without <hi>Thunder;</hi> or if the Sea ſeeme to riſe, or ſwell, in thoſe places where there is no ſenſible VVind to irritate it. Some have employ'd their curioſity, in making praedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from Birds, and Water-Fowle, from Ravens, and Crows, the playing of Porpuſes and Dolphins, the ſpinning of Spiders, the leaping of Fiſhes above the water, &amp;c. Innumerable of this nature may be had from <hi>Ariſtotle, Paduanius, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus de Medina, Ricciolus, Fournier;</hi> though for the moſt part fallible
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56342:124"/>
and uncertain, we might offer at the Philoſophicall reaſons of ſome <hi>Prognoſtiques;</hi> but thoſe, which have any evident connexion between the cauſes &amp; effects, may be ſolu'd from the former Diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>But (as I before noted) the great <hi>Inequalities</hi> in the ſuperficies of the Earth, the ſeverall obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and <hi>repercuſſions</hi> from moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the different <hi>Situations</hi> of the places, and <hi>Medium's</hi> in which they blow, the <hi>diſtance</hi> of thoſe Countries from the <hi>Poles</hi> of the World: Their <hi>reſpects</hi> to the courſe of the <hi>Sun:</hi> whether they comply with, or reſiſt the <hi>Naturall Motion</hi> of the Air from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt</hi> &amp;c have ſo many intricate, &amp; nice ſpeculations, that it will be hard to lay down any perfect <hi>Theory</hi> of

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:56342:137"/>
of South <hi>Latitude</hi> he met with a Tempeſt of this nature, towards the Coaſt of <hi>India;</hi> of which I had ſome particulars extracted from his <hi>Journal:</hi> Firſt, contrary to the courſe of the VVinds, which they expected to be at <hi>S.

of the VVind, till it ended in an extreme <hi>Hurricane;</hi> which an hour after Midnight, came to ſuch an height, that no Canvas or ſayles would hold; and 7 men could ſcarce govern the Helme. But that which I mention as moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable to our purpoſe, was, that the whole <hi>Hemiſphere,</hi> both the Heavens and raging Seas, appear'd but as one <hi>entire Flame of Fire;</hi> and thoſe who are acquainted with the reputation of this Grave Perſon, will find no juſt reaſon to diſtruſt the truth of the Relation.</p>
            <p>Although theſe <hi>Fiery</hi> Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds are to be reckon'd as the moſt wonderfull events in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet we have frequent examples of them in <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> and <hi>Philoſophers:</hi> One the moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:56342:138"/>
which ever I read of, was known, ſome years ſince, here in <hi>England;</hi> and deſcrib'd at large in the Publick <hi>Gazet:</hi> it run a long in a <hi>tract,</hi> as a dreadfull <hi>Torrent of Fire,</hi> deſtroying all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wherever it came; and, if I miſtake not, did much damage in <hi>Lincolne-Shire;</hi> but I cannot now recollect the particulars, though, as I remember, it happend ſince the laſt <hi>Dutch</hi> warr.</p>
            <p>They have a ſtrange kind of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nephias</hi> towards the <hi>Arabian</hi> Gulf, which riſes from the <hi>North;</hi> where alſo they have oftentimes <hi>Sandy Tempeſts;</hi> and that not only in <hi>Afric,</hi> near the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Hammon,</hi> (as ſeems to have been noted by <hi>Herodotus)</hi> but eſpecially in <hi>Arabia;</hi> where the Floating Sands are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

               <hi>I</hi> ſhall conclude with a Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Hurricanes,</hi> which have the greateſt affinity in their Nature to the <hi>Tornados,</hi> but farre more laſting and violent: by ſome, they are call'd <hi>Huracanos,</hi> and by others, <hi>Orancan:</hi> Yet I rather think the word was firſt borrow'd of the <hi>Natives,</hi> and deduc'd from a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous <hi>Origine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVe ſeldome hear of any <hi>Hurricanes</hi> but between the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piques,</hi> and within the juriſdiction of the <hi>Generall,</hi> or <hi>Trade-VVind;</hi> which blowing perpetually from the <hi>Eaſtern points,</hi> if it chance to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:56342:139"/>
be repell'd by a <hi>Land-Briſe,</hi> or any contrary Motion from the Weſt; This muſt needs occaſion ſtrange <hi>Conflicts</hi> and <hi>Seditions</hi> in the Air: and, were our ſenſes fine enough to diſcerne the inviſible commotions of the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> we ſhould ſee it oftentimes diſturb'd &amp; <hi>Fluctuating,</hi> no leſs then the moſt <hi>Tempeſtuous Seas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are not alike terrible in all places between the <hi>Tropiques,</hi> but raign more eſpecially near High ſhoars and Iſlands that lye <hi>Eaſtward</hi> from the Continent; ſo that they infeſt the <hi>Philippine</hi> and <hi>Caribbe-Iſles,</hi> more then any other parts of the Habitable World.</p>
            <p>Nearer the Line it's moſt inclin'd to Calms; and though in the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> there is but one <hi>Set</hi> VVind all
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:56342:139"/>
the year round, yet they are alſo extremely ſubject to Tempeſts, whenever the <hi>Levants</hi> encounter any oppoſition from the <hi>Weſt.</hi> For although (as I before noted) the progreſſe of Wind is Naturally direct, yet meeting with any impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment, it whirles about in a <hi>Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> and Vortiginous Motion. This cauſe was aſſign'd by <hi>Doriſi</hi> of the dangerous ſtorms that happen near the <hi>Aequinoctiall:</hi> &amp; (not to inſtance in ſeverall others, who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd for the ſame <hi>Hypotheſis) Ric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciolus,</hi> and more expreſly <hi>Varenius,</hi> in his <hi>Geography,</hi> gives the like account of theſe <hi>Typhons,</hi> or <hi>Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes:</hi>

            <p>We ſee theſe kind of <hi>Eddys</hi> in Rivers, when the Courſe of the Channell is ſtopt by a damme or Bank; at leaſt when two contrary Currents meet; And I believe the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of <hi>Hurricanes</hi> might be ſufficiently illuſtrated from <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtatique</hi> experiments, were it not my intention rather to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their Naturall Hiſtory, then to determine their cauſe. Though I ſhall endeavour to collect ſuch obſervations, as may not obſcurely hint to us the fitteſt Materials, on which to ſuperſtruct an <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> But we cannot ſafely adventure upon this Arduous attempt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more exact diſcoveries of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:56342:140"/>
Accidents, which are of greateſt importance to theſe nice Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>I ſhould enquire what <hi>Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Winds</hi> blow either in <hi>Guiana,</hi> or the Neighbouring continent; eſpecially from the <hi>Weſt,</hi> in thoſe Months which are moſt ſuſpected for <hi>Hurricanes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, what judgement can be made of their <hi>Cauſes,</hi> from their <hi>Prognoſtiques:</hi> ſince I am aſſur'd from very good hands, that they have oftentimes been foretold by the <hi>Indians.</hi> Moreover, the <hi>Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> the nature of the <hi>Currents</hi> and <hi>Shoars;</hi> the <hi>Phaſis</hi> of the Moon, &amp;c. ought not to be neglected by the Inquiſitive <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralliſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, whether they are not
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:56342:141"/>
frequently accompany'd by <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,</hi> as I have been inform'd by ſome who were Planters in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> which was likewiſe taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in that excellent Hiſtory of the <hi>Caribbes,</hi> of an Hurricane which happen'd in the year 1563 together with an <hi>Earthquake.</hi> For the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Spirit,</hi> which caus'd that Palpitation in the Boſome of the Earth, being afterwards releaſt from it's impriſonment, might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion theſe dreadfull Tempeſts and VVinds. <hi>Fournier</hi> (who is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally reputed an Author of good credit, &amp; skilfull in what relates to <hi>Hydrography)</hi> mentions an <hi>Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> on the Coaſts of <hi>America,</hi> an <hi>Eruption</hi> of a <hi>Burning Mountain,</hi> and an <hi>Earthquake</hi> near the ſame time; which for the memorableneſs of the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:56342:141"/>
event, I ſhall ſet down in a few lines.</p>
            <p>Thirty five leagues on the South of <hi>Lima,</hi> is ſituate a Famous <hi>Port</hi> call'd <hi>Hiſco;</hi> and a Town in which moſt of Nobleſſe and perſons of Qualitie doe reſide; who perceiving one day, that the Sea retir'd all at once, from their ſhoars, and left the River dry, great Numbers of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple flock't together on the ſhoare, to behold ſo extraordinary a ſight; little ſuſpecting the ill deſtiny which was to attend them: For, preſently after, they ſaw a great and ſuddain <hi>tumour</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> and perceiv'd the Water to boyl, and the waves to ſwell, and rowle one upon another; not like <hi>Waves,</hi> but <hi>Mountains</hi> of water, ſo high, that there remain'd no hope of ſaving
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:56342:142"/>
their lifes by flight; expecting every moment when they ſhould be Swallow'd up by the Sea: ſo that, the <hi>Ocean</hi> quitting it's ordinary Bounds, made an excurſion for three Hundred leagues; overturn'd the houſes and trees, and left the Country deſolate: the ſhips ſail'd over the higheſt walls, during this wonderfull Inundation. <hi>Canama,</hi> a noted Village diſtant 230 leagues from <hi>Lima,</hi> was deſtroy'd with it's Port, and many other places; more eſpecially the Town of <hi>Arica,</hi> which loſt in the Harbour many ſhips richly laden, to the value of a Million in Gold. The Mountain <hi>Onerate,</hi> which, ſome years ſince, had vomited out a great quantity of Aſhes, began a very terrible Conflagration, and was follow'd
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:56342:142"/>
by a ſuddain Trembling of the Earth, which in leſſe then a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour, ſwallow'd up ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Villages; that there was ſcarce ever a more Dreadfull <hi>Earthquake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not unuſuall to have <hi>Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations</hi> of the Seas, <hi>Eruptions of Burning Mountains, Earthquakes,</hi> and then <hi>Violent Tempeſts,</hi> like <hi>Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricanes,</hi> to happen about the ſame time, and probably from the ſame Cauſe: For the <hi>Nitro-Sulphureous</hi> ſpirit which cauſes the Trembling of the Earth, and that ſtupendious commotion of the Seas, may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward break looſe into the moſt Horrid conflagrations, and Winds: eſpecially, in ſuch places that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with theſe <hi>Thundring Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals;</hi> which, if we conſider their Active nature, are the fitteſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for <hi>Hurricanes.</hi> I know not
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:56342:143"/>
how farre it may be thought a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this, that <hi>Bray-Brook</hi> in <hi>Northampton-Shire,</hi> where (as was at large deſcrib'd in the laſt of the <hi>Philoſophicall Tranſactions)</hi> there happen'd that dangerous <hi>Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind</hi> the laſt year, has been a place much ſubject to <hi>Earthquakes.</hi> But I return from this digreſſion, to the <hi>Hurricanes</hi> of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> where it ſeems to me very odd, that they ſhould be ſo dreadfull in ſome places of the <hi>Caribbe-Iſlands,</hi> inſomuch that <hi>Mevis</hi> and St. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtophers,</hi> have ſeverall times been almoſt depopulated by them, when they never reach to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> on the <hi>one ſide</hi> (happily as lying without the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind) nor <hi>on the other,</hi> beyond <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bados,</hi> where they have ſeldome
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:56342:143"/>
more then the Tail of an <hi>Hurricane,</hi> though it is not farre ſituate from St. <hi>Chriſtophers, Porto Rico, Garda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loupe,</hi> and other Iſlands, where they rage with the greateſt violence.</p>
            <p>They are no ſtrangers to the <hi>Moluccas,</hi> and <hi>Philippines,</hi> and we have moſt incredible relations of the ſtorms in the way to <hi>Japan,</hi> which have carry'd ſhips a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable diſtance from the <hi>Sea,</hi> up the <hi>Dry-Land:</hi> Some have been miſerably wrackt, &amp; buryed in the waves, others ſplit in a thouſand pieces againſt the Rocks, that ſcarce one ſhip in five eſcapes theſe diaſters in the Tempeſtuous Months about Autumn, or at the change of the <hi>Monſoons.</hi> From hence we may collect this <hi>conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble remarque,</hi> That they never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:56342:144"/>
but on the <hi>Eaſtern Shoars,</hi> where they are <hi>Fatall</hi> to the <hi>Chineſe</hi> and <hi>Caribbe-Seas,</hi> and ſo as farr as the River of <hi>Plate;</hi> likewiſe to that part of <hi>Afric</hi> from the <hi>Cape</hi> to St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> &amp; the Adjacent Iſles: when they are altogether unknown to the <hi>African Ocean,</hi> from the <hi>Canaries</hi> to <hi>Cape Bon Eſperance,</hi> are never heard of at <hi>New Spain,</hi> or the Coaſts of <hi>Peru,</hi> nor towards any other we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern parts of <hi>America;</hi> becauſe there the VVinds, which blow off from <hi>Land,</hi> make no oppoſition againſt the <hi>Generall Briſe,</hi> but comply with the Conſtant motion of the Air between the <hi>Tropiques,</hi> from <hi>Eaſt to Weſt:</hi> For the ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Trade-Wind</hi> from the <hi>Eaſterly Points,</hi> is uſually the firſt <hi>On-ſet</hi> of an approaching <hi>Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:56342:144"/>
Yet, however theſe ſuſpicious of mine be receiv'd, I think it cannot be rationally diſputed, but that thoſe direfull Tempeſts have their firſt riſe from the <hi>Weſtern Continent:</hi> for we ſeldome encounter them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>remote from Land,</hi> and the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd Maſters-of-ſhips are never jealous of <hi>Hurricanes</hi> in the <hi>Spacious Ocean;</hi> or, if they perceive them coming, immediately make out to <hi>Sea,</hi> where their fury is much <hi>leſſe,</hi> then near the <hi>Shoars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are moſt to be dreaded about the end of Summer, in the Months of <hi>July,</hi> and <hi>August:</hi> For both the <hi>Winds and Seas,</hi> imitate the Motions of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and being dilated by the Celeſtiall heat, annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>revert</hi> from <hi>North, to South;</hi> and from <hi>South,</hi> to <hi>North</hi> again; ſo that
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:56342:145"/>
the Sun haſting from one <hi>Tropique</hi> to another, cauſes the like ſuddain <hi>Converſions</hi> in the <hi>Currents</hi> and <hi>Winds;</hi> and being the moſt <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Efficient,</hi> muſt needs be princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally concern'd in all viciſſitudes of the <hi>Sublunary World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hurricanes</hi> are uſually preceded by an extraordinary <hi>Tranquillity</hi> of the Heavens and Seas: poſſibly, ſome <hi>Counter-Winds</hi> may for a ſhort ſpace ballance another, &amp; bring the Air to an <hi>Equal poiſe.</hi> So that, thoſe who happen to be in the Center of the <hi>Whirl-Wind</hi> are at firſt ſenſible of no diſturbance; as we ſee in Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys or <hi>Whirl-pools</hi> of water, that, while the Circumference is violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agitated, in the middle it continues for ſome time, quiet and calme.</p>
            <p>I have already too long digres'd
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:56342:145"/>
from my firſt deſign, which was to contribute, what I could, to their <hi>Hiſtory;</hi> &amp; for this end, I have colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſeverall relations which may be of greateſt importance to make a fuller diſcovery of their nature, &amp; the <hi>Miraculous Effects</hi> of <hi>Hurricanes:</hi> The firſt is out of <hi>Battiſta Ramuſio;</hi> and though I am aſſur'd, that the beſt accounts are to be had from <hi>Oviedo,</hi> and other <hi>Spaniards,</hi> &amp; the deſcriptions they have made of the <hi>New-World,</hi> yet their books are ſo rarely to be met with, that very few of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Journalls come to our hands, but what were firſt tranſlated into other <hi>Modern</hi> languages, as this, of two ſeverall <hi>Hurricanes</hi> at the Iſland of <hi>Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola:</hi> I made diligent enquiry after <hi>Gonzalo D' Oviedo,</hi> which is a

               <q>It happened on Wedneſday the third of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in the year 1508 <hi>(Don Franciſco Nicola D' Ovando</hi> the great <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dator,</hi> being Governour of this Iſland) very near midday, that
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:56342:147"/>
there roſe upon a ſuddain a very great <hi>Wind,</hi> accompanied with <hi>Rain;</hi> which, in one and the ſame inſtant, was taken notice of in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny remote parts of the <hi>Iſland;</hi> and hence, by reaſon of it, great loſſes immediately follow'd in the fields; and the Country farmes remained utterly <hi>waſted</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed:</hi> in this City of St. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menico</hi> it bore to the Ground all the houſes of ſtraw which were in it; and ſome too which were built with ſtone were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly batter'd and endanger'd: Nay in that Country which they call'd the <hi>Happy Adventure,</hi> all the houſes were levelled to the Earth; from which accident the name of the <hi>Miſadventure</hi> was afterward given to it, by reaſon of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:56342:148"/>
the great numbers which there underwent a <hi>Totall Ruine:</hi> and that which was worſt, and moſt ſenſibly afflictive, that in the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of this City were deſtroyed more then twenty ſhips, pinnaces, and other veſſels: The VVind was <hi>North,</hi> and ſo ſtrong that the Mariners perceiving the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain encreaſe, threw themſelves into their Boats, and went to caſt more Anchors into the Sea, and to faſten and ſecure their veſſels with ſtronger Cables; But to ſuch a height grew the Tempeſt, that all proviſion which was made to reſiſt it, proved uſeleſs, and ineffectuall, becauſe every thing broke, and the Wind with an incredible force drove all the veſſells, both ſmall
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:56342:148"/>
and great, down the River, out of the Port, and Carry'd them into the Sea, ſome it ſtranded acroſs the ſhoars of that River; others were ſunk and never appear'd more: but afterward, the VVind changing upon a ſuddain to the contrary point, the <hi>South Wind,</hi> with no leſſe violence and furie, roſe to an equall height, with the former <hi>North Wind;</hi> whence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all apprehenſion, ſome veſſels were furiouſly driven back again into the Port, and as the <hi>North Wind</hi> had forced them to Sea, ſo this <hi>Oppoſite</hi> drove them back again into the Harbour againſt the ſtream of the River. Theſe very veſſels we afterward obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to move down the ſtream, without perceiving any more of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:56342:149"/>
them then the Cages or Tops of their Maſts, for their Hulks ſunck totally under water. Many men were drown'd in this cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and the extremity of the Tempeſt laſted Twenty four hours, even till the next day Noon; but ceas'd not ſo, in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, as it began: Such an one it was, that many who ſaw it, and are yet living in this City, do affirm, that it was the moſt Affrightfull &amp; Horrid ſpectacle, that could poſſibly be look'd upon with human eyes: and they report the Appearance to be ſuch, that it ſeem'd as if Hell had ſtood open, and the Infernall ſpirits carried thoſe veſſels from one place to an other; The Wind hurried away in a Body to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:56342:149"/>
many men, divers Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoots through the ſtreets, and fields, without any poſſibility to ſtop or help themſelves; many of whoſe heads were miſerably ſhatter'd and broken: It drew by force ſome ſtones out of the mid'ſt of the walls, it threw down and broke in peices <hi>many thick Woods</hi> turning them upſide down; hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the trees of others at a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>great diſtance.</hi> In ſhort, the loſſe occaſion'd by this Tempeſt, was exceeding great and Generall to the whole Iſland. The <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſay, that at other times here have us'd to be <hi>Hurricanes,</hi> but not any like <hi>This</hi> had ever yet happen'd; neither in theirs, nor their predeceſſors times; ſo that by this <hi>Horrible Tempeſt</hi> many
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:56342:150"/>
were ſlain, and their Eſtates and Goods ruin'd; both in this City, and in the greater part of this Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but chiefly their Farmes in the Country.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Admirall <hi>Don Diego Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lombo</hi> came the year following being (1509) into this City, the tenth of <hi>July,</hi> and on the twenty ninth of the ſame Month, there aroſe another <hi>Hurricane,</hi> greater then that already mention'd, but yet it made not ſo much ſpoyl among the Houſes, though in the Fields a much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. There have been others ſince, but never <hi>Such,</hi> nor ſo <hi>Stupendious</hi> as theſe. 'Tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiv'd and aſſerted by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi> that ſince the moſt Holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Altar</hi> has been
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:56342:150"/>
plac'd in the Churches of this City, and in the other Regions of this Iſland, theſe <hi>Hurricanes</hi> have ceaſed. Certainly, whoſoever hath paſſeth by ſome Woods of great and thick ſtanding trees, where the <hi>Hurricanes</hi> have arriv'd, has ſeen things of much wonder and amazement. For one might then behold trees, innumerable, and thoſe extream bigg, drawn up with their <hi>roots,</hi> which were as long as was the Tree even to his higheſt top-branch, others cleft aſunder in many pieces; and in ſuch a manner placed one upon an other, that it appear'd exactly a <hi>Diabolicall</hi> operation. I my ſelf have ſeen in ſome places the whole territorie covered with eradica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and cleft trees; and plac'd
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:56342:151"/>
one upon another with wonderfull Entanglings. And becauſe we were to goe from thence, and paſſe through thoſe very Countrys and woods, thus rent aſunder and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricated, having no other way ſo ſafe to our deſign (the great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers interpoſing us, together with the ſharp Craggs of Mountains, the deep Vallies, and the thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and cloſe Woods, and many other difficulties; beſide the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of the enemy, and the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the country) ſo that it was very obſervable to ſee how our men went clambring, eight or ten yards one higher then the other, from tree to tree, &amp; from bough to bough, toyling themſelves in the proſecution of their way; whence going on through all their Moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:56342:151"/>
they felt the moſt extream Torture &amp; Anguiſh, with hope to attain the ſafeſt way, though by a paſſage ſo infinitely obſtructed; and continually ſome of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions came out from the trees thus plagued, cruſhed, and their cloaths wholly torn off, &amp; the skin flead off from their hands; The trees were exceſſively bigg; and ſtupendious it was to ſee them in this manner, and at ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the place, where they firſt grew, ſo heaped, intangled, and interwoven one within ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that, as we have ſaid already, it appears no other then the work of the Devill. I have many preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Teſtimonys in the City of the two <hi>Hurricanes,</hi> that I now deſcribe, which in our Times hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:56342:152"/>
in this Iſland, and there are yet ſome remains of the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> it did in my own houſe; ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall other perſons throughout the Iſland then loſt moſt of their riches, as there are yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more in <hi>Spain,</hi> who felt the fury of the firſt <hi>Hurricane,</hi> to their utter ruine, and loſſe of their ſhips. In a word, ſuch were theſe two <hi>Tempeſts,</hi> that their memory will laſt, as long as thoſe now living on the place, and therefore 'tis fit that ſome notice of them remain ever to <hi>Poſterity.</hi>

            <p>I have made choice of another account out of the Hiſtory of the <hi>Caribbe-Iſlands,</hi> written by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious <hi>Frenchman:</hi> and <hi>I</hi> have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly met with ſeveral other relations both of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who

               <q>
                  <hi>Hurricanes</hi> are terrible and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Tempeſts, which may be term'd the true images of the laſt Conflagration of the VVorld: formerly they happen'd but once in 5 or 7 years; but they are now become more frequent, ſince the <hi>Antilles</hi> were inhabited, for there was one in 51, another in 52, two in 53, and two in 56: [Nay, in the Iſland of <hi>Gardaloupe,</hi> lying

about the 16 degree of <hi>N. Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> there happen'd no leſſe then 3 <hi>Hurricanes</hi> in one year] The manner of them is Thus.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ordinarily the <hi>Sea</hi> becomes <hi>Calme</hi> on a ſuddain, and Smooth as glaſſe: then preſently after, the <hi>Air</hi> is <hi>darkned,</hi> and fill'd with Denſe and Gloomy Clouds; after which, it's all (as it were) on Fire, and opens on every ſide with Dreadfull <hi>Lightnings,</hi> that laſt a conſiderable time: after which follow wonderfull Claps of <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> that ſeem as if the Heaven was rent aſunder. The Earth <hi>Trembles</hi> in many places, and the VVind blows with ſo great Impetuoſity, that it roots up the talleſt and greateſt Trees, which grow in the VVoods; Beats down
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:56342:153"/>
almoſt all the Houſes, and tears up the Vegetables; deſtroying every thing that grows upon the Earth; and very often compels men, whilſt this Dreadfull Tempeſt laſts, to catch hold of the trunks of trees, to ſecure themſelves from being carried away by the Winds; ſome lye in the Caves of the Rocks, or retire into the Huts of the <hi>Negroes</hi> and <hi>Caribbians,</hi> which are built exceeding low on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to elude the ſhocks of theſe Tempeſts. But that which is moſt dangerous of all, and which cauſes the greateſt Miſchief, is, that in four and twenty Hours, and ſometimes in leſs ſpace, it makes the <hi>whole Circle</hi> of the Compaſs; Leaving neither Road nor Haven ſecure from it's raging
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:56342:154"/>

                  <p>IN <hi>anſwer to your requeſt, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the</hi> Hurricane, <hi>I can ſay little of it's effects more, then what concerns our particular Damage, and Terrour. It happen'd upon the</hi> 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>of</hi> Auguſt <hi>laſt,</hi> 16 <hi>Hours after the</hi> New Moon, <hi>in the</hi> 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Degree of North Latitude, about</hi> 90 <hi>leagues from</hi> Barbados; <hi>It ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded a ſtorme of</hi> 48 <hi>hours continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at North-Eaſt; an unuſuall way of it's appearing, for it commonly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a</hi> Calme: <hi>It's preſage being a ſhifting of the Wind about the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, with the Appearance of a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled skye, the only advantage we have to prepare for it's reception. The Fury of it began about</hi> 10 <hi>at Night, and continu'd till</hi> 12 <hi>the next Day.</hi>
                     <pb n="287" facs="tcp:56342:155"/>
                     <hi>It's obſerv'd that the</hi> Hurricanes <hi>of the New Moon begin at</hi> Night, <hi>and thoſe at the Full in the</hi> Day; <hi>as was noted two years ſince, when the Lord</hi> Willoughby <hi>periſht with</hi> 8 <hi>ſhips, and near a</hi> 1000 <hi>perſons.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>During it's</hi> 14 <hi>hours Fury with us, it ſhifted</hi> 14 <hi>Points, from the N. E. to the S. S. Weſt, keeping a method of changing</hi> one point <hi>an</hi> hour; <hi>and then ſhifted Backward, and in it's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat ſtill abated, untill it returned to the Originall Point, where it wholly ceaſed.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>In the height of it, we had ſome Hail, the Stones whereof were very great, which ſeemed to be thrown upon us for the ſpace of the twentieth part of a Minute, and then an intermiſſion of</hi> 5 or 6 <hi>Minute, before any more came. The Sea in the night ſeem'd</hi>

                     <hi>as a</hi> reall Fire, <hi>and I believe we might have diſtinctly perceiv'd any object at a great Diſtance: In the day time we ſeem'd rather to ſayl in the Air then Water, the Wind forcing the Sea ſo high that we could ſcarce make a diſtinction of either Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Terrour of it was ſuch, that I thought it the Emblem of Hell, and the laſt diſſolution of all things; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the firſt two hours, which were attended with ſo much Thunder and Lightning, ſo aſtoniſhing, as if we had been wrapt up into the Clouds, or the whole Air ſet on Fire.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſtrength of the Wind was ſo great, that it blew a Boat of</hi> 18 <hi>foot long (faſtned to</hi> 4 <hi>Ring-bolts, and each Bolt through a Ring of the ſhip) Clear off the Deck: It blew away a</hi>

The laſt remain of its Fury was a Weighty Grinding-Stone, which it left faſtned between two Timber Heads, but it blew away the Trough from under it. I had ſeveral Accounts from Particular Friends how terrible it was in other places, but to me it ſeem'd beyond all expreſſion.</hi>

                     <hi>ſearch into their Cauſe.

            <p>Were it not ſufficient, that a Relation much of this Nature was preſented to his <hi>Majeſty;</hi> and that the ſhip, after it return'd, lay at Anchor a long time in the River of <hi>Thames;</hi> not without ſignal marks of the <hi>Hurricane,</hi> I might have been ſcrupulous enough, to have deſir'd the Subſcriptions of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall others, who could atteſt the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:56342:158"/>
truth of this Narrative. I ſhould only wiſh that ſome of thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions, which the Ingenious Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is pleas'd to make upon this occaſion, were enquir'd into, by thoſe who live upon any of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbe-Iſlands:</hi> whether the <hi>Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes</hi> of the <hi>New</hi> Moon begin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly by <hi>Night,</hi> and thoſe at the <hi>Full</hi> in the <hi>Day?</hi> which would be remarkable, though I never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to have met with the like obſervation in any other Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. However, we can by no means exclude the Operations of this Influentiall Planet; which has a very great Dominion over both the Winds and Tydes; whether from it's <hi>Preſſure,</hi> or by what means ſoever it produces theſe effects: Some have thought that the Moon
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:56342:159"/>
has an <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> of its own, and ſends out effluviums to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring World; and therefore acts more Powerfully in the <hi>Perigaeum,</hi> when it approaches neareſt the Earth.</p>
            <p>That wonderfull light which appear'd during this <hi>Hurricane,</hi> might be from the Colliſion of the Lucid Salts, with which the Sea-water is ſo deeply impregnated: <hi>Light</hi> happily being nothing elſe but the Motion of ſome ſubtil matter.</p>
            <p>We have ſeldome heard of any <hi>Hurricanes</hi> but in the Months of <hi>July, Auguſt,</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> and the Seamen hitherto have never been apprehenſive of them at other times; yet the laſt year there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd one in <hi>October</hi> which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unuſual.</p>

            <p>The laſt advice was from <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> the ſecond of <hi>September;</hi> the moſt part of the New Town of <hi>St. Johns</hi> was quite thrown down to the ground. Where diverſe of our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Ships richly laden, ſome from <hi>New-England,</hi> and one <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ship that came thither for ſhelter, periſh'd in the Harbour; together with many more Veſſels that were
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:56342:160"/>
caſt away at <hi>Meavis,</hi> and other parts of the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I alſo take notice of another paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, where he ſays <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> has been exempt from <hi>Hurricanes,</hi> when it's certain that at the firſt Deſcent of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon this Iſland, it was moſt obnoxious to them of all others, whereupon they afterwards took occaſion to boaſt, that, ſince the Holy Sacrament, was expos'd in their Churches, they wholly ceas'd.</p>
            <p>VVe may likewiſe obſerve, that the Seamen took the firſt <hi>Preſage</hi> of the <hi>Hurricane,</hi> from the whifling of the VVind about the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, which is Ominous in thoſe Climates, where it hangs generally between the <hi>Eaſterly Points.</hi> They vary'd, no more then 14 <hi>Points</hi> in
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:56342:160"/>
this Formidable <hi>Hurricane,</hi> though it has been a vulgar errour that they ſhift through all Quarters of the Compaſſe. Not only the <hi>Winds,</hi> but the <hi>Currents</hi> are obſerv'd to change, and run round in <hi>Eddys</hi> before the beginning of the Tempeſt.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Hurricane</hi> was preceeded by a ſtorme at <hi>North-Eaſt,</hi> though it's Univerſally agreed on, in the Relations both of the <hi>Engliſh, French,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that they commonly ſucceed a Calme: So that you ſhall have the Sea, for ſome time Placid, and Even, &amp; not ſo much as the leaſt wrinkle to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on the Surface of the Water. It's likewiſe eſteem'd a ſure <hi>Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtique,</hi> that the Birds (led by an inſtinct of Nature) come down before hand in Flocks from the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:56342:161"/>
Mountains to ſecure themſelves in the Vallies againſt the injurie of the Weather.</p>
            <p>I believe, there might be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent uſe made of the <hi>Barometer</hi> for predicting of <hi>Hurricanes,</hi> and other Tempeſts, eſpecially at Sea; ſince I am credibly informed, that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Quality, who lives by the Sea-ſide, (though happily there may not be ſo conſiderable altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the gravity of the <hi>Atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere</hi> far off at Land) can by the <hi>Barometer</hi> almoſt infallibly foretell any great Tempeſt for ſeverall hours before it begins.</p>
            <p>I find no mention of <hi>Salt Rains</hi> in any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Narratives; but the moſt Inquiſitive of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> have reckon'd it as a very Infallible Preſage, that the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:56342:161"/>
Rain, which falls a little before, is bitter, and ſalt as the Sea-water: which happily may argue a Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſome Saline and Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous ſpirits, in the Regions of the Air, that encountring each other, may by their violent Diſploſion be principally concern'd in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>Hurricanes. My Lord Bacon</hi> juſt hints in his <hi>Chapter [De Imitamentis Ventorum]</hi> that there are certain Flatulent, and expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſpirits cuntained in ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals (and then inſtances particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in Niter) that not only imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, but exceede the force of moſt VVhirlwinds. But certainly <hi>Nitre</hi> alone can effect no ſuch VVonders, though by the addition of <hi>Sulphur</hi> it is ſoon inflamed, and capable of the moſt vehement Agitation. For
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:56342:162"/>
the Sulphureous particles, being extreamly ſubtil, looſe the Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Salts, and render them of the moſt expanſive Nature; wherefore in the compoſition of Gunpowder, the Ignition is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the Diſploſion more impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, accordingly, as the Nitrous corpuſcles have greater or leſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays of Sulphur or coale, which they uſe in a different Proportion for Fowling-peices &amp; Canon-powder.</p>
            <p>Thus from the expanſion of theſe <hi>Raging Minerals,</hi> (which after their Rarefaction require an immenſe ſpace, and are exploded with the greateſt violence) we can only expect ſuch wonderfull Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects as thoſe of <hi>Hurricanes.</hi> For beſide the Subverting of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and Towns, <hi>They</hi> have

I ſhall not undertake to determine poſitively the Mode, only I thought good to inſinuate thus much, that theſe Miraculous Emotions of the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> can

hardly be ſuppoſed from the Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of common vapours or Air; For ſo General a Conſpiracy of the VVinds, and as it were a kind of <hi>Paroxyſme</hi> which ſo much diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Frame of <hi>Nature,</hi> muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily proceed from ſome very extraordinary cauſe.</p>
