         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Well-meaning and dutiful Subject hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
begs your Majeſty to read this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which is written with no other

Engliſh Monarchy.</item>
                  <item>II. How it was remov'd from off its natural

                  <item>IV. By what Expedient your Majeſty may

and alſo raiſe it to as high a degree of

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. The Monarchy of <hi>England</hi> was ſetled upon
an over balance of Lands veſted in the King,
the Nobility, and the Church, who antiently
poſſeſs'd above two thirds of the whole Engliſh
Territory: But the Noble-men held their Lands
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61461:3"/>
upon condition, that they ſhould aſſiſt the King
upon all his Occaſions with certain Quotas of
Men well arm'd and paid: And then theſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
let out their Lands to their Tenants upon
condition that they ſhould always be ready to
follow their reſpective Lords to the War as often
as the King ſhould have any occaſion for their
Service. So that very ſmall Rents were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Lord from the Tenants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had contracted for their Perſonal
Service.</p>
            <p>'Twas this diſpoſition of Lands which ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
our former Kings to raiſe great Armies
when they pleas'd, and to invade <hi>France</hi> (their
natural Enemy) with ſucceſs: and hereby it
was that the Nobility upheld the Grandure of
the King at home as well as abroad; and at the
ſame time they were a ſhelter and defence to
the common People, if the King were inclin'd
to make any Incroachments upon them. For
the over-balance of Propriety (and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
their greateſt natural Power) was veſted
in the middle ſtate of Nobility; who were
therefore able to preſerve both King and People
in their due bounds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61461:3"/>
Thus the Engliſh Monarchy ſtood upon a
natural Foundation, the King being the great
Landlord of his People, who were all bound
by their Tenures (in ſubordination to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
to ſupport his Crown and Dignity.</p>
            <p>II. This antient Foundation of the Engliſh
Monarchy was ſap'd and undermined by K. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the Seventh, who (having ſeen the Imperial
Crown of <hi>England</hi> diſpos'd of at the pleaſure
of the Lords who had maintain'd a War againſt
the Crown for near 400 years) could not but
be much concern'd at the over-grown Power of
the Peers, who ſometimes would pull down
and ſet up what King they pleas'd; and this
Conſideration made K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh ſeek
after ways and means how to leſſen the Power
of the Lords, which had bin ſo prejudicial to
the Crown: and ſeeing that their over grown
Power was ſupported by the great Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Land of which they were poſſeſs'd,
and which they could not alienate from their
Heirs, He by the help of his Parliament found
out a way to change the Tenure of Lands in
ſuch a manner that the Tenant ſhould be oblig'd
only to pay a Rent inſtead of Perſonal Service
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61461:4"/>
to his Landlord: and alſo a way was found out
for the Lords to alienate their Lands from their
Poſterity. This was done to the end that the
Lords might be encourag'd by an expenſive
way of living to ſell their Lands, and that the
Commons who liv'd thriſtily might be enabled
to purchaſe them. Hereby it came to paſs that
at the end of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Reign (in
whoſe time moſt part of the Church-Lands
were alſo ſold to the People) the common
People of <hi>England</hi> had near two thirds of the
Lands of <hi>England</hi> in their proper Poſſeſſion,
and the King, Lords, and Church little more
than one third part; whereby the Balance was
turn'd on the ſide of the Commons, who were
therefore able to make War upon the King,
Lords and Church together, as appeard after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears that the antient Foundation
of the Engliſh Monarchy was remov'd in the
Reign of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh; and the over-balance
of Lands falling from the Lords to
the Commons, 'tis evident that the Monarchy
has ever ſince ſtood, not upon an Ariſtocratical,
but a Popular Foundation; and ſuch a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
dos naturally ſupport none but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61461:4"/>
Forms of Government. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Monarchy ſupported on ſuch a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may properly be call'd a Government of
Expedients, becauſe it is by Expedients and
Inventions, and not upon any bottom of its
own that it ſubſiſts. Now what Expedients
our Kings have us'd to ſupport the Monarchy
is the next thing to be conſider'd. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</p>
            <p>III. The Balance of Lands being chang'd
by the end of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Reign,
from the Lords and Church to the Commons
of <hi>England,</hi> 'tis paſt all doubt but that Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> diſcover'd the popular bottom of the
Monarchy, becauſe ſhe found out the only wiſe
Expedient by which the Monarchy upon its
new Foundation was capable of being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
in its antient Luſtre and Glory. Her
Expedient was her Popularity, by which ſhe
accommodated her perſonal Adminiſtration to
the true Genius of the Monarchical Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
as it then ſtood. For the whole Reign
of that Queen (of Glorious Memory) tho
long (but not tedious) was paſt over in a
conſtant Courtſhip to her People, in which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61461:5"/>
not only all her Actions, but ſometimes her very
Words expreſſed her knowledg, that the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
was then founded on their Affections. In
what Glory ſhe ſupported her ſelf and the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Monarchy by that Expedient of Popularity,
notwithſtanding very great Oppoſitions from
the preeminent Powers of <hi>Europe,</hi> her Hiſtory
do's ſufficiently explain.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt was not in his nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to perſue this honourable and proper Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,
but his thoughts ſeem'd to be ſet upon
his own Power more than upon his Peoples
Good; whereby it came to paſs that the Flattery
of the Court was more pleaſing to him than
the general Intereſt of his Kingdom. And
having gotten ſome ſuperficial skill in the Arts
and Sciences, and a profound knowledg (as he
thought) in Theology, he made his Court to
the Divines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that
they being appriz'd of his great Learning might
in their Writings celebrate his Fame, and inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
to the People his great Knowledg in all
ſorts of Divine and Human Learning. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
at his firſt coming to the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
he induſtriouſly aſſiſted the Biſhops and
Church-Party againſt the Puritans; whom the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61461:5"/>
Church look'd upon as no leſs than her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
becauſe tho they could endure, yet they
did not admire her Biſhops and Ceremonies.
And in this manner that King found out his
Expedient in the Church-party, which admir'd
and almoſt ador'd his deep Learning, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
comparing him to King <hi>Solomon</hi> for Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and indeed omitted no opportunity which
might gain him an extraordinary Reverence
among the People.</p>
            <p>'Tis not then to be wonder'd at that King
<hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt trod in the ſteps of his Father,
and perſued the ſame Expedient which had been
ſucceſsful to his Father, eſpecially having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from him the ſame Temper of Mind,
and being well pleas'd to have for his Flatterers
the graveſt of Divines; whoſe Courtſhip ever
tended to aggrandize the King by enlarging the
Royal Prerogative, and to ſet it above the
Laws of the Realm, by virtue of ſome politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Doctrines which they drew from the Word
of God. From hence ſprang the Divine Right
by which thoſe Kings were ſaid to reign over
us, and a Divine Right of Succeſſion to the
Crown of <hi>England</hi> was derived to their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
But yet King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt laid too
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61461:6"/>
great a weight upon his Expedient, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
it too much, even when the People
began to be ſenſible that the Pulpit-Law did
build the Kings Prerogative upon the Ruins of
the People's Liberty: And herewith began the
quarrel of the People againſt that King, in
which he loſt his Life; and the Monarchy,
loſing its Expedient of the Church party, was
likewiſe overthrown.</p>
            <p>After this an Eſſay was made to introduce a
Commonwealth-form of Government, but it
was interrupted by a Standing Army, which
with their arbitrary and uncertain ways of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
at laſt tir'd out the People, that
they reſtor'd the Monarchy in the Perſon of
King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; who being the Son of
the Royal Martyr, was intitled to all that Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
which the Church was capable of giving:
and there was one thing more which made the
Church-men exert all their Powers with the
greateſt vigor in favour of their reſtor'd King,
which was this.</p>
            <p>The Clergy and their Party having bin ill
treated ſince the downfal of King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Firſt, and being again reſtor'd with <hi>Charles</hi> the
Second to their former Dignities, they were high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61461:6"/>
animated againſt the Presbyterians, by whom
they had bin provoked in the late <hi>Interregnum,</hi>
ſo that nothing was more in their Deſires than
to be avenged of their Enemies; and this
Maſter-paſſion of theirs was ſo well gratified
by their King, who granted ſevere Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all Diſſenters from the Church, that no
Prince ever gain'd the Hearts of the Clergy
and their whole Party more entirely to his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
than <hi>Charles</hi> the Second. No Vice or Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
could ſtain the Reputation of the Martyr's
Son; but tho he were the greateſt Encourager of
all Profaneneſs and Immorality in the moſt open
manner, yet ſtill he was our moſt Religious and
Gracious King. In his time all Atheiſts, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchees
and looſe Perſons own'd the Church of
<hi>England</hi> for their Mother; which numerous Party
enlarging the Pale of the Church, aſſiſted very
much to advance the Power of the King upon
the foundation of a Divine Right, which it was
ſaid God had given him: ſo that the univerſal
Acclamation was, <hi>viz.</hi> Great is <hi>Diana</hi> of the
<hi>Epheſians,</hi> and great is the <hi>Jure divino</hi> King, the
Image which fell down from <hi>Jupiter!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this loud Acclamation,
the cautious King, who in his Youth had bin
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61461:7"/>
forc'd to travel into foreign Countries, and was
unwilling to take ſuch another Journey, did
not think fit to rely wholly upon this Church-Expedient,
but to give it greater ſtrength he
twiſted into it a Court-party, who by their
Places and Penſions were oblig'd to aſſiſt his
Royal Pleaſure by their Votes in both Houſes
of Parliament: and thus the Monarchy had its
Foundation laid in Place and Penſion, which
by angry People is call'd <hi>BRIBERY.</hi> But let
that be as it will, 'tis certain that Men can never
act ſo vigorouſly for a Bribe, as out of mere
Inclination. Beſides this, mercenary Men are
ſoon diſcover'd in their Deſigns, and the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of their Principle forfeits all their Credit
with the People. So that a ſmall ſteady Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Party in Parliament were a great clog upon
the Projects of Church and Court, which, tho
ſo cloſely united together, prov'd but a lame
Expedient to ſupport the Monarchy in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; ſo that between
theſe two ſtools he fell at laſt to the ground,
but not without thoughts of the only Expedient
by which he might (had he liv'd) have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
himſelf upon the foundation of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:61461:7"/>
King <hi>James</hi> the Second would not truſt to any
of the fore-mention'd Expedients, becauſe none
of them could be ſufficient to carry him thro all
his Deſigns, eſpecially thro that of introducing
Popery. Nothing leſs than a ſtanding Army
could ſupport his Tyranny, but Popery was too
great a weight for the Army to ſtand under:
So that whilſt he was ſubduing the people to
Popery by a Proteſtant Army, he loſt both Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and Army; in conſequence whereof he was
loſt himſelf. And that the loſs of him may by
means of your Majeſty's happy Reign be a Gain
to <hi>England,</hi> it is to be conſider'd,</p>
            <p>IV. By what Expedient your Majeſty may
ſupport the Engliſh Monarchy during your
Reign, and by which you may raiſe it to as
eminent a degree of Glory as it hath ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
heretofore.</p>
            <p>Your Majeſty may remember that the original
foundation of the Monarchy was the great
Territory of Land poſſeſſed by the King: but
your Majeſty is alſo ſenſible that there are but
very ſmall Remainders of this Territory in your
preſent Poſſeſſion; even the very accidental
additions of Lands to the Crown have bin alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61461:8"/>
to the Favorites of the Scotiſh Line: So
that there is need of an Expedient now as much
as ever for the ſupport of the Monarchy.</p>
            <p>Be pleas'd therefore to review the Expedients
of former Princes, and ſee if any of them be
ſutable to your particular Circumſtances, or
proper for your Majeſty to depend upon for the
Support and Glory of your Throne. And,</p>
            <p>As for the Church-party, which was the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Support of the Scotiſh Line, it is ſo much
worn out by a Succeſſion of three Kings, that
'tis very weak and <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> at preſent. The
Craft of the Prieſt, <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in framing
ſuch Interpretations of holy Scripture as ſerve
an indirect Intereſt, was never discover'd ſo
much as of late; and no Perſon has ſo much
contributed to the diſcovery hereof as your own
ſelf; who by the Revolution you have lately
made have revers'd all the Political Divinity
which the Clergy have bin propagating ſince
the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt. 'Twas the
Church-Clergy and Party who by their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and voting oppos'd the Bill for excluding
<hi>James</hi> D. of <hi>York,</hi> a known Papiſt: 'Twas this
Party who impos'd upon the Nation the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of Paſſive Obedience to a Tyrannical
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61461:8"/>
King upon pain of eternal Damnation: They
always avow'd the divine right of a Lineal
Succeſſion to the Crown (by which yout Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
is excluded) and that all Kings are of
God's (not the Peoples) making. From theſe
Principles ſome of 'em openly refus'd to ſwear
Allegiance to your Majeſty; and thoſe of 'em
who yield a paſſive Conformity to your Title
and Government, have bin found in ſeveral
differing ſtories about the ways and means
whereby they ſatisfy their Conſciences in this
matter. Some have alledg'd, that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
having conquer'd us, they may lawfully
ſubmit to a Uſurpation which cannot be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and is ſetled by Succeſs: but all of 'em know
that your Majeſty can make Biſhops and Deans
<hi>de facto,</hi> and therefore they will not queſtion
the Defactoſhip of your Prerogative Royal.
But it cannot be expected that the Clergy, who
have uſually requir'd the Peoples ſubmiſſion to
their Sentiments under the pain of Damnation,
ſhould upon this Revolution be contented to
cry <hi>peccavi,</hi> and openly recant all their former
Doctrines of divine Polity by a hearty active
conformity to your Majeſty's rightful Title
and Government. For this reaſon it is you have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61461:9"/>
receiv'd ſo little reſpect from the body of the
Clergy, altho we have receiv'd all that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
from you.</p>
            <p>But yet ſuppoſe the Church were willing to
exert it ſelf in your Service, its Influence is not
at preſent ſo powerful as it has bin: for by
medling ſo much in State-Affairs ſhe has loſt
(in great meaſure) her former Reputation:
Nor has ſhe ne're ſo numerous a Party as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
ſhe had: for all the Deiſts, Socinians, and
Latitudinarians own no ſuch Church-power at
all. The Presbyterians, Independents, Baptiſts,
and Quakers, tho they have their ſeveral forms
of Church-Government, yet are no friends to
that publickly eſtabliſh'd, but they are unfeigned
lovers of your Majeſty. Bigotry likewiſe has
lately ſuffer'd a great diminution, and Incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is ſtrangely increas'd, and almoſt become
faſhionable. Thus the Authority of the Church
is forc'd to ſubmit to the Reaſon of Mankind;
and all thoſe who are dutiful to your Majeſty
are averſe to the Homilies of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they exclude you from all pretence of
Right to the Crown you wear: So that the
Toleration granted by your Majeſty has done
you more Service than Uniformity can ever do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:61461:9"/>
As for the Court-party 'twas never eſteem'd
to be any more than an Auxiliary to the
Church for the ſupport of K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. in whoſe
Reign too it was diſcover'd, that after a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of Court-Penſioners was publiſh'd from
the Preſs, the Complexion of his Parliaments
was very much changed. And if at any time
ſuch a Liſt ſhould be printed, the People of
<hi>England</hi> would refuſe to give their Votes for
them in the next Election of a Parliament, and
in their ſtead will elect Members of a contrary
temper: People commonly run out of one
Extreme into another; and when they reject a
Courtier, they will probably chooſe a moroſe-humour'd
Man in his place.</p>
            <p>It muſt be allow'd that it has the face of a
politic Expedient to adopt Men of known In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
and Love to their Country into the Court-party;
for hereby the Hearts of the People will
be for the preſent gain'd to the Court: tho theſe
Patriots being endued with a ductile temper,
will ſoon become conformable to the nature of
the Court. This very Expedient has for a time
done good Service to your Majeſty's Affairs both
at home and abroad. But I think it ought to be
conſidered only as a Cordial which for a ſhort
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61461:10"/>
time may revive a languiſhing Man's Spirit,
but yet ought not to be depended upon as a
conſtant ſupport of Life. And as for theſe new
Whig-Courtiers, they will raiſe the Expectations
of all Men to hope for a ſteady virtuous Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration.
But when this reputed Patriot ſhall
accommodate his Diſcourſe to the old ſtyle of
the Court; when he ſhall inſinuate ſuch Notions
to his old Acquaintance, the baſeneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs
whereof his old Friends had heard
him frequently deteſt all his days in which he
was unprefer'd; this new Courtier ſoon loſes
all his Credit and Intereſt with his old Friends,
who refuſe to follow the Decoy Duck into the
Net.</p>
            <p>But this is not all the miſchief which attends
this Project of a Whig-Courtier, but a perſonal
loſs of your own Reputation is actually the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
hereof: for as long as the Court was
made up of Tories, the People were willing to
excuſe your Majeſty, and lay the faults of Male-adminiſtration
upon the Tory-Court, ſaying,
That the old Tools would ſtill do no other than
the old Work. But when a Man of known Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Integrity and Love to his Country, upon
getting a Preferment ſhall change his former
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61461:10"/>
Note, do Violence to himſelf by changing his
avowed Principle, and thereby loſing all the
Reputation which his former Virtue had gain'd
him, every Man will be apt to conclude that
this new Courtier is encourag'd to do this by
ſome higher Power, if not engag'd thereto by
the fear of loſing his Place or Penſion. And
when the People of <hi>England</hi> ſhall come to know
that as ſurely as a Land-man who is imploy'd
at Sea will turn Seaman, ſo certainly will a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot
imploy'd in the Adminiſtration turn Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,
they will begin in earneſt to think of ſuch a
Form of Government which can ſubſiſt without
a Court.</p>
            <p>And having ſaid this, I cannot forbear telling
your Majeſty my Thoughts concerning a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
Party which has bin much talk'd of
in <hi>England</hi> during the Reign of K. <hi>Charles</hi> the
Second, and has not quite bin forgotten at any
time ſince that Reign.</p>
            <p>A great Veneration for Monarchy has bin fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
made uſe of by Men to recommend
themſelves to the particular favor of our Kings
of <hi>England;</hi> and when real occaſions have bin
wanting to recommend their Affection for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
to the notice of the King, a mere fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61461:11"/>
imaginary fear of a Common wealth has
bin made uſe of: and hence they have bin
perſwading our Soverign Princes that a great
number of their Subjects have form'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon Commonwealth Principles, and are
ſtill waiting an opportunity to extirpate the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
and to introduce into its place a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican
form of Government. But your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
has ſeen this fantaſtical Opinion ſufficiently
confuted: For thoſe who were the ſuſpected
Commonwealths-men join'd heartily together
in preſerving the Monarchy, by voting your
Majeſty (then P. of <hi>Orange</hi>) into the Engliſh
Throne, in oppoſition to thoſe Adorers of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
who were ſetting up a Regency; who
had they put the Kingly Power into the hands
of a Committee, had founded a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
or ſomething very hardly to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
from it. But to proceed from matter of
Fact, to reaſon freely upon this matter. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſuppoſe that any Man who has the uſe of
his Reaſon, and liveth under a Monarchy,
ſhould be fond of a Commonwealth, if all
the ends of Government are anſwer'd by the
ſettled Monarchy. So in <hi>Holland</hi> he would be
thought to have loſt the uſe of his Reaſon who
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61461:11"/>
ſhould hazard his Life by endeavouring to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a Monarchy there, where all the ends of
Government are perfectly anſwer'd by the
eſtabliſh'd form of a Commonwealth. The
end of all Governments is the common good of
the People; and if that great End be attained
under any eſtabliſh'd Form, he is fit only for
a Mad-houſe who will endeavour to pull
down the eſtabliſhed form only to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a new one: And a party of ſuch mad
men as theſe can never be ſufficient to raiſe a
jealouſy in any Government which is under an
upright Adminiſtration. Tho it muſt alſo be
acknowledged, that as corrupt Prelats make
way for a Presbyterian Government into the
Church, ſo a corrupt Court-party may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally
introduce a Republican form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
into the State. But to return from
this Digreſſion, ſince Prieſt-craft and Court-craft
have bin (of late) ſo much diſcover'd; ſince
Bigotry of late days is grown out of requeſt;
ſince the unbigotted People are more dutiful to
your Majeſty than the Bigots are; and ſince
the common People of <hi>England</hi> are more firm
and truſty than a Court-party, I cannot but
think that</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:61461:12"/>
A <hi>Real Popularity</hi> would be a better Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
than a Church and Court-party join'd
together can be: for as to the Expedient of a
<hi>Standing Army,</hi> 'tis certain, that beſides its own
intrinſic inſufficiency, <hi>Lewis</hi> the preſent French
King, and <hi>James</hi> the laſt of <hi>England,</hi> have render'd
it odious. It ſtinks in the Noſtrils of all free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
Men, and can only be an Expedient to ſet
up a Commonwealth. But 'tis plain that</p>
            <p>A profeſſed regard to the Common-weal of
the People of <hi>England</hi> ſteddily perſu'd did raiſe the
Engliſh Monarchy under the Adminiſtration of
Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (of bleſſed memory) to as high a
degree of Glory as it did ever attain to when
it ſtood upon its natural Foundation. Nor is
any Expedient ſo proper for your Majeſty to
uſe as this. For,</p>
            <p>1. Upon this Foundation the Glory of your
Illuſtrious Anceſtors was built. And,</p>
            <p>2. Hereby your Majeſty was recommended
to the juſt and rightful poſſeſſion of the Crown
which at preſent you adorn. Party-taking,
Party-making, or Partiality of all ſorts over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, ſhook the Throne
of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and overturn'd the
Monarchy under the Adminiſtration of the late
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61461:12"/>
King <hi>James,</hi> which by your Majeſty's Affection
to the People of <hi>England</hi> was reſtor'd, and by
the ſame means is ſtill preſerv'd, and may be
advanc'd to as high a pitch of Glory as ever
heretofore it had gain'd. For hereby,</p>
            <p>1. All the true ends of Government will be
fully anſwered.</p>
            <p>2. All Factions and Parties will be ſunk
and forgotten: there will be no Whig nor
Tory, no Jacobite, no Church-party, Court-party,
nor Country-party: for the Intereſt of
Court and Country will be one and the ſame,
which has not been known ſince the death of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and therefore will be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
pleaſing for its Novelty, as well as
for its Profitableneſs.</p>
            <p>3. Virtue and Honeſty (which have bin
much decay'd of late years) will be encourag'd
and reſtor'd. For no Man can pretend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
himſelf to your Royal Favour but
by advancing the Deſign which your Majeſty
openly does encourage.</p>
            <p>4. Hereby your Majeſty will gain ſuch a
Credit with your People, as by virtue thereof
very much to increaſe the Wealth and Strength
of the Nation in a ſhort time. And your
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61461:13"/>
Majeſty's Revenue muſt neceſſarily bear a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
proportion to the Trade of your Subjects;
ſo that he who commands the Trade of the
World, will conſequently command the Wealth
of the World. And,</p>
            <p>5. Hereby you may be able to follow the
two great Maxims of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign,
which were,
<list>
                  <item>1<hi>ſt.</hi> To be the Head of the Proteſtants all
over the World. And,</item>
                  <item>2<hi>dly.</hi> To keep the Balance of <hi>Europe</hi> equal
and ſteddy.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And thus the Glory of the Engliſh Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
under your Majeſty's gracious Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will be the Terror of others, and the
Delight of all Engliſh People, which is the
ſincere deſire of</p>
