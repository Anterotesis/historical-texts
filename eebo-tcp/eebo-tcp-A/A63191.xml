            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

they ſtand Indicted by the Names of <hi>Rowland Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Dearing Bradſhaw,</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe Cave,</hi> Gent.
for that they, not having the fear of God before their
eyes, but being inſtigated and ſeduced by the Devil and
their own wicked hearts, on the fourth day of <hi>May,</hi>
in the Fourth year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord
King <hi>James</hi> the Second, in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Nicholas
Cole-Abby,</hi> in and upon Sir <hi>Charles Pymm,</hi> Bar.
Felloniouſly, willfully, and of their malice before thought,
did make an Aſſault; and that he the ſaid <hi>Rowland

certain Rapier made of Iron and Steel, of the value of
about 5 s. and thruſt him the ſaid Sir <hi>Charles Pymm</hi>

Wound of the bredth of one Inch, of the depth of ten
Inches; and that they the ſaid <hi>Dearing, Bradſhaw,</hi>

the Priſoners at the Bar, who all three ſtand indicted for the
Murther of Sir <hi>Charles Pymm</hi> Baronet, in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas
Cole-Abby,</hi> thruſting him through the Body near the

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Another Council for the King.</speaker>
               <p>My Lords, this Murther fell
out on the fourth day of <hi>May</hi> laſt after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> The
ſaid Sir <hi>Charles Pymm,</hi> one Mr. <hi>Mirriday,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Neale,</hi> and
Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton</hi> and others, dined at the Swan Tavern
upon <hi>Fiſh-ſtreet-hill;</hi> after they were come into the Houſe,
they went up ſtairs, after which the Priſoners at the Bar came
into the Houſe, and took another Room to Dine of Beef and
other things. But one of Sir <hi>Charles</hi>'s Company deſired
to have a Plate of it; upon which Mr. <hi>Clowdſley</hi> told them
ſome Gentlemen had beſpoke it for Dinner, but he ſaid he
would get them a Plate of it, which was ſent up, and ordered
to be reckoned into Mr. <hi>Walters</hi> the Priſoners Bill; after Dinner
they drank their Healths, and returned them thanks for their
Beef; and towards the Evening Sir <hi>Charles Pymm</hi> and his
Friends came down ſtairs, and met the Priſoners at the bottom,
and Mr. <hi>Cave</hi> asked them how they liked the Beef that was
ſent up; upon which one in the company anſwered, and told
them, they did not ſend it, for they had paid for it; upon
which farther words aroſe, and Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> drew his Sword
and fell upon Sir <hi>Charles Pymm,</hi> but he got out into the
Streets, after which Mr. <hi>Walters</hi> came forth, and plucked
Sir <hi>Charles Pymm</hi> by the arms, and forced him to fight with
him, ſaying, here is my hand, and here is my Sword; and as
ſoon as he was in the Street, he received this mortal Wound,
and ſo fell down dead; and after this Mr. <hi>Walters</hi> took him
by the nape of the neck, and daſhed his head upon the ground,
and cried out, God Damm you, you are dead; and ſaid farther,
let the Sword alone in his Body. My Lords this ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be done, without any manner of provocation; and if
ſo, I hope your Lordſhips will find him guilty of willful Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

               <p>My Lord, on the fourth day of <hi>May</hi> laſt,
on a Friday, Sir <hi>Charles Pymm,</hi> my ſelf, and theſe Gentlemen
here in Court, came to dine at the Swan Tavern in <hi>Old Fiſh-ſtreet,</hi>
we asked for Meat, and Mr. <hi>Clowdsley,</hi> the man of the
Houſe, told us, we might have Fiſh, for he had no Meat, but
what was beſpoke by Mr. <hi>Walters</hi> and his company; we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
him to help us to a Plate of it if it might be got, which
we had brought up ſtairs; after Dinner we drank the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Health that ſent it, and returned them thanks for
it: a while after Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton</hi> went away, and about
an hour after that, or thereabouts, Sir <hi>Charles Pymm</hi> and the
reſt of us came down to go away, and when we were in
the Entry, Mr. <hi>Cave</hi> met us, and asked Sir <hi>Charles</hi> how he
liked the Beef that was ſent up, who anſwered, we did not
know you ſent it, for we have paid for it; then the Boy that
kept the Bar told us, that he did not reckon it in the Bill; upon
which Mr. <hi>Cave</hi> ſeemed to take it ill. But my Lord, I cannot
be poſitive whether Mr. <hi>Bradshaw</hi> and Mr. <hi>Palms</hi> were at any
words. Then I took Mr. <hi>Cave</hi> to one ſide into the Entry, and
he thought that I had a mind to fight him, but I did what I
could to make an end of the quarrel.</p>

ſaid, <hi>Here is my Hand, and here is my Sword;</hi> but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
both in again into the Tavern, and within two Minutes

through Sir <hi>Charles Pymm</hi>'s Body almoſt a Foot, and he fell

               <p>I know but very little of the matter, but that there
was a Plate of Beef ſent up to us, but we knew not from
whence it came, till afterwards the Drawer brought us word
that the Gentlemen below had ſent it up, after which we
drank their Healths and returned them Thanks for it after
which I went to the Coffee-Houſe hard by, and ſat about
half an hour, and preſently heard a cry of Murther, and I
came down and ſaw Sir <hi>Charles Pymm</hi> lying with a Wound
in his Body, and another in his Head, but I did not know

having not eaten all the day before, we had a piece of Beaf,
of which Sir <hi>Charles Pymm</hi> and his Company had ſome, who
afterwards drank our Healths as I was informed. For my part
my Lord, I never ſaw the Gentleman before in my days: My L.
I am very ſorry it ſhould be my misfortune to kill him in the

you Sir, what I had to do to meddle; I went preſently my
Lord to a Fiſh-mongers where Mr. <hi>Mirriday</hi> was, and Sir
<hi>Charles Pymm</hi> came, and Mr. <hi>Mirriday</hi> ſaid to him, Sir <hi>Charles</hi>
Damn you Sir, go and Fight him, and I will be your Second,
and preſently they came upon me and I Drew my Sword
in my own Defence, and he run me Eight Inches into the
Thigh, and at the ſame Paſs, I had the misfortune my Lord, to
run him into the Body.</p>

               <speaker>Mirriday.</speaker>
               <p>No Sir, I did not ſee that, neither did I ſay any

               <p>My Lord, all that I ſaw of the Buſineſs was, that
when the Coach-man was called to the door, Mr. <hi>Neale</hi>
came and threatned him if he did not ſtay; then Mr. <hi>Cave</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> was in the Entry, and I heard them
diſcourſe about Beef, and ſome of them ſaid, you give us
<hi>Beef</hi> and make us pay for it, and there was anſwer made
they were Raſcals that ſaid ſo, for they did not. There was
one of the Gentlemen in our Shop hearing of it, ſaid, Let
me come to him, I will Fight him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bar. Jen.</speaker>
               <p>Gent. of the Jury, you have three Perſons, Indicted
<hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Walters,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cave,</hi> for Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99297:3"/>
Sir <hi>Charles Pymm</hi> Baronet, and have had ſeveral Witneſſes
called for the King againſt the Priſoners at the Bar, the firſt
to which was Mr. <hi>Mirriday,</hi> and he gives you this Account,
and it is all that each and every one gives, and it agrees on all
ſides; and he tells you, that all thoſe Gentlemen were to
Dine at Mr. <hi>Cloudſleys,</hi> at the <hi>Swan Tavern</hi> in <hi>Old Fiſh-ſtreet;</hi>
and that they were there at Dinner it is very plainly proved.
And being there, it ſeems that ſome of thoſe Gentlemen had
beſpoke a Fiſh Dinner, ſome Fleſh, and had ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> a Plate
of Beef; and he tells you alſo that when Dinner was over,
ſome Words did ariſe concerning the Reckoning, and that
one of the Companies were got down Stairs in the Entry,
where a further Quarrel did ariſe. <hi>Mr. Merriday</hi> tells you
further, that Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> and he Quarrelled, ſo there
was a Scufflie in the Entry; after which things were pretty
well quieted there, in comes <hi>Mr. Walters</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles
Pymm,</hi> and while Mr. <hi>Mirriday</hi> was ſecuring the firſt Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
they, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Pymm</hi> and Mr. <hi>Walters</hi> were
got out at the Door, and Sir <hi>Charles</hi> was ſtooping down, and
Mr. <hi>Walters</hi> was puſhing upon his Neck and throwing him
down.</p>
               <p>So ſaid Mr. <hi>Mirriday,</hi> and when he went to take the Sword
out of his Body he ſaw him a dying Man.</p>
               <p>The next Evidence was Mr. <hi>Neale,</hi> and he obſerves to you,
that one of the Gentlemen did ſay, that the Quarrel was not
intended againſt them; and he gives an account of the Story,
how that it was about the Beef; how that Sir <hi>Charles</hi> was
Run through by <hi>Walters,</hi> but did not ſee him knock his
Head againſt the Ground.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> gives the like Account, and ſaith; that whileſt
they were a Scuffling in the Entry, Sir <hi>Charles</hi> was Kill'd at
the Door.</p>
               <p>The next Evidence is the Drawer, who tells you of a Squab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that Mr. <hi>Neale</hi> had with the Coach-man at the Door; and
how that there was left four of the Gentlemen behind, and
that the Coach-man was unwilling to Wait becauſe it Rained,
his Horſes being Hot, they might catch Cold; whereupon
he put his Foot-boy into the Coach, and threatned the Coach-man
if he went away: This was before they fell out about
the Meat.</p>
               <p>The next Evidence was one <hi>Brummidge</hi> the Fiſhmonger,
he gives the ſame Account, how that a Quarrel was amongſt
them, and how that Mr. <hi>Walters</hi> was on one ſide of the Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
and Sir <hi>Charles Pymm</hi> on the other ſide, and there they
ſtood with their Swords drawn, and as ſoon as they came to
Cloſe they Wounded each other, and Sir <hi>Charles Pymm</hi> was
Killed, but he did not ſee his Head knock'd againſt the
Ground.</p>
               <p>Comes <hi>Fletcher</hi> my Lord Mayor's Officer, and he tells you
that he was going by the Door home into <hi>Bread-ſtreet,</hi> and he
ſees a Man that was wounded ſtooping down; and he Swears
that Mr. <hi>Walters</hi> took him by the Nape of his Neck, and
knock'd his head againſt the Ground, and heard him Swear,
<hi>Let the Sword ſtick in him. Sarah Web</hi> and another Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſpeaks it to be in the like manner; and one of them talks
of Mr. <hi>Walter</hi>'s pulling Sir <hi>Charles Pymm</hi> out of the Entry
before he would come out.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all Gentlemen, here was Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> one of their
Company, who went away to the Coffee-Houſe, and hearing
Murther cryed out, he came and found Sir <hi>Charles Pymm</hi>
Kill'd and quite Dead. This, Gentlemen, is the Evidence that
you have heard as near as I can give it you.</p>
               <p>Now for the Priſoner Mr. <hi>Walters,</hi> he would have you
believe, as if Sir <hi>Charles</hi> had ſtruck him before he drew
his Sword, but he hath not proved it: Likewiſe ſpeaks of
Mr. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> but he doth not remember that Sir <hi>Charles
Pymm</hi> ſtruck him before he drew: But ſo it was, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that was a quarrel in which that Honourable and Worthy
Gentleman, Sir <hi>Charles Pymm,</hi> loſt his Life.</p>
               <p>Now for Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> he confeſſeth that there was a
quarrel, but he ſaith that he did not know when or how Sir
<hi>Charles Pymm</hi> was killed; and for Mr. <hi>Cave,</hi> I do not find
any thing objected againſt him, nor either of them.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, I muſt tell you what the Law is in this
caſe: Firſt of all to begin with Mr. <hi>Walters,</hi> ſo as it fairs with
<hi>Mr. Walters,</hi> ſo you may be guided to deal with the other
two: Now it hath not been made appear by any of the Evidence
that you have heard, that there was any premeditated malice
between them, for they were never in company before, and
knew not each other, ſo that there could be no manner of
malice from him in particular.</p>
               <p>The next ſtep, Gentlemen, is, Here is nothing that can
impute a general malice upon <hi>Mr. Walters,</hi> for if I had no
deſign to kill a man, and kill another with whom I do not
quarrel, that cannot be any premeditated malice; but I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
think that there was a little heat of Wine amongſt them:
And this whole Action was carried on by nothing elſe but by a
hot and ſudden Frolick, and I am very ſorry that it ſhould fall
upon ſuch a Worthy Gentleman as he was: And if ſo that
there was no malice premeditated, then he can be found guilty
of nothing but Manſlaughter; and as for the other two,
they muſt be totally acquitted: if I have erred in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
up of theſe Evidences, or miſtaken my ſelf in any Point,
here are my Brothers to help me.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then the Gentlemen of the Jury withdrew for about the
ſpace of half an hour, and returned into Court: Upon a
ſcruple of Conſcience, one amongſt them ſpoke to the Court
as followeth.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jury.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, We are not ſatisfied in our Conſciences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the death of Sir <hi>Charles Pymm,</hi> we find in it Malice
fore thought, becauſe after he had run the Sword through his
Body, he was not ſatisfied with that, but muſt knock his
head againſt the ground: So we do take it, that the ſaid Sir
<hi>Charles Pymm</hi> was maliciouſly Murthered.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſtice <hi>Allibone.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to direct you in this Caſe, and tell you what the Law
ſaith in it, that it cannot reach mans Life, where no propenſe
Malice is proved; that there is none proved, appears very plain
to me, and I hope alſo to you, becauſe it hath been proved
that thoſe Gentlemen, <hi>viz.</hi> the Priſoners at the Bar, and the
deceaſed, had never been in company before.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Gentlemen, You are upon your Oaths to ſerve the King as
Jury-men, and I, as a Judge, am upon my Oath to try the
Cauſe as well on the behalf of the Living as the Dead: So that
upon the whole Matter, Gentlemen, this can be called no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but a Storm, an ungoverned Storm that ſuch men
are ſubject to; ſo that it doth not reach precedent Malice but
ſubſequent Paſſion, which ſad Paſſion was continued to that
height, that Sir <hi>Charles Pymm</hi> in the midſt of it loſt his
Life.</p>
            <p>Then the Jury went out again for about a quarter of an
hour, and returning brought <hi>Mr. Walters</hi> in Guilty of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter,
but the other two were acquitted.</p>
