            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the Empire obtained by her husband, ſhe not only added <hi>Aethiopia</hi> to it, but ſhe carried the war into <hi>India,</hi> which beſides her and <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great never any in vaded. At laſt when ſhe deſired to lie with her ſon, ſhe was killed by him, having reigned two and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years after <hi>Ninus.</hi> Her ſon <hi>Ninns</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the Empire purchaſed by his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, did abandon the ſtudy of war, and as if he had changed his ſex with his mother, he grew old in the company of Ladies, being ſeldome at any time ſeen by men; his Succeſſors alſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his example, gave anſwers to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by their Agents. The <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards were called <hi>Syrians,</hi> did poſſeſs the Empire for the ſpace of one thouſand and three hundred yeers. The laſt that reigned was <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danapalus,</hi> a man more diſſolute then a woman. When his Lieutenant over the <hi>Medes, Arba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus</hi> by name, after great ſolicitation could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be admitted into his preſence, which was vouchſafed unto none before him, he found him amongſt a throng of Concubines ſpinning Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on a diſtaff, and diſtributing their tasks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and exceeding them all both in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminacy of his habit, the ſoftneſs of his body, and the wanton glances of his eye: Which things obſerved, <hi>Arbactus</hi> being poſſeſt with indignation, that ſo many men ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jet to ſuch a woman, and that thoſe who did
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62253:11"/>
bear arms ſhould obey a Spinſter, repairing to his companions, he did communicate to them what he beheld; he denied that he could pay Homage unto him who had rather be a woman then a man. A conſpiracy therefore was plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and war was made on <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> which he underſtanding, (not as a man who would defend his Kingdom, but as women at the fear of death) he looked firſt about where to hide him; then with a few, and thoſe out of all military order, he advanced to the battell; being overcome, he retired himſelf into his Court, where a pile of wood being prepared and burning, he threw himſelf and his riches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire, in this only having imitated a man: After this <hi>Arbactus</hi> the Governor of the <hi>Medes,</hi> and the killer of the King, was made King himſelf; he tranſlated the Empire from the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> to the <hi>Medes:</hi> After many Kings the Kingdom did deſcend to <hi>Aſtyages</hi> by the order of Succeſſion. He in a dream be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held a Vine to ſpring from the womb of his only daughter, by the branches whereof all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> was ſhadowed: The Magicians being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked their counſel, they made anſwer, that from the ſame daughter he ſhould have a Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child whoſe greatneſs was preſaged, and that he himſelf ſhould loſe the Kingdom: Being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at this anſwer, he gave his daughter in marriage neither to a Gentleman nor to a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62253:12"/>
leſt the nobility of the Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould elevate the mind of his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child, but to <hi>Cambyſes</hi> a mean man, and one at that time of the obſcure Nation of the <hi>Perſians:</hi> And the fear of his dream being not thus taken off, he ſent for his daughter being great with child, that the child ſhould eſpecially be killed in the ſight of the Grandfather. The Infant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born, was delivered to <hi>Harpagus</hi> (a parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker with the King in all his counſels) to be killed. He fearing that if the King being dead, and the Empire divolved to his daughter, becauſe that <hi>Aſtyages</hi> had no male-child, ſhe would take that revenge from the ſervant which ſhe could not from the father for the murder of her ſon, did deliver the Babe to the Kings Shepheard to be expoſed in the woods to the mercy of wilde beaſts. It ſo fell out, that at the ſame time the Shepheard had a ſon born; his wife, hearing of the expoſition of this royall Infant, did earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreat her husband that the child might be brought home and ſhewed her: Returning to the wood he found a bitch cloſe unto the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant giving ſuck unto him, and defending him from the birds and beaſts: and being himſelf moved to compaſſion, with which he ſaw the bitch to be touched, he brought the Infant to his cottage, the bitch all the way ſollicitouſly following him; as ſoon as the woman took him into her arms, the boy danced as to a note of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62253:12"/>
muſick; and there appeared in him ſuch a vigor, and ſuch ſweet ſmiles of flattering innocence, that the wife of her own accord did deſire the Shepheard to expoſe her own child for him, and to give her leave to bring up that boy either for his hopefulneſs, or for his fortune; and thus the condition of the little ones being changed, the one was brought up for the Shepheard, and the other expoſed for the Grand child of the King. The name of the Nurſe was afterwards called <hi>Spacon,</hi> for ſo the <hi>Perſians</hi> do call a bitch. The boy being brought up amongſt the Shepheards, received the name of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Not long after being by lot choſen King amongſt his Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellows, when by wantonneſs he puniſhed thoſe who appeared to be ſtubborn with ſtripes, a complaint was brought from the fathers of the boys to the King, diſdaining that the ſons of ingenuous men ſhould be whipped like ſlaves by a ſervant of the Kings. The boy being ſent for, and the reaſon of it demanded, when with a countenance nothing changed, he made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that he did as a King; the King admiring his conſtancy, did call to mind his dream, and the anſwer of the Magitians into his memory; and when his Phyſiognomy and likeneſs, and the time of his being expoſed, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Shepheard did all agree, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him to be his Grandchild; and becauſe he thought he was clear of his dream,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62253:13"/>
the domination of <hi>Cyrus</hi> being exerciſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Shepheards, he only diſmiſſed him with a check: but being angry with <hi>Harpagus</hi> in revenge of his preſerved Grandchild, he ſlew his own ſon, and delivered him to his father to feaſt on; <hi>Harpagus</hi> for the preſent having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled his grief, deferred his hatred of the act to an occaſion of revenge.</p>
            <p>Some yeers after this, when <hi>Cyrus</hi> grew into years, <hi>Harpagus</hi> being admoniſhed with his grief that he was childleſs, did write unto <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> how he was made over by his Grandfather to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> how he commanded him to be ſlain being a little one, how he was preſerved by his benefit, how he had offended the King by it, and loſt his own ſon: He exhorted him to prepare an Army and advance the ready way into the Kingdom, promiſing that the <hi>Medes</hi> ſhould turn unto him; the Letter becauſe it could not be carried openly, (the Kings Garriſons guarding all the avenues) was put into the belly of a diſentrail'd Hare, and he Hare was delivered to a faithful ſervant to be carried to <hi>Cyrus</hi> into <hi>Perſia;</hi> Nets were alſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him, that under the pretence of hunting the deceit might be more conceal'd. The Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being read, he was commanded in a dream to take the ſame courſe, and was forewarned that whom he firſt ſhould meet with on the next morning, he ſhould take him as a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62253:13"/>
in his enterprizes. Beginning his journey about the break of day, he met with the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of a <hi>Median, Sybaris</hi> by name, who late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had eſcaped out of priſon; his pedigree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded, he no ſooner underſtood that he was a <hi>Perſian,</hi> but his chains being knocked off, he took him as his companion, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the City of <hi>Perſopolis.</hi> The people being there called together, he commanded all of them to be ready with their hatchets to cut down the wood that ſhut up the way; which when they had cheerfully performed, he invited them on the next day to a dinner, and when he obſerv'd them made more cheerful, he demanded of them, that if a condition were propounded to them, which courſe of life they would make choice of, whether of yeſterdays labor, or of this days dinner; as they all cryed out, Of this days dinner; you ſhall live all your lives, ſaid he, like to yeſterdays labor, as long as you obey the <hi>Medes;</hi> but if you will follow me, you ſhall lead a life like to your preſent feaſting. All of them rejoycing thereat, he made war upon the <hi>Medians. Aſtyages</hi> forgetting what <hi>Harpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> had deſerved of him, did commit the chief command of the war unto him; he no ſooner received the Army, but preſently did betray it unto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> revenging the cruelty of the King with the perfidiouſneſs of revolt; which when <hi>Aſtyages</hi> underſtood, having from all places
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62253:14"/>
drawo together new forces, he advanced in perſon againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and the fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begun again with great reſolution, whiles his men were in the height of the conflict, he placed a part of his Army on their Rear, and commanded them to fall on the flying ſouldiers with their ſwords as on enemies, &amp; proclaimed to thoſe in the Van with him, that unleſs they overcame, they ſhould find no leſs reſolute men on their Rear then in their Front; therefore he adviſed them to look to it, whether this Army was to be broken by them flying, or that by them fighting. Admoniſhed by this neceſſity, his Army did fight with great reſolution; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Army of the <hi>Perſians</hi> (being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced) began to give ground a little, their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and their wives did meet them, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to return into the battel; the ſouldiers delaying to rally and to charge again, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men pulling up their cloaths did ſhew them the nakedneſs of their bodies, and asked them if they would fly back into the wombs of their mothers or their wives; being reſtrained with this check, they returned into the battel, and having made a violent impreſſion upon their enemies, they inforce thoſe of fly from whom before they fled.</p>
            <p>In this fight <hi>Aſtyages</hi> was taken, from whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> took nothing but his Kingdom, and deported himſelf to him rather like a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62253:14"/>
Grandchild then a Conqueror; and becauſe he would not return again unto the <hi>Medians,</hi> he made him Governor of the populous Nation of the <hi>Hyrcanians.</hi> This was the end of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the <hi>Medes,</hi> which continued three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty years. <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the beginning of his Reign made <hi>Cybaris</hi> Governor of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> &amp; gave him his ſiſter to marriage, having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his viſion in the night delivered him from his chains, and made him his companion in all his enterprizes. But the Cities of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> which were tributary, thinking their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition changed with their Empire, did revolt from <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which was the cauſe and original of many wars unto him; but the greateſt part of them being at laſt ſubdued, when he made war againſt the <hi>Babylonians, Croeſus</hi> the King of the <hi>Lydians</hi> who in thoſe days was famous for his treaſure and rich moveables, did march to their aſſiſtance; but being overcome, and ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous for his own ſafety, he fled into his back Kingdom. <hi>Cyrus</hi> after this victory having ſetled the affairs in <hi>Babylon,</hi> did carry the war into <hi>Lydia,</hi> where he eaſily overcame the Army of <hi>Croeſus;</hi> they being diſcouraged at the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the former fight, <hi>Craeſus</hi> himſelf was taken; but by how much the war was of the leſs danger, by ſo much the milder was the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. <hi>Croeſus</hi> had his life, and ſome parts of his Patrimony, and the City <hi>Borce</hi> granted to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62253:15"/>
him, in which although he lived not a Kingly life, yet it was next to Kingly Majeſty. This clemency was no leſs profitable to the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror then the Conquered; for it being known that war was made againſt him, Auxiliaries came in ſuch great numbers to him out of all <hi>Greece,</hi> as to extinguiſh a common fire; ſo great was the love which the Cities in general did profeſs to <hi>Croeſus,</hi> that <hi>Cyrus</hi> would have pull'd a heavy war from all <hi>Greece</hi> upon himſelf, if he had determined any thing too cruelly againſt <hi>Croe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the proceſs of time <hi>Cyrus</hi> being imployed in other wars, the <hi>Lydians</hi> again rebelled, who being again overcome, their horſes and arms were taken from them, and they were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to exerciſe voluptuous and effeminate arts and employments, by which means that indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious &amp; heretofore powerful and warlike Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being weakned by ſloth and riot, did loſe their antient vertue, and whom before <hi>Cyrus</hi> no wars could maſter, being fallen into luxury, eaſe and exceſs did overcome. The <hi>Lydians</hi> had many Kings before <hi>Croeſus</hi> famous for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny adventures; but the fortune of <hi>Candaules</hi> is to be compared unto none, who, when he made his wife the ſubject of all his diſcourſe, whom he too much loved for the excellence of her beauty; and as if ſilence were the enemy of beauty, being not content with the tacit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62253:15"/>
of his pleaſures, unleſs he revealed the ſecrets of wedlock, to add at laſt a proof to his aſſeveration, ſhewed her naked to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion <hi>Gyges,</hi> by which fact he made both his friend his enemy, being allured to commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with his wife, and her love being thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed to another, he eſtranged his wife from himſelf; for not long after the murder of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daules,</hi> was the reward of the marriage. The wife being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62253:16"/>
which when it was declared to the Queen, ſhe ſent her young ſon to purſue him with the third part of the Army. When he came to <hi>Cyrus</hi> Camp, the young man being unexperienced in the affairs of war, forgetting his enemies, and as if he came to feaſt and not to fight, did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> unaccuſtomed to wine, to overburthen themſelves with it, and the <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were overcome with wine before they were overcome in war; for this being diſcovered, <hi>Cyrus</hi> returning by night did oppreſs them, not thinking of him, and put all the <hi>Scythians</hi> to the ſword, and the ſon of their Queen. <hi>Thomy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> (ſo great an Army being loſt, and which is more to be lamented, her only ſon) did not pour forth her grief into tears that ſhe was childleſs, but did reſerve it into the comfort of revenge, and with the like policy of deceit circumvented her enemies inſulting at their late victory; for counterfeiting a diſtruſt of her ſtrength, and retiring in ſome diſorder, by reaſon of the loſs received, ſhe brought <hi>Cyrus</hi> into a ſtraight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two hills, where her Ambuſcado being lodged, ſhe killed two hundred thouſand of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> with the King himſelf. In which victory this alſo was memorable, That there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained not a meſſenger of ſo great an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw. The head of <hi>Cyrus</hi> being cut off, the Queen commanded it to be caſt into a tub fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the blood of men, with this exprobra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62253:17"/>
were conſcious of this confederacy, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, that they might not have the leiſure to repent and diſcloſe the plot, with ſwords un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their garments did repair to the Court. There thoſe being killed whom they met with in the way, they came unto the <hi>Magi,</hi> who wanted not courage to defend themſelves; for with drawn ſwords they killed two of the Conſpirators; howſoever they were apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the greater number, one of whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſt in the arms of <hi>Gobrias,</hi> his companions doubting leſt they ſhould kill him in the ſtead of <hi>Magus,</hi> becauſe it was acted in a dark place, he commanded them to make ſure work of it, though the ſword ſhould paſs even thorough his own body; but fortune ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, he was preſerved, and <hi>Magus</hi> ſlain. The <hi>Magi</hi> being deſtroyed, great was the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which theſe Princes did obtain for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome reſtored; but greater far was their glory in this, that when they were in debate on a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, they did ſo well agree upon it; for they were ſo equal in vertue and nobility, that the equality could hardly give an advantage to the people in the Election: They therefore of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves found out a way by which they might commit a triall of themſelves both to Religion and to Fortune. They did all agree, that on an appointed morning they ſhould on the break of day come every one on horſeback before the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62253:18"/>
Court, and he whoſe horſe was firſt heard to neigh before the riſing of the Sun, he ſhould be King. For the <hi>Perſians</hi> do believe the Sun to be the only God, and that horſes are conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him. <hi>Darius</hi> the ſon of <hi>Hyſtaſpes</hi> was one of their Aſſociates, who being deſirous of the Kingdom, the maſter of his horſe aſſured him, that if that were all which made the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doubtful, he ſhould take no more care for it; therefore on the night before the appointed day he brought a Mare to the ſame place, and did let looſe the horſe unto her, conceiving by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs to the Venereal pleaſure that it would ſo fall out, as indeed it did. On the next day when they all met on the prefixed hour, the horſe of <hi>Darius,</hi> the place being known unto him, did preſently neigh aloud, out of his deſire to the Mare, and the other horſes being dull and heavy, did give a happy auſpication to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. So great was the moderation of the reſt of the Nobility, that this auſpication being heard, they rather leaped then alighted from their horſes, and ſaluted <hi>Darius</hi> King. The people alſo following the approbation of the Princes, did conſtitute him King. Thus the Kingdom of the <hi>Perſians</hi> being recovered by the vertue of ſeven of the moſt noble of the Princes, in ſo ſhort a ſpace, was conferred into the power of one. It is altogether incredible to conſider with what a pious gallantry this

            <p>IN this relation of the atchievements of the <hi>Scythians</hi> which were of large extent and magnificence, we muſt derive their Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree from their firſt original; for they had beginnings as illuſtrious as was their Empire, and were no leſs famous under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of women then of men; for the men did found the Kingdom of the <hi>Parthians</hi> and the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> and the women did erect the kingdom of the <hi>Amazons;</hi> if you conſider the deeds done both by the men and women, it will be uncertain to determine which of their Sexes were moſt famous. The Nation of the <hi>Scythians</hi> was always eſteemed to be of all moſt antient; although for a long time there was a contention betwixt the <hi>Scythians</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:62253:20"/>
and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> concerning the Antiquity of their Nations. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> alleadging that in the beginning of all things, when other Lands did burn with the immoderate heat of the Sun, or were frozen with the extremity of the cold; ſo that they were not onely inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to produce men, but could neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or entertain any adventitious, before ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliments for their bodies were found out, to defend them from the violence of the heat or cold; or the intractableneſs of the places were made more tolerable by remedies procured by Art; <hi>Egypt</hi> was always ſo temperate, that neither the heat of the Summer, nor the cold of the Winter, did oppreſs her inhabitants. The ſoil was alſo ſo fruitful, that no place did more abound with nouriſhment for the uſe of mankinde; therefore it in reaſon may appear that men were firſt born there, where they could moſt eaſily be brought up. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, the <hi>Scythians</hi> conceived the temper of the Heavens to be an Argument of no force to prove Antiquity; for when Nature did firſt diſtribute the beginings either of heat or cold unto Countries, ſhe ſtraight way, not onely produced creatures to endure the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of that Clime, but divers kinds of Fruits and Trees, aptly qualified and ſuitable to the condition of the Countries. And by how much the Climate of the <hi>Scythians</hi> is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62253:20"/>
more ſharp then the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> by ſo much their bodies and their underſtandings are more ſolid. But if the world was ever entire in one piece, as it is now divided into many; or if in the beginning of things the deluge of waters did overwhelm the earth, or if the fire which begot the world did poſſeſs all things; the <hi>Scythians</hi> in every reſpect were moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in their original: for if the fire firſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed all things, which by degrees being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, gave place unto the earth; there was no place that was ſooner ſevered from the fire then the North, by reaſon of the cold; as to this day it is to be ſeen, that no Clime is more ſtiffe with Winter; but <hi>Egypt</hi> and all the Eaſt received long afterwards their temper, ſeeing it doth ſtill burn with the violent heat of the Sun. On the other ſide, if all Lands were heretofore drowned in the Deeps, no doubt but every higheſt part (the waters flowing down) was firſt uncovered, and that the water ſtayed for a long time in the lower Countries; and the ſooner that any part of the earth became dry before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſooner it began to bring forth creatures. But <hi>Scythia</hi> is ſo high in her ſituation above all other Lands, that all Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers which have their beginnings there, do flow down firſt unto the <hi>Maeotick,</hi> then into the <hi>Pontick,</hi> and afterwards into the <hi>Egyptian</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:62253:21"/>
Sea, but <hi>Egypt</hi> (whoſe fences have been made at the care and charges of ſuch great Kings, and ſo many ages, and provided with ſo many Banks againſt the force of the falling Rivers, and cut into ſo many Ditches, that when the waters are drayned from one place they are received into another; and yet for all this cannot be inhabited, unleſs <hi>Nilus</hi> too be excluded) cannot appear to pretend to any antiquity, which both by the exaggeration either of her Kings, and of <hi>Nilus</hi> drawing ſo much mud after it, doth ſeem of all Lands to be the laſt inhabited. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> being overcome with theſe Arguments, the <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were always eſteemed the more Antient. <hi>Scythia</hi> being ſtretch'd forwards towards the Eaſt, is inclos'd on one ſide with <hi>Pontus,</hi> and on the other with the <hi>Riphaean</hi> mountains, on the back of us with <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the River <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</hi> The men have no limits to their poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they Till not the ground, nor have any houſe or ſhelter, or place of reſidence being accuſtomed to wander through waſte and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented places, as they drive and feed their Cattel: they carry their wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with them in Waggons: Which (being covered with the Hides of Beaſts to defend them from the ſhowers and tempeſts) they do uſe in the ſtead of houſes. The Juſtice of the Nation is more beautified by the ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62253:21"/>
of their converſation, then by their Laws. There is no crime amongſt them more capitall then theft; for having flocks and droves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any houſe or fence, what would be ſafe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them if it were lawful for them to ſteal? they deſpiſe gold and ſilver as much as other men do covet it. They feed on milk and honey. The uſe of Wool and of Apparel is unknown unto them; and becauſe they are pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with continual cold, they are cloathed with the skins of wild beaſts, great and ſmal.</p>
            <p>This their continence hath endued them with ſuch a righteouſneſs of converſation, that they covet not any thing which is their neighbours; for there is the deſire of riches where is the uſe of it; and it were to be wiſhed that in other men there were the like moderation and abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence; ſurely not ſo many wars ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued through all Ages, almoſt over all Lands, neither ſhould the ſword devour more men then the natural condition of Fate. It is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful indeed, that Nature hath granted that to theſe, which the <hi>Grecians</hi> could not attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the repeated Inſtructions of their wiſe men, and the Precepts of their Philoſophers, and that their refined Manners ſhould ſtoop in the compariſon to unrefined Barbariſm; ſo much the ignorance of vices hath profited more in them, then doth in others the knowledge of vertue. The <hi>Scythians</hi> thrice attempted the chief com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

of <hi>Aſia,</hi> they themſelves did always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main either untouched or unconquered by the forces of others; by a ſhamefull flight they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from <hi>Scythia Darius</hi> King of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.</hi> They deſtroyed <hi>Cyrus</hi> with all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and in the ſame manner they overthrew <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyron</hi> one of the Commanders of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the Great, with all his power: They heard of, but not felt the arms of the <hi>Romans.</hi> They erected the <hi>Parthian</hi> and <hi>Bactrian</hi> Kingdoms, a Nation proud of war and labor. The ſtrength of their bodies is great, they lay up nothing which they are afraid to loſe, and where they are Conquerors, they deſire nothing but glory. <hi>Vexores</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt</hi> was the firſt that made war upon the <hi>Scythians,</hi> having firſt by Ambaſſadors ſent a Summons to them to obey him; But the <hi>Scythians</hi> being before adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by their Neighbours of the coming of the King, made anſwer, We wonder that the Commander of ſo rich a People ſhould ſo fooliſhly make war againſt poor men, having more reaſon to look to his affairs at home; for here the event of the war is uncertain, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the Conqueſt are none, and the loſſes are apparent; therefore they would not attend till he ſhould come to them, when in ſo great and rich an enemy there was more by them to be expected, and therefore of their own accord they were reſolved to meet him. Their deeds
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62253:22"/>
did jump and overtake their words; and the King underſtanding that they marched towards him with ſo much ſpeed, he turned his back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and his Army with all the Bag and Baggage being left behind, he timorouſly eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into his Kingdom. The Marſhes did hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Scythians</hi> from the purſuit. Being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from thence they ſubdued <hi>Aſia,</hi> and made it tributary, a ſmall tribute being impoſed rather to ſhew their titular Command, then for any reward of their victory. Having ſtayed fifteen yeers in eſtabliſhing the affairs of <hi>Aſia,</hi> they were called back by the importunity of their wives, it being aſſured them by their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, that unleſs they did return with more ſpeed, they would ſeek for iſſue from their Neighbours, nor ever ſuffer through their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, that the Nations of the <hi>Scythians</hi> ſhould have no name in poſterity. <hi>Aſia</hi> was tributary to the <hi>Scythians</hi> for the ſpace of one thouſand and five hundred yeers; <hi>Ninus</hi> King of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> did put a period to the tribute: But in this interval of time, two young men of roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all blood amongſt the <hi>Scythians, Plinos</hi> and <hi>Scolopythus</hi> being driven from their own Countrey by the faction of the Nobility, did draw with them a gallant and numerous train of young men, and ſitting down in the coaſt of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> neer unto the River of <hi>Thermodoon,</hi> they did inhabite the <hi>Themiſcyrian</hi> Plains
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62253:23"/>
which they had conquered to obedience: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unaccuſtomed there for the ſpace of many yeers to plunder their Neighbours, they were at laſt ſlain through treachery by the conſpiracy of the people. Their wives when they obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their puniſhment to be without children, to be added to their baniſhment, did put on arms, and firſt by removing, and afterwards by commencing wars, they did defend their own Territories. They alſo did forbear the deſire of marriage with their Neighbours, calling i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The body of the King being known, the <hi>Dorians</hi> marched back without any engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all: By this means the <hi>Athenians</hi> were delivered from the war by the vertue of their King, who for the ſafety of his Country,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62253:27"/>
did devote himſelf to deſtruction. After <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus</hi> there was no King of <hi>Athens,</hi> which is added to the memory of <hi>Codrus</hi> his name. The adminiſtration of the Commonwealth was tranſmitted to yeerly Magiſtrates; but the City had then no Laws at all, becauſe the will of the Rulers did paſs for Laws. <hi>Solon</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was choſen, a man famous for Juſtice, who with his Laws did as it were erect a new City, and did deport himſelf with ſo great a temper between the Senate and the People, that when he propounded ſomething for one order, which might ſeem to diſpleaſe the other, he received equall thanks from both. Amongſt many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things of this man, this doth moſt prefer it ſelf to obſervation. The <hi>Athenians</hi> and the <hi>Megarans</hi> did contend with arms for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the Iſle of <hi>Megara,</hi> almoſt to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſtruction of both parties. After many overthrows, it began to be a capital offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Athenians,</hi> if any one had but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the vindication of their right to the Iſland; <hi>Solon</hi> being therefore perplexed, left by his ſilence he ſhould be unprofitable to the Commonwealth, or by his ſpeech he ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger his life, he diſguiſed himſelf into a madneſs, by the liberty whereof he could not only ſpeak, but do things that were prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In a torn unfaſhioned habite, juſt like a mad man, he came into the publick, where a

great aſſembly being drawn together, that the better he might diſſemble his counſell, he began to perſwade the people in verſes unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to him, to that which was forbidden, and ſo poſſeſſed the minds of them all, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately war was decreed againſt the <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans.</hi> In the mean time the <hi>Megarans</hi> being mindful of the war which was made againſt them by the <hi>Athenians;</hi> and fearing leſt they ſhould ſeem in vain to have attempted war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, did repair to their ſhips, having a deſign to oppreſs by night the <hi>Athenian</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons at their Eleuſin devotions. Which being underſtood, <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> Captain General of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> did lay an Ambuſh for them, the Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Megarans</hi> when they obſerved the form and building of the ſhips, and the booty that was purchaſed, ran down to the ſhore to meet them, where being all ſlain, <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> became almoſt Maſter of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

Thus the <hi>Megarans</hi> by their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit did give a victory to their enemies; but <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> as if he overcame for himſelf, and not for his Countrey, did by ſubtility invade the ſoveraign Authority; for having afflicted himſelf at home with voluntary ſtripes, his body being torn, he came forth into the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, and an Aſſembly being called, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his wounds unto the people; be complained of the cruelty of the Rulers, by whom he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled that he ſuffered this opprobrious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury; tears were added to his complaints, and by his envious words the credulous people were incenſed; he affirmed that he was hated by the Senate for his love unto the people; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Guard for the preſervation of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; by the power of whom being eſtabliſhed in his tyranny he reigned three and thirty yeers. After his death, <hi>Diocles</hi> one of his ſons, having raviſhed a Virgin, was killed by the brother of the Maid. His other brother <hi>Hippias</hi> being ſetled in his fathers Government, did command the killer of his Brother to be apprehended, who when by torments he was inforced to name thoſe who were guilty with him of the murder, he named all the friends of the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, who being put to death, the Tyrant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded if there were any yet remaining of them; he anſwered, there are no more whom I now deſire to have dead, but the Tyrant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62253:28"/>
by which words, after the revenge of his Siſters chaſtity, he ſhewed himſelf to be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror of the Tyrant himſelf. By his vertue the City being admoniſhed of her liberty, <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias</hi> at laſt was driven from his Kingdom into baniſhment, who repairing to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> did offer himſelf as a Guide unto <hi>Darius</hi> in his war againſt his Countrey. Therefore the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (the approach of <hi>Darius</hi> being underſtood) deſiring aid of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> a City then in friendſhip with them, and finding that by reaſon of ſome Religion they demanded the reſpite of four days, their aſſiſtance being not regarded, with ten thouſand of their own Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and a thouſand Auxiliaries of the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſians,</hi> they advanced into the fields of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rathon,</hi> againſt ſix hundred thouſand of their Enemies; <hi>Miltiades</hi> was Captain Gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Great therefore was the cheerfulneſs and courage of their minds, which they ſhewed in their eager running to the battel, inſomuch that when there was the ſpace of a mile betwixt both Armies, in full ſpeed, and before the flight of their arrows, they came up unto the faces of their enemies; neither was ſucceſs wanting to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62253:29"/>

            <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> being overcome, did fly into their ſhips, many of which were ſunk, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny taken.</p>
            <p>In this fight ſo great was the proweſs of every one, that it is hard to judge whoſe praiſe was the greateſt: But the glory of young <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocles</hi> did apparently ſhine forth amongſt the reſt, in whom his Imperatorious Honours to come were eaſily to be ſeen. The glory alſo of <hi>Cynegirus</hi> an <hi>Athenian</hi> Souldier, is celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the praiſes of many Writers, who after innumerable ſlaughters in the fight, when he had driven the flying enemies to their ſhips, he took hold of a ſhip laden with men with his right hand, nor did he let looſe his hold till he loſt that hand: His right hand being cut off, he faſtened upon the ſhip with his left hand; and having loſt that alſo, he took hold of the ſhip with his mouth; ſo great was his courage, that being not wearied with ſo many ſlaughters, nor (both his hands being loſt) being yet over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, at the laſt thus diſmembred as he was, and like an inraged wild beaſt, he fought even with his teeth. In that battel the <hi>Perſians</hi> loſt two hundred thouſand men, beſides thoſe who periſhed at Sea. <hi>Hippias</hi> the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Tyrant was alſo ſlain, the Author and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62253:29"/>
Promoter of the war, the Gods the revengers of his Countrey, taking puniſhment of his treachery. In the mean time <hi>Darius</hi> when he would renew the war, died in the very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of it, many children being left begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten both before and after his reign. <hi>Artobaza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> being eldeſt by the priviledge of his age did challenge the Kingdom, which the right and order of birth and nature her ſelf doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to the Nations: But <hi>Xerxes</hi> did make his plea not in relation to order, but to the happineſs of his birth; It was true indeed, he ſaid, that <hi>Artobazanes</hi> was the firſt-born, but when <hi>Darius</hi> was a private man; but he was born when <hi>Darius</hi> was a King; therefore his brothers who were born to <hi>Darius</hi> being but a private man, could not challenge to themſelves the Kingdom, but only that private Fortune which <hi>Darius</hi> had before he was a King; He alledging that he was the firſt whom his Father being a King, did beget to inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. To this it was added that <hi>Artobazanes</hi> was born when not only his father but his mother alſo were of a private Fortune: but he was born his mother being a Queen, and that he never ſaw his father but when a King; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that King <hi>Cyrus</hi> on his mothers ſide was his Grandfather, not only the heir but the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of ſo great an Empire: Therefore if the Father had left both Brothers endued with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall

right, yet he ſhould carry it, both by the right of his Mother, and his Grandfather. This ſtrife, with concording affections, they did refer to their Uncle <hi>Artaphernes,</hi> as to a Domeſtick Judge, who, the cauſe being exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, made <hi>Xerxes</hi> King; and ſo brotherly was the contention, that neither the Conqueror did inſult, nor the conquered repine; and in the very height of the conteſtation they ſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to one another, and had not only undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful but delightful feaſtings together. The Judgement it ſelf was alſo given without arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators, and without reproaches; ſo much more moderately did brothers then decide great Kingdoms amongſt themſelves, then they do now ſhare but ſmall Patrimonies. <hi>Xerxes</hi> made preparations five yeers together for the <hi>Grecians;</hi> which when <hi>Demaratus</hi> King of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who lived as a baniſhed man in the Court of <hi>Xexes,</hi> underſtood, being more friendly to his Countrey after his flight, then to the King after his benefits, leſt they ſhould be oppreſſed by an unexpected war, he did certifie the particulars to the Magiſtrates in Tables of wood, and covered the Letters with wax ſpread over them, that neither the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters might be read, which would have bin if they had nothing to cover them, nor the freſh wax betray the deceit; he then gave them to a faithful ſervant to be carried, and did command
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62253:30"/>
him to deliver them to the Magiſtrates of <hi>Sparta,</hi> which being brought unto them, it held them long in ſuſpence at <hi>Lacedemon;</hi> for they ſaw nothing written, and yet believed that they were not ſent in vain, and that the buſineſs was ſo much the greater, by how much it was the more concealed. The men not knowing what to conjecture, the ſiſter of King <hi>Leonides</hi> found out the deſign of the writer; the wax ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being taken off, the advertiſements of the war were diſcovered. <hi>Xerxes</hi> had by this time armed ſeven hundred thouſand men out of his own Dominions, &amp; had three hundred thouſand ſent to his aſſiſtance, that it is not unworthily recorded that Rivers were drank up, and that all <hi>Greece</hi> was hardly able to contain his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; he was alſo ſaid to have one hundred thouſand Ships. To this ſo great an Army a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was wanting; for if you look upon the King, you will rather extol his wealth then his conduct, of which there was ſuch abundance in his Kingdom, that when Rivers were conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with his multitudes, yet his Exchequer was ſtill full. He was always ſeen the laſt in the fight, and the firſt in the flight; humble in dangers, and when the occaſion of fear was over, one high-minded. Before the trial of the War, as if he was Lord of Nature her ſelf, by the confidence o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> his numbers he levelled moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and raiſed the valleys all to one height;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62253:31"/>
ſome Seas he covered with Bridges, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted others, for the advantage of the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors. His entrance into Greece as it was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, ſo was his departing foul and ſhamefull; for when <hi>Leonides</hi> King of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had ſecured the Straights of <hi>Thermopylae</hi> with four thouſand men, <hi>Xerxes</hi> in contempt of their powers, commanded thoſe of his ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to encounter them, whoſe kinſmen were ſlain in the <hi>Marathonian</hi> Plains, who whiles they began to revenge their friends, were the beginning of the overthrow; and theſe being followed by an unprofitable multitude, a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſlaughter was occaſioned. Three dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether there they fought, to the grief and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the <hi>Perſians;</hi> on the fourth, when it was reported to <hi>Leonides,</hi> that the tops of the Straights were poſſeſſed by twenty thouſand of the enemie, he exhorted his aſſociates to drawback, and to reſerve themſelves for ſome better ſervice for their Countrey: He would try his own fortune, he ſaid, with the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> being more indebted to his Country then to his life; the reſidue were to be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the general defence of <hi>Greece.</hi> The command of the King being heard, the reſt were diſmiſſed, and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> only remained. In the beginning of the war, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell being asked of the Oracle of <hi>Delphos,</hi> it was anſwered, that either the King of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians,</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:62253:31"/>
or the City muſt fall; therefore when King <hi>Leonides</hi> did ſet forth to the War, he ſo confirmed the reſolution of his own ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that they all knew he advanced with a mind reſolved to dye. He therefore did poſſeſs himſelf of the Straights, that he might overcome with a few with greater glory, or fall with leſs dammage to the Common-wealth. His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions therefore being diſmiſſed, he exhorted the <hi>Spartans</hi> to remember that howſoever did they fight, they muſt fall, and that they ſhould take heed leſt they might ſeem to have more couragiouſly ſtood ſtill, then to have fought; therefore he ſaid they were not to attend to be invironed by their enemies, but as ſoon as night ſhould adminiſter the opportunity to fall unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly upon them ſecure, and hugging an abuſing joy: The Conquerors, he ſaid, could never dye more honourably then in the Tents of their enemies. It was no hard task to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thoſe who were reſolved to dye: they preſently buckled on their Arms, and ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men did beat up the Quarters of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand; immediately they advanced to the Pavilion of the King to dye with him, or if they vvere over-povvered to dye eſpecially in his tent and ſight. The Alarum vvas heard o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Camp. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> after they could not find cut the King, did fly up and dovvn as Conquerors over all the Camp,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62253:32"/>
and killed or overthrew whatſoever did oppoſe them, as knowing that they did not fight in hope of victory, but to revenge their own deaths. The fight was continued from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of night unto the greateſt part of the next day; at the laſt not overcome, but being weary with overcoming, they fell upon the great heaps of the carka<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> the General of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> when he underſtood that the <hi>Ionians,</hi> againſt whom the King of the <hi>Perſians</hi> had underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this war, had ſet forth to Sea with a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to his aſſiſtance, he reſolved to ſollicite them to take part with him; and becauſe he could not have the opportunity to confer with them, he provided that Symbols ſhould be provided and left written on the ſtones, by which they were to ſail, in theſe words: What madneſs hath poſſeſſed you, O <hi>Ionians?</hi> What crime is this which you undert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Did we therefore build your Walls, that they ſhould be thoſe who muſt overthrow our own?

if you think this Counſel not ſafe, the battels being joyned, withdraw your ſelves by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, keep back your Oars, and depart from the War. Before the Battel at Sea vvas fought, <hi>Xerxes</hi> had ſent four thouſand men to plunder the Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Delphos,</hi> as if he vvould vvage vvar not vvith men onely, but alſo vvith the Immortal Gods: vvho vvere all deſtroyed vvith tempeſts and thunders that he might underſtand that the greater the anger of the Gods is, by ſo much there is no povver of men that is able to ſtand againſt them. After this he ſet on fire <hi>Theſpiae</hi> and <hi>Placeae,</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> deſtitute of inhabitants; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vvith his ſvvord he could not deſtroy the men, he did devour their houſes with fire; for the <hi>Athenians</hi> after the battel of <hi>Marathon (Themiſtocles</hi> forevvarning them that the victory over the <hi>Perſians</hi> vvould not be the end, but the cauſe of a greater vvar) did build tvvo hundred ſhips, and having asked Counſel of the Oracle on the approach of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was, that they ſhould defend themſelves with walls of wood. <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> conceiving that by the Oracle, a defence of ſhipping was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

then to their City, and that God was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this counſel. This counſel being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of, and the City being abandoned, they lodged their wives and children with their moſt precious moveables in the cloſe Iſlands; they themſelves being armed, did repair unto their ſhips. There were other Cities alſo that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the example of the <hi>Athenians.</hi> When all their Fleet was united and reſolved for a Sea-fight, and had poſſeſſed themſelves of the Straights of <hi>Salamis,</hi> that they might not be circumvented by the multitude of <hi>Xerxes</hi> Fleet, there did ariſe a diſſention amongſt the Princes, who when they would forſake the war to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their own poſſeſſions, <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by the departure of his confederate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>By this artifice, he prevailed upon the King to give a ſign and ſound to the battel: The <hi>Greeks</hi> alſo being buſied at the advance of their enemies, did prepare for the fight with their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited powers. The King in the mean time (one part of his ſhips not far from him) did ſtand upon the ſhore as ſpectator of the fight
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62253:33"/>
but <hi>Artemiſia</hi> Queen of <hi>Halicarnaſſus,</hi> who came to the aid of <hi>Xerxes</hi> in her own perſon, did fight moſt gallantly amongſt the foremoſt of the Commanders; for as you might here behold a womaniſh fear in a man, ſo in a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man you might ſee a manly courage. When the fight was doubtful, the <hi>Ionians</hi> according to the Inſtructions of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> did by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with-draw themſelves from the fight, whoſe revolt did alter the reſolution of their companions; therefore looking round about them where to fly, they were at a ſtand, and preſently after being overcome, they were all put to ſlight. In the violence of this fear, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhips were drowned, and many ſunk, and many dreading as much the anger of their King as the fury of their enemies, did ſteal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into <hi>Perſia. Xerxes</hi> being amazed at this overthrow, and uncertain what to reſolve upon, <hi>Mardonius</hi> came unto him, and did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort him that he would return into his own Kingdom, leſt the report of the unproſperous war might occaſion ſome ſedition at home; and as the cuſtome is, making the beſt of all things, he deſired that he would leave to him the command of three hundred thouſand of ſelected men, with which he would eithet to his glory overcome all <hi>Greece,</hi> or if the event fell otherwiſe, he ſhould fall before the enemies without the infamy of his Maſter. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62253:34"/>
being applauded, the Army was delivered to <hi>Mardonius,</hi> and the King himſelf intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lead back the remainder of them into his own Kingdom. But the <hi>Grecians</hi> having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice ot the Kings retreat, did take counſell to break down the bridge, which <hi>Xerxes</hi> as if he had been Conqueror of the Sea, had made at <hi>Abydos,</hi> that his paſſage being hindred, he ſhould either be deſtroyed with his Army, or through deſperation of ſucceſs, be inforced to ſue for peace. But <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> fearing leſt the enemies being ſhut up in <hi>Greece,</hi> it might raiſe their deſperation into reſolution, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them with their ſwords to open that way which was obſtructed to them; he declared that there already were too many Enemies left in <hi>Greece</hi> behind, and that their numbers ought not to be increaſed by obſtructing them in their return. When he could not prevail by his counſell, he ſent the ſame ſervant to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and did thoroughly inform him of it, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him by a ſwift flight to make ſure his paſſage.

of things to be admired for the variouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of human condition, to behold him hiding himſelf in a ſmall veſſel, whom not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſcarce all the Sea could contain: and that he ſhould be without the attendance of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whoſe armies by reaſon of their multitude were a burden grievous to the earth to bear them. Neither had his Armies by Land which he aſſigned to his Captains, a more happy expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for to their daily travell (there being no reſt to the fearfull) famine was joyned, and the want continuing many days did bring the Plague upon them; and ſo great was the noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs of the dying, that the High-ways were filled with Carkaſes; and Beaſts, and Birds of Prey did follow the Army, being tempted by the multitude of the Carkaſes. In the mean time <hi>Mardonius</hi> did ſack <hi>Olynthus</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> and did ſollicite the <hi>Athenians</hi> to the hope of peace, and to the friendſhip of the King, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing them to build again their Citie that was burned, and to make it greater then before; when he found that they would ſell their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at no price, having burned what he began to rebuild, he marched with his Army into <hi>Baeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;</hi> thither the forces of the <hi>Greeks</hi> did follow him, which conſiſted of one hundred thouſand men.</p>
            <p>The battell there being fought, the fortune of the King was not changed with the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62253:35"/>
               <hi>Mardonius</hi> being overcome, did fly as out of a wrack at Sea, with a few men; his tents full of Princely wealth were taken, and the <hi>Perſian</hi> gold being divided amongſt them, the luxury of riches did there firſt ſeize upon the <hi>Grecians.</hi> On that day in which the forces of <hi>Mardonius</hi> were overthrown, there was a fight alſo at Sea againſt the <hi>Perſians</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Mountain of <hi>Mycale</hi> in <hi>Aſia.</hi> There before the engagement, when the two Fleets ſtood oppoſite to one another, it was with confidence reported to both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that the <hi>Grecians</hi> had obtained the Victory, and that the Army of <hi>Mardonius</hi> was utterly overthrown; ſo great in this was the celerity of Fame, that when in the morning the Battell was fought in <hi>Baeotia,</hi> in a few hours through ſo many Seas, and ſo many hills and valleys, it was brought by neon into <hi>Aſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The war being ended, there was a counſell called concerning the rewards of the Cities; and by the judgement of all, the vertue and the proweſs of the <hi>Athenians</hi> was prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red above the reſt, and by the atteſtation of all the Cities, <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> being judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the moſt meritorious amongſt the Commanders, did increaſe the glory of his Country.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> therefore being enlarged
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62253:35"/>
both by the rewards of the War, and by the glory of it, did begin again to build their City; and becauſe their walls were ſtronger, and of a greater compaſs then they were before, they began to be ſuſpected to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> wiſely fore-ſeeing that if the Ruines of their Citie could give them ſo great additions, what would they now purchaſe, the City being enlarged and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led about? They therefore did ſend Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to admoniſh them, not to build again Fortifications for their Enemies, and the Receptacles of a War to come. <hi>Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> obſerving that they envyed the increaſing glory of their City, yet determining not to deal abruptly with them, did anſwer the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors that they would ſend meſſengers of their own to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> who ſhould debate with them concerning the ſame ſubject. The <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> being diſmiſſed, he exhorted the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to make haſte of the work, and not long after he did go himſelf as an Ambaſſador to <hi>Lacedemon;</hi> and ſometimes in his journey counterfeiting an indiſpoſition in his body, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time accuſing the ſloth of his fellow-Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, without whom nothing could be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he from day to day ſo long delayed the time, that he gave them at <hi>Athens</hi> the leiſure to accompliſh the work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:62253:36"/>
In the mean time it was told the <hi>Spartans</hi> that the buildings at <hi>Athens</hi> were almoſt fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, whereupon they ſent Ambaſſadors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to look upon the work. <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> hearing of it, did write unto the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates at <hi>Athens</hi> to keep the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> in ſafe cuſtody, and to detain them as a pledge, leſt any thing ſhould be determined too cruelly againſt himſelf. He then addreſſed himſelf to the Senate of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> where he declared that <hi>Athens</hi> was fenced round about, and that they were able now to ſuſtain a War, not only by their Walls, but by their Armies: And if for that they would make him ſuffer, he told them that their Ambaſſadors were detained at <hi>Athens</hi> as a pledge of his ſafety. He then did ſharply reprehend them, for that they ſought to increaſe their own power not by the ſtrength but by the weakening of their Aſſociates. Being diſmiſſed to <hi>Athens,</hi> he was received by the <hi>Citizens</hi> as if <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> had been triumphed over. After this, the <hi>Spartans</hi> (that their Army might not be corrupted with ſloth, and to revenge the War which the <hi>Perſians</hi> had made on their City and on <hi>Greece)</hi> did of their own accord make incurſions into, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

He alſo wrote to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> that whatſoever Meſſengers he ſent unto him, he ſhould put them to death, leſt the nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation betwixt them ſhould be betrayed by their tongues; but <hi>Ariſtides</hi> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> being choſen his Companion in the War, by croſſing the deſigns of his Colleague, and wiſely provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for the imminent danger, did find out the Treaſon, and not long after <hi>Pauſanias</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accuſed was condemned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xerxes</hi> when he found the plot diſcovered, made War again upon the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who elected for their Captain <hi>Cimon</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian,</hi> the Son of <hi>Miltiades</hi> a young Gentleman, the example of whoſe piety did declare his greatneſs to come; for to give him Funerall Rites, he redeemed the body of his Father out of priſon, where he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being accuſed to have purloined from

and not miſtruſting <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> being very young, he reported that the King was ſlain by his own Son <hi>Darius,</hi> that he might the ſooner enjoy the Kingdom: He perſwaded <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> by Parricide to revenge Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, and coming to the houſe of <hi>Darius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſleep they killed him, as if being guilty he had coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>After this, when <hi>Artabanus</hi> ſaw that one of the Royall Iſſue was yet remaining, and did out-live his villany, and withall fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the contention of the Nobility concerning the poſſeſſion of the Kingdom, he aſſumed <hi>Baccabaſſus</hi> to be a partner of his co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This being underſtood, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the number of the ſons of <hi>Artabanus,</hi> did command that his Army ſhould be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered on the next day, that he might take into his obſervation the number of his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and their particular induſtry and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in their exerciſe of Arms: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when amongſt the reſt <hi>Artabanus</hi> was preſent and in Arms, the King diſſembled

an equal diviſion of Land to all, that their Patrimonies being alike, no man might be made more powerful then his Neighbour; he commanded all men to keep their feaſts in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, that no mans riches or his luxury ſhould be concealed. It was permitted to young men to wear but one ſuit of Apparel during the ſpace of one whole year, and that no man ſhould be clothed better then another, nor feaſt more voluptuouſly, leſt the imitation ſhould be turned into luxury. He inſtituted that the boys at fourteen years of age ſhould not be brought up in the City, but in the field, that they might lay forth their firſt yeers not in riot, but in labour: They were permitted neither bed nor pillows to lie upon, nor to eat any warm things, nor to return into the City un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they were at mans eſtate. He ordained that the Virgins ſhould be married without porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He commanded that wives ſhould not be choſen for their money; for he ſaid that huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands would more ſeverely obſerve the Laws of Matrimony when they were obliged by no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects of Dowry.

harſh and hard, he diſſembled that <hi>Apollo</hi> of <hi>Delphos</hi> was the Author of them, and that he received them from his Inſtructions, that ſo the fear of Religion might take away all tediouſneſs from the obedience of them. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he might give eternity to his Laws, he did oblige the City by oath that they ſhould change nothing in their Laws till he returned, and counterfeited that he would go to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle at <hi>Delphos</hi> to conſult what ſhould be taken away or added to them. But he travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not to <hi>Delphos,</hi> but to <hi>Creet,</hi> and lived there in perpetuall baniſhment, and dying he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that his bones ſhould be caſt into the Sea, left being brought to <hi>Lacedemon</hi> they ſhould think themſelves diſcharged of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of their Oath, and diſſolve their Laws.

which their own and their Fathers Names were engraven, that if the fury of the battel ſhould have deveured them all, and by the ſpace of time the lineaments of their bodies ſhould lie confuſed together, yet by the obſervation of their Titles they might be diſcovered and delivered unto burial.</p>

This Expedition of <hi>Pericles</hi> was famous, but much more famous was his contempt of his private Patrimony: for the Enemies when they made havock of the reſt, did leave his Fields untouched, hoping by that means to pluck upon him either danger by the envie, or the infamy of treachery by ſuſpition; which <hi>Pericles</hi> foreſeeing, did both declare it unto the people, and to decline the aſſault of envie, did give away thoſe Fields to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and ſo where his danger was moſt ſought after, he found his greateſt ſafety.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is reported that <hi>Sicily</hi> by ſome narrow necks of Land was heretofore joyned to <hi>Italy,</hi> and that it was torn from it as from the greater body by the impetuouſneſs of the upper Sea, which is carryed that way with all the weight of its Waves. The Earth itſelf is light &amp; brittle, and ſo full of holes &amp; flaws, that it lies almoſt all open to the guſts of the winds; and there is a natural vertue and faculty in it, both for the begetting and the nouriſhing of fire; for it is reported that within, it is full of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62253:44"/>
veins of Pitch and Rozen, which is the cauſe that the wind in the bowels of the Earth wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the fire, it often and in ſeveral places doth belch forth ſometimes fire, ſometimes va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, and ſometimes ſmoak; and from hence through ſo many Ages, the fire of <hi>Aetna</hi> doth continue; and where the winds do work more ſtrong through the ſpiraments of the Caves, heaps of Sands are caſt forth. The Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory next to <hi>Italy</hi> is called <hi>Rhegium,</hi> which according to the Greek doth ſignifie <hi>abrupt:</hi> Neither is it a wonder, that the Antiquity of this place ſhould bee ſo fabulous, in which ſo many wonderful things do meet together. Firſt, there is nowhere a more violent Sea, and not only with a rapid but a cruel force, and terrible not only to the Saylors but Spectators afar off: ſo great alſo is the combate of the Waves tilting one againſt another, that you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſome of them as it were turning their backs to dive into the bottom of the Gulph, and others in foaming triumph to ride aloft as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours over them; you may hear the roar of their rage in the height, and the groans again of their fall into the Deeps. The perpetual fires of the Hill of <hi>Aetna</hi> and of the <hi>Aeolian</hi> Ilands do come ſo neer, that you would think the very fire is nouriſhed by the water; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in ſo narrow a compaſs, ſo great a fire could never continue ſo many Ages, if it were not fed
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62253:45"/>
by the nutriture of the moyſture: From hence the Fables did produce <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charibdis;</hi> from hence thoſe barkings were heard, from hence were thoſe ſtrange ſhapes of the Monſter believed, when the Saylers by, affrighted with the great noyſe and ſwallows of the whirl-Pools, did conceive thoſe Waves did bark, which the voraginouſneſs of the devouring Sea did commit and claſh together. The ſame cauſe makes the fire of the Monntain <hi>Aetna</hi> to be perpetual; for this concurſe and wraſtling of the water doth take down with it into the bottom of the deeps the enforced ſpirit, and there ſuffocates and keeps it down ſo long, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til diffuſed through the pores of the Earth, it kindles the nutriment of the fire. The neerneſs of <hi>Italy</hi> and of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the height of their Promontories is ſo equal, that it gives no leſs admiration to us, then it did terror to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, who did believe (the Promontories meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both, and uniting themſelves into one, and by and by again dividing) that Ships often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times were by them intercepted and comſumed. Neither was this invented by the Antients for the delightfulneſs of the Story, but by the fear and wonder of the Saylers; for ſuch is the condition of the place to thoſe who at diſtance do obſerve it, that you would believe it rather to be a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour then a Paſſage, to which when you are arrived, you will think that the Promontories

did cleave aſunder and were divided, which before were joyned into one. <hi>Sicily</hi> was firſt called <hi>Trinacria,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Sicania:</hi> At the beginning it was the Country of the <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clops,</hi> who being extinguiſhed, <hi>Aeolus</hi> poſſeſſed himſelf of the command of the Iland, after whom every one did ſtoop to the Government of Tyrants, there being never any Land more fruitful of them. In the number of whom when <hi>Anaxilaus</hi> with juſtice and mercy contended with the cruelty of others, his moderation gain'd him no little profit; for when dying he left many little children, and committed the Tutelage of them to <hi>Micythus</hi> a ſervant of his of approved fidelity, ſo great was the love which they did all bear unto his Memory, that they choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to obey a ſervant, then to abandon the children of the King; and the Governors of the Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Government of <hi>Sicily</hi> was heretofore attempted by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and with various ſucceſs they for a long time did fight with the Tyrants; but their General <hi>Hamilcar</hi> being loſt at laſt with his whole Army, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered were quiet for a ſeaſon: In the mean time, when the Inhabitants of <hi>Regium</hi> did la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with diſcord, and the City was divided into two parts, the old Souldiers who combined
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62253:46"/>
altogether being called by the Inhabitants of the City of <hi>Imera</hi> to their ayd, having relieved the City, did fall upon their friends whom they came to aſſiſt, and not only ſeized upon their City, but took their Wives and Children captive, their Fathers and Husbands being ſlain who did oppoſe them; a villany by no Tyrants to bee paralleld. How much more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble were it for the <hi>Rhegians</hi> in this cauſe to be conquered then to conquer? for although by the Laws of War they had ſerved the Authors of their Captivitie, or, their Countrey being loſt, they were neceſſitated to be baniſhed, yet they ſhould never have left their City nor their Wives and Children as a prey to the moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous of Tyrants, nor be ſacrificed themſelves almoſt on their own Altars, and in the preſence of the gods of their Countrey.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Catanians</hi> alſo, when they found the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> too heavily to oppreſs them, diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting their own ſtrength, deſired ayd of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who whether out of the deſire to encreaſe their Dominions, being maſters already of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> or whether for fear that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> Forces ſhould be added to the <hi>Syracuſian</hi> Navie, ſent <hi>Lamponius</hi> their Captain with a Fleet into <hi>Sicily,</hi> that under pretence of aſſiſting the <hi>Catanians,</hi> they ſhould indeavour to poſſeſs themſelves of the whole Iland. And becauſe their firſt beginnings were
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62253:46"/>
proſperous enough, their Enemies being often ſlain or routed, with a great Navie and a ſtronger Army they came again to <hi>Sicily,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of <hi>Lachetes</hi> and <hi>Chariades;</hi> But the <hi>Catanians</hi> either through fear of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> or the tediouſneſs of the War, made peace with the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> the Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>Athenians</hi> being diſmiſſed: Not long after, when this Covenant of Peace was ill obſerved by the <hi>Saracuſians,</hi> they ſent their Ambaſſadors again to <hi>Athens,</hi> who in old and ragged habiliments, their hair both of head and beard being of an unſightly length, and in a moſt ſlovenly and deformed poſture, to move compaſſion, did addreſs themſelves to the Aſſembly. Tears were added to their prayers, and their ſupplications ſo prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the people inclined to pity, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned their Captains who brought back their Auxiliaries from them. Hereupon a great Navie was prepared; <hi>Nicias,</hi> and <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> and <hi>Lamachus</hi> were made Captains, and ſo formidable an Army was ſent into <hi>Sicily,</hi> that they became even a terror to thoſe unto whoſe ayd they marched. Not long after <hi>Alcibiades</hi> being called back to anſwer to the Charge that was brought againſt him, <hi>Nicias</hi> and <hi>Lama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> did obtain two Victories by Land, and with a cloſe ſiege having begirt their Enemies, they block'd up the paſſage, which brought
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62253:47"/>
them their relief from Sea. The <hi>Syracuſians</hi> labouring under the burden of theſe neceſſities, deſired ayd of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> which was diſpatched to them but with one Captain, <hi>Gylippus</hi> by name, but ſuch a one that no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance could be comparable to his. He (the nature and courſe of the War being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and yet almoſt in a loſt condition, they had drawn together ſome few inconſiderable Forces our of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Sicily)</hi> did in the firſt place poſſeſs himſelf of ſome places of reſerve fit for the carrying on of the War: After this being twice routed; in the third encounter, he ſlew <hi>Lamachus</hi> one of their Commanders of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and having put his Enemies to flight, he relieved his beſieged friends. On this the <hi>Athenians</hi> transferr'd the War from Land to Sea, which being ſuddenly known, <hi>Gylippus</hi> ſent to <hi>Lacedemon</hi> for the Fleet to his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and for ſome recruits if need were for the ſervice of the Land. The <hi>Athenians</hi> alſo ſent <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> and <hi>Eurymedon</hi> in the place of their Captain that was killed, with ſupplies both of men and money. And by the common decree of Cities, the <hi>Pelopenneſians</hi> ſent Auxiliaries in great numbers to the <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſians;</hi> and as if that the War of <hi>Greece</hi> was tranſlated into <hi>Sicily,</hi> they did fight on both ſides in the height of reſolution with all the powers they could make. In the firſt encounter at
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62253:47"/>
Sea the <hi>Athenians</hi> were overcome, who loſt all, and all their moneys both publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate: This diſtreſs at Sea was ſeconded by a diſtreſs at Land, and being routed there alſo, it was the counſel of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> that they ſhould remove themſelves, and the War from <hi>Sicily,</hi> whiles their affairs, though ſhaken and ruinous, were not quite loſt, and that they ought not to perſevere any longer in a War unluckily begun; he alleaged that there may be more grievous and more unfortunate Wars at home, for which they ought to reſerve the Forces of their City. But <hi>Nicias,</hi> whether through ſhame of the ill ſucceſs, or through f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ar to leave deſtitute the hopes by abandoning the cauſe of his Aſſociates, or fate ſo ordaining it, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to ſtir. Therefore the fight again at Sea was renewed, and they were called back from the ſtorm of their former misfortune, to ſome hope of Victory; But by the unexperience of their Captains who aſſaulted the <hi>Syracuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> defending themſelves in the ſtreights of the Sea, they were eaſily overcome. <hi>Eurymedon</hi> their Captain fighting moſt bravely amongſt the foremoſt, was the firſt that was ſlain: The thirty ſhips which he commanded were all immediately devoured by the fire. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> and <hi>Nicias</hi> being themſelves all overcome, did convey their Army to the ſhoar, thinking that their flight would be more ſafe by Land, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62253:48"/>
               <hi>Gylippus</hi> ſeized upon one hundred and thirty of their ſhips which they had abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and purſuing the <hi>Athenians</hi> in their flight, he took many Priſoners, and put many to the ſword. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> (the Army being loſt) did with his ſword by a voluntary death redeem himſelf from Captivity: But <hi>Nicias,</hi> who would not be admoniſhed by the counſel of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> to provide for himſelf, did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his overthrow with the diſhonour of Captivity.</p>

overcome; neither could any military abilities be expected from theſe men, who were inured to bonds, and not unto Tents: They were all therefore either killed or taken; <hi>Conon</hi> their General only remained alive, who fearing the cruelty of the Citizens, with eight ſhips did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair unto <hi>Evagoras</hi> the King of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> But the General of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> the war happily being mannaged, did inſult over the fortune of his Enemies: He ſent the ſhips he took, the booty being layd forth upon the Decks, in the way of triumph to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Cities into his protection which payed tribute to <hi>Athens:</hi> the fear of the doubtful fortune of the war, detaining them till then in their fidelity; the <hi>Athenians</hi> had now nothing left them but the Citie it ſelf; when this was reported at <hi>Athens,</hi> they all abandoning their honours, did traverſe the ſtreets of the City in great fear; they deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the news of one another, and examined the authority of the Meſſengers; imprudency kept not at home the young, nor delibity the old, nor the weakneſs of their Sexe the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: So much the ſence of the calamity had poſſeſſed every Age.

friends deerer then their kindred, and with private miſchances mingled the publick loſſes; ſometimes thinking of the ruine of themſelves, ſometimes of the ruine of their Countrey, ſometimes conceiving the fortune of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to be more miſerable then the fortune of the dead; they did every one propound unto themſelves, ſiege and famine, and the proud conquering Enemy. The deſtruction and firing of the City, the general captivity, and moſt miſerable ſlavery did ſtill preſent it ſelf before their eyes, believing that the ruines of the former City were far more happy, when their ſons and fathers being alive, they were onely puniſh'd with the deſtruction of their walls and honours: They had now no Fleet to which as before they might repair, nor had they any Army by whoſe valour being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, they might build greater walls. In this manner lamenting the condition of their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, their Enemies came upon them, and at once did inviron them with an Army, and beſieged them with hunger: They knew that not many of their forces remained; and they provided that no man ſhould be brought in; with which growing miſeries the <hi>Athenians</hi> being diſcouraged, after a long famine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a great mortality, they deſired peace: And a long debate there was amongſt the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and their Aſſociates,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62253:55"/>
Whether it were expedient that it ſhould be vouchſafed them or not: when many were of judgement that the very name of the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> was to be extinguiſhed, and the City ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to be deſtroyed with fire. The <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> denying that of the two eyes of <hi>Greece,</hi> one of them was to be plucked out, did promiſe peace unto them, if they would pull down their wals towards <hi>Pyreum,</hi> and ſurrender the ſhips unto them, which were left, and withal receive thirty of their Delegats to govern their Commonwealth. The City being delivered upon theſe conditions: the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> did commit unto <hi>Lyſander</hi> the charge of it.</p>
            <p>This yeer was remarkable for the beſieging and taking of <hi>Athens,</hi> and for the death of <hi>Darius</hi> King of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and for the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the great Tyrant in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily.</hi> The State of <hi>Athens</hi> being altered, the condition of the Citizens was changed with it: Thirty Rulers were ſet over the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth who became all Tyrants; for at their entrance into their government, they did take unto themſelves a Guard of three hundred men, there ſcarce remaining ſo many Citizens by reaſon of ſo many overthrows; and as if this number were too little to ſecure the City, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Garriſon of ſeven hundred Souldiers of the <hi>Lacedemonians;</hi> after this they began the

               </hi> they ſent in full ſpeed to intercept him in the way, and having found where he was, when they could not openly put him to death, they burned him alive in the chamber where he ſlept. The Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants being delivered from this fear of their Revenger, did fill the wretched Relicks of the City with ſlaughters and rapine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty when they found it, did diſpleaſe <hi>Thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> who was one of their numbers, they did put him to death to be a terror to the reſt; whereupon they fled all out of the City, and <hi>Greece</hi> was filled with the <hi>Athenian</hi> exiles, which being all the ſecurity they had, that alſo was taken from theſe miſerable men; for by an Edict of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> the Cities were prohibited to receive the baniſhed; on this, they all conveyed themſelves to <hi>Argos</hi> and <hi>Thebes;</hi> where they not onely lived in baniſhment, but entertained the grateful hopes to be reſtored to their Countrey. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the number of the baniſhed, there was one <hi>Thraſibulus,</hi> a man of great vigour both in body and in minde, and of noble Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, who propounding to himſelf, that ſomething although with danger ought to be

undertaken for the publick ſafety, having drawn the baniſhed men together, he ſeized upon <hi>Phyle</hi> a Caſtle on the Borders of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens;</hi> neither was the favour and aſſiſtance of ſome other of the Cities wanting, who had in compaſſion the extremity of their ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: Therefore <hi>Hiſmenias</hi> the Prince of the <hi>Thebans</hi> did aſſiſt them with private, although he could not with publick helps: And <hi>Lyſias</hi> the <hi>Syracuſian</hi> Orator, being alſo a baniſh'd man, did ſend at his own charge five hundred Souldiers to aſſiſt them in this recovery of the Countrey of the common Eloquence. The encounter was ſharp, the <hi>Athenians</hi> exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all their courage for the recovery of their own Countrey, and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> fighting more ſecurely for the poſſeſſions which belong'd to others; the Tyrants at laſt were overcome, who flying into the City, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in revenge filled it with ſlaughter, they did alſo diſpoil it of Arms; and ſuſpecting all the <hi>Athenians</hi> to be guilty of treachery, they commanded them to depart out of the City, and to live in the ruines of the Suburbs which were pulled down, and in the mean time they defended themſelves with forraign Souldiers. After this, they attempted to corrupt <hi>Thraſibulus,</hi> and to promiſe him a ſhare in the Goverment, which he refuſing to accept, they deſired ayd of the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:62253:56"/>
which being ſent unto them, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the encounter, in which <hi>Critius</hi> and <hi>Hippomachus</hi> two of the moſt cruel of all the Tyrants were killed; the others being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, when their Army (which for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part conſiſted of the <hi>Athenians)</hi> did flie away, <hi>Thraſibulus</hi> with a loud voice did cry out unto them, and demanded, What made them to fly from the Conqueror, whom they ought rather to aſſiſt as the Deſendor of their common liberty? He told them that his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was compoſed of their own Citizens and not of Enemies; neither did he take up Arms to force any thing from them, but to reſtore unto them what they had loſt; he made war, he ſaid, on the thirty Tyrants, and not on the City of <hi>Athens;</hi> he did admoniſh them that they were all of one blood, of one Law, of one Religion, and of one <hi>Militia</hi> through the courſe of ſo many wars: He did implore them to have compaſſion on their baniſhed Citizens; and though they themſelves would be patient ſlaves, yet they ſhould reſtore their Countrey unto them, that they might receive their liberty. With theſe words he ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon them, that the Army being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into the City, they commanded the Tyrants to remove to <hi>Eleuſina,</hi> ten being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted who ſhould govern the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, who being nothing terrified with the

example of the former Tyrants, did tread in the ſame paths of cruelty.</p>
            <p>Whiles theſe things were thus mannaged at <hi>Athens,</hi> it was enformed at <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> that the <hi>Athenians</hi> had taken Arms again; whereupon <hi>Pauſanias</hi> their King was ſent to ſuppreſs them, who being touched with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, did reſtore the baniſh'd Citizens to their City, and commanded the ten Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants to abandon the City, and to go to their companions to <hi>Eleuſina.</hi> Peace being made, not many dayes after, the Tyrants on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, reſenting with indignation, that the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed were reſtored, and that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to baniſhment, as if the liberty of the Citizens were their ſlavery, they did make a new war upon the <hi>Athenians:</hi> But a Treaty being had, as if they were to receive again their Domination (being in the way by policy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted) they were all put to death, and made the ſacrifices of the publick peace. The people whom before they commanded to live about the ruines of the remoteſt walls, were called back into the City; and the City diſperſed into many members, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced again into one body; and that no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention ſhould ariſe concerning any thing committed in the time of war, they all did oblige themſelves by oath, that there ſhould be an oblivion of all diſſentions. In the mean
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62253:57"/>
time, the <hi>Thebans</hi> and <hi>Corinthians</hi> did ſend Ambaſſadors to <hi>Sparta,</hi> to demand their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in the ſpoils of the common war and danger, which being denyed, they did not openly declare a war againſt the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians,</hi> but with ſilence did conceive ſo great an indignation, that all might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that a war was deſigned. Much about that time, <hi>Darius</hi> the King of the <hi>Perſians</hi> dyed, leaving behind him two ſons, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi> and <hi>Cyrus.</hi> His Kingdom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and to <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Cities of which he was before Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant: This Legacy of the Father, did ſeem to <hi>Cyrus</hi> to be unequal; he therefore privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepared war againſt his brother, which when it was told to <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> he ſent for his brother, who pretending innocency, did come unto him, and was by him bound with chains of gold, and had been put to death, if his mother had not commanded him to the contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> being mindful of the aſſiſtance he ſent them in their war againſt the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> did decree to ſend help upon him, but in ſuch a way as if they did not take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice

againſt whom the war was made, that if the occaſion ſo required, they might procure unto themſelves the favour of <hi>Cyrus:</hi> and if <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had overcome, they might hope for his Patronage and his pardon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they determined nothing openly againſt him. But in the encounter, the chance of the fight having brought both brothers directly oppoſite one againſt another, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was firſt wounded by his brother, but was delivered from further danger by the ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his horſe; <hi>Cyrus</hi> being overpowred by the King's Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>guard was ſlain out-right. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> being Conqueror, enjoyed the Army and the ſpoils of his brothers war.

the acts which they performed: But a ſedition of the Souldiers (whom the former Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of the King had defrauded of their pay) diſturbed <hi>Conon;</hi> the Souldiers demanding their Arrears the more roundly, becauſe knowing their duties in the war ſhould be the harder under ſo great a Captain, <hi>Conon</hi> having a long time wearyed the King in vain with Letters, did at the laſt repair in his own perſon to him; but being denyed either to ſee him or to ſpeak with him, becauſe he would not proſtrate himſelf unto him after the cuſtom of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> he treated with him by Meſſengers, and complained that the wars of the moſt mighty King did ſuffer through indigence, and having an Army equal to the Enemies, he was overcome by the want of money, in which he did exceed them, and was found inferiour in that part of ſtrength in which he was far ſuperiour. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that the moneys for the war might be truſted into his hand, it being dangerous that it ſhould be committed unto many: The moneys being received, he returned to the Navie, and made no delay in the proſecution of the war. He acted many things valiantly, and many things happily; he plundred the Fields, he ſacked the Cities of his Enemies, and as a Tempeſt, did beat down all before him. With which proceedings, the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:62253:60"/>
being affrighted, did determine to call back <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> out of <hi>Aſia</hi> for the defence of his own Countrey. In the mean time, <hi>Lyſander</hi> being left by <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> to command the Forces at home in his abſence, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to try the fortune of the war by battel, did with great care and induſtry provide a mighty Navie, and <hi>Conon</hi> being ready to joyn in battel with the Enemy, did with great judgement aſſign unto every ſhip its ſtation, and the emulation of the Souldiers was no leſs then of the Captains; for <hi>Conon</hi> the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral did not ſo much labour for the <hi>Perſians</hi> as for his Countrey, and in their afflicted eſtate, as he was heretofore the Author of their loſs, ſo he would now be the author of their power reſtored, and receive that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey by conquering, which he had loſt by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conquered, which would be ſo much the more glorious, that he fought not with the forces of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> but of another Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and fighting at the charge and danger of the King of <hi>Perſia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The ſame was the care of the Souldiers, and of all the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, whom a deeper impreſſion did poſſeſs, not ſo much that they ſhould onely loſe the great riches they had obtained, as that the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſhould again recover it of them: But by how much the fight was the more perillous, the Victory of <hi>Conon</hi> was by ſo much more glorious. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> being overcome; The Garriſons of the Enemies were drawn away from <hi>Athens,</hi> and the people reſtored to their ancient dignity, were delivered from their bondage, and many Cities were reduced: This was the beginning to the <hi>Athenians</hi> of reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming their power, and to the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> of ending theirs, who as o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This yeer was remarkable, not onely that a ſudden Peace was made over all <hi>Greece,</hi> but that at the ſame time alſo the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was taken by the <hi>Galls.</hi> But the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> being ſecure, and having treacherouſly obſerved the abſence of the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> did lay a vigorous ſiege unto their Caſtle, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken it, they did put a Garriſon into it.

The <hi>Arcadians</hi> therefore with a prepared Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, taking the <hi>Thebans</hi> unto their ayd, were reſolved to regain what they loſt by war: In the fight, <hi>Archidamus</hi> the General of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi> was wounded, who when he beheld the deſtruction of his men, demanded by a Herald the bodies of the dead to give them burial: For amongſt the <hi>Grecians,</hi> this was a ſign of a victory acknowledged; with which confeſſion the <hi>Thebans</hi> being contented, they ſounded a retreat. Some few daies after, neither of them exerciſing hoſtility againſt each other, when as it were by a ſilent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, there was a truce, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> being engaged in another war, the <hi>Thebans</hi> under the command of <hi>Epaminondis,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained a ſudden hope to become maſters of their Citie; therefore in the beginning of the night, in a ſilent match, they did advance to <hi>Lacedemon;</hi> but they could not take the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens unprepared; for the old men and the weaker youth, the approach of their Enemies being diſcovered, did meet them in Arms at their very entrance into their Gates, and not above one hundred men, and diſabled too by their age, did enter into a fight againſt fifteen thouſand Souldiers; ſo much ſtrength and courage the ſight of their City, and of their houſhold gods did adminiſter, who infuſed into them greater ſpirits, as much by their preſence as
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62253:63"/>
by the remembrance of them; for when they ſaw for whom, and amongſt whom they ſtood, they were all of a reſolution either to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come or die; a few old men undertook the whole brunt of the battel, unto whom (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that day appeared) not all the youth and Army of their Enemies could be equal: In this fight, two Captains of the Enemies were ſlain. In the mean time, when the coming of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was reported, the <hi>Thebans</hi> retreated, and ſome few hours after the battail again began; for the youth of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> being inflamed with the courage and glory of their old men, could not be kept back, but would throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon their Enemies; howſoever the <hi>Thebans</hi> had the Victory, and <hi>Epaminondas</hi> performing the duty not onely of a General, but of a reſolute and couragious Souldier, was grievouſly wounded, which being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, the <hi>Thebans</hi> through the exceſs of grief were poſſeſſed with fear; and the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi> through the exceſs of joy with a kind of amazement, and as it were with a conſent on both ſides, they departed from the bat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is hard to ſay, whether he was a better man or a better Captain; for he ſought the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment not for himſelf, but for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and was ſo careleſs of money, that he had not wherewith to defray the charges of his own Funeral; moreover, he was no more covetous of glory then of money; for the Commands were all thrown upon him, refuſing and drawing back from them; and he ſo deported himſelf in his places of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that hee ſeemed not to receive, but to give an ornament to the dignity it ſelf; So great was his knowledge in Letters and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, that it may be wonderful how that excellent experience in the affairs of war ſhould arrive unto a man born amongſt
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62253:64"/>
the Arts; neither did the manner of his death differ from the inſtitutions of his life; for being brought half dead into his Tent, he collecting his voyce and ſpirits, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded onely if his Enemy had taken his Buckler from him when he fell, which when hee underſtood was preſerved, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee it, and it being brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, he kiſſed it as the companion of his labours and his glory. Hee again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, Who had obtained the Victory? when it was anſwered, The <hi>Thebans;</hi> he replyed, It was well; and ſo gratulating his Countrey, he did give up his laſt breath. In his grave the vertues not onely of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> but of the <hi>Athenians</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was buried; for he being taken away, whom they were accuſtomed to emulate, they did degenerate into ſloth, and laid forth the publick Revenues, not as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, on Fleets and Armies, but on feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val dayes, and on the ſetting forth of Playes, and viſiting the Scene oftner then the Camp; they onely celebrated the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, famous with Poets and Actors, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Poets and their Orators more then their Captans; by which means it came to paſs that in theſe leiſures of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> the name of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> but

And thus all of them being ſlain,

               <hi>Megabazus</hi> being ignorant of the event, and ſeeing they returned not, did command <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baris</hi> thither with a part of his Army onely, as into a poor and eaſie war, ſcorning to go himſelf leaſt he ſhould be diſhonoured to make war in his own perſon with ſo contemptible a Nation. But <hi>Bubaris</hi> before the war, being inflamed with the love of the daughter of <hi>Amyntas,</hi> inſtead of making wars, did make a marriage; and all hoſtility being layd aſide, he entred into the obligations of affinity. After the departure of <hi>Bubaris</hi> from <hi>Macedonia, Amyntas</hi> the King deceaſed, to whoſe ſon and Succeſſor <hi>Alexander,</hi> the conſanguinity with <hi>Bubaris</hi> not onely procured peace in the time of <hi>Darius,</hi> but confirmed <hi>Xerxes</hi> to him, inſomuch that he endued him with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the whole Countrey, between the Hills of <hi>Olympus</hi> and <hi>Haemus,</hi> when like a Tempeſt he invaded <hi>Greece.</hi> But <hi>Amyntas</hi> increaſed his Kingdom as well by his own va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour as by the liberality of the <hi>Perſians.</hi> By order of ſucceſſion, the Kingdom of <hi>Macedonia</hi> came afterwards to <hi>Amyntas</hi> the ſon of his brother <hi>Menelaus;</hi> he alſo was famous for his induſtry, and accompliſhed with all royal ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: He begat three ſons of his firſt wife, <hi>Eurydice; Alexander, Perdicas,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the Father of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and a daughter called <hi>Euryone;</hi> and on his ſecond
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62253:68"/>
wife <hi>Cygaea, Archelaus, Aridaeus,</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelaus:</hi> He made great war, firſt with the <hi>Olynthians,</hi> and afterwards with the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> and had loſt his life by the treaſon of his wife <hi>Eurydice</hi> who contracting a marriage with her ſon in-law, had undertaken to kill her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and to deliver the Kingdom unto her adulteror, which had taken effect if her daughter had not betrayed the looſneſs of the Mother, and the counſels of her wickedneſs. The old man deliverd from ſo many dangers, deceaſed, the Kingdom being left to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the eldeſt of his Sons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> in the beginning of his reign bought his peace of the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> a ſum of moneys being agreed upon, and his Brother <hi>Philip</hi> being given them as a pledge; in the proceſs of time he made peace with the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans,</hi> having given the ſame pledge unto them, which conduced much to the growing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of <hi>Philip</hi> by the advantage of his edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; for being three yeers a pledge at <hi>Thebes,</hi> he received the firſt rudiments of his youth in a City of ancient ſeverity, and in the houſe of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> who was as great a Philoſopher as a General. Not long after <hi>Alexander</hi> being aſſaulted by the treaſon of his Mother <hi>Euridice,</hi> was ſlain; his Father had pardoned her before, being guilty of contriving his death, in relation to the children
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62253:69"/>
he had by her, not thinking ſhe would prove ſo pernicious unto them. His brother <hi>Perdicas</hi> did alſo loſe his life, being killed by the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable plotting of his mother: A moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thing it was that the children ſhould be deprived of their lives by their mother for her luſt, the conſideration of whom had before protected her from the puniſhment due unto her for her wickedneſs. This mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Perdicas</hi> ſeemed the more grievous, becauſe the little ſon whom he left could not prevail upon her cruelty to take compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him. <hi>Philip</hi> a long time did deport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not as a King, but as a Guardian to the Infant. But when great wars did threaten the Kingdom, and that the help would be too late in the expectation of the Infant, he took upon him the Government of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, being compell'd unto it by the people. In the beginning of his reign, the hopes were great that were conceived of him both for his wit, which promiſed him to prove a great man, and for the ancient fates of <hi>Macedon,</hi> which ſang that one of the ſons of <hi>Amyntas</hi> being King, the ſtate of that Kingdom ſhould be moſt flouriſhing; And this was the man who was preſerved from the wickedneſs of his mother, to make good the hopes of the people and to juſtifie the Oracle. When on one ſide, the moſt unworthy murder of his
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62253:69"/>
brothers, on the other ſide the multitude of his Enemies, the fear of new treacheries, the want occaſioned by the continual wars, and the Kingdom exhauſted of Souldiers, did much diſtract him and the wars of many Nations from ſeveral places did at one time conſpire to oppreſs <hi>Macedonia,</hi> becauſe he could not anſwer them all at once, he thought it expedient to diſpence with ſome for a while; he therefore upon an agreement did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound for a peace with ſome; others he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came with eaſie aſſaults, by the conqueſt of whom he confirmed the doubtful minds of his Souldiers, and took from himſelf the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his Enemies. His firſt war was with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who being overcome by an Ambu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The event of theſe things anſwering his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62253:70"/>
with ſucceſs, he took to wife <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias</hi> the daughter of <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> King of the <hi>Moloſsians;</hi> her brothers ſon <hi>Arymbas,</hi> who was her overſeer, and was then King of the <hi>Moloſsians</hi> did make the marriage, having him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf marryed <hi>Troas</hi> the ſiſter of <hi>Olympias,</hi> which was the cauſe of his deſtruction, and the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold calamities which afterwards fell upon him; for whiles he hoped to make ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to his Kingdom by the affinity of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> being depriv'd by him of his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he grew old in baniſhment. Theſe things being thus paſſed, <hi>Philip</hi> being now not contented onely to remove wars, did now provoke and challenge others Nations of his own accord. As he was beſieging <hi>Methona,</hi> an arrow from the walls as he was paſſing by, did put out his right eye; for all which wound he became not the flower in the proſecution of the war, nor was he made more angry by it againſt his Enemies, who ſome days after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards having ſupplicated for peace, he did grant it to them, and was not onely mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but alſo merciful againſt the conquered.</p>

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62253:71"/>
Conquered to undergo the yoak of ſervitude. The <hi>Thebans</hi> were the cauſe and the beginning of this calamity, who when they were maſters of all, and carrying their good fortune with too impotent a mind, did publickly before a general Councel at <hi>Greece</hi> accuſe the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Phocenſians,</hi> as if before they had endured but ſmall puniſhments for the ſlaughters and the rapines which they committed: it was layd to the charge of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> that they had ſeized upon the Tower of <hi>Thebes</hi> in the time of truce, and to the <hi>Phocenſians</hi> that they had plundered <hi>Baeotia,</hi> as if after Arms and War there were a place left for the Laws: When the judgement was carryed according to the pleaſure of the Conquerors, they were condemned in a greater ſum of money then they were able to pay. Therefore the <hi>Phocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> when they were deprived of their wives and children, and poſſeſſions, in a deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>Philomelus</hi> being their Captain, they ſeized upon the Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Delphos,</hi> and being angry with men, they would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of God; being made rich with the gold and ſilver which there they found, they made war upon the <hi>Thebans</hi> with a mercenary Army; and though all abhorred this act of the <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſians,</hi> by reaſon of the ſacriledge, yet the <hi>Thebans</hi> contracted more envie by it, by whom they were enforced to this neceſſity, and both
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62253:71"/>
the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and <hi>Athenians</hi> ſent ayd unto them. In the firſt encounter <hi>Philomelus</hi> became maſter of the Camp and Tents of the <hi>Thebans;</hi> but in the ſecond battel he fell firſt of all, fighting amongſt the thickeſt of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and with the forfeit of his impious blood did anſwer for the crime of his ſacriledge. <hi>Onomerchus</hi> was made Captain in his place, againſt whom the <hi>Thebans</hi> and <hi>Theſſalians</hi> choſe not a Captain of their own Citizens for fear of his domineering if he ſhould prove Conqueror, but <hi>Philip</hi> King of the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to be their General; and of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord they did fall into that power and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in another Commander which they feared in their own. <hi>Philip</hi> therefore, as if he was rather a revenger of the Sacriledge, then of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> commanded all his ſouldiers to weare wreaths of bayes on their brows; and thus as if god was his conduct, he advanced to the battel.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Phocenſians</hi> ſeeing the Enſigns of the God, being affrighted with the conſciouſneſs of their offence, throwing down their Arms, did fly away, and with great ſlaughter and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed did expiate the violation of Religion. It is incredible, what glory this atchievement brought to <hi>Philip</hi> amongſt all Nations; Him they extoll'd as the vindicator of ſacriledge, the Revenger of Religion, which the world with all
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62253:72"/>
its power was obliged to keep undefiled; the onely man who was thought worthy to exact a Piacle for the ſin committed to plunder God. He next unto the gods was eſteemed, by whom the majeſty of the gods was vindicated: But the <hi>Athenians,</hi> the event of the war being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, did ſeize upon the ſtreits at <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mophyle</hi> to keep <hi>Philip</hi> from <hi>Greece,</hi> as they did heretofore the <hi>Perſians,</hi> but not with the ſame courage nor the ſame cauſe; for then they fought for the liberty of <hi>Greece,</hi> now for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſacriledge; then to vindicate the Temples from the violent prophanation of the Enemies, now to defend the violent Prophaners againſt the Vindicators of them, and they deported themſelves as defenders of that wickedneſs in which it was a ſhame to be Connivers, being altogether unmindful that in the uncertainty of their affaires they had heretofore repaired to that god as to the Author of their Counſels: and he being their conduct, they had undertook ſo many wars, and formerly erected ſo many Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and obtained ſo great a Soveraignty both by Sea and Land, and mannaged nothing either publick or private without the majeſty of his divinity. Who would imagine that wits adorned with all variety of learning, and brought up under ſuch excellent Laws and Inſtitutions, ſhould commit ſo horrible an impiety, that they had nothing left, of which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62253:72"/>
after it they might juſtly accuſe the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans?</hi> But <hi>Philip</hi> obſerved no more faith him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf towards his Aſſociates; for fearing leaſt he ſhould be overcome himſelf of his Enemies in the impiety of ſacriledge, in a hoſtile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he ſeized upon thoſe Cities, of which but immediately before he was Protector; thoſe Cities which ſought under his conduct, thoſe Cities which gratulated both him and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the victory they had obtained, he in a ſcornful manner ſold not long afterward both the wives and children of them all; he ſpared not the Temples, nor the conſecrated houſes, nor the publick, nor the private gods whom not long before he adored: Inſomuch that he ſeemed not to be the Revenger of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, but to grant a liberty for ſacriledges; After this, as if he had done admirably well, he marched into <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> where having man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged the war with the like perfidiouſneſs and the neighbouring Kings being taken and ſlain by treachery, he joyned the whole Country of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> to the Kingdom of the <hi>Macedons:</hi> After this to take away the infamy of envie, with which at that preſent he laboured above other men, he ſent ſeveral perſons through ſeveral Kingdoms and moſt flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cities, to plant a belief that King <hi>Philip</hi> had laid up a great bank of money for the erecting of new walls through the Cities,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62253:73"/>
and for the building of Fanes and Temples, and made Proclamations by Heralds, to the end that work-men might come in to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the building, who when they came to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> being fruſtrated by long delayes, they departed home in ſilence, fearing the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the King. After this he invaded the <hi>Olynthians,</hi> who after his ſlaughter of one of his brothers, did in compaſſion entertain the two other, whom <hi>Philip</hi> reſolved to put to death, pretending they deſired to partake with him in the Kingdom, being the children of his mother-in-law; for this onely cauſe he utterly deſtroyed this ancient and noble City, and his brothers being delivered to their deſtined deſtruction, he enjoyed a great booty together with the deſires of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide. After this, as if all things were lawful which he had a mind to do, he ſeized upon the golden Mines in <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> and on the ſilver Mines in <hi>Thrace,</hi> and that he might leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inviolated, he at laſt reſolved to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Pyracies on the Seas: Theſe things in this manner mannaged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it came to paſs that the two brothers of the King of <hi>Thrace</hi> did make choyce of him as an Arbitrator of their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, not out of any contemplation of his juſtice, but both of them fearing leaſt by his aſſiſtance he ſhould add more ſtrength and quite over-ballance the cauſe and power of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62253:73"/>
the other. But <hi>Philip,</hi> (according to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatilneſs of his wit) did come with a gallant Army, the two brothers unſuſpecting it, not as an Arbitrator but a General, and deprived them both of the Kingdom by force, not like a Judge, but as a Theif and a plunderer. While thoſe thing were in agitation, the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſent Ambaſſadors to him to deſire a peace, who having had audience, he ſent himſelf Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to <hi>Athens</hi> with the condition of it, and a peace was concluded for the advantage of them both. There came alſo Ambaſſadors from the other Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> not ſo much for the love of peace, as for the ſears of war; for the fire of their rage being not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed but by blood, the <hi>Thebans</hi> and <hi>Boetians</hi> did deſire that he would vouchſafe to profeſs himſelf to be the General of <hi>Greece</hi> againſt the <hi>Phocenſians,</hi> being poſſeſſed with ſo great a hatred againſt the <hi>Phocenſians,</hi> that forgetful of their own ruine, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired rather to periſh themſelves then not to deſtroy them, and to endure the known cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Philip</hi> then to pardon their Enemies. The Ambaſſadors of the <hi>Phocenſians</hi> on the other ſide, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Athenians</hi> being joyned with them, did crave that the war might not proceed, this being the third time that they bought with moneys a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:62253:74"/>
A vile thing it was, and ſhameful to behold, that <hi>Greece</hi> being at that time the miſtreſs of the world, both in ſtrength and dignity, and alwaies the Conquereſs of Kings and Nations, and at that time the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of ſo many Cities, ſhould humble her ſelf at the doors of a ſtranger, and either craving or deprecating war, ſhould put all her hope in the aſſiſtance of another. The Revengers of the world were brought ſo low by their own diſcords and by civil wars, that of their own accord they flattered a ſordid part not long before of their own clientry; and this eſpecially was done by the <hi>Thebans</hi> and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> before emulous which of them both ſhould enjoy the abſolute command of <hi>Greece,</hi> as <hi>Greece</hi> at this preſent would have the command of them. <hi>Philip</hi> in theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions, for the oſtentation of his glory, did ride as it were in triumph over the tops of ſo great Cities, and did deliberate with himſelf which part was moſt worthy of him. Having given audience in private to the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors on both ſides, to the one ſide he did promiſe the forbearance of the war, having obliged them by an Oath not to divulge his anſwer; unto the others he gave aſſurance, that he ſuddenly and powerfully would aſſiſt them; he commanded both either to prepare for war or to fear it; and thus with a double
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62253:74"/>
anſwer both ſides being ſecure, he ſeized upon the ſtraights of <hi>Thermophylae.</hi> Then the <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſians</hi> finding themſelves circumvented by the treachery of <hi>Philip</hi> had their recourſe to Arms, but they had not the leiſure to prepare an Army, nor to draw unto them any Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: and <hi>Philip</hi> threatned utterly to deſtroy them, if they would not ſurrender themſelves unto him. But there was no more truſt in his compoſition, then there was in his promiſe that the war ſhould be forborn; They were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore everywhere put to ſlaughter, and violated; the Children were pluck'd from their Parents, the Wives from their Husbands, and the Images of the gods were not ſafe, nor left in their own Temples. This was all the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble comfort that they enjoyed, that when <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> had defrauded his Aſſociates in the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the booty, and ingroſſed it all to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, they could finde nothing of their own goods amongſt their Enemies. Being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into his Kingdom, he drove Cities and People as Shepherds do their Flocks, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into their Summer, and ſometimes into their Winter Paſtures: He tranſlated every place according to his own pleaſure, as he would have them peopled or left deſolate; lamentable was the face of all things, and like unto an utter ruine. There was no fear of any invaſion of the Enemy, no running about of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62253:75"/>
Souldiers in the ſtreets, no tumult of Arms, no plundering of goods, nor forcing men into Captivity, but a ſilent grief and ſadneſs did poſſeſs them, and a fear that even the very tears in their eyes ſhould be cenſur'd for delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency: Their griefs did increaſe in their counterfeiting, and in their concealing of them, ſinking ſo much the deeper, by how much they were the leſs ſeen to expreſs them: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they revolved in their mindes the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of their Ance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>rs, ſometimes their old houſhold gods, ſometimes their own houſes in which they begot their children, and in which they were begot themſelves: Sometimes they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented their own misfortune that they lived to ſee that day, ſometimes the misfortune of their children that they were not born after it. <hi>Philip</hi> in the mean time did remove ſome of them into the frontier Garriſons, and ſet them before the faces of their Enemies; others he did diſpoſe of into the fartheſt bounds of his Kingdom: Some whom he had taken Priſoners in the war he reſerved at home to ſupply his Cities, and ſo out of many Countreys and Nations he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted one Kingdom and People. The affairs of <hi>Macedonia</hi> being ſet in order, he became maſter of the <hi>Dardanians,</hi> and other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring places taken by deceit; neither did he abſtain from thoſe who were moſt neer unto him; for he determined to drive <hi>Arym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>

out of his Kingdom who was King of <hi>Epirus,</hi> and in the neereſt conſanguinity obliged to his wife <hi>Olympias;</hi> and for this purpoſe he ſent for <hi>Alexander</hi> the brother of his wife <hi>Olympias,</hi> a boy of a ſweet and lovely counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to come in his ſiſters name to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and with all his art having ſollicited him into the hope of his Fathers Kingdom, diſſembling his luſt, he enforced him to grant him the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful uſe of his body, thinking that he would be more obſequious to him either through this familiarity of unlawful love, or through the benefit of the Kingdom; therefore when he arrived to the age of twenty yeers, he took the Kingdom from <hi>Arymbas</hi> and gave it unto him, being unrighteous in both, for that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved not the rights of conſanguinity in him f om whom he took the Kingdom, and that he made him his proſtitute before he made him a King unto whom he gave it.</p>

            <p>He marched alſo into <hi>Scythia</hi> to ſee what plunder he could get there, and like a Merchant he maintained one war by the profits of another.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62253:77"/>
to enform <hi>Matthaeas,</hi> that when he beſieged <hi>Byzantium,</hi> he had vowed a Statue to <hi>Hercules,</hi> and that he now came to erect it at the mouth of the River of <hi>Iſter;</hi> he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſired that coming as a friend to the <hi>Scythians,</hi> he might be allowed a peaceable entrance to perform his religion to his god: <hi>Matthaeas</hi> made anſwer, that if he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his vowes, he ſhould ſend the Effigies unto him, and promiſed that it ſhould not onely be erected accordingly as he deſired, but that it ſhould ſtand inviolated. He ſent him word that he could not give way that his Army ſhould enter into his Dominions, and if he ſhould erect any Statue, the <hi>Scythians</hi> being unwilling, he would pull it down again, when he was departed, and convert the braſs of the Statue into heads for arrows. With theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages the minds of both being much exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the battel was begun.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scythians</hi> excell'd in vertue and valor; howſoever they were overcome by the policy of <hi>Philip.</hi> There were taken twenty thouſand women and children, and a vaſt booty of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, but of gold and ſilver nothing at all: And although it were before reported, it was at this time firſt of all believed how poor the <hi>Scythians</hi> were. Twenty thouſand of their Mares of a brave race were ſent into <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> for breed. But the <hi>Triballians</hi> did meet
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62253:78"/>
with <hi>Philip</hi> on his return from <hi>Scythia;</hi> they denied to give him paſſage, unleſs they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived part of the prey; From hence began the quarrel, and by and by the fight, in which <hi>Philip</hi> was ſo ſorely wounded in his thigh, that through his body his horſe was killed; when all conceived him to be ſlain, the booty was all loſt; therefore the devoted ſpoyls of the <hi>Sythians</hi> were to be lamented rather than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by the <hi>Macedons;</hi> as ſoon as he began to recover of his wound, he brought upon the <hi>Athenians</hi> his long diſſembled war, to whoſe cauſe the <hi>Thebans</hi> did joyn themſelves, fearing leaſt the <hi>Athenians</hi> being overcome, the flames of the neighbouring war ſhould whirle upon them.</p>
            <p>A league being therefore made betwixt the two Cities that not long before were at the greateſt enmity, they wearved <hi>Greece</hi> with their Ambaſſadors, alleadging that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy was to be repelled by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtrength; for they ſaid that <hi>Philip</hi> would not leave off, if the affairs at firſt ſucceeded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his minde, until he had ſubdued all <hi>Greece</hi> unto him. Some Cities being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by the <hi>Athenians</hi> did unite themſelves unto them, but the fear of the war did draw many unto <hi>Philip:</hi> the battel being begun when the <hi>Athenians</hi> did much exceed in the number of the Souldiers, they were overcome by the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62253:78"/>
valor of the <hi>Macedons</hi> inured to daily wars; howſoever they fell not unmindful of their antient glory; for with honourable wounds they dying, did all cover that place of the field with their bodies which their Captains did aſſign them to fight in.</p>
            <p>This day did ſet a period to all <hi>Greece,</hi> in the reſpect of their antient liberty, and the glory of the Soveraignty of their command. The joy of this Victory was craftily diſſembled by <hi>Philip,</hi> for he did not obſerve it as a day conſecrated to Triumphs; he was not ſeen to laugh at the banquet; he neither crowned his head, nor anointed his body, and as much as in him was, he ſo overcame that no man could perceive him to be a Conqueror: He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that he ſhould not be called the King, but the Captain of <hi>Greece;</hi> and he ſo tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf betwixt a ſilent joy, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick grief of his Enemies, that his own Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers could not obſerve him to rejoyce, nor his Enemies to inſult. And though the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> were alwaies moſt pernicious to him, yet he ſent home their priſoners without ranſome, and reſtored the carkaſſes of the dead to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, and of his own accord gave order that they ſhould be carryed to the Sepulchers of their Fathers: Moreover, he ſent his Son <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> and his friend <hi>Antipater</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> to eſtabliſh a firm friendſhip and a peace betwixt
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62253:79"/>
them. But he was not ſo indulgent to the <hi>Thebans;</hi> for he not onely ſold their Captives but alſo the carkaſſes of their ſlain. Some of the Rulers of that City he beheaded, ſome he forced into baniſhment, and ſeized on all their goods, and reſtored thoſe into their Country who had been baniſhed from it, out of which number he appointed three hundred to be the Judges and Rulers of the City, by whom when ſome of the moſt powerful of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens were accuſed, that unjuſtly they had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them into baniſhment, they were of that conſtancy, they all in general confeſſed that they were all the Authors of it, and with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence affirmed that it was better with the Commonwealth by far when they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned perſons, then it could be now when they were reſtored.</p>
            <p>A wonderful confidence it was; they paſſed a ſentence as well as then they could, on the Judges of their lifes and deaths, and did contemn that abſolution which their Enemies could give them, and becauſe they could not revenge by deeds, they aſſumed to themſelves a liberty by words.</p>
            <p>The affairs being thus compoſed in <hi>Greece, Philip</hi> commanded that Ambaſſadors out of all the Cities ſhould be called to <hi>Corinth,</hi> to conſider on the preſent occaſions, and to provide for the future: He there appointed to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62253:79"/>
all <hi>Greece</hi> a condition of Peace, according to the merits of every City, and choſe to himſelf a Counſel, and as it were a Parliament out of all. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> onely did deſpiſe both the Law and the Law-giver, affirming that it was a ſlavery and not a peace which was impoſed upon them by the Conqueror, and did not proceed from the Cities. After this the Auxiliaries of every City were liſted, by whom the King was to be aſſiſted againſt any invaſion, or he being their General, was to make war himſelf with them, and to lead them forth againſt any Nation; for it was not doubtful that the Empire of the <hi>Perſians</hi> was the deſign of theſe great preparations. The number of his Auxiliaries of foot were two hundred thouſand, and fifteen thouſand horſe: Beſides theſe, there was the Army of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi> and an Army of the barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons who were contiguous to them. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Spring, he ſent three of his cheif Commanders into that part of <hi>Aſia</hi> which was under the power of the <hi>Perſians, Parmenio, Amyntas,</hi> and <hi>Attalus,</hi> whoſe ſiſter he had lately marryed; <hi>Olympias</hi> the Mother of <hi>Alexander</hi> being repudiated upon the ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of incontinence. In the mean time until the Auxiliaries of <hi>Greece</hi> might be drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one body, he did celebrate the Nuptials of his daughter <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and of <hi>Alexander</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:62253:80"/>
whom he had made King of <hi>Epirus.</hi> The day was remarkable for the magnificence of the two Kings, the one marrying, the other giving his daughter in marriage: Neither was there wanting the delightfulneſs of Enterludes, to the beholding whereof when <hi>Philip</hi> paſſed without a guard between the two <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> his Son-in-law, and his own Son, <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanias</hi> one of the Nobility, being ſuſpected by no man, did kill King <hi>Philip</hi> as he was paſſing through the crowd, and made the day deſtined to mirth and marriage black with the lamentation of a Funeral: This <hi>Pauſanias</hi> about the fourteenth yeer of his age, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to be a proſtitute to <hi>Attalus,</hi> to which indignity this ignominy was added, that <hi>Attalus</hi> having afterwards brought him into the Banquet, and made him drunk with wine, did not onely expoſe him to his own luſt, but to the luſt of all his gueſts, and rendred him a common laughing ſtock amongſt them all: Which <hi>Pauſanias</hi> with great indignation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, did oftentimes complain of it to <hi>Philip;</hi> And finding that he was both deluded and delayed in his juſt complaints, and that his Adverſarie moreover was honoured with a new addition of power and greatneſs, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted his anger againſt <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf, and that revenge which he could not have on his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, he took on his unrighteous Judge,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62253:80"/>
It is alſo believed that he was encouraged to it by <hi>Olympias</hi> the Mother of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and that <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf was not ignorant of the murther of his Father; for <hi>Olympias</hi> was no leſs troubled at her divorce, and that <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi> was perferr'd above her, then <hi>Pauſanias</hi> was at the violation of his honour. It was conceived alſo that <hi>Alexander</hi> ſuſpected that his brother begot of his Step-mother, did aſpire unto the Kingdom; and ſo far the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie did advance it ſelf, that at a former Banquet he firſt quarrelled with <hi>Attalus,</hi> and afterwards with his Father, inſomuch that <hi>Philips</hi> did follow him from the Table with a drawn Sword, and was hardly deteined by the intreaties of his friends from the ſlaughter of his ſon. Wherefore <hi>Alexander</hi> did firſt convey himſelf with his Mother to his Uncle in <hi>Epirus,</hi> and from thence to the Kings of the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> and was hardly afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to his Father, and with much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty was perſwaded by his kinſmen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto him. <hi>Olympias</hi> alſo did ſollicite her brother <hi>Alexander</hi> the King of <hi>Epirus</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the war, and had overcome him to it, if the Father had not prevented his Son-in-law by the collocation of his daughter to him: With theſe provocations of jealouſie and anger, it is believed that both of them did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite <hi>Pauſanias</hi> to the commiſſion of ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperare
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62253:81"/>
an Act. Sure it is, that <hi>Olympias</hi> had horſes ready for <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> if it had been his fortune to have eſcaped; and ſhe her ſelf, the death of the King being underſtood, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of the duty, ſhe came in great haſte that night to attend his Hearſe, ſhe did impoſe on the very ſame night a Crown of Gold on the head of <hi>Pauſanias</hi> then hanging on the Croſs, which none but ſhe would have been ſo bold to have adventured, the Son of <hi>Philip</hi> being alive. Some few daies after, ſhe cauſed his body to be taken off from the Croſs and burn'd, and in the ſame place ſhe did erect him a Monument, and ſtruck ſuch a ſuperſtition into the people, that ſhe provided that for the honor of his memory, here ſhould be yeerly made a parentation to him: After this, ſhe cauſed <hi>Cleopatra</hi> (for whoſe ſake ſhe was divorced from <hi>Philip,</hi> having firſt in her own lap killed her daughter) to end her life by hanging, and ſatisfied her revenge by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding her in that lamentable poſture ſwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Tree. Laſt of all, ſhe conſecrated that ſword with which the King was ſlain to <hi>Apollo,</hi> under the name of <hi>Myrtalis;</hi> for ſo <hi>Olympias</hi> was called when ſhe was a little one. All which was done ſo opnely, that it may be ſeared leaſt the fact committed by her were not approved by others: <hi>Philip</hi> deceaſed about the ſeven and fourtieth yeer of his age,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62253:81"/>
after he had reigned five and twenty yeers. He begat on <hi>Lariſſaea</hi> the Dancereſs <hi>Aridaeus,</hi> who reigned after <hi>Alexander:</hi> He had alſo many other Sons from divers other marriages, it being the cuſtom of Kings to take them into Marriage as many as they pleaſed; but they all dyed, ſome by natural deaths, and ſome by the ſword. He was a King more ſtudious of the preparations of Arms then Feaſts; his greateſt riches were the utenſils of war, and yet he was more cunning to get riches then to perſerve them, which made them alwaies poor, though he was alwaies plundering: Mercy and Treachery were in him equally beloved: No way whatſoever to overcome his Enemies did appear ſordid to him; In his diſcourſe he was both pleaſing and deceitful, and one who would alwaies promiſe more then he would perform; he was maſter of his Arts both in jeaſt and in earneſt: He obſerved his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips not by faithfulneſs but by profit: To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble love in hatred, to plant ſedition amongſt friends, and to inſinuate himſelf both with friends and foes was his daily Cuſtome: Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent he was in Eloquence and in the acuteneſs of a fine flouriſh in his words, full of delicate compoſures, that neither facility was wanting to the ornament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor the ornament of invention to the facility. <hi>Alexander</hi> did ſucceed him greater then his Father both in vertues
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62253:82"/>
and in vices. Their way was different in the Conqueſts they obtained: The Son man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged his wars by apparent valour, the Father by deceits: The Father joyned his Enemies being ſurprized; the Son being openly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; The Father more ſubtle in Counſel; the Son more magnificent in minde; The Father would commonly diſſemble his paſſions, and overcome them; The Son inflam'd with rage knew neither how to delay, not moderate his revenge; Both of them were too greedy of wine, but their vices in the exceſs were different. It was the cuſtome of the Father from the Banket to advance againſt the Enemy, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter him, and unadviſedly to expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto all dangers; <hi>Alexander</hi> was more furious againſt his own friends then againſt his Enemies; wherefore the battels have often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſent back <hi>Philip</hi> wounded, and his Son hath often come from the Banquet the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of his Friends; This would not reign over his friends, the other would uſurp and grow upon them; Tbe Father did chooſe rather to be beloved, the Son to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; The love to Learning was equal to them both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Father was more full of Policy, the Son of Fidelity; The Father more moderate in his ſpeech, the Son in his actions, for he had alwayes a more ready and a more honeſt minde to be merciful to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62253:82"/>
thoſe whom he overcame; The Father was addicted to thrift, but the Son to exceſs: By theſe Arts the Father layd the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Conqueſt of the World, and the Son accompliſhed the glory of the work.</p>

Intereſt, if he alive did behold the Enſign of his Majeſty in his Son. But <hi>Darius</hi> after theſe unaccuſtom'd examples of indulgence, took counſel to kill his Father: He had been wicked enough, if he onely had conceived the parricide in his minde; but ſo much the more wicked, that into the ſociety of the villany he took his fifty brothers to be partakers of it; Prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous it was, that in ſo great a number, the parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide could not onely be contracted but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and that amongſt fifty of his children there was not one found whom neither the Majeſty of the King, nor the reverence of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient man, nor the indulgence of a Father, could recal from ſo horrible an act. What was the name of a Father ſo vile amongſt ſo great a number of his Sons, that he who ſhould be ſafe even againſt his Enemies by their defence, being circumvented by their Treaſon, ſhould now be ſafer amongſt his Enemies then amongſt his own children? The cauſe of the Parricide was far more wicked then the Parricide it ſelf; for <hi>Cyrus</hi> being ſlain in the brothers war, as menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on above is made, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> the King took his Concubine <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> into marriage; <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> did demand that his Father ſhould give her unto him, as he had delivered up his Kingdom, who being too indulgent to his children, did promiſe at firſt that he would do it, and not long after repenting himſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

denying what raſhly he had promiſed, he made her a Prioreſs in the Temple of the Sun, whereby a perpetual abſtinence from all men was religiouſly impoſed on her. The young man being much incenſed at it, did firſt quarrel with his Father; and not long after having made a conſpiracy with his brothers, whiles he ſought to betray his Father, being diſcovered and apprehended with his Aſſociates, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated with their blood the deſigned Parricide, and did puniſhment to the Gods the Revengers of paternal Majeſty. The Wives alſo of them all with all their children were put to death, that there ſhould not be ſo much as a ſhadow to be ſeen of ſo great a villany. After this <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi> having contracted a diſeaſe by the exceſs of grief deceaſed himſelf a happier King then a Father.</p>
            <p>The Inheritance of the Kingdom by order of ſucceſſion was devolved on <hi>Occhus,</hi> who fearing the like conſpiracy, did fill the Court with the ſlaughter of his kinſmen, and the ruins of the Princes, being touched with no compaſſion in the reſpect either of blood, or ſex, or age; belike that he might not be more innocent then the Parricides his brothers.</p>
            <p>And having as it were thus purified his Kingdom, he made war upon the <hi>Armenians;</hi> in which one of the Enemies having ſent a challenge to try his force in Arms with any in a

            <p>In theſe deſtractions the coming of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> was as a Soveraign remedy, who in a ſet ſpeech did for the preſent ſo perſwade and comfort the Souldiers, that he took off all fear from the timerous, and did raiſe the opinion of all into a great hope of him: He was then but twenty yeers of age, in which he ſo mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately promiſed ſo much that it might appear to all that he reſerved more for the proof. He gave to the <hi>Macedonians</hi> the immunity of all things, unleſs a diſcharge from the wats, by which he ſo much attracted their love, that they ſaid they had changed onely the body, but not the vertue nor the valor of the King. The firſt care he had was for his Fathers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequies at which he gave a charge above all things that all who were guilty of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death ſhould be ſlain before the Tombe of his Father; he onely reprieved <hi>Alexander</hi> the brother of the <hi>Lynceſtae,</hi> preſerving in him the inaguration into his dignity; for he was
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62253:86"/>
the firſt that did ſalute him King. He alſo took care that his brother <hi>Caraunus</hi> born of his Step-mother, who aſpired to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſhould be put to death.</p>
            <p>In the firſt beginning of his Reign he awed many Nations that were about to rebel, &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed divers ſeditions in the Eaſt, and joyful at the ſucceſs of his proceedings he marched privately into <hi>Greece,</hi> where having called all the Cities to <hi>Corinth</hi> after the example of his Father, he was made General in his place. After this, he did go on with the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the <hi>Perſian</hi> war, which was begun by his Father; and being altogether imployed to make proviſion for it, he was enformed that the <hi>Athenians, Thebans,</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had revolted from him to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and that the Author of that treachery was <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes</hi> the Orator, who was corrupted by the <hi>Perſians</hi> with a great ſum of gold: He alledged that all the Forces of the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> were overthrown by the <hi>Triballians</hi> with their King, and in his ſpeech compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for that purpoſe, he produced his Author before the people, who affirmed that he was wounded in the ſame battel wherein the King was ſlain: By which report the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of almoſt all the Citizens being ſtartled, they reſolved to ſhake off the Garriſons of the <hi>Macedons;</hi> to meet with and to prevent
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62253:86"/>
theſe difficulties, he marched into <hi>Greece</hi> with ſo much ſpeed, and with ſo gallant and ſo prepared an Army, that whom they knew not of to come, they could hardly believe they ſaw. In his way he exhorted the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalians,</hi> and did put them in minde of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of <hi>Philip</hi> his Father to them, and of the neer relations of his Mother deſcended from the generation of the <hi>Aeacidans.</hi> His exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was agreeable to the <hi>Theſſalians;</hi> they created him General of <hi>Greece</hi> after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his Father, and delivered to him all their tributes and revenews. But the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> as they were the firſt in the revolt, ſo they began to be the firſt in repentance, and turning the contempt of their Enemy into their admiration of him, they extoll'd the youth of <hi>Alexander</hi> deſpiſed before above the vertue of the ancient Captains; Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors therefore being ſent, they beſought a forbearance of the war; <hi>Alexander</hi> having heard them and ſeverely reprehended them, did remit the war. After this he advanced againſt the <hi>Thebans,</hi> and would have exerciſed the ſame indulgence towards them, if he had found the ſame repentance; but the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> were reſolved to make uſe of their Arms, and not of entreaties or deprecations. Being overcome, they endured the heavieſt puniſhments of the moſt miſerable captivity:

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62253:87"/>
and were ſo vex'd with adulteries and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, that they never endured any thing more grievous; he intreated not he ſaid for the Citizens who were ſo few, but for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent ground of his Country, and for the City which had not onely brought forth men but gods: He ſupeſtitiouſly conjured the King by the remembrance of <hi>Hercules,</hi> who was born amongſt them, and from whom the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Aeacidans</hi> did derive their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that he would forbear all further execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: He beſought, his father <hi>Philip</hi> having had his education in that City, that he would vouchſafe to ſpare it, it being the City which adored ſome of his Anceſtors being born gods amongſt them, and which ſaw others who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there brought up were Kings of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preameſt dignity. But anger was more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then prayer; the City therefore was le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd to the ground: the Fields were divided amongſt the Conquerors; the Captives were ſold, whoſe prizes were ſet not for the profit of the Buyers, but at the rate of the hatred of the Enemy. Their ſad condition was lamented by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who opened their Gates to receive them againſt the mandate of the King: which <hi>Alexander</hi> took ſo grievouſly, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> by a ſecond Ambaſſy beſeeching him to forbear the war; he did remit it on that condition, that their Orators and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62253:88"/>
by whoſe confidence they ſo often had rebelled, might be delivered to him; into ſo great a ſtrait the <hi>Athenians</hi> were brought, that rather then undergo the war, their Orators being retained, their Captains were ſent into baniſhment, who immediately go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Darius,</hi> were of no ſmall moment in the Army of the <hi>Perſians; Alexander</hi> being now wholy deſign'd <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>on the <hi>Perſian</hi> war did put to death thoſe kindred of his ſtep-mothers, whom <hi>Philip</hi> advancing to the places of higheſt dignity had ſet over the Kingdom; neither was he more indulgent to thoſe who were more neer unto him, if they nouriſhed aſpiring thoughts and were fit for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that no occaſion of ſedition might call him back being imployed in his war in <hi>Aſia;</hi> &amp; he took into the war thoſe Penſioners of the King with him, the abilities of whoſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings were more eminent then their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, leaving thoſe who were of any age and gravity behind him for the defence of his Kingdom. After this, having drawn his Army all into one Body, he ſpeedily embarked them, and being come into the ſight of <hi>Aſia,</hi> being inflamed with an incredible ardor of ſpirit, he erected twelve Altars, where he made his vowes to the gods of war: He divided all the Patrimony which he had in <hi>Macedonia</hi> and in <hi>Europe</hi> amongſt his friends, alledging

that <hi>Aſia</hi> was ſufficient for himſelf; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that any of his ſhips put forth to Sea, he offered ſacrifices, deſiring Victory in this war, in which he was to be the Revenger of <hi>Greece</hi> ſo often invaded by the <hi>Perſians;</hi> whoſe Empire was great, old, and over-ripe, it being now high time that it ſhould receive others by turns, who could do better: Neither were the preſageful reſolutions of his Army leſs then his own; for all of them forgetting their wives and children, and the war that was to be mannaged ſo far from their own Country, did propound unto themſelves the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gold, and the Riches of all the Eaſt as already their own booty: when they drew neer unto the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, <hi>Alexander</hi> firſt of all did throw a dart as into the hoſtile La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, and in his Armor leaping on the ſhoar and valting aloft, did cut a fine caper or two; he there offered ſacrifices, praying that thoſe Countries would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly receive him their King: In <hi>Ilium</hi> alſo he did parentate to the Tombs of thoſe who fell in the <hi>Trojan</hi> war; advancing afterwards towards the Enemy, he cauſed a Proclamation to be publiſhed, forbidding his Souldiers to plunder, alledging that they muſt ſpare their own goods, nor deſtroy thoſe things which they came to poſſeſs.</p>
            <p>In his Army there were two and thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foot, and four thouſand and five hundred
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62253:89"/>
horſe, and a Fleet conſiſting of one hundred and fourſcore and two ſhips. With this ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable an Army, it is hard to ſay whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he more wonderfully overcame all the World, or that he durſt undertake to do it, eſpecially when to ſo dangerous a war he choſe not an Army of robuſtious men, or in the firſt flower of their youth, but old Souldiers, and ſome who by the Laws of war were to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed by reaſon of their Age, and who had ſerved in the wars of his Father and his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, that you would have taken them to be ſelected maſters of the war rather then Souldiers; neither in the firſt files or ranks was any a lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man who was not threeſcore yeers of age, inſomuch that had you beheld the order of their Camp, you would have ſaid that you had ſeen a Senate of ſome ancient Commonwealth. Therefore in the battel no man thought of flight but of Victory, neither did they put any hope in the nimbleneſs of their feet, but in the ſtrength of their Arms.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Darius</hi> King of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> in the confidence of his ſtrength, affirmed that nothing was to be done by circumvention, and that the cloſe counſel of a ſtollen Victory was not ſuitable to his greatneſs: He thought it more honourable to drive back the war then not to admit it, and not to prohibite the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into his Confines, but to receive him into
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62253:89"/>
his Kingdom. The firſt battel was in the Plain of <hi>Adraſtum,</hi> where there being ſix hundred thouſand in the Army of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> they were put to flight, being overcome as much by the policy of <hi>Alexander</hi> as by the courage of the <hi>Macedons;</hi> great was the ſlaughter of the <hi>Perſians;</hi> in the Army of <hi>Alexander</hi> there were ſlain but nine foot-men, and one hundred and twenty horſe, whom for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of their fellows, the King cauſed to be honourably enterred, and commanded Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues to be cut for them, as for ſome memorable Commanders, and gave priviledges of immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to all their kindred. After this victory, the greater part of <hi>Aſia</hi> did ſubmit unto him; He alſo made many wars with the Lieutenants of <hi>Darius</hi> whom he overcame not ſo much by arms as by the terror of his Name. Whiles thoſe things were thus managed, he underſtood by one of his Captives, that a treaſon was plotted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him by <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Lynceſte,</hi> the Son-in-law of <hi>Antipater,</hi> who was the Kings Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and fearing that if he ſhould put him to death, it might occaſion ſome tumult in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> he onely confined him to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment and Bonds; After this, he advanced to the City of <hi>Gordium,</hi> which is ſituated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both the <hi>Phrygias,</hi> which City he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be maſter of, not ſo much for the booty, as for that he underſtood that in that City in

the Temple of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> there was conſecrated the plough of <hi>Gordius,</hi> the knots of whoſe cord if any could unloſe, the Oracle did perſage of old that he ſhould raign over all <hi>Aſia.</hi> The cauſe and original was from this; When <hi>Gardius</hi> was ploughing in this Country with his Oxen, great flights of birds of all ſorts did flie round about him, and repairing to the <hi>Augurs</hi> of the next City to know the reaſon of it, he met in the Gate of the City a Virgin of an excellent beauty, and having demanded of her to what <hi>Augur</hi> he ſhould more particularly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs himſelf, ſhe having underſtood the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and having ſome knowledge herſelf in the Art, by the inſtructions of her Parents, did make anſwer that the Kingdom was preſaged to him, and did offer her ſelf the companion of his hope, and to be his companion in marriage. So <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>air a condition did ſeem to be the firſt felicity of the Kingdom. After the marriage, there did ariſe a ſedition amongſt the <hi>Phrygians;</hi> and counſel being asked, what a period ſhould be put unto the differences: and when the Oracles did anſwer, That to end the diſcord there was need of a King; and it being deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded again, who ſhould be the King: They were commanded to make him King whom they ſhould finde with a Plough entring into the Temple of <hi>Jupiter. Gordius</hi> was the man whom preſently they ſaluted as their King.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62253:90"/>
He conſecrated to Regal Majeſty in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Jupiter</hi> the Plough by which the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was conferr'd on him. After him there reigned his Son <hi>Midas,</hi> who being inſtructed by <hi>Orpheus</hi> with the ſolemnities belonging to the worſhip of their gods, did fill all <hi>Phrygia</hi> with Religion and Ceremonies, by which during the whole courſe of his life, he was ſafer then by his Arms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> therefore, the City being taken, when he came into the Temple of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> he demanded where the Plough was, which being ſhewed unto him, when he could not diſcover the ends of the cord lying hid among the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of the foldings, he gave a violent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation to the ſenſe of the Oracle, and cutting the cords aſunder with his ſword, he found the ends lying undiſcovered in the myſterie of the twiſts. Whiles he was doing this, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that <hi>Darius</hi> was approaching to give him battel with a formidable Army. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fearing the danger of the ſtreights, he in a ſwift march did lead his Army over the Mountain of <hi>Taurus;</hi> in which expedition, his foot without any reſpite did run five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred furlongs: When he came unto <hi>Tarſus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken with pleaſantneſs of the River <hi>Cydnus</hi> running through the midſt of the City, having unbuckled his Armor, and being covered with ſweat and duſt, he threw himſelf into the River

There was one of his Phyſitians <hi>Philip</hi> by Name who promiſed to give a redreſs unto his evil, but ſome letters ſent the day before by <hi>Parmenio</hi> from <hi>Cappodocia</hi> did render him ſuſpected to the King, who not knowing of <hi>Alexander's</hi> ſickneſs did write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him to have a careful eye on <hi>Philip</hi> his Phyſitian, becauſe he was corrupted by <hi>Darius</hi> with a great ſum of money; howſoever thinking it ſafer to doubt the truſt of his Phyſitian, then his undoubted diſeaſe, having received the Cup, he delivered the letters to him, &amp; ſted faſtly did behold him as he drank the phyſick: Having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62253:91"/>
of his Souldiers, being mounted on horſe-back he did ride about his Army, and by ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations did enflame the courage of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Nations; he ſtirr'd up the <hi>Illyrians</hi> and the <hi>Thracians</hi> with the oſtentation of the wealth of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the <hi>Grecians</hi> with the memory of their former wars, &amp; with their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual hatred againſt the <hi>Perſians:</hi> He put the <hi>Macedonians</hi> in mind of <hi>Europe</hi> overcome, and of <hi>Aſia</hi> deſired by them; and that the world had not any Souldiers that were comparable unto them: This battel he ſaid would put an end to their labors, but no end unto their glory: As he delivered theſe words, he did once and again command his Army to ſtand, that by that delay they might the better obſerve and ſuſtain the unwe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ldy numbers of their Enemies; neither was <hi>Darius</hi> leſs induſtrious in the marſhalling of his Army; for omitting no office of a General, he in his own perſon did ride about the Army, and did exhort every one, and admoniſh them of the ancient glory of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire, and of their everlaſting poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion which was given of it by the immortal Gods. After this the battel was fought with great reſolution, in which both Kings were wounded, and the fight was doubtful until <hi>Darius</hi> fled, whereupon there followed a great ſlaughter of the <hi>Perſians;</hi> there were ſlain of their foot threeſcore and ten thouſand, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62253:92"/>
ten thouſand of their horſe, and forty thouſand were taken Priſoners. Of the <hi>Macedons</hi> there were ſlain one hundred and thirty foot, and one hundred and fifty horſe: In the Camp of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> there was found much gold, and other rich movables. Amongſt the Captives, there were the Mother, and the Wife, who was alſo the ſiſter of <hi>Darius,</hi> and his two daughters, to viſit and to comfort: who when <hi>Alexander</hi> came in perſon with ſome men in Arms, they imbracing one another as if immediately they were to die, did make a skrieking lamentation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then humbling themſelves to the knees of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> they deſired not life, but onely a reſpite from death ſo long until they had buried the body of <hi>Darius.

After this he advanced into <hi>Syria,</hi> where many Kings of the Eaſt with Fillets and Miters did meet him; of whom ſome he received into the ſociety of his friendſhip ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their merits, and from others he took their Kingdom, new Kings being choſen in their places. Amongſt others, <hi>A'bdolominus</hi> choſen King of <hi>Sidonia</hi> by <hi>Alexander</hi> was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, who living but miſerably before (all his imployment being either to ſcoure ditches, or to water gardens) was ordained King by him, the Nobility of that Kingdom being rejected, leaſt they ſhould impute their royalty to their birth, and not to the benefit of the giver; When the City of <hi>Tyre</hi> had ſent to <hi>Alexander</hi> by their Ambaſſadors a Crown of gold of great weight in the pretence of gratulation, the gift being gratefully accepted, <hi>Alexander</hi> did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto them that he would repair himſelf unto <hi>Tyre</hi> to pay his vows to <hi>Hercules;</hi> the Ambaſſadors replying that he ſhould perform that better in the old Town of <hi>Tyre,</hi> and in

And <hi>Philip</hi> not long before his death, did openly confeſs that <hi>Alexander</hi> was not his Son, and cauſed <hi>Olympias</hi> to be divorced from him as being guilty of incontinence; <hi>Alexander</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſiring to know the divinity of his Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,

and to deliver his Mother from Infamy, did ſend ſome before him to ſuborn the Prieſts what anſwers they ſhould give unto him. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the Temple, the Prieſts immediately did ſalure him as the Son of <hi>Ammon;</hi> He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyful of this his adoption by the God, did command that he ſhould be eſteemed as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. After this he demanded, whether he had taken full revenge on all the Murtherers of his Father: It was anſwered, That his Father could neither be killed nor die, but the revenge for King <hi>Philip</hi> was fully performed. After this having propounded a third demand unto them: It was anſwered, That both Victory in all wars, and the poſſeſſion of all Lands was granted to him. His Companions alſo were enjoyned by the Prieſts to worſhip him as a God, and not as a King. From hence he was poſſeſſed with a ſtrange inſolence, and a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful pride of minde, being altogether eſtranged from that familiarity which he had learned by the letters of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Macedons:</hi> being returned from <hi>Hammon,</hi> he builded <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that a Col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Darius</hi> flying to <hi>Babylon,</hi> deſired <hi>Alexander</hi> by letters, that he might have the liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the Captive Ladies, and promiſed him a vaſte ſum of money. But <hi>Alexander</hi> returned
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62253:94"/>
anſwer, That to redeem thoſe Captives, he muſt not onely have his money, but all his Empire. Not long after <hi>Darius</hi> did write again to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and in his letter he offered him the marriage of his Daughter, and a great part of the Empire; but <hi>Alexander</hi> did write back unto him, that he gave him but that which was his own before, and commanded him to come as a Suppliant to him, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Conqueror to diſpoſe of the Kingdom at his own pleaſure. Wherefore having abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all hope of peace, <hi>Darius</hi> did prepare again for the war, and advanced againſt <hi>Alexander</hi> with four hundred thouſand foot, and one hundred thouſand horſe. In his march he was enformed that his Wife was dead in her extremity of pain by an abortive birth, and that <hi>Alexander</hi> did lament her death, and aſſiſted at her burial, which civilities he uſed towards her, not out of the heat of vain love, but the obligations of humanity; for he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that <hi>Alexander</hi> did never ſee her but once, when he oftentimes repaired to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort his Mother and his Daughters; <hi>Darius</hi> then confeſſing that he was truly conquered, when after ſo many battels his Enemy in courteſies did overcome him, and that it ſhould not be altogether unpleaſing to him if he could not be victorious, eſpecially when he was conquered by ſuch an Enemy,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62253:94"/>
did write the third time unto <hi>Alexander,</hi> and gave him thanks for his civil reſpects unto his Family, and offered him his other Daughter to Wife, and the greater part of his Kingdom, even to the River of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and thirty thouſand talents for the other Captives. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> returned anſwer, That the giving thanks of an Enemy was ſuperflucus, neither had he done any thing in flatto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y of him, or in the diſtruſt of the event of the war, or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement for conditions of peace, but out of the greatneſs of his minde by which he had learned to contend againſt the Forces, but not the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of his Enemies: He promiſed that he would allow the ſame Grants to <hi>Darius,</hi> if he would be his Second and not his Equal: But as the World could not be governed by two Suns, no more could it endure the Government of two ſuch great Empires in a ſafe condition: Therefore he ſhould come, he ſaid, and make a ſurrender of himſelf on that preſent day, or prepare for the battel on the next<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor promiſe to himſelf any other fortune then of what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had the experience.</p>
            <p>On the next day, their Armies ſtood both in battel-array; Immediately before the fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, a deep ſleep invaded <hi>Alexander,</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with too much care, who being onely wanting in the battel, he was with much ado awakned by <hi>Parmenio:</hi> All men demanding
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62253:95"/>
the cauſe of ſo ſound aſleep in ſuch apparent danger, when in his greateſt leiſures he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes moderate of it; He made anſwer, that being delivered from a great ſear, the ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſecurity was the occaſion of it, for he might now fight at once with all the Forces of <hi>Darius,</hi> being afraid before that the wars would be delayed if the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſhould have divided their Army. Before the battel did begin both the Armies made a ſtand, and did look on one another. The <hi>Macedons</hi> did wonder at the multitudes of their Enemies, at the greatneſs of their bodies, and the beauty of their Armor: The <hi>Perſians</hi> were amazed that ſo many thouſand of their Souldiers had ſo often by ſo few been overcome. The two Kings did ride round ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut their Armies; <hi>Darius</hi> aſſured his, that if the diviſion were made throughout his Army, he had ten men in arms to fight againſt but one of his Enemies. <hi>Alexander</hi> admoniſhed the <hi>Macedonians</hi> not to be troubled with the multitudes of their Enemies, nor with the greatneſs of their bodies, or the novelty of the complexion of their Arms: he commanded them onely to remember that this is the third time they fought with them, and ſo conſider that they were become never the better men by their ſo often flying away, but carryed alwayes with them the ſad remembrance of their former overthrows, &amp; of ſo much blood
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62253:95"/>
they had loſt before in the two other battels; He aſſured them that as <hi>Darius</hi> did exceed in men, ſo did he in ſtrength: He perſwaded them to deſpiſe that Army ſhining with gold and ſilver, in which there was more booty then danger; the Victory being not to be purchaſed by the glittering of ornaments, but by the edge of the ſword.</p>
            <p>After this both Armies were joyned in battel; The <hi>Macedons</hi> in contempt of the Enemy ſo often overcome, did throw themſelves upon the ſwords of the <hi>Perſians.</hi> And the <hi>Perſians</hi> deſired rather manfully to die then to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeldom more blood in any fight was ſhed. <hi>Darius</hi> when he ſaw his Army over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, would willingly have dyed himſelf: But thoſe who ſtood next unto him did compel him to flie: Some perſwading him to break down the Bridge of the River of <hi>Cydnus</hi> to ſtop the paſſage of his Enemies; he made anſwer, That he would not ſo diſhonourably provide for his own ſafety by expoſing ſo many thouſands of his Souldiers to the fury of their Enemies, and that the ſame way of flight was to he open to others, which lay open to himſelf. <hi>Alexander</hi> in his own perſon was alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the greateſt difficulties, and where he ſaw his Enemies on their thickeſt ſquadrons to fight moſt bravely, he clapped in upon them, and would have all the dangers to be wholy his

               </gap> gained unto himſelf the whole Empire of <hi>Aſia</hi> in the fifth yeer of his reign, and ſo great was his felicity, that after this no man durſt to rebel; and the <hi>Perſians</hi> after the Empire which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo many yeers did patiently endure the yoak of ſervitude. His Souldiers being reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and refreſhed, ſo great was the booty, that it took up forty daies to receive the full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it; he found hid in the City eleven thouſand Talents: After this, he took <hi>Perſepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> the chief Seat of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire, a City renowned for many yeers, and full of the ſpoyls of the World, which firſt appeared at the deſtruction of it.</p>
            <p>As thoſe things thus paſſed, eight hundred <hi>Greeks</hi> did come unto him, who with diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The King having granted them leave to return to their own Country, they made choyce to be ſeated ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a plantation abroad, leaſt in the ſtead of joy, they ſhould preſent unto their Parents the lamentable and loathed ſpectacle of themſelves. In the mean time, <hi>Darius</hi> to purchaſe favour of the Conqueror, was bound by his kniſmen in golden chains in a Town of the <hi>Parthians</hi> called <hi>Tancas.</hi> I believe the immortal gods, ſo
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62253:96"/>
ordained it, that the Empire of the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſhould have its end in their Land who were afterwards to ſucceed in the Government. <hi>Alexander</hi> purſuing the chaſe in a full gallop came to the ſame Town on the next day. He there underſtood that <hi>Darius</hi> in a cloſe wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon was carryed away by night; his Army therefore being commanded to follow, he purſued him with onely ſeven thouſand horſe, and in the way had many and dangerous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters; And having in the chaſe numbred many miles, when he could not receive the leaſt notice of <hi>Darius,</hi> he reſpited a little to breathe and bait his horſes. As one of his Souldies did go unto the next ſpring, he found <hi>Darius</hi> bleeding through many wounds, but yet alive; whereupon he made uſe of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to be his Interpreter, whom when <hi>Darius</hi> found by his voyce to be a <hi>Perſian,</hi> he ſaid that this brought ſome comfort to him in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent misfortunes, that he ſhould ſpeak to one who underſtood him, and ſhould not in vain breathe forth his laſt words. He deſired that it might be repreſented to <hi>Alexander</hi> that he dyed much in his debt; being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to him for many favours, having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the happineſs to return any; he was much to thank him that he deported himſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Mother and his children, not like an Enemy, but a King; and was more happy
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62253:97"/>
in his Adverſary, then in his own kindred; for the lives of his Mother and his children were given to them (he ſaid) by his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, but his life was taken away by his kinſmen to whom he had given both life and Kingdoms, for which he ſhould receive that recompence, which he being a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror ſhould be pleaſed himſelf to take; All the thankfulneſs which he being a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man could return unto him, was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the powers above, and the powers below, and the gods that diſpoſe of Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that they would grant him the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of all the World; For himſelf he deſired to have rather a ſolemn then a ſumptuous Funeral.

               <hi>Parmenio</hi> was made Chancellor of it.

The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of this war was <hi>Agis</hi> King of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians;</hi> which inſurrection <hi>Antipater,</hi> having drawn his forces together, did ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs in the very beginning of it. The ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter howſoever was great on both ſides: <hi>Agis</hi> when he beheld his Souldiers to turn their backs, having cleared himſelf of his Guard, that he might be equal to <hi>Alexander,</hi> though not in fortune, yet in courage, did make ſo great a ſlaughter of his Enemies, that ſometimes he drove whole Troops of them before him: At the laſt, though he was over-born by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62253:99"/>
yet he overcame them all in glory. And <hi>Alexander</hi> King of <hi>Epirus</hi> being called into <hi>Italy</hi> by the <hi>Tarentines,</hi> deſiring ayd againſt the <hi>Brutians,</hi> did march with ſo much reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if in the diviſion of the world, the Weſt by lot had fallen to him, and the Eaſt to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Son of <hi>Olympias</hi> his ſiſter, he might have found no leſs a ſubject of glory, in <hi>Italy, Africk,</hi> and in <hi>Sicily,</hi> then the other in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and amongſt the <hi>Perſians.</hi> To this may be added, that as the Oracles at <hi>Delphos</hi> did fore-warn <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery in <hi>Macedonia;</hi> ſo he was adviſed by <hi>Jupiter</hi> of <hi>Dodona</hi> to take heed of the City of <hi>Pandoſia</hi> and of the <hi>Acheruſian</hi> River, which being both in <hi>Epirus,</hi> he being ignorant that they were both in <hi>Italy</hi> alſo, did more readily undertake a forreign war to decline the danger which was threatned by the deſtinies as he conceived at <hi>Rome.</hi>

At that time <hi>Brunduſium</hi> was the City of the <hi>Apulians,</hi> which the <hi>Aetolians</hi> (following the Conduct of their Captain <hi>Dio medes,</hi> renowned for his atchievements at the ſiege of <hi>Troy)</hi> did build. But being forced away by the <hi>Apulians,</hi> it was told them by the

After this <hi>Alexander</hi> aſſumed the habit and the diadem of the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> before unuſed by the Kings of <hi>Macedon,</hi> as if he had tranſlated himſelf into the cuſtomes and faſhions of thoſe whom he had overcome; which, that it might not more enviouſly be beheld in him alone, he commanded his friends alſo to take unto them the long robe of gold and purple. And that he might imitate as well their riot as their habit, he divided the nights by turns amongſt the flocks of his Concubines, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for their birth as for their beauty, to which he added, the magnificence of ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, leaſt his luxury ſhould not ſeem com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat. And according to the vanity of royal pomp, he made his Feaſts more delightful with Enterludes, being altogether unmindful that ſo great wealth with ſuch profuſeneſs is accuſtomed to be conſumed and not enlarged.

from his Father <hi>Philip,</hi> that he cared not for the name of his own Country, and followed the diſſoluteneſs of the <hi>Perſians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> whom for ſuch diſſoluteneſs he overcame; and that he might not onely ſeem to addict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the vices of thoſe whom with arms he had ſubdued, he permitted his Souldiers to marry thoſe female Captives, to whom they had indeared themſelves: politickly conceiving that having in their Tents a repreſentation of their houſes and Families at home, the labour of the war would be both more pleaſant by the company of their wives; and their deſires to return into their Countries, would be more moderate: And that <hi>Macedonia</hi> alſo ſhould be leſs exhauſted with recruits, if young Souldiers ſhould ſucceed in their old Fathers places, and fight in the ſame works in which they were born, being likely to be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant upon duty, exerciſing not onely their youth and childhood, but having their cradles alſo rocked in the Camp. This Cuſtom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained afterwards amongſt the Succeſſors of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and maintenance was provided for the Infants, and Inſtruments for the making of Arms, and the furniture for horſe were given them to practice on, when they were but young; and their Fathers had allowances ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them according to the number of their children, and if their Fathers dyed, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62253:101"/>
the children had the penſions of their Father, their Infancy amongſt ſo many Expeditions being as a continual war-fare. Therefore from their minority being enured to labour and to dangers, their Armies were unconquerable; for they thought no otherwiſe of their Tents then of their Country, and that an encounter was alwayes nothing elſe but Victory.</p>
            <p>This is that off-ſpring which were called <hi>Epigoni:</hi> The <hi>Parthians</hi> being overcome, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragoras</hi> one of the moſt noble of the <hi>Perſians</hi> was made Governor of them, from whom the Kings of <hi>Parthia</hi> did afterwards derive their Original. In the mean time, <hi>Alexander</hi> did begin to exerciſe his rage on his own men, not like a King, but like an Enemy: Nothing more incenſed him then that he was upbraided by them, that he had ſubverted the Cuſtoms of his Father <hi>Philip,</hi> and of his own Country, for which offence old <hi>Parmenio</hi> next unto the King in Dignity, and his Son <hi>Philotas</hi> (being queſtioned for other pretences) were both put to death. On this there did ariſe a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur over all the Camp, in compaſſion of the condition of the innocent old man and of his Son, and ſometimes they were heard to ſpeak, that they could not hope for any better them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; which when it was reported unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> fearing leaſt the ſame reproach

He deſired the Souldiers to write freely unto their friends, being but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to enjoy ſuch an apportunity again, by reaſon of the more diſtant remoteneſs of the war.

               <hi>Alexandria</hi> on the River of <hi>Tanaia,</hi> within ſeventeen daies having made a Wall about it ſix miles in compaſs, and tranſlated thither the people of three Cities which <hi>Cyrus</hi> had erected. He builded alſo twelve Cities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Bactrians</hi> and the <hi>Sogdians,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſtributed amongſt them whomſoever he found to be ſeditious in his Army. After this, upon a holy day, he called his friends together to a banquet, where mention being made by them in their wine, of the deeds performed by <hi>Philip, Alexander</hi> preferr'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above his Father, and extoll'd unto the Skies the greatneſs of his own atchievements, the greateſt parts of his Gueſts aſſenting to him: Therefore when <hi>Clytus</hi> one of the old men tempted by the confidence of his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the King, did advance the memory of <hi>Philip</hi> and the battels which he fought, he ſo inflamed <hi>Alexander,</hi> that a ſpear being ſnatched from one of the Guard, he killed him at the banquet, and inſulting over him, he objected to him, being dead, how bravely he defended his Father <hi>Philip,</hi> and how highly he praiſed his wars. After his paſſion was blown over, and he was ſatisfied with his blood, and the conſideration of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation ſucceeded into the room of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, pondering with himſelf ſometimes the perſon of him who was ſlain, and ſometimes
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62253:103"/>
the cauſe of his being ſlain, he began to repent of what he had done, and that he gave ſo diſcontented an ear to the prayſes of his Father, which he ought not to have given to his reproaches, and lamented that his old friend, and his innocent one was ſlain by him, being full of wine and ſupper, and by the ſame fury being hurryed into repentance, as he was into paſſion, he would have kill'd himſelf: Melting into tears, he did imbrace the body of the dead, he did handle his wounds, and did confeſs his madneſs to him, as if he had heard him, and taking the ſpear again into his hand, he turned the point of it to himſelf, and had done a thorough ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution with it, if his friends had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him; this reſolution to die continued with him certain dayes afterwards. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his Nurſe, ſiſter unto <hi>Clytus,</hi> was an addition to his repentance, for whom being abſent, he was greatly aſhamed that he returned her ſo foul a recompence for the nouriſhments ſhe had given him, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a young man and a Conqueror, he ſhould with Funerals requite her in whoſe arms he was bred up. He then conſidered what reports, what diſgrace he had by this violent act pull'd upon himſelf, not onely in his Army, but amongſt the conquer'd Nations, how much fear and hatred he had cotracted
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:62253:103"/>
amongſt his friends, how ſad he had made his Feaſt, ſitting more terrible at his banquet with his friends, then armed in face of his Enemies. Then <hi>Parmenio</hi> and <hi>Philotas,</hi> then <hi>Amyntas</hi> his kinſman, then his Step-mother and his Bothers being killed, then <hi>Attalus, Eurilochus</hi> and <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> and others of the ſlaughter'd Princes of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves unto his memory. For this he four dayes perſevered in an abſtinence from all meat, until at laſt he was intreated by the prayers of all the Army, deſiring that he would not lament ſo much the death of one, as to deſtroy them all, nor forſake them whom he had brought into the furtheſt part of the Eaſt amongſt barbarous and cruel Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and provoked by the war. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of <hi>Caliſthenes,</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> did prevail much upon him, who was his familiar acquaintance, and bred up with him in the School of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and was at that time ſent for by him to commit his Deeds to Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</p>
            <p>Having therefore called back his mind to the war, he took into his protection the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi> and <hi>Choraſmians,</hi> who did ſubmit unto him; Not long after, to make himſelf yet more hateful, he commanded that he ſhould not only be worſhipped, but adored, which was the onely thing he had forborn in the proud
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62253:104"/>
imitation of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings. <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> was the moſt ſharp and reſolute of all that did contradict it, which brought a deſtruction both on him and many others of the Princes of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> for they were all put to death under the pretence of treaſon. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the <hi>Macedons</hi> would not admit of adoration, but onely retained the Cuſtom of ſaluting their King: After this he marched into <hi>India</hi> to bound his Empire with the Ocean and the fartheſt Eaſt, to which glory, that the ornaments of his Army might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, he cover'd with ſilver the trappings of their horſes, and the arms of his Souldiers, and from their ſilver bucklers he called his Army <hi>Argyraspidae.</hi> When he came unto the City of <hi>Nyſa,</hi> the Inhabitants not reſiſting him by reaſon of their religious confidence in the aſſiſtance of their god <hi>Bacchus,</hi> by whom that City was builded, he commanded that it ſhould be ſpared, being glad that he followed not onely the Militia, but the foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſteps of the god.</p>
            <p>After this he did lead his Army to the ſight of the holy Hill, which was cloathed with Vines and lvie, the goods of Nature, and that ſo elegantly, as if it had been adorned by the art and induſtry of the hand of the Planter. But his Army was no ſooner marched to the Hill, but tranſported with a ſudden rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62253:104"/>
they did by inſtinct break forth into the ſacred ululations of the God, and to the amazement of the King, did run up and down without any prejudice, that he might underſtand that by ſparing the Inhabitants, he provided as well for his Army as for them.</p>
            <p>From thence he marched to the Hills of <hi>Dodalus,</hi> and to the Kingdom of Queen <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis,</hi> who having yielded her ſelf unto him, ſhe received back her Kingdom, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed it by granting him the uſe of her body; obtaining that by wantonneſs which ſhe could never have purchaſed by the force of arms; She called her ſon <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by him, who afterwards enjoyed the Kingdom of the <hi>Indians.</hi> Queen <hi>Cleophis</hi> by reaſon of this violation of her chaſtity was afterwards called by the <hi>Indians,</hi> The royal Whore. Having marched almoſt through <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> when he came to a Rock as wonderful in its bigneſs, as in the difficulty of its aſcent, into which many Nations fled, he underſtood that <hi>Hercules</hi> was by an Earthquak prohibited from the taking of it. Being therefore tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with a deſire to overcome the Acts and Labors of <hi>Hercules,</hi> with infinite difficulty and danger, he became maſter of it, and took into his protection all the Nations in that place. One of the Kings of the <hi>Indians</hi> was
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62253:105"/>
called <hi>Porus,</hi> as admirable by the ſtrength of his body, as by the greatneſs of his minde, who having underſtood before of the advance of <hi>Alexander,</hi> had prepared an Army to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him. The battels being joyned, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Army to invade the <hi>Macedons,</hi> and demanded for their King, being reſolved as a private Enemy to fight with him hand to hand; <hi>Alexander</hi> made no delay to anſwer him, and in the firſt encounter having fallen head-long to the ground, his horſe being killed under him, he was preſerved by the concourſe of his Guard. <hi>Porus</hi> being almoſt covered with blood from many wounds which he received, was taken Priſoner, and with ſuch indignation grieved that he was overcome, that after his Enemy had given him quarter, he would neither take any ſuſtenance, nor ſuffer his wounds to be dreſſed, and with much difficulty was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to be contented to live.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> in the honour of his valour, did ſend him back ſafe into his own Kingdom: He erected there two Cities, one called <hi>Nicaea,</hi> the other <hi>Bucephale,</hi> after the name of his horſe: After that having overthrown their Armies, he took the <hi>Adreſtrians, Strathenians, Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams,</hi> and <hi>Gangaritans;</hi> when he came to the <hi>Euphites</hi> where they attended his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with an Army of two hundred thouſand horſe, all his Army being tired as well by the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62253:105"/>
numbers of their Victories as by their labors did beſeech him with tears, that he would put at laſt a period to the war, and once think upon a return into his Country; they beſought him to look upon the yeers of his Souldiers whoſe age would ſcarce ſuffice to their return; ſome ſhewed him their gray hairs, ſome their wounds, ſome their bodies conſumed with ſickneſs, and ſome their bodies with the loſs of blood. They onely (they ſaid) were the men who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the continual war-fare of two Kings, <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Alexander:</hi> They did entreat him that he would reſtore their Relicts and what was left of them to the graves of their Fathers, there being no defect in their zeal, but in their age: Howſoever, if he would not ſpare his Souldiers, that he would ſpare himſelf, and not weary his good Fortune by too much oppreſſing it; Being moved with theſe ſo juſt entreaties he commanded his Camp (as to give an end to his Victories) to be made more magnificent then was uſual, that by the large extents thereof, both the Enemy ſhould be terrified, and an admiration of him ſhould be left unto poſterity. His Souldiers did never undertake any work more readily; and their adjacent Enemies being ſlain with a great joy they returned unto them.</p>
            <p>From thence he marched to the River <hi>Aceſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> on which he ſailed to the Ocean; The
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62253:106"/>
               <hi>Geſonae</hi> there and the <hi>Aſybians</hi> (two Nations of whom <hi>Hercules</hi> was the Founder) did ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto him; from thence he ſailed to the <hi>Ambrians</hi> and <hi>Sycambrians,</hi> which Nations with foureſcore thouſand armed foot, and threeſcore thouſand horſe were ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him; Having overthrown them in battel he did lead his Army to their Citie, and being himſelf the firſt man that ſcaled the Walls, when he found the City to be abandoned by its Defendants, he leaped down without any Guard into it; The Enemy when they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him alone, with a great ſhout from every place ran towards him, to try if in one man they could end the wars of the World, and give a revenge to ſo many Nations. <hi>Alexander</hi> did as reſolutely reſiſt them, and did fight alone againſt ſo many thouſands: It is incredible to be ſpoken, that not the multitude of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor the pointed force of their weapons, nor the cries and ſhouts they made provoking one another could any wayes affright him; he alone did kill and put to flight ſo many thouſands of them; but when he perceiv'd that he began to be over-powred by their numbers, he applyed himſelf to the body of a Tree that ſtood cloſe unto the Wall, by which defence he along time did ſuſtain their multitudes: His friends at length (the danger being underſtood) did leap down unto him, of which many were
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62253:106"/>
ſlain, and the battels continued doubtful until all his Army (the Walls being thrown down) did come to his aſſiſtance: In this fight being ſhot with an arrow under the breaſt, he fainted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through the loſs of blood, yet he fought ſo long with one knee on the ground until he had killed him who wounded him. The cure of the wound was more grievous then the wound it ſelf; but being at laſt reſtored from almoſt a deſperation of recovery, he ſent <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percon</hi> with his Army unto <hi>Babylon.</hi> He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a ſelected number of Souldiers did go aboard his Fleet to make ſome diſcovery on the Ocean. When he landed at the City of King <hi>Ambigerus,</hi> the Inhabitants underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was not to be overcome by the ſword, did arm their Darts with poyſon, and with a double wound of death, forcing their Enemies to retreat from their Walls, they killed many of them. When amongſt others, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was deadly wounded, and was even ready to expire, an herb was ſhown to the King in his ſleep as a remedy for the poyſon; which being found out and ſteeped in <hi>Ptolomys</hi> drinck, he was ſuddenly delivered from the danger, and by this remedy the greater part of the Army was preſerved. The City being taken, he returned to his ſhips and ſacrificed to the Ocean, imploring a happy return into his Country; And (as a Chariot driven about
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:62253:107"/>
the gole) having put bounds unto his Empire, where the creeks, or the ſolitudes of the Land did ſuffer him to paſs, or the Sea was navigable, he was at laſt brought by a favourable tide into the mouth of the River of <hi>Indus.</hi> There as a Monument of what he had done, he builded the City of <hi>Barce,</hi> and erected Altars, having left one of his friends as his Lieutenant over the Maritine <hi>Indians:</hi> Being afterwards to march altogether by Land, having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that the places were dry, about the middle of his way he cauſed Wells to be digged, and great ſtore of freſh water being found he came to <hi>Babylon.</hi> Many of the conquered Nations did there by their Ambaſſadors accuſe his Lieutenants, whom <hi>Alexander</hi> without any reſpect of friendſhip did cauſe to be put to death in the ſight of the Ambaſſadors. After this he took to marriage <hi>Statyra</hi> the daughter of King <hi>Darius,</hi> and gave in marriage to the Princes of the <hi>Macedons</hi> the moſt noble of the Virgins choſen cut of all Nations, that by the community of the fact, the fault of the King might appear the leſs. He then called his Army together, &amp; promiſed at his own charges to pay all their debts, that intirely they might carry home with them both their booty and their pay. This munificence was remarkable, not onely for the ſum but for the ground of the Gift, nor was it more grateful to the Debtors
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62253:107"/>
then to the Credit<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs, becauſe the exaction as well as the ſolution was of equal difficulty to them both: Three and twenty thouſand Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents were layd forth in this largeſs. The old Souldiers being diſmiſſed, he ſupplyed his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with thoſe of younger age, who being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained did murmur at the departure of the old Souldiers, and demanded to be diſcharged themſelves; they required that <hi>Alexander</hi> would not number their yeers but their pay unto them; and being choſen into the ſame war with old Souldiers, they thought it juſt they ſhould be diſobliged of their oath with them; at laſt they turn'd their entreaties to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and told him ſince he had ſo great a minde to it, he ſhould end the wars alone with his Father <hi>Hammon. Alexander</hi> on the other ſide, ſometimes did chaſtiſe his Souldiers, ſometimes he did perſwade them that they would not with ſeditions clow'd the glory of their warfare. At the laſt, when he found that he prevailed nothing by words, he leaped unarmed from the tribunal amongſt the armed multitude, to apprehend the authors of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and no man oppoſing him, he with his own hand took twelve of them and hurried them to puniſhment; either the fear of the King did give them ſo great a patience to die, or the Diſcipline of the war did give the King ſo great a conſtancy to exact puniſhment
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62253:108"/>
of them. After this, having called the Auxiliaries of the <hi>Perſians</hi> to convention by themſelves, he extolled their perpetual fidelity, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelf and towards their former Kings: He made mention of his benefits to them, and that he never did deport himſelf towards them as being conquered, but rather as the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of his Conqueſts; laſtly, that he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf into their manners and faſhions, and not they into the manners of his Country, and that the Conquerors did mingle in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and affinity with the conquered; He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he was now reſolved to commit the Cuſtody of his Body not to the <hi>Macedons</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but to them; And accordingly he choſe out of their young men one thouſand of them to be in the number of his Guard; he mingled alſo a party of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Auxiliaries with his own Army to inure themſelves to the Diſcipline of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> which the <hi>Macedons</hi> took much to heart, alledging that the Enemies of the King were overcome by him for their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Then they all weeping did repair unto him, and beſought him that he would rather ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie himſelf with their puniſhments then with their ignominy. By which modeſty they prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo much upon him, that he diſ-authorized eleven thouſand of the antient Souldiers. Of his old friends there were diſmiſſed <hi>Polypercon,</hi> and <hi>Clytus, Gorgias, Polydamas,</hi> and <hi>Antigonus.</hi>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:62253:108"/>
In their return, <hi>Craterus</hi> was appointed to be their chief, who was alſo to be the Kings Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant in <hi>Macedonia</hi> in the place of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater,</hi> who was called out of <hi>Macedonia</hi> to bring ſome Recruits unto the Army and to be in the place of <hi>Craterus:</hi> Their pay was given to them in their return, as if they had continned ſtill in the Army.</p>
            <p>Whiles theſe things were thus managed, <hi>Epheſtion</hi> dyed, one of the Kings friends, and moſt deer unto him both by the endowments of his beauty, and by the obſequiouſneſs of his youth, whom <hi>Alexander</hi> contrary to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a King, did a long time lament, and erected him a Tomb on which he layd forth twelve thouſand Talents, and commanded after he was dead, that he ſhould be worſhip'd as a god.</p>
            <p>Returning to <hi>Babylon</hi> from the furtheſt ſhores of the Ocean, he was informed that Ambaſſadors from <hi>Carthage</hi> and other Cities of <hi>Africk,</hi> as alſo from <hi>Spain, Sicily, France</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and from divers Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> did attend his arrival. The terror of his name had ſo poſſeſſed the whole World, that all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſubmitted to him as to their deſtined King: For this cauſe approaching to <hi>Babylon</hi> to keep as it were a Parliament of the World, ſome of the Magicians did adviſe him not to enter into the City, affirming that it would be
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62253:109"/>
fatal to him: wherefore <hi>Babylon</hi> being omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he turned aſide to <hi>Byrſia</hi> an unpeopled City, on the other ſide of <hi>Euphrates;</hi> He was there importuned by <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher to deſpiſe again the preſages of the Magicians as things falſe and uncertain, and unknown to men if proceeding from the Fates, or if from Nature, not to be prevented. Being returned therefore to <hi>Babylon,</hi> after the leiſures of many days, he again prepared a ſolemn Feaſt, which ſometimes before he had intermitted, where having devoted himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to mirth, in the exceſs of drinking he added night unto the day: <hi>Theſſalius Medius</hi> afterwards to a new Bower did invite both him and his Companions; having taken the Cup into his hand, in the middle of his draught he groaned as if he had been ſtruck through with a ſword, and being carryed half dead from the Banquet, he was tormented with ſo great a pain, that to free himſelf of it, he demanded for a ſword, and his body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo extreamly tender, that he complained at the touches of his friends, as if he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo many wounds. His friends divulged the cauſe of his diſeaſe to be a diſtemper by the exceſs of wine, when indeed it was treaſon, the infamy whereof the powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Succeſſors did ſuppreſs. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the Treaſon was <hi>Antipater,</hi> who
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:62253:109"/>
when he beheld the deareſt of his friends com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to death, his Son-in-law <hi>Alexander Lyceſtos</hi> ſlain, and himſelf having done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſervice in <hi>Greece,</hi> not reſpected only, but alſo made diſtaſtful to the King, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver accuſed by his Mother <hi>Olympias</hi> for divers inſolencies: when he conſidered alſo ſome few daies before, what were the puniſhments which the Lieutenants of the conquered Nations too cruelly indured, and conjectured that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was called out of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> not to the ſociety of the war but to be a partaker of their puniſhment; therefore to make ſure work with the King, he with poyſon ſuborn'd his Son <hi>Caſſander,</hi> who with his brother <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Jolla</hi> were accuſtomed to miniſter unto him; So great was the ſtrength of this poyſon, that it could not be contained either in Iron or in Braſs, or in any ſhell, and could no way be carryed, but in the hoof of an horſe. <hi>Caſſander</hi> was inſtructed that he ſhould not commit the truſt of it unto any but to <hi>Theſſalus</hi> and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For this cauſe therefore the Feaſt was prepared and renewed in the houſe of <hi>Theſſalus. Philip</hi> and <hi>Jollas,</hi> who were accuſtomed to take an aſſay of the Kings Cup, had the poyſon ready in cold water, and having taſted of the wine they put the poyſon afterwards into it. Four days afterwards, <hi>Alexander</hi> finding that death undoubtedly was approaching, he ſaid,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:62253:110"/>
that he acknowledged the fate of the Family of his Anceſtors (moſt of the <hi>Aeacidans</hi> dying about the thirtieth yeer of their age:) After this he pacified the Souldiers growing into tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, and ſuſpecting that he periſhed by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and being brought into the higheſt and the moſt conſpicuous place of the City, he did admit them all into his preſence, and gave them his right hand to kiſs. When they all wept, he was ſeen to be not onely without tears him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but without the leaſt ſhow of a troubled minde, and comforted ſome who impatiently did lament; he gave to others his inſtructions to deliver from him to their Parents; ſo invincible was his courage now againſt death, as it was before againſt his Enemies. The Souldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſmiſſed, he demanded of his friends who ſtood round about him, if they thought they ſhould finde another King that was like unto him? they all holding their peace, he ſaid, that as he himſelf was ignorant of that, ſo he was confident of this, and did preſage it, and did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt with his eyes behold how much blood <hi>Macedonia</hi> ſhould loſe in this contention, and with how many ſlaughters ſhe would parentate to him being dead: At the laſt, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his body to be burryed in the Temple of <hi>Hammon.</hi> When his friends beheld him to faint away, they demanded whom he would make heir of his Empire? he made anſwer,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:62253:110"/>
The moſt worthy. So great was the magnitude of his minde, that when he had left behind him his Son <hi>Hercules,</hi> his brother <hi>Aridaeus,</hi> and his wife <hi>Roxane</hi> great with child, forgetting thoſe obligations, he did nominate the moſt worthy to be his heir; as if it were a ſin, that any but a valiant man ſhould ſucceed a valiant man, or the wealth of ſo great an Empire ſhould be left to any but to approved reſolutions: With theſe words as if he had ſounded into his friends ears a charge unto the battel, or had ſent the evil ſpirit of diſcord amongſt them, they all grew immediatly jealous of one another, and in a popular ambition, did all tacitely ſeek the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Souldiers. On the ſixth day, being ſpeechleſs, having taken his Ring from his finger he delivered it to <hi>Perdicas,</hi> which for the preſent did pacifie a little the growing diſſention of his friends; for although he was not named Heir by voyce, yet by choyce he ſeemed to be elected. <hi>Alexander</hi> deceaſed being three and thirty yeers of age and one month, a man endued with a mightineſs of ſpirit above the capacity of men. On that night when his Mother <hi>Olympias</hi> did conceive him, ſhe ſeemed in her ſleep to have commerce with a great Serpent, neither was ſhe deceived in her dream, which by God was preſented to her; for undoubtedly ſhe had in her womb a burden
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:62253:111"/>
above the condition of mortality; and although the generation of the <hi>Aeacidans</hi> from the firſt memory of Ages, and the Kingdoms of her Father, brother, and husband, and of her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors before them, did render his mother moſt illuſtrious, yet ſhe was not more famous by any Title, then by the name of her Son. There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared alſo many preſages of his greatneſs on the day of his birth; for two Eagles flying all that day round about the place, did pearch at laſt upon the Battlements of his Fathers Court, prognoſticating unto him, the two Empires of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> and on the ſame day his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther received the glad tidings of two Victories, the one in <hi>Illyria,</hi> and the other in the <hi>Olympick</hi> race, to which places he ſent ſome Chariots drawn all with four horſes, which portented to the Infant the victory of the whole World. He was of an admirable apprehenſion in the ſtudy of letters, and having paſſed his minority, he for the ſpace of five yeers had his education under <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the moſt excellent of all the Philoſophers. Being inveſted in his Fathers Kingdom, he commanded that in his Title he ſhould be called King of all Lands and Lord of the World. So great a confidence had his Souldiers in him that he being preſent they feared not, though unarmed, the arms of any Enemy. He therefore never encountred any

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lexander</hi> the Great being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed in the flower of his Age and the height of his Victories, a ſad ſilence there was over all <hi>Babylon</hi> and over all men. The conquered and barbarous Nations would not believe the report, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd him to be as immortal as he was invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; They called to minde how often he had been pluckt from ſudden death, how often his ſword being broke, and his buckler ſlipt from his hand, he on a ſudden preſented himſelf to his Souldiers not onely ſafe but a Conqueror. But as ſoon as it was believed that he was
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62253:112"/>
dead, all the barbarous Nations, whom not long before he overcame, did leave him not as an Enemy but a Father. The mother alſo of <hi>Darius</hi> (who her ſon being loſt, yet repented not by the indulgence of the Conqueror that ſhe lived that day, although reduced from the height of Majeſty into Captivity) having heard of the death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſhe wilfully ended her own life, not that ſhe preferr'd an Enemy above her Son, but becauſe ſhe found the piety of a Son in him whom ſhe had fear'd as an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. On the other ſide the <hi>Macedons</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce as if they had loſt rather an Enemy then a Citizen and a King of ſo great a Majeſty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning his great ſeverity, and the daily dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the war. To this you may add that the Princes looked after the Soveraignty of command, the common Souldiers after the treaſure and the heavie and great weight of gold as an unexpected booty, thoſe bending their thoughts to the ſucceſſion of his Kingdom, and theſe to the inheritance of his riches; for you are to underſtand that there was in the treaſury one hundred thouſand, and in the office of the yeerly revenews by tributes three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Talents; But the friends of <hi>Alexander</hi> did not undeſervedly expect the Kingdom; for they were of that vertue and veneration that you would have believ'd every one of them to be a
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62253:113"/>
King, ſuch a graceful beauty of countenance, ſuch a tall ſtreightneſs of body, ſuch a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vigor of ſtrength and wiſdom were in them all, that they who did not know them, would have judged them not to be ſelected out of one people, but out of all the Nations in the Earth. For never <hi>Macedonia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor any other Nation did flouriſh in the production of ſuch famous men, whom <hi>Philip</hi> firſt of all, and after him <hi>Alexander</hi> did ſelect with ſo much care, that they ſeemed not ſo much to be choſen into the ſociety of the war, as into the ſucceſſion of the Kingdom. Who would therefore wonder that the world ſhould be conquered by ſuch miniſtrators, when the Army of the <hi>Macedons</hi> was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned rather by ſo many Kings then Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, who never had found any equal to them, if they had not fallen out amongſt themſelves; and <hi>Macedonia</hi> in the roome of one ſhould have had many <hi>Alexanders,</hi> if Fortune had not armed them by the emulation of their vertue into their mutual deſtruction.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Alexander</hi> being deceaſ'd, they were neither ſecure nor joyful, drawing both their perſons and competitions into one place, neither were the common Souldiers leſs ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous, whoſe liberty was more diſſolute, and whoſe favor more uncertain: Their equality
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62253:113"/>
did encreaſe their diſcord, not one of them all ſo excelling another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that any one of them ſhould ſubmit unto him. Therefore putting on their Arms, they came all unto the Court to form a new State according to the emergency of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent affairs. <hi>Perdiccas</hi> was of judgement, that they ſhould attend the Iſſue of <hi>Roxanes</hi> womb, who being eight Moneths with childe, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ready to be delivered, &amp; if ſhe brought forth a Boy, that he ſhould be his Succeſſor in the Kingdom. <hi>Meleager</hi> denied that the Counſels ought to be delayed to the doubtful events of the birth of the child, neither ought they to attend when Kings ſhould be born unto them, when they might make choyce of thoſe who were born already; for if they would have a child, there was at <hi>Pergamus</hi> the Son of <hi>Alexander,</hi> begotten on <hi>Arſine;</hi> or if they would rather have a young man, there was in the Camp <hi>Aridaeus</hi> the brother and companion of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> and moſt acceptable to all, though not in his own, yet in the name and notion of <hi>Philip</hi> his Father. He alledged that <hi>Roxane</hi> received her original from the <hi>Perſians,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it lawful that Kings ſhould be derived to the <hi>Macedons</hi> from thoſe whoſe Kingdoms they deſtroyed, and that <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf was againſt it, who dying made no mention of him. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> refuſed <hi>Aridaeus</hi> to be King, not onely by reaſon of his Mothers infamy, being begot on
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62253:114"/>
               <hi>Lariſſaea</hi> the Dancereſs, but alſo by reaſon of his own incapacity, leaſt he having the Title onely, another ſhould govern the Empire; it was therefore better he ſaid to make choyce of thoſe who in regard of their virtue were next unto the King, who might govern the Provinces, and might command war or peace, then to ſubject themſelves to the command of unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men under the pretence of a King.</p>
            <p>The opinion of <hi>Perdiccas</hi> was approved by the conſent of all: It was therefore agreed upon, that they ſhould attend untill <hi>Roxane</hi> was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of her child, and if it were a Male, that <hi>Leonatus, Perdiccas, Craterus</hi> and <hi>Antipater</hi> ſhould be his Guardians, and immediately they every one did take their oaths to perform the office of a Guardian. When all the horſemen did the like, the foot being offended, that they were not aſſumed into the participation of their Counſels, did chooſe <hi>Aridaeus</hi> the brother of <hi>Alexander</hi> to be their King, and did provide him with a Guard out of their own Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and commanded that he ſhould be called <hi>Philip</hi> after the name of his Father, which when it was reporred unto the Horſemen, they ſent two of the Nobility, <hi>Attalus</hi> and <hi>Melea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> to pacifie their minds, who ſeeking a new power to themſelves by a compliance with the people, omitting their legation, did accord with them. On this the ſedition did encreaſe,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62253:114"/>
and it began now to have both head and Counſel. The foot being all in arms did break into the Court to deſtroy their Cavalry, which being underſtood, the Horſe ſurprized with fear, did abandon the City, and having encamped not far from it, the Foot themſelves were ſtartled at it. But the conteſtation of the Nobility ceaſed not: <hi>Attalus</hi> did ſend to kill <hi>Perdiccas</hi> who was Captain of the other party, to whom, being armed and out-daring them, when the Executioner durſt not approach, <hi>Perdiccas</hi> was of ſo great a reſolution, that of his own accord he came unto them, and admoniſhed them to look back upon the crime which they were about to commit, and conſider againſt whom they had taken arms, not <hi>Perſians,</hi> but <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,</hi> not enemies, but Citizens, and moſt of them their neareſt kinſmen, certainly their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Souldiers, and companions in the ſame Tents and dangers; it would be a gallant ſpectacle he ſaid unto their Enemies, who would rejoyce in their mutual ſlaughter, by whoſe arms they were overcome, and to ſee them with their own blood to parentate to the ghoſts of their Enemies whom they had ſlain. When <hi>Perdiccas</hi> had ſpoken this according to that excellent eloquence which was natural in him, he ſo prevailed upon the Footmen, that his Counſels being approved, he was choſen General by them all. The Horſe at the ſame
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62253:115"/>
time being reduced into concord with the Footmen, did choſe <hi>Aridaeus</hi> for their King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But a portion of the Empire was reſerved for the Son of <hi>Alexander,</hi> if a Son were born unto him: When this was done, the dead body of <hi>Alexander</hi> was placed in the midſt of them, that the Majeſty of it ſhould be a witneſs to their Decrees: Theſe things being compoſed, <hi>Antipater</hi> was made Governor of <hi>Macedonia</hi> and of <hi>Greece.</hi> The cuſtody of the Treaſure was committed to <hi>Craterus:</hi> The care of the Army and of all Military affairs was aſſigned to <hi>Meleager</hi> and <hi>Perdiccas;</hi> And <hi>Aridaeus</hi> was commanded to convey the body of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> unto the Temple of <hi>Ammon. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diccas</hi> being incenſed againſt the Authors of the ſedition, did on a ſudden (his Colleague being ignorant of it) command that there ſhould be a luſtrati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Being returned, the Provinces were by him divided amongſt the Princes, that at once he might remove the Emulators, and make the allotments in the Empire the benefit of his bounty. <hi>Aegypt</hi> in the firſt place and a part of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Arabia</hi> did come by lot to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> whom <hi>Alexander</hi> from an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

            <p>This diviſion of the Empire, which was as a fatal gift to every one, did prove unto many a ſubject of great additions; for not long after as if they had divided Kingdoms, and not Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenantſhips, being made Kings of Lieutenants, they purchaſed great wealth for themſelves, and dying, left it to their poſterity. When this was done in the Eaſt, the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Aetolians</hi> with all their power did proceed in the war which they undertook <hi>Alexander</hi> being alive. The occaſion of the war was, That <hi>Alexander</hi> returning out of <hi>India</hi> did ſend letters into <hi>Greece,</hi> by which the baniſhed of all Cities were reſtored, thoſe onely excepted who were guilty of murther. Theſe Letters being read all <hi>Greece</hi> being preſent at the <hi>Olympick</hi> Fair, a great combuſtion did ariſe, becauſe many of the baniſhed men were driven from their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, not by the Laws, but by the faction of the Princes, who feared that being called back, they might grow more powerful then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Common-wealth. Many Cities d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d therefore openly murmur, and declared that their liberty was to be vindicated by war. The <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Aetolians</hi> were the chief ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:62253:116"/>
in it: Which when it was reported to <hi>Alexander,</hi> he commanded that a Fleet of one thouſand ſhips ſhould be in readineſs, with which he would proſecute war in the Weſt, reſolving with a ſtrong power to level <hi>Athens</hi> to the ground.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> therefore having drawn an Army together of thirty thouſand Souldiers, and two hundred ſhips, did make war againſt <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipater,</hi> who by lot was Governor of <hi>Greece,</hi> and delaying the battel, and protecting himſelf within the Walls of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> the <hi>Athenians</hi> did cloſe beſiege him. At the ſame time <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> Orator, who was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from his Country, being condemned for bribery, having received a ſum of gold from <hi>Harpalus,</hi> and who fled from the cruelty of <hi>Alexander,</hi> having perſwaded the City to war againſt him, did lead a baniſhed life at <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garae,</hi> who when he underſtood that the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> had ſent <hi>Hyperides</hi> their Ambaſſador to ſollicite the <hi>Pelopennenſians</hi> to joyn in war with them, having followed him to <hi>Syceon,</hi> he by his Eloquence joyned <hi>Arges, &amp; Corinth,</hi> and other Cities to the <hi>Athenians:</hi> For which he was called back from baniſhment, the <hi>Athenians</hi> having ſent a ſhip to meet him in the way. In the mean time, <hi>Antipater</hi> being beſieged in <hi>Heraclea, Leoſthenes</hi> the Captain of the <hi>Athenians</hi> was ſlain with a dart from the Wall
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:62253:117"/>
as he came to give ſome directions in the Leaguer, which ſo encouraged <hi>Antipater,</hi> that he ſallyed forth and poſſeſſed himſelf of ſome of the works of the Enemies. After that, he by his Ambaſſadors deſired help of <hi>Leona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> who when he marched to his aſſiſtance, the <hi>Athenians</hi> meeting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him with a gallant Army, and having given him battel on horſe-back, he received a grievous wound, of which he dyed: <hi>Antipater,</hi> although he beheld his Auxiliaries were overcome, yet he in wardly rejoyced at the death of <hi>Leonatus;</hi> for he gratulated himſelf that his emulator was taken from him, and that the remainder of his fortes was come unto him: Therefore with this addition to his Army, when he appeared to be equal to his Enemy in ſtrength, having raiſed the ſiege, he marched into <hi>Macedonia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Whereupon the Forces of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> the Enemy being driven from their Confines, did ſteal away into their own Cities: In the mean time, <hi>Perdiccas</hi> having made an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt war on <hi>Ariarathes</hi> the King of the <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docians,</hi> and being Conqueror in the battel, did bring nothing from him but wounds &amp; danger; for the <hi>Cappadocians</hi> flying from the fight into the City, having ſlain their own wives and children, did ſet their own houſes on fire with all the Forces which they had; and having brought thither all their wealth, they threw both it and themſelves into the flame, ſo that
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:62253:117"/>
their Enemies, the Conquerors of them &amp; their Poſſeſſions, did enjoy nothing but only the ſpectacle of the fire. After this, that by his power he might arrive to royal Authority, he pretended to the marriage of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> ſiſter to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and Wife to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> late King of <hi>Epirus, Olympias</hi> her Mother ſeeming enclined to it. But he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved firſt to over-reach <hi>Antipater</hi> under this pretence of affinity; he therefore diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to deſire his daughter in marriage, to the end that he might the ſooner obtain of him a recruit of young men out of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> which deceit <hi>Antipater</hi> fore-ſaw, and whiles <hi>Perdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi> courted two Ladies at the ſame time, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained neither.</p>
            <p>After this, there did ariſe a war betwixt him and <hi>Antigonus: Craterus</hi> and <hi>Antipater</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted <hi>Antigonus</hi> in their own perſons, and having made a Peace with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> did ſubſtitute <hi>Polypercon</hi> in the Government of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Macedonia.</hi> The affairs of <hi>Perdiccas</hi> being in ſome difficulty, he came into <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia,</hi> and he took into Counſel with him <hi>Aridaeus,</hi> and the Son of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, the charge of whom was committed to him to debate there concerning the carrying on of the war.</p>
            <p>It was the opinion of ſome that the war ſhould be tranſlated into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> the head
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:62253:118"/>
and original of the Kingdom, and where <hi>Olympias</hi> the Mother of <hi>Alexander</hi> lived, who would bring no ſmall moment to their party, beſides the favor of the Inhabitants in their reſpect to the names of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Philip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others differed in judgement from it, and it was concluded that it was better for the preſent to begin with <hi>Aegypt,</hi> leaſt whiles they were withdrawn into <hi>Macedonia, Aſia</hi> might be ſeized on by <hi>Ptolomy.</hi> In the mean time, <hi>Paphlagonia, Caria, Lycia</hi> and <hi>Phrygia</hi> were added to the Provinces of which <hi>Eumenes</hi> was Governor: It was appointed that they ſhould there attend the coming of <hi>Antipater</hi> and <hi>Craterus: Alcetas</hi> the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Perdiccas</hi> and <hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> did joyn themſelves with their Armies to the Armies of <hi>Perdiccas:</hi> The charge of the Navie was committed to <hi>Clytus; Cilicia</hi> was taken from <hi>Philotas,</hi> and given to <hi>Philoxenus: Perdiccas</hi> himſelf with a formidable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my did march into <hi>Aegypt;</hi> And thus the <hi>Macedons,</hi> their Captains being divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two parties, were armed againſt their own bowels, and turning their ſwords from an hoſtile war, they covered themſelves with civil blood, after the example of mad men who themſelves do tear their own hands and members. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> in <hi>Aegypt</hi> with wiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:62253:118"/>
did lay up great riches; for with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular moderation of government he attracted the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> to him, and obliged the neighbouring Kings with benefits and all civil reſpects: He alſo enlarged the bounds of his Empire, having poſſeſſed himſelf of the City <hi>Cyrene,</hi> and was now ſo great, that he feared not ſo much his Enemies as he himſelf was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come terrible to them. The City of <hi>Cyrene</hi> was builded by <hi>Ariſtaeus,</hi> who being tongue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed, was called <hi>Battus. Cyrenus</hi> his Father King of the Iland of <hi>Thera,</hi> when he came to the Oracle of <hi>Delphos</hi> to implore the god to take away the diſgrace from his Son who could not ſpeak, he received an anſwer by which his Son <hi>Battus</hi> was commanded to go to <hi>Africa,</hi> and to build there the City <hi>Cyrene,</hi> which being done, he ſhould enjoy the uſe of his tongue: When the anſwer ſeem'd like a jeer, by reaſon of the ſimilitude of the Iland <hi>Theramenis,</hi> from which they were commanded to travel ſo great a journey to build a City in <hi>Africa,</hi> the Oracle was was not obeyed: Not long after, having their contumaciouſneſs puniſh'd with a Peſtilence, they were enforced to be obedient to the Oracle, their number being ſo few, that all of them could ſcarce fill one ſhip; when they came into <hi>Africa,</hi> having driven away the Inhabitants, they ſeated themſelves on the

               </gap>yed, did begin to ſpeak, which encouraged them (the promiſes of the god being in ſome part fulfilled) to proceed in the building of the City; Having there pitched their Tents, they received the opinion of the ancient Fable, that <hi>Cyrene,</hi> a Virgin of an excellent beauty, being forced from the Hill <hi>Pelion</hi> to <hi>Theſſaly</hi> by <hi>Apollo,</hi> and brought to the cliffs of the ſame Hill which they did inhabite, being bid by the god, did bring forth four Children, <hi>Nomius, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaeus, Eurocus</hi> and <hi>Agaeus;</hi> thoſe who were ſent by their Father <hi>Hypſaeus</hi> King of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> to ſeek out the Virgin, did reſide in the ſame place with her, being taken with the pleaſure of the place. Three of the Boys being grown unto age, did return afterwards into <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> where they enjoyed their Fathers Kingdom; <hi>Ariſtaeus</hi> did reign in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and firſt delivered unto men the uſe of Bees, and Honey, and Milk, and Curds, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Solſtices,</hi> and the motion of the Stars: Which being underſtood, <hi>Battus</hi> (the name of the Virgin being known by the Oracle) did build the City <hi>Cyrene.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ptolomy</hi> being encreaſed with the ſtrength of this City, did make ready for war againſt

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:62253:121"/>
therefore conſtantly profeſſed, that if theſe things were a terror unto any of them, he would willingly grant him leave to depart: By which words he ſo enflamed the minds of all to adhere unto him, that of their own accord they did exhort him to the war, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that with their ſwords they would cut in pieces the Decrees of the <hi>Macedons.</hi> Being advanced with his Army into <hi>Aetolia,</hi> he commanded the Cities to pay him contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, and violently forced it from thoſe who refuſed it. Afterwards he marched unto <hi>Sardis,</hi> to <hi>Cleopatra</hi> the ſiſter of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, that by her voyce the chief Officers and Centurions might be confirmed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieving that regal Majeſty would turn all to that ſide for which ſhe ſtood.</p>
            <p>Such was the veneration of the greatneſs of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that even by the addreſſes of women, the favor of his ſacred name was implored. On his return, Letters were found diſperſed over all the Camp, in which great rewards were promiſed to thoſe who ſhould bring the Head of <hi>Eumenes</hi> to <hi>Antigonus; Eumenes</hi> having underſtood it, and called the Souldiers to an Aſſembly, did in the firſt place give thanks that there was not any found amongſt them who preferr'd the hope of a bloody reward above the Oath of his fidelity, and craftily concluded that theſe
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:62253:121"/>
Letters were contrived and ſcattered by his directions, thereby to make a trial of their reſolutions: He declared that his ſafety con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in the power of them all, and that none of the Generals would ſo overcome, as to decree that ſuch a moſt wicked act ſhould be determined againſt him. By this means he confirmed the ſtaggering reſolutions of his Souldiers for the preſent, and provided for the future, that if any ſuch thing ſhould happen again, his Souldiers might believe that it was no corruption of their Enemy, but the temptation of their General: They therefore all by throngs did offer themſelves and their endevours for the preſervation of his perſon.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Antigonus</hi> came upon them with his Army, and having encamped cloſe unto him, did on the next day ſet his Army in Array to give him battel. <hi>Eumenes</hi> alſo with great care marſhalled the Field, and made no delay of the encounter; but being overcome, he fled into a Caſtle that was fortified, where when he ſaw that he muſt undergo the fortune of a ſiege, he disbanded the greater part of his Army, leſt he ſhould be delivered to the enemy by the conſent of the multitude, or the ſiege ſhould be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by their numbers. After this, in a moſt humble manner he ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipater,</hi> who only was equal in power to <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus,</hi>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:62253:122"/>
who when he found that conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ayds were ſent unto him by <hi>Antipater,</hi> he rayſed the ſiege. <hi>Eumenes</hi> was now delivered from the fear of death, but not from the fear of danger, having before disbanded a great part of his Army. Therefore looking round about him to provide for his ſafety, it ſeemed moſt expedient to him to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the <hi>Argyraſpides</hi> of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, an invincible Army, and ſhining with the glory of ſo great and ſo many Victories.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Alexander</hi> being deceaſed, the <hi>Argy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raspides</hi> diſdained to be commanded by any, conceiving that the Militia under others would be but diſgraceful after the memory of ſo great a King. <hi>Eumenes</hi> therefore did court them with alluring words, and full of ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive reſpects, did complement with every one of them, ſometimes calling them his fellow-Souldiers, ſometimes his Patrons, ſometimes the Companions of his dangers in the great labours of the Eaſt, ſometimes his Suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the onely Refuges of his ſafety; they (he ſaid) were the onely men by whoſe valour the Eaſt was overcome, the onely men who exceeded the wars of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Hercules,</hi> by whom <hi>Alexander</hi> was made great, by whom he obtained divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and immortal glory; He beſought them to receive him, not as their General, but as
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:62253:122"/>
their fellow-Souldier, and to be admitted as a member of their body. Being on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition entertained, he not long after by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing all of them, and by gently cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting what was done amiſs amongſt them, did by degrees uſurp the Soveraignty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; nothing was done in the Camp with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, nothing could be contrived or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined without his Policy. At the laſt, when it was declared that <hi>Antigonus</hi> came againſt him with an Army, he enforced them to come down and to give him battel, where when they deſpiſed the Commands of their General, they were overcome by the valour of their Enemies. In that battel, they did not onely loſe their glory gained in ſo many wars, but their booty alſo, with their wives and children. But <hi>Eumenes,</hi> who was the Author of their overthrow, and had no other hope of ſafty, did encourage the conquer'd, affirming that they were ſuperior to their Enemies in courage; for they ſlew five thouſand of them, and if they would but continue the war, he aſſured them that the Enemy of their own accord would deſire peace of them. He enformed them that their loſſes (by which they thought themſelves overcome) were but two thouſand women, and a few children and ſlaves, which were but the luggage, &amp; the lumber of the war, and to be repaired by fighting and proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:62253:123"/>
and not by forſaking the Victory. But the <hi>Argyraspides</hi> made anſwer that they would neither fly, after the dammages of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and the loſſes of their wives, nor would they make war againſt their own children. Moreover, they did torment him with reproaches, that in their returning home after ſo many yeers of their pay dearly ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the rewards of ſo many Victories, he recalled them (being diſcharged) into new wars and battels as laſting as they were dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and had with vain promiſes deceived them, being almoſt at their journeys end in the very entrance of their Country, and the ſight of their houſhold gods, and now having loſt all the booty which they gained in their happy warfare, he would not permit them in the penury of their old age to reſt, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: Immediately upon this, their Captains not knowing of it, they ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> demanding that what they had loſt, might be reſtored to them: He promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that all things ſhould be returned, if they would deliver up <hi>Eumenes</hi> unto him; which being underſtood, <hi>Eumenes</hi> with a few men did attempt to fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

them all, ſilence being made, and his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuffs of ſteel taken off, he ſtretched forth his hand unto the people, having yet ſome other chains upon him, and ſaid: Souldiers, Behold here, the habits and the ornaments of your General, which none of the Enemies have impoſed upon me, for that would be my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not him at all, where or in what manner I ſhall fall; and I ſhall by this means be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the ignominy of death. This, if I ſhall obtain, I will diſoblige you all of the Oath, by which you have ſo often devoted your ſelves unto me; or if you are aſhamed to lay violent hands upon me, deſiring it, give me a ſword, and permit your General to do that for you without any Oath, which you have ſo often ſworn, that you would act for your General. When he could not obtain it of them, he turned his entreaties into curſes, and in a great paſſion: But you (he ſaid) O devoted Heads, may the gods, the Revengers

Being full of paſſion, he commanded his keepers to go before to the Camp of <hi>Antigonus:</hi> The Army followed, having betrayed their General, &amp; he himſelf a Captive, did bring the triumph of himſelf to the Tents of his Conqueror: They delivered all the Trophies, all the Palms and Lawrels of King <hi>Alexander,</hi> together with themſelves unto the Conqueror; and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the pomp might be wanting, their <hi>Elephants,</hi> and the Auxiliaries of the Eaſt did follow. Much more honourable was this for <hi>Antigonus,</hi> then ſo many Victories were for <hi>Alexander;</hi> for though <hi>Alexander</hi> conquered the Eaſt, <hi>Antigonus</hi> conquered thoſe by whom
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:62253:124"/>
the Eaſt was overcome. <hi>Antigonus</hi> therefore divided amongſt his Army theſe Conquerors of the World, having reſtored all things to them which he took from them in the former victory. After this, he did ſet a Guard upon <hi>Eumenes,</hi> being not admitted to come into his preſence, in reſpect of the familiarity of their former friendſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the mean time, <hi>Eurydice</hi> the wife of <hi>Aridaeus,</hi> the King of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> as ſoon as ſhe heard that <hi>Polypercon</hi> was returned out of <hi>Greece</hi> into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and that <hi>Olympias</hi> was ſens for by him, being poſſeſſed with a female emulation, and abuſing the weakneſs of her Husband, whoſe Offices ſhe challenged to her ſelf, ſhe did write to <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percon</hi> in the name of the King to deliver the Arms to <hi>Caſſander</hi> to whom the King had transferred the adminiſtration of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; ſhe ſent alſo Letters to <hi>Antigonus</hi> to the ſame effect in <hi>Aſia,</hi> by which benefit <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> being obliged, did perform all things which the boldneſs of the Queen did prompt him to; Having marched into <hi>Greece,</hi> he made war there on many Cities, by the deſtruction whereof the <hi>Spartans</hi> being affrighted, as by a fire in a neighbours houſe, diſtruſting to their arms, they did encloſe their City with a Wall, contrary to the anſwer of the Oracles, and the ancient glory of their Predeceſſors, whoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable cuſtom alwayes it was to defend it
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:62253:125"/>
with their arms and not with their Walls; So much they degenerated from their Anceſtors, that when for many yeers, the wall of their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was the vertue and the valour of their Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, they now conceived they could not be ſafe unleſs they lay h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Whiles theſe things were thus man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, the troubled Eſtate of <hi>Macedonia</hi> did call back <hi>Caſſander</hi> out of <hi>Greece;</hi> for <hi>Olympias</hi> the Mother of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, being come from <hi>Epirus</hi> towards <hi>Macedonia, Aeacidas</hi> the King of the <hi>Moloſſi</hi> following her, ſhe was forbidden by <hi>Eurydice</hi> and King <hi>Aridaeus</hi> to enter into the Confines of that Kingdom, which ſo incenſed the <hi>Macedons,</hi> both in the regard of the memory of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, the greatneſs of her Son, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity of the act, that they all ſided with <hi>Olympias,</hi> by whoſe command both <hi>Eurydice</hi> and King <hi>Aridaeus</hi> were both ſlain, having raigned ſix yeers after the deceaſe of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi> But <hi>Olympias</hi> enjoyed not the Kingdom long afterwards; for having committed many great ſlaughters of the Princes after a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſh, rather then a manly way, ſhe turned the love of her Subjects into hatred. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having heard of the approach of <hi>Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> diſtruſting to the <hi>Macedons,</hi> ſhe fled with <hi>Roxane</hi> her daughter-in-law, and <hi>Hercules</hi> her grand-child, into the City of <hi>Pictua.</hi> In her

            <p>When <hi>Caſſander</hi> was informed of it, in a ſwift match he came to <hi>Pictua,</hi> and layd a cloſe ſiege unto the City; Which when it was oppreſſed with the ſword and famine, <hi>Olympias</hi> being no longer able to endure the tediouſneſs of the ſiege, having Articles for her life, did deliver her ſelf to the Conqueror. But <hi>Caſſander</hi> having called the people to an Aſſembly to underſtand what they would have done in relation to <hi>Olympias,</hi> he ſuborned the Parents and kindred of the noble men whom ſhe had put to death, who having put on mourning habits, did accuſe the cruelty of the woman, by whom the <hi>Macedons</hi> were ſo much inſtigated, that without any reſpect to her former Majeſty, they did decree that ſhe ſhould be put to death, being altogether unmindful that by her Son and Husband, they not onely enjoyed their lives with ſafety amongſt their neighbours, but alſo became maſters of ſuch great wealth, as alſo of the Empire of the world. But <hi>Olympias,</hi> when ſhe beheld the armed men to come reſolutely towards her, being cloathed in royal habiliaments, and leaning
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62253:126"/>
on her two Maids, ſhe did go to meet them: The Executioners beholding her, were amazed, and ſtood ſtill, ſtartled at the Majeſty of her preſence, and the names of ſo many of their Kings which came at once into their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory: At the laſt, they were commanded by <hi>Caſſander</hi> to run her through with a ſword; ſhe drew not back from the ſword, nor at the thruſt that was made, nor gave any ſhrike like a woman, but ſubmitted unto death after the manner of valiant men, and for the glory of her antient family; inſomuch that you might have ſeen <hi>Alexander</hi> again in his dying mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Moreover, ſhe covered her face with her hair, and the neither parts of her body with her garments, that nothing unſeemly might be diſcovered.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Caſſender</hi> did take to wife <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonice</hi> the daughter of King <hi>Aridaeus,</hi> and ſent the Son of <hi>Alexander</hi> with the Mother to be kept priſoners in the Tower of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phipolis.</hi>

At which, when <hi>Caſſander</hi> could not be preſent by reaſon of the war with his Neighbours, he ſent <hi>Lyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi> to his ayd with a formidable power: This <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> was famous in <hi>Macedonia</hi> by the Nobility of his diſcent, but more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous by his vertue then his Nobility, which was ſo eminent in him, that in the greatneſs of his mind, in the knowledge of Philoſophy, and in the glory of ſtrength he excelled all by whom the Eaſt was overcome; For when <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great did falſely accuſe <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſthenes</hi> the Philoſopher of the Treaſon that was contriv'd againſt him, being indeed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry becauſe he did forbear to worſhip him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtome of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and had rendred him a lamentable and deformed ſpectacle by cruelty, diſmembring his body, and cutting off his noſe and lips, and carrying him ſhut up in a kennel with a Dog to be a terror to the reſt; <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> would then repair unto him, and hear and take inſtructions from him, and in compaſſion of ſo great a man, ſuffering forhis liberty, and not for any crime,

he gave him poyſon to put a period to his miſeries, to which <hi>Alexander</hi> did give ſo hainous an Interpretation, that he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be objected to a hungry and an enraged Lyon, who when at the firſt ſight with a ſwift and eager violence he did run upon him to devour him, <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> having wrapt his hand in a cloath, did thruſt it into the mouth of the beaſt, and plucked out at once both the tongue and the life of the Lyon, which when it was reported to <hi>Alexander,</hi> the admiration was turned into ſatisfaction, and alwayes afterwards he had him in an higher reſpect for the conſtancy of ſo great a vertue; and <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> with great patience indu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:62253:129"/>
impoſe it on his to binde the wound, which was an earneſt to <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> of the royal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to come; And after the death of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> when the Provinces were divided amongſt his Succeſſors, the moſt fierce of all the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nations were aſſigned to him as the moſt valiant of them all, ſo much he did exceed the reſt by the approbation of them all. But before the war was carryed on betwixt <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and his Aſſociates againſt <hi>Antigonus, Seleucus</hi> marched down from <hi>Aſia</hi> the greater, being a new Enemy unto him; famous alſo was the vertue of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and his Original admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for his mother <hi>Laodice</hi> being married to <hi>Antiochus</hi> a great Commander in the Army of <hi>Philip,</hi> did ſeem in her ſleep to have concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with child by <hi>Apollo,</hi> and to have received a Ring from him, the reward for the uſe of her body; In this Ring, there was a Gem, and an Anchor engraven on it; which ſhe dreamed ſhe was commanded at her delivery to give to her Son for a gift. This apparition was truly wonderful; for on the next day, the Ring with the Anchor engraven on it was found in the bed, and the figure of an Anchor was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently to be ſeen on the thigh of <hi>Seleucus</hi> when he was born. <hi>Seleucus</hi> going after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into the <hi>Perſian</hi> war with <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, <hi>Laodice</hi> did give that Ring unto him, having firſt taught him the original of his

act confirmd thoſe to be their friends who were before their Enemies. Amongſt many other calamities they alſo indured the heavie burthen of Tyranny; for when the common people did too impotently demand new tables and a levelling proportion to be ſhared amongſt them in the Fields of thoſe who were rich, the buſineſs being often debated in the Senate, when it could not be determined, the Senate deſired ayd of <hi>Timotheus</hi> General of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and not long after of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> General of the <hi>Thebans:</hi> but both of them refuſing it, they had recourſe to <hi>Clearchus</hi> whom they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had forced into baniſhment: So great was the neceſſity of their calamities, that they called him back to the defence of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, whom they had commanded never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto it. But <hi>Clearchus</hi> returning more wicked from his baniſhment, conceiving this diſſention of the people to be a prompt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on offered to him to exerciſe his tyranny, he had firſt a conference with <hi>Mithridates</hi> the Enemy of his Citizens, and having entred into a League, he compounded with him to be made his Lieutenant, and to betray the City to him as ſoon as he was called back into his Country. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he turned the treachery which he had prepared for the Citizens againſt <hi>Mithridates</hi> himſelf: For being returned from baniſhment, as the Arbitrator of the civil diſcord, the time
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:62253:135"/>
being appointed in which he ſhould deliver the City to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> he took him Priſoner with his friends, and having received a vaſt ſum of money for his ranſom, he delivered him being taken. And as to <hi>Mithrdates</hi> he ſuddenly made himſelf an Enemy of a friend, ſo being called back to defend the cauſe of the Senate, he immediately became the Patron of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and not only incenſed the people againſt the Authors of the power, by whom he was called back into his Country, and by whom he was placed at the helm of Government, but exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed his uſurped power in the higheſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of Cruelty and Tyranny. The people therefore being called to an Aſſembly, he declared that he would be no longer preſent nor aſſiſt the Senate in their rage againſt the people, but would take their parts if they perſevered in their former cruelty; and if they conceived themſelves to be equal in ſtrength to deal with them, he would depart with his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, nor have any hand in their civil diſcords; but if they diſtruſted in their own ſtrengths, he would not be wanting to be a Protector to in them. He deſired them therefore to ask counſel of themſelves, whether they would command him to be gone or to remain their Companion in the common cauſe. The people being excited with theſe words did transfer into his power the chief Government of all, &amp; whiles
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:62253:135"/>
they were incenſed at the power of the Senate, they delivered themſelves, their wives, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, unto the domination of a Tyrant. <hi>Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> having ſeized upon threeſcore of the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors (for the reſt were fled away) did throw them into priſon, being laden with Irons. The people rejoyced eſpecially that the Senate were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the Captain General of the Senators, and that their ayd was converted into their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and <hi>Clearchus</hi> threatned ſudden death to every one of them on purpoſe to raiſe the market of them to a higher rate. For under the pretence of withdrawing them from the fury of the people, having received from them great ſums of money, and deſpoyled them of their fortunes, he not long after did deſpoyl them of their lives; And having underſtood that war was made againſt him by thoſe Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors who fled away, the Cities prompted to compaſſion being come to their aſſiſtance, he did ſet free their Servants: and that no affliction ſhould be wanting in theſe potent Familes, he enforced their wives and their daughters to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their own Servants, death being propoſed to every one that ſhould refuſe it; by this means he thought to render the Servants more faithful to him, and more unreconcileable to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. But theſe ſad Nuptials were made more grievous by the ſudden Funerals of the Matrons; for many of them before their Nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:62253:136"/>
and ſome on the very day in which they were marryed, having firſt killed their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, did afterwards kill themſelves, and delivered themſelves from their encreaſing calamities by the vertue of an ingenious ſhame.</p>
            <p>Not long after this, the battel was fought, in which the Tyrant being Conqueror, he in the way of triumph did drag the conquered Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors before the faces of Citizens, and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the City, he bound ſome of them, he racked others, and ſlew many; there was no place free from his cruelty; inſolence was added to his ſavageneſs, and arrogance to his fury. And now by the ſucceſs of his continual felicity he did forget himſelf to be a man, and did call himſelf the Son of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> When he would be ſeen in publick, a golden Eagle was born before him in the honour of his diſcent: His body was cloathed with a garment of Purple; he did wear buskins on his feet after the cuſtom of Tragick Kings, and a Crown of Gold upon his Head: He alſo called his Son <hi>Ceraunus,</hi> that he might delude the gods not onely with lyes, but alſo with names. Two of the moſt noble of the young men, <hi>Chion</hi> and <hi>Leonides,</hi> complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at theſe things with indignation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to deliver their Country, did conſpire the death of the Tyrant. Theſe two were the Scholars of <hi>Plato</hi> the Philoſopher, who deſiring
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:62253:136"/>
to exhibite that vertue to their Country to which they daily were inſtructed by the precepts of their Maſter, they did prepare an Ambuſh of fifty of their kindred, as if they were all their Clients, and repairing themſelves to the Tower to the Kings, as two in great conteſtation, being admitted by the right of Familiarity, whiles the Tyrant intentively heard the former of them pleading his cauſe, he was killed by the other; but their friends coming in not timely enough to their aſſiſtance, they were both cut in pieces by the Guard, by which it came to paſs that the Tyrant indeed was killed, but their Country was not delivered; For <hi>Satyrus</hi> the brother of <hi>Clearchus</hi> did the ſame way invade the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and <hi>Heraclia</hi> for many yeers by degrees of ſucceſſion was poſſeſſed by Tyrants.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Uch about the ſame time there was a terrible Earthquake in the Countries of <hi>Hellespont</hi> and <hi>Cherſoneſus,</hi> in which though they trembled all over, yet the City onely of <hi>Lyſimachia</hi> erected by <hi>Lyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi> two and twenty yeers before, was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly overthrown, which portended diſmal things to come both to <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> and to his Generation, and the ruine of the Kingdom with the deſolation of the afflicted Countries round about him. Neither was belief wanting to the prodigy; for not long after, he killed
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:62253:137"/>
his Son <hi>Agathocles</hi> by poyſon, having uſed therein the aſſiſtance of his Stepmother <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrice,</hi> it being the more horribly remarkable; for (having ordained him into the ſucceſſion of the Kingdom, and made many proſperous wars under his Conduct) he now hated him not onely beyond the obligation of a Father, but beyond the Example of Humanity. This was his firſt ſtain and the beginning of his growing ruine; For this parricide was attended with the ſlaughter of the Princes, who were puniſhed to death becauſe they lamented the death of the young man. Therefore thoſe who were Commanders in his Army, did in great numbers fall away from him to <hi>Seleucus,</hi> &amp; enforced him (being prone enough before out of the emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of glory) to make war againſt <hi>Lyſimachus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the laſt conteſtation betwixt the fellow - Souldiers of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and (as it were) reſerved by Fortune to make the example of their parallel the more admirable. <hi>Lyſima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> was ſeventy and four yeers of age, and <hi>Seleucus</hi> ſeventy and ſeven: But in this old age, they had both of them the reſolutions of youth, and an inſatiable deſire to encreaſe Soveraignty of Command; for when but theſe two did ſeem as it were to be maſters of the whole world, they were ſhut up into too narrow bounds, and meaſured the end of their lives, not by the ſpace of yeers but by this limits of their Empire. In
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:62253:138"/>
that war <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> having loſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before in divers charges fifteen ſons, dying not uncouragiouſly, did diſcend into the Grave himſelf being the laſt Hearſe of all his Family: <hi>Seleucus</hi> rejoycing in ſo great a victory, and which he conceived to be greater then the victory, that he was the laſt that lived of the cohort of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and a Conquerour of the Conquerors, did vaunt of his fortune, as if it had been a work of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and above the condition of man, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant, that not long afterwards he was to be an Example himſelf of the frailty of the condition of man; for at the end of ſeven Moneths he was ſlain, being circumvented by the treachery of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> whoſe ſiſter <hi>Lyſima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> had marryed, and loſt the Kingdom of <hi>Macedonia</hi> (which he took away from <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimachus)</hi> together with his life. Therefore <hi>Ptolomy</hi> being ambitious to pleaſe the people, for the honour of the memory of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the Great, and in the favour of the revenge of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimachus,</hi> did firſt reſolve to reconcile unto him the children of <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> and deſired the marriage of <hi>Arſinoe</hi> his own ſiſter who was their Mother; having promiſed to adopt them his own Sons, thinking thereby that they would attempt nothing againſt him, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by their duty to their mother, and by their calling of him Father. He deſired alſo by letters the friendſhip of his brother the King
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:62253:138"/>
of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> profeſſing that he would forget the offence of his ſucceeding in his Fathers King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, &amp; would demand no more of him being his brother, the injury being received from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: With all his Art he flattered <hi>Eumenes</hi> and <hi>Antigonus</hi> the Sons of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> the Son of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> againſt whom he was to make war, for fear a third Enemy ſhould ariſe unto him. Neither was <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> the King of <hi>Epirus</hi> omitted, it being of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to what party he became a friend, who deſiring himſelf to maſter them all, did labour to have an intereſt in every party. Therefore having promiſed to aſſiſt the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> he deſired ſhips of <hi>Antigonus</hi> to tranſport his Army; he deſired moneys of <hi>Antiochus</hi> who was more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable both in men and money; he deſired of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the ayd of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Souldiers; <hi>Ptolomy</hi> who made no delay to gratifie him, having a numerous Army, did lend unto him for the ſpace of two yeers, and no longer, five thouſand foot, four thouſand horſe, and fifty Elephants, for which <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> having taken to marriage the daughter of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> did leave him inveſted in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But becauſe we are come to the mention of <hi>Epirus,</hi> we muſt deliver a few things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Original of that Kingdom. In that Countrey was firſt of all the Kingdom of the

               <hi>Moloſſians:</hi> Afterwards, <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> the Son of <hi>Achilles</hi> having loſt his Fathers Kingdom by his long abſence in the <hi>Trojan</hi> wars, did plant himſelf in this Country, the people being firſt called <hi>Pyrrhide,</hi> afterwards <hi>Epirotae:</hi> But <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> when he came to ask counſel in the Temple of <hi>Jupiter</hi> of <hi>Dodona,</hi> he there ſaw and by force took unto him <hi>Anaſſa</hi> the Niece of <hi>Hercules,</hi> by whom he had eight children: He marryed thoſe who were Maids to the neighboring Kings, and purchaſed to himſelf great Poſſeſſions by the ayd of affinity: and gave unto <hi>Helenus</hi> the Son of King <hi>Priamus</hi> for his ſingular knowledge in Prophecy the Kingdom of <hi>Chaonia,</hi> and <hi>Andromache</hi> the relict of <hi>Hector</hi> to wife, whom in the diviſion of the <hi>Trojan</hi> booty he took unto his own bed. Not long after he was ſlain at <hi>Delphos</hi> between the Altars of the god by the teachery of <hi>Oreſtes</hi> the Son of <hi>Agamemnon. Piales</hi> his Son ſucceeded him and by order of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion the Kingdom was devolved to <hi>Arym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> who being of a tenderage, and the onely child that remayned of that Regal Family, had Guardians aſſigned him with great care, both for his preſervation &amp; his education: And being ſent to <hi>Athens</hi> to be inſtructed there, he was ſo much the more acceptable to the people, as he was more learned then all his Predeceſſors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He firſt made Laws, and ordained a Senate and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:62253:139"/>
yearly Magiſtrats, and the form of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; and as the Country became more famous by <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> ſo it was reduced to more humanity under the Government of <hi>Arymbas.</hi> His Son was named <hi>Neoptolomus,</hi> from whom <hi>Olympias</hi> was immediately diſcended, who was the Mother of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and <hi>Alexander</hi> who after him enjoyed the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Epirus,</hi> and having made war in <hi>Italy,</hi> he was ſlain amongſt the <hi>Brutians.</hi> After his death, his brother <hi>Aeacides</hi> ſucceeded in the Kingdom, who by his daily wars againſt the <hi>Macedonians</hi> having too much wearyed and exhauſted the people, did contract the hatred of the Citizens, and being forced into baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by them, he left his Son <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> a young child of two yeers of age to ſucceed him in the Kingdom, who when he was fought for by the people to be put to death by reaſon of the hatred which they did bear unto Father, he was privately conveyed to the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to <hi>Beroe</hi> the daughter of King <hi>Glaucias</hi> to be nurſed by her, who was himſelf of the Family of the <hi>Aeacidans;</hi> The King either in the compaſſion of his fortune, or delighted with his ſportfulneſs, did not onely protect him a long time againſt <hi>Caſſander</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> although he threatned to make war againſt him for detaining of him, but alſo did adopt him into the ſucceſſion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,

Being a young man, he made many wats, and began to be ſo great in the ſucceſs thereof, that he ſeemed alone to be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the <hi>Tarentines</hi> againſt the <hi>Romans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Many of the Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> following the event of this battel, did deliver themſelves to <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus;</hi> Amongſt the reſt, the <hi>Locri</hi> having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed the <hi>Roman</hi> Garriſon did ſubmit to <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus: Pyrrhus</hi> out of the booty which he took, ſent back to <hi>Rome</hi> two hundred Souldiers whom he had taken Priſoners without any ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, that the <hi>Romans</hi> might take notice as well of his liberality as of his valour: Some time being paſſed, when the Army of the Aſſociates were drawn altogether, he joyned in battel again with the <hi>Romans,</hi> in which his fortune was the ſame as in the former.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Mago</hi> the General of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> being ſent with one hundred and twenty ſhips to bring Auxiliaries to the <hi>Romans,</hi> did addreſs himſelf to the Senate, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> did deeply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that in <hi>Italy</hi> they ſhould ſuffer the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of war from a forraign King: For which cauſe he was ſent, that the <hi>Romans</hi> being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by a forraign Enemy, they ſhould alſo be relieved by a forraign Enemy.</p>
            <p>The Senate having returned their hearty thanks to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> did ſend back their Auxiliaries. But <hi>Mago</hi> after the fine ſubtilty of the Punick wit, after a few days did repair pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> as a peace-maker from the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> to dive into his Counſels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Sicily,</hi> to which place Fame reported

that he was deſigned. And indeed, that was the cauſe why the <hi>Romans</hi> ſent back the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> ayd, leſt <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> in the war with <hi>Rome,</hi> being detained in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſhould not have the liberty to tranſport his Army and the war into <hi>Sicily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whiles theſe things were in agitation, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius Lucinus</hi> being ſent Ambaſſador from the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> did conclude a peace with <hi>Pyrrhus;</hi> to confirm which, <hi>Cyneas</hi> being ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> with great preſents from <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> found not any whoſe hand was open to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them: There was almoſt at the ſame time, another Example of the ſame continuance of the <hi>Romans;</hi> for an Ambaſsie being ſent from the Senate into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> when they had refuſed great gifts offered to them by King <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> ſome few days after being invited to a ſupper, they had Crowns of Gold ſent to them, which having received in a complement of an honour, the next day they impoſed them on the Statues of the King. <hi>Cyneas</hi> when he brought back word that the Peace with the <hi>Romans</hi> was diſturbed by <hi>Appius Claudius, Pyrrhus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him what manner of City <hi>Rome</hi> was; He made anſwer, That it ſeemed to him to be a City all of Kings.</p>
            <p>After this, the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Sicily</hi> came to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> delivering to him the command of the whole Iland, which was extreamly harraſſed
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:62253:142"/>
with the daily wars of the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Therefore having left his Son <hi>Alexander</hi> at <hi>Locri,</hi> and put ſtrong Garriſons into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he paſſed over with his Army into <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe mention hath been made of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> we will ſpeak ſomething of their original, the Genealogy of the <hi>Tyrians</hi> being to be extracted from many generations, whoſe conditions alſo were much to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The Nation of the <hi>Tyrians</hi> diſcended from the <hi>Phoenicians;</hi> who being ſhaken with an Earthquake, having abandoned their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, did firſt inhabit the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> marſh, and not long afterwards the ſhoar next unto the Sea where they builded a City and called it <hi>Sidon,</hi> from the abundance that was there of fiſhes; for the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> call a fiſh Sidon; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the proceſs of many yeers, being overcome by King <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> they took ſhipping again, and did build the City of <hi>Tyre</hi> in the yeer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the deſtruction of <hi>Troy;</hi> and being long and variouſly wearied with the wars of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> they were Conqueros at the laſt; but their Forces being exhauſted, they endured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy puniſhments by their own Servants at that time abounding in their multitudes, who having made a conſpiracy, did kill all the free people and their maſters with them; and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsing themſelves of the City, they enjoyed the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:62253:143"/>
Houſes of their Maſters, they invaded the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, they marryed wives and begat children.</p>
            <p>One amongſt ſo many thouſands of the ſlaves, being of a better diſpoſition, and prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take compaſsion on the old man his Maſter and his little Son, did not kill them with cruelty, but look'd upon them with pious pity and humanity; therefore when he had removed them out of the way, as if they had been ſlain, the ſlaves taking into conſideration the preſent condition of their Republick, they thought it expedient to have a King created out of their own Corporation, and to make choyce of him as moſt acceptable to the gods, who firſt could diſcover the riſing Sun. This deſign he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted <hi>Strato</hi> with, for ſo his Maſters name was called whom he had privately conceald: and being by him inſtructed of the place of the Randezvous, when at midnight they came all forth into one Field, the others looking towards the Eaſt, he alone did turn himſelf towards the Weſt; It appeared unto them a madneſs to look for the riſing of the Sun in the Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere of the Weſt: But when the day brake forth, and the Sun began to ſhine on the higheſt tops of all their Cities; others expecting that they ſhould in the Eaſt behold the riſing of the Sun, he ſhowed them in the Weſt the fulgor of it, where it did gild the Pinnacles of their
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:62253:143"/>
Temples. The device appeared to exceed the apprehenſion of a ſlave; and <hi>Strato</hi> being examined, he confeſſed that he had been one of their Maſters: Then they underſtood how much ingenious underſtandings were ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the ſervile, and that ſlaves may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in numbers and malice, but not in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; pardon therefore was granted to the old man and his Son; and as if they had been preſerved by Providence, they immediately created <hi>Strato</hi> their King; after whoſe death the Kingdom paſſed to his Son, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to his Grandſons. This outragious villany of the ſlaves, was everywhere report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an Example to be feared over all the World: Therefore in the proceſs of time, when <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great made war in the Eaſt, having ſacked the City of the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> he laſtned all to the Croſs who remained alive, as the Revenger of the publick ſecurity in the remembrance of this their ancient ſlaughter; But he preſerved the Family of <hi>Strato</hi> invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and reſtored the Kingdom to his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; ingenuous and innocent Inhabitants being commanded to inhabit that City, and ſo the ſervile race being utterly extirpated, a new generation of Citizens was erected. The <hi>Tyrians</hi> being thus founded by the auſpication of <hi>Alexander,</hi> did ſoon grow rich by thrift and induſtry: But before the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:62253:144"/>
committed on their Maſters, when they abounded both in wealth &amp; numbers, having ſent a Colony into <hi>Africa,</hi> they builded the City of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica:</hi> In the mean time, the King of <hi>Tyrus</hi> deceaſed, having left Heirs <hi>Pygmalion</hi> his Son, and <hi>Eliza</hi> his daughter, a Virgin of an excellent beauty; The people delivered the Kingdom to <hi>Pygmalion</hi> a boy of a very tender age. <hi>Eliza</hi> marryed her Uncle <hi>Sichaeus</hi> the Prieſt of <hi>Hercules,</hi> which was an honour next unto the King. He had great but concealed treaſures, and for fear of the King he did hide his gold, not in Houſes or Coffers, but in the Earth, which though it was unknown to men, yet Fame reveal'd it to <hi>Pygmalion,</hi> who being tranſported with an inſatiable deſire of it, and forgetting all reſpects of nature and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, did impiouſly kill his Uncle, who was alſo his brother-in-law. <hi>Eliza</hi> for a long time could not endure the preſence of <hi>Pygmalion</hi> by reaſon of the horrid murder he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; at the laſt, having diſſembled her hatred, and made more ſmooth her brow, ſhe privately attempted to fly away, and having taken into her ſociety ſome of the Princes who were equally exaſperated againſt the King, ſhe truly conceived that they had the ſame deſire to make an eſcape with her. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſhe made her deceitful addreſſes to her brother, and repreſented to him that ſhe
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:62253:144"/>
had a deſire to live in his Court, that the houſe of her Husband might no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new any ſubject of grief unto her, ſhe being deſirous to forget him, and that no longer the imagination of him might reflect ſo ſad up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her. <hi>Pygmalion</hi> did give no unwilling eare to theſe words of his ſiſter, thinking that with her the gold of <hi>Sychaeus</hi> would come along unto him. But <hi>Eliza</hi> in the dusk of the evening, did put into the ſhips not onely the goods but the ſervants of the King, who were ſent by him to attend her in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval to the Court: and being carryed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the main, ſhe commanded them to throw into the Sea ſome great bags and ſacks of ſand, which ſhe ſaid were all bags of gold, and ſo made up and corded, that by their handling they could not diſcover what the heavie burden was. Then ſhe melting into tears, did implore <hi>Sichaeus</hi> with a mournful voyce, that favourably he would receive his own wealth which he left, and take thoſe as ſacrifices to his grave which were the cauſe of his death: After this, ſhe ſent for the ſervants of the King, and declared to them, that for her part, ſhe wiſhed for death many yeers ago, but grievous and diſmal torments did hang over their own heads, who had taken to ſatisfie the avarice of the Tyrant, the wealth of <hi>Sychaeus,</hi> for the hope of which
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:62253:145"/>
the King had murdered him. Theſe words having ſhot a general fear into them, ſhe took them along with her as the companions of her flight, and on that night alſo a prepared company of Senators did unite themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, and under pretence of renewing the Sacrifices in the honour of <hi>Hercules,</hi> whoſe Prieſt <hi>Sichaeus</hi> was, they ſought new habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by a wilful baniſhment. Sayling along the Coaſt, they were firſt driven into the Ile of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where the Prieſt of <hi>Jupiter</hi> by the admonition of the god, did offer himſelf a companion to <hi>Eliza,</hi> with his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to be a partaker of her fortune, having agreed with her to have for himſelf and his poſterity the perpetual honor of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. The condition was taken for a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt token of a good fortune to come. It was the cuſtom of the <hi>Cyprians</hi> to ſend their Virgins on ſet days before their marriage to the Sea-ſhore, to provide themſelves a Dowry by the uſe of their bodies, and to offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice afterwards to <hi>Venus</hi> for the reſt of their chaſtity: <hi>Eliza</hi> commanded that four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore of the youngeſt of them ſhould be taken away and carryed to her ſhips, that ſo both the young men ſhe took with her might enjoy wives, and her City grew numerous by Poſterity.</p>

The Ambaſſadors alſo of the <hi>

            <p>The <hi>Africans</hi> alſo had a great deſire to entertain theſe new Inhabitants; therefore <hi>Carthage</hi> was builded by the general conſent of all the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> paying a yeerly Tribute for the ground on which the City was build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: In the firſt foundations of the City, there was found the head of a Bullock, which was the token indeed of a fruitful Earth, but of a labourious and a ſervile City; wherefore they tranſlated the City into another place; There the head of an horſe, (portending that they ſhould be a wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Nations coming in throngs to give their judgement on this new City, in a ſhort time, both the people and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were greatly enlarged. The affairs of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> flouriſhing thus in continual ſucceſs, <hi>Hiarbas</hi> King of the <hi>Mauritanians</hi> having ſent ten of his Princes to them, he demanded <hi>Eliza</hi> for wife, and threatned to make war upon them if they ſhould deny him: The Ambaſſadors fearing to declare their Meſſage to the Queen, they dealed with her according to the capritiouſneſs of the Punick apprehenſion, and expreſſed to her that the

Being circumvented by this deceit, having with many tears and great lamentation invoked the name of <hi>Sichaeus,</hi> ſhe at laſt made anſwer, That ſhe would go whether her own ſtubborn fortunes and the deſtinies of her City did call her. For which having taken the ſpace of three Monthes, ſhe at the end thereof, erected a huge pile of wood in the Suburbs of her City, and as ſhe would appeaſe the ghoſt of her Husband, ſhe ſlew many ſacrifices; and having a drawn ſword in her had, ſhe did aſcend the funeral pile, and looking back on her people, ſhe told them that ſhe would go to her Husband accordingly as he had enjoined her, and ended her life with the ſword: As long as <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> was unconquered, ſhe was afterwards
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:62253:147"/>
honoured for a Goddeſs. This City was builded before <hi>Rome</hi> threeſcore and twelve yeers, and as it was famous for war, ſo the ſtate thereof at home was troubled with much contention. When amongſt many other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, they were afflicted alſo with the plague, they uſed the Religion of a moſt bloody devotion, &amp; an abhomination for their remedy, for they offered men in Sacrifice, and laid their children on their bloody Altars, whoſe Infancy would have provoked their Enemies to compaſſion, and with their blood they deſired peace of the gods, for whoſe life the gods were accuſtomed by other Nations to be devoutly importuned. The gods therefore being averſe to ſo horrid an impiety, when a long time they had fought unfortunately in <hi>Sicily,</hi> the war being tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into <hi>Sardina,</hi> they were overthrown in a great battel, having loſt the beſt part of their Army, for which they commanded <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> (under whoſe conduct they had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued a part of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and performed great atchievements againſt the <hi>Africans)</hi> to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the part of the Army which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained: Which the Souldiers took ſo heavily, that they ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> who in the firſt place were to deſire the liberty to return into their Country, and a pardon for their unhappy warfare, and if not,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:62253:147"/>
to declare unto them, That if they could not obtain it by entreaties, they would command it by arms. When the threatnings as well as the Petitions of the Ambaſſadors were deſpiſed, they not long after having embarked themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did advance in arms unto the City. There having called both the gods and men to witneſs, that they came not to ruine, but to be reſtored to their Country, and to manifeſt to the Citizens, that in the managing of the former war, they wanted not valour, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, having beſieged the City, and cut off all proviſions from coming to it, they brought the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to the loweſt deſperation. In the mean time, <hi>Cartalo</hi> the Son of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed <hi>Machaeus,</hi> when he was ſent for by his Father, as he paſſed by the Leaguer in his return from <hi>Tyre</hi> (to which place he was ſent by the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to carry the Tenths to <hi>Hercules</hi> out of the <hi>Sicilian</hi> prey, which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther took) he returned anſwer, That he would firſt diſcharge the obligations of publick Religion before the duties of private piety; This anſwer, although it much troubled his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet he durſt not offer any violence to Religion; Not long after, the people having made <hi>Cartalo</hi> their Agent, to deſire that <hi>Machaeus</hi> would ſuffer proviſions to be brought with ſafety to the City, when he came unto his Father, being cloathed in purple

and the fillets of the Prieſthood hanging down from his Miter, his Father calling him aſide did ſpeak unto him; And how dareſt thou, wretch as thou art, to approach into the preſence of ſo many miſerable Citizens cloathed in that purple &amp; gliſtering with gold! How dareſt thou, as it were in triumph to enter into our ſad mournful Tents, in ſuch a ſlowing habit and ornaments of quiet fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity!

Not many daies ſince being ſent for by me, thou didſt not onely proudly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe (I will not ſay) thy Father, but I am confident, the General of thy own Citizens; And what ſheweſt thou more in that purple, and thoſe Crowns, then the titles of my Victories? Since therefore, thou wilt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge nothing of a Father, but the title onely of a baniſhed man, I am reſolved to ſhew my ſelf not like a Father but a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and I will make thee an Example that none hereafter ſhall be ſo bold as to ſcorn the unhappy miſeries of his Father; having ſaid this, he commanded him to be faſtned to a moſt high Croſs, in his gorgeous habiliments in the ſight of the whole City. Some few days

afterwards he ſurprized <hi>Carthage,</hi> and having called forth the people to an Aſſembly, he complained of the injury of his baniſhment, he excuſed the neceſſity of the war, he forgave the contempt of his former Victories, &amp; having puniſhed the chief Authors of the injurious ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the miſerable Citizens, he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned all the reſt; And having put to death ten of the Senators, he reſtored the City to her former Laws.

fought alſo againſt the <hi>Africans,</hi> demanding the Tribute for the ground of their City, the payment whereof for many yeers was neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: But as the cauſe of the <hi>Africans</hi> was more juſt, ſo their fortune was better; And the war was concluded with them not by Arms, but with the payment of the moneys: And <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> being grievouſly wounded, dyed in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> having delivered up the Government to his brother <hi>Amilcar:</hi> The general lamentation in the City, and his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Dictatorſhips, and four Triumphs, did make his death the more remarkable. The courage alſo of the Enemy did encreaſe, as if the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had loſt their Army with their Captain; The people therefore of <hi>Sicilia</hi> having addreſſed themſelves to <hi>Leonidas</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the King of the <hi>Spartans</hi> (by reaſon of the daily injuries committed by the <hi>Carthani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians)</hi> the war between them continued long with various ſucceſs. Whiles theſe things were in action, Ambaſſadors came to <hi>Carthage</hi> from <hi>Darius</hi> King of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> bringing an Edict with them, in which the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were forbidden to ſacrifice men upon their Altars, as alſo to eat the fleſh of dogs, they were alſo commanded to burn, and not to bury in the ground the bodies of the dead; they deſired alſo ayd of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> againſt the <hi>Grecians,</hi> on whom <hi>Darius</hi> was

reſolved to make war. But the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> refuſing to ſend Auxiliaries by reaſon of the daily wars with their Neighbors, did readily obey him in the reſt, leſt that they might ſeem to be obſtinate altogether. <hi>Amilcar</hi> in the mean time was killed in the <hi>Sicilian</hi> war, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left behind him three Sons, <hi>Hamilco, Hanno,</hi> and <hi>Giſco.

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:62253:150"/>
his Army by the rage of a peſtilential Planet. Which when it was reported at <hi>Carthage,</hi> the City was ſo full of ſorrow and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as if it had been taken it ſelf: The ſhops and houſes were ſhut up; ſo were the Temples of the gods; no publick duties of religion were performed, and all Offices intermitted which belonged to the adminiſtration of juſtice. They all ſlocked in throngs to the Haven, and asked thoſe few who came out of the ſhips (who eſcaped the fury of the mortality) how their Sons and kinſmen did; and when they were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of their deaths, of which before they were uncertain, and were in ſome hopes that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports were falſe, they filled all the ſhoar with their lamentations; nothing was heard but ſighes and throbs, and the ſad complaints of the unhappy Parents. In the mean time, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed General <hi>Amilco</hi> came down out of his own ſhip, raggedly cloathed, and in the habit of a ſervant; the multitudes of the mourners preſſed round about him to behold him; And he amongſt the reſt lifting up his hands to Heaven, ſometimes bewailed his own, and ſometimes the publick fortune; ſometime he accuſed the gods who took from them ſo many Ornaments and Trophies of the war, and of the victories which they had given them, and had deſtroyed the victorious Army, not by war but peſtilence, ſo many Cities being taken,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:62253:151"/>
and the Enemies ſo often overcome in the battels both by Sea and Land; Howſoever, he ſaid, he brought ſome comfort to the Citizens, that the Enemies though they might rejoyce, yet they could not glory in their calamity, for they could neither ſay, that thoſe who were dead were killed, or that thoſe who returned, were routed by them. The booty he ſaid, which the Enemy found in their abandoned Tents, was not ſuch as they could boaſt to be the ſpoyls of a conquered Enemy, but ſuch as by the caſual deaths of their Maſters, they had ſeized upon, being poor and tranſitory things, which no body was left to own; &amp; that in relation to their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they departed Conquerors, but in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the plagues, they departed conquered: Howſoever, he affirmed that he took nothing more neer unto his heart, then that he could not die himſelf amongſt ſo many moſt valiant men, and was preſerved not for any delight which he took in life, but onely to be the ſport of calamity; yet nevertheleſs, having brought the miſerable relicks of his Army to <hi>Carthage,</hi> he would follow alſo himſelf his deceaſed Souldiers, and would make it apparent to his Country, that he did not continue to that day, becauſe he had a minde to live, but that he would not by his death, betray theſe whom the direful peſtilence had ſpared, by leaving them amongſt the Armies of their Enemies.

With this Reſolution and complaint, having entred the City, as he came to the threſhold of his own door, he diſmiſſed the multitude that followed him with his laſt Farewel unto them, and having locked the door, with his ſword he put a period to his own life, not admitting any, not ſo much as his own Sons to come unto him.</p>

riot by his example, to the uſe of temperance and frugality. He daily extolled vertue, and cryed down the vices of luxury, and did num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to them how many Cities were deſtroyed by this devouring ſin; and at laſt he was ſo much followed by the multitude, that what was thought almoſt incredible, even ſome of the moſt riotous of thoſe people were converted into the manners and principles of the moſt thrifty of men. He had ſeveral Schools and ſeveral Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditories, and diſtinctly taught the Matrons from the men, &amp; the children from their Parents: He taught the Matrons chaſtity, and obſequiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards theit husbands; and he taught their husbands temperance, and to be lovers of Learning. He alwayes prompted both unto frugality, as if it were the mother of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and by his daily diſputation he ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed that the Matrons did leave off their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of gold, and other ornaments of their dignity, as the inſtruments of luxury; and theſe ornaments being brought them into the Temple of <hi>Juno,</hi> they were by theſe Matrons conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the goddeſs her ſelf, profeſſing that the beſt ornaments of Matrons was chaſtity and not gorgeous apparrel: How much alſo he prevailed by conqueſt on the young men, the conquered ſpirits of the contumacious women <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:62253:155"/>
through the Intereſt of their ſociety, did like Separatiſts ſegregate themſelves from the reſt of their Citizens, being ſuſpected to hold a clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine Conſpirary, they exaſperated the Citizens againſt them, who would have burned them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together being convened in one houſe. In this tumult there periſhed about threeſcore of them; the reſt were condemned to baniſhment. <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> having lived twenty years at <hi>Crotona,</hi> did remove himſelf to <hi>Metapontum,</hi> in which City he dyed; they had there ſo great an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of him, that they made of his houſe a Temple, and did worſhip him as a god.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Tyrant having (as before we mentioned) tranſported his Army out of <hi>Sicily</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> and made war upon the <hi>Grecians</hi> who there inhabited, he overcame the <hi>Locrians,</hi> and did aſſault the <hi>Crotonians</hi> through a long reſpite ſcarce reſuming new ſtrength, ſo great was their overthrow of their former war; they now more valiantly reſiſted with a few men the powerful Army of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> then heretofore with many thouſands they reſiſted the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of the <hi>Locrenſians:</hi> So much vertue hath poverty againſt inſolent riches, and ſometimes ſo much more certain is a diſpaired then a preſumed Victory.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Ambaſſadors of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who not many Moneths before had burned <hi>Rome,</hi> did addreſs themſelves to <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:62253:156"/>
making wars in <hi>Italy,</hi> and deſired a league and friendſhip of him, they affirmed that their Nation was now ſeated between his Enemies, and would be of great concernment to him, both to attend him in the Van<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to defend him if his Enemies ſhould take the advantage to preſs upon him in the Rear.</p>
            <p>This Embaſſie was acceptable to <hi>Dionyſius;</hi> wherefore having entred into a league with them, and re-inforced his Army with Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries from them, he did begin the war again. The cauſe which brought theſe <hi>Gauls</hi> to ſeek new habitations in <hi>Italy,</hi> was civil diſcord and daily diſſentions at home, being weary with the tediouſneſs whereof, when they came in multitudes into <hi>Italy,</hi> they did drive the <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> from their poſſeſſions, and builded <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, Comum, Brixia, Verona, Bergomum, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentum,</hi> and <hi>Vincentia.</hi> The <hi>Tuſcans</hi> at the ſame time under the command of <hi>Rhetus,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt their ancient habitations, did poſſeſs themſelves of the Alpes, and called the Country which they commanded <hi>Rhetia,</hi> after the name of their Commander.</p>
            <p>Not long afterwards, <hi>Dionyſius</hi> was called back into <hi>Sicily</hi> by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who having recovered themſelves by the aggregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of new Forces, did begin the war again which they had abandoned by reaſon of the Peſtilence. <hi>Hanno</hi> was choſen General of the

war, whoſe Enemy <hi>Suniator</hi> the moſt powerful at that time of all the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> when in hatred to him he had frequently in the Greek Tongue acquainted <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of the approch of the Army, and of the temper and ſloath of the General, the letters being intercepted, he was accuſed of Treaſon, and condemned for it, and an Act was paſſed by the Senate, that no <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> ſhould afterwards either ſpeak or write in the Greek Tongue, that they might hold no diſcourſe, nor write unto the Enemy without an Interpreter: Not long after <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> whom neither <hi>Sicily</hi> nor <hi>Italy</hi> could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, being overcome and wearyed out with the daily encounters in the war, was ſlain by the treachery of his own Souldiers.</p>

But <hi>Dionyſius</hi> in the beginning of his raign had a deſire to take away his Uncles as thoſe who would be partakers with him in his Kingdom, and be the perſwaders of his brothers to have
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:62253:157"/>
it divided amongſt them. And the better to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble his deſign, he thought it requiſite in the firſt place to aſſure himſelf of the good opinion of the people, being more excuſedly to perform what he had determined, if he ſtood faſt in the approbation of them all. He delivered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of priſon three thouſand that lay there in chains together, and for three years diſmiſſed the payment of all tributes, and by all Artifices ſollicited the affections of all men to him.</p>
            <p>Then reſolving to put in practice his contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved villany, he put to the ſword not onely the kinſmen of his brothers, but even his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers themſelves, beginning his tyranny firſt in his own Family before he exerciſed it in others, and left not ſo much as the ſpirit of fraternal conſortment to thoſe to whom he owed a conſortment in his Kingdom. His emulators being thus taken away, and falling into ſloth, he became unweildy in his body by too much riot, and contracted ſo great a weakeneſs in his eyes, that he could not endure the Sun or Duſt, or any ſplendor of light: By reaſon of which, believing that he began to become deſpicable, he committed outragious cruelties, and filled not as his Father the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with enchained Citizens, but filled the City with the murthers of them, by which he grew both contemptible and hateful unto all.
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:62253:158"/>
Therefore when the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined war againſt him, he was in a great ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence whether he ſhould lay down his royal Authority, or make reſiſtance in war againſt them; but his Souldiers propounding to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a great booty, and the plundering of the City, he was enforced by them to try it out in battel with them. Being overcome, when not long after he had the ſame ill fortune in the fight again, he ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Syracuſae,</hi> promiſing to lay down his tyranny, if they would ſend ſome to him to agree upon Articles for a peace.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Syracuſians</hi> ſending ſome of the moſt eminent in their City to him, he commanded them to priſon, and brought his Army to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw their City, which at that preſent feared no aſſault, nor the approach of any Enemy at all: The fight was a long time doubtful in the City, but the Citizens overcoming with their multitudes, <hi>Dionyſius</hi> was routed and beaten out of it. And fearing to be beſieged in the Tower, he fled privately into <hi>Italy</hi> with all his Princely furniture: Being there as a baniſhed man, he was received by the <hi>Locren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> who were in friendſhip with him, and he poſſeſſed himſelf of their Tower, where he exerciſed his accuſtomed cruelties: He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the wives of the chiefeſt of the City to be defloured; He took away the Virgins
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:62253:158"/>
by force, and having raviſhed them, he returned them to thoſe who were to eſpouſe them: The moſt wealthy of all the City he commanded to be expelled, or to be ſlain, and did confiſcate their goods; And when there was not the leſt occaſion for any further rapine, he circumven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the whole City by this ſtudied project. When the <hi>Locrenſians</hi> were oppreſſed by the war of <hi>Leophron</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Rhegium,</hi> they vowed if they were Conquerors, they would proſtitute their Virgins on a day dedicated to <hi>Venus.</hi> This vow being unperformed, when they made unfortunate wars againſt the <hi>Luca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Dionyſius</hi> called them to a publick Aſſembly, and did exhort them to ſend their wives and daughters into the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> dreſſed in the richeſt cloathes they could put on, and that one hundred of them, choſen by lot, might perform the publick vow, and that for Religions ſake, they might ſtand one whole Moneth in the open Stews, all men having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taken an Oath not to defile any of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that the Virgins might not be deceived, performing the Vows of the City, he ordained that not a Maid ſhould be marryed until huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands were firſt provided for them: This counſel being approved, in which proviſion was made both for the ſuperſtition and the chaſtity of the Virgins, the women adorned in the moſt ſumptuous manner did come in
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:62253:159"/>
throngs to the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> every one of whom <hi>Dionyſius</hi> deſpoyled, having ſent in Souldiers to the Temple, and converted the Ornaments of the Matrons into his own Wardrope. He killed alſo ſome of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands of the richeſt of them: and ſome women he tormented to betray their Husbands wealth; when by theſe arts he raigned ſix years, being driven from the City by the Confederacy of the Citizens, he returned into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and after a long peace, all men being ſecure, he became Maſter of <hi>Syracuſae</hi> by treachery.</p>
            <p>Whiles theſe things were thus mannaged in <hi>Sicily, Hanno</hi> the General of the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi> employed his own treaſure, in which he exceeded the bank of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, to become abſolute Soveraign of all, and attempted having firſt killed the Senate, to uſurpe the Kingdom. For the acting of this wickedneſs, he ſet apart a ſolemn day for the marriage of his Daughter, that by the religion of his Vows, he might both the better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and conceal his abominable deſign. He prepared a Feaſt for the people in the publick places, and for the Senate in his own houſe, that with Cups infected with poyſon, he might more ſecretly and without any witneſſes deſtroy them, and the more eaſily invade the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth deprived of her Magiſtrates. This being betrayed to the Senators by his ſervants,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:62253:159"/>
the wicked plot was declined but not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged, leaſt in a man ſo powerful the plot ſhould prove more prejudicial being known then concealed. Being therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a decree to put a meaſure to the charges of marriages, they commanded it not to be obſerved by one or ſome few, bur by all in general, that the perſon might not ſeem to be pointed at, but the vice corrected. Being prevented by this Counſel, he again incited the ſlaves to a Rebellion; and having appointed another day for the ſlaughter of the Senators, when he found that he was the ſecond time prevented, fearing to be call'd into judgement, he poſſeſſed himſelf of a fortified Caſtle having armed twenty thouſand ſlaves.</p>
            <p>There whiles he incited the <hi>Africans</hi> and the King of <hi>Mauritania</hi> to make war on the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> he was taken, and being ſcourged with rods, his eyes pulled out, and his hands and legs broken, that a due puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be exacted of every one of his members, he was put to death in the ſight of the people, and his body torn with rods, was faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on a Croſs.

            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Dionyſius</hi> being received

by the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> when he grew every day more grievous and cruel to the City, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by a new conſpiracy, and having at laſt layd down both his Tyranny and his Army, he delivered the Tower to the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> and taking with him ſome neceſſaries for a private fortune, he betook himſelf to a baniſhed life in <hi>Carinth,</hi> and there conceiving things moſt humble to be moſt ſafe, he deſcended into a moſt ſordid condition of life, for being not contented to foot it up and down in publick, but to drink alſo, and not onely to be ſeen in Taverns and Houſes of wantonneſs, but to continue in them many dayes together, he would quarrel with the vileſt ſcum upon the baſeſt ſubject, and be ſeen all in rags and ſquallid, and rather give an occaſion of laughter to others then receive it from them; he would ſtand in the Shambles and devour with his eyes what he was not able to buy; he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Bawds and Whores before the <hi>Aedils,</hi> and do all things in ſuch an importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate rudeneſs, that he ſeemed rather to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed then to be feared. At laſt, he profeſſed himſelf to be a School-maſter, and taught chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in open places, that he might either be ſeen alwayes in publick by thoſe that feared him, or more readily be deſpiſed by thoſe that feared him not. And although he abounded with the vices of a Tyrant, yet this diſſembling of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:62253:160"/>
his vices was not by nature, but by art he counterfeited to have loſt all royal ſhame, being not ignorant how hateful was the very name of Tyrants without their revenews. He endeavoured alſo to take away the envie of things paſt by the contempt of things preſent, and made uſe not of honeſt, but of ſafe counſel. Nevertheleſs, amongſt thoſe arts of his diſſimulation, he was thrice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed to affect the Tyranny again, and his beſt protection was the deſpicableneſs of his perſon and his fortunes.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> being amazed at the great ſucceſs of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, fearing that he would add <hi>Africa</hi> to the Empire of <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſent <hi>Amilcar,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Rhodanus</hi> (a man famous above the reſt for eloquence and policy) to diſcover his intents: Their fear was encreaſed by the taking of the City of <hi>Tyre,</hi> the mother to their City, and by the building of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> a City emulous of <hi>Carthage</hi> on the bounds of <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and by the perpetual felicity of the King, whoſe deſires and whoſe fortune could not any wayes be bounded: <hi>Amilcar</hi> having obtained acceſs to the King by the means of <hi>Parmenio,</hi> he diſſembled to the King that he fled unto him, being bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from his own Country, and offered himſelf to ſerve him in his expedition againſt

it. And having dived into his Counſels, he wrote all things to the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in woodden Tables, the Letters being covered with wax. Howſoever, after the death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> did put him to death, being returned into his own Country, not onely by an ungrateful but with a cruel ſentence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alledging that he would have betrayed their City unto <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great.</p>

He was born in <hi>Sicily,</hi> his Father was a Potter; nor had he a more honeſt childhood then he had Original; for being admirable in beauty, and the linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his body, he a long time lived by the paſſive proſtitution of his body: And being come to ſixteen yeers of age, he transferred his luſt from men to women. Afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:62253:162"/>
infamous with both Sexes, he changed his courſe of life, and committed Robberies. In proceſs of time he travelled to <hi>Syracuſae,</hi> and was ſent for into the City by the Inhabitants, where he lived a long time without reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for he had nothing more in fortune to loſe, nor in chaſtity to defile. Being at laſt an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Souldier, he was as prone to any villany by a ſeditious, as he was before by a diſſolute life. He was reſolute and active, and very eloquent in diſcourſe. In a ſhort time he was made a Centurion &amp; not long afterwards Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune of the Souldiers. In the firſt war againſt the <hi>Aetnaeans,</hi> he ſhewed the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent demonſtrations of his Chivalty. In the following war againſt the <hi>Campanions,</hi> the opinion which all had of him was ſo great, that he was choſen General in the place of <hi>Damaſcen</hi> deceaſed, whoſe wife (having known her firſt by adultery) he did take unto him in marriage after the death of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. And being not contented that of a poor man he ſuddenly grew rich, he at laſt turned Pyrat againſt his own Country: It was his ſafety, that his Companions being taken, and tormented, denyed that he had any any intereſt amongſt them. Twice he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to poſſeſs himſelf of <hi>Syracuſae,</hi> and twice he was driven into baniſhment for it. In the hatred to the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> he was made

firſt <hi>Praetor,</hi> and afterwards General by the <hi>Murgantins,</hi> amongſt whom he did lead a baniſhed life: In that war he took the City of the <hi>Leontins,</hi> and began to beſiege the City of <hi>Syracuſae,</hi> to the defence whereof when <hi>Amilcar</hi> General of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> was deſired to march, having laid aſide all hoſtile hatred, he ſent conſiderable Forces to relieve it. In one and the ſame time, the City of <hi>Syracuſae</hi> was defended by her Enemies in a civil love, and was beſieged by her Citizens in a civil hatred; But <hi>Agathocles</hi> when he perceived that the City was more gallantly defended then beleagured, did by his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers Petition to <hi>Amilcar,</hi> that he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the arbitration for a peace betwixt him and the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> promiſing on his part the aſſured peculiar return of all good Offices that he could expect. <hi>Amilcar</hi> being poſſeſſed with this hope, did enter into a league with him, being induced to it by the fear of his power, conſidering that what ſtrength by this confederacy he gave to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathocles</hi> againſt the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as much to himſelf for the enlargement of his private fortunes. Therefore Peace was not onely made with <hi>Agathocles,</hi> but he was alſo made <hi>Praetor</hi> of <hi>Syracuſae:</hi> After this tapers of wax, being brought forth and lighted, he did ſwear to <hi>Amilcar</hi> to be careful

upon all occaſions to advance the Intereſts of <hi>Carthage.</hi> Having then received of him a Garriſon of five thouſand <hi>Africans,</hi> he killed all thoſe of greateſt power in the City; and intending as it were to form a new Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Common-wealth, he commanded the people to be called forth into the Theater, the Senate being diſpoſed of into another place, as if he would conſult with them concerning ſomething before hand; and thus having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his affairs, and brought in the Souldiers, he beſieged the people, and put the Senators to the ſword; and having finiſhed the ſlaughter of them, he killed thoſe that were moſt rich, and moſt forward of the people.

nor any wayes prepared to endure the fury of the ſiege, and withal (by reaſon of his cruelty and other offences) that he was forſaken of his Confederates, he reſolved to carry the war into <hi>Africa.</hi> A wonderful boldneſs it was, that he who was inferior to his Enemy in his own Land and Cities, ſhould tranſlate the war into their Countrey, and advance to encounter with them abroad, being not able at home to deſend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that being overcome he ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult over the Conquerors. The ſilence of this counſel was no leſs admirable then was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign he undertook<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> profeſſing onely to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that he had found them out a way to victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: He deſired them that they would arm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a reſolution patiently for a while to indure the difficulties of the ſiege; or if the condition of their preſent fortune was grievous to any of them, he gave them free leave to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part where they pleaſed; when one thouſand and ſix hundred of them did go away, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the reſt with corn and money for the neceſſity of the ſiege; he onely took with him fifty Talents for his preſent uſe, being to provide himſelf with other things rather from his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my then his Companions; Having then gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted freedom to all the ſervants that were of age to bear arms, he did oblige them by Oath to be faithful to him, and afterwards ſhipped them and the greateſt part of his Army; and
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:62253:164"/>
having made equal the condition both of bond and free, he conceived that there would be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them a mutual emulation of vertue. All the reſt were left for the defence of his Country.</p>
            <p>In the ſeventh year of his raign (none of his Souldiers knowing whether they were to be tranſported) he directed his courſe to <hi>Africa,</hi> taking with him his two Sons, who were then of age, <hi>Archagathus</hi> and <hi>Heraclidas;</hi> when they all believed that they were imbraked ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to plunder <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Sardinia,</hi> having land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them on the ſhore of <hi>Africa,</hi> he declared his deſign unto them, and enformed them in what condition <hi>Syracuſae</hi> was, to whom there was no other help remaining then to do unto their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies what they ſuffered themſelves. The war, he ſaid, was managed otherwiſe at home then it was abroad; Thoſe were onely the ayds at home, which the ſtrength and Forces of the Country did adminiſter: but abroad the Enemy was often overcome with his own ſtrength, their aſſociates revolting from them, and in the hatred of continued Soveraignty look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after innovation and forraign ayds. To this he added that the Cities and Caſtles of <hi>Africa</hi> were not encompaſſed with Walls not builded on the tops of Hills, but lay open in the Champain without any defence, and theſe might eaſily be brought to joyn in ſociety with him to prevent their utter ruine. The war, he
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:62253:165"/>
ſaid, would be more grievous to the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi> it ſelf then in <hi>Sicily,</hi> where they would all joyn their Forces together againſt one City more famous by her name then her by ſtrength; and what ſtrength he brought not with him, he would take it there. Neither would the ſudden fear of the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> be of a ſmall moment to the victory, who undoubtedly would tremble, amazed at the gallant confidence of their Enemies; And this terror of theirs would be encreaſed by the firing of their Towns, and the plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their Caſtles and contumacious Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and by the ſpoyls of <hi>Carthage</hi> it ſelf: By all which they ſhould perceive, that war not onely lay open to them againſt others, but to others alſo againſt them; and by this means that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> might not only be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, but <hi>Sicily</hi> be delivered from the burthen of their Forces; for the Enemies would never continue in the beſieging of <hi>Syracuſae,</hi> when they were put ſo hard to it at home. The war he alledged, could never be carryed on more eaſily, nor the booty be more abundant; for <hi>Carthage</hi> being taken, all <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> would be the reward of the Conquerors; Moreover, the glory of this honourable war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare was ſo great, that it would continue through all Ages, and be determined by no meaſure of time, it being recorded that they
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:62253:165"/>
were the onely men in the world, who tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated to their Enemies the wars which they could not themſelves ſuſtain at home, and of their own accord followed the Conquerors, and beſieged the beſiegers of their own City: He concluded that the war therefore was to be carryed on by them all with a gallant &amp; joyful reſolution, there being no reward more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant for the Conquerors, nor any monument more honourable for the conquered. By theſe exhortations the courages of the Souldiers were erected; but they were amazed again at the portent they beheld, which was that being under Sayl the Sun was ecclipſed; of which the King gave an account with no leſs care then was his preparation for the war, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that if it had hapned before they had ſet forth, it might be believed that it perſaged loſs unto them, but it coming to paſs after they had lanched forth, it did por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ill to thoſe againſt whom they did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. Moreover, that the natural defect of the Stars did alwayes perſage ſome preſent change of State, and it was moſt certain that the condition of <hi>Carthage</hi> being then in their height of flouriſh, there was a change per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaged by it, and calamity to come.</p>
            <p>The Souldiers being thus comforted, he commanded all the ſhips to be burned, that they might all underſtand that the means of
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:62253:166"/>
their flight being taken away, they muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther overcome or fall by the ſword. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards having born down all before them whereſoever they did march, and ſet on fire the Towns and Caſtles, <hi>Hanno</hi> General of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> did advance to give them battel with an Army of thirty thouſand men: The battel being fought, two thouſand of the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> and three thouſand of the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> were ſlain with the General himſelf; with this Victory the courages of the <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> were erected, and the ſpirits of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> fainted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agathocles,</hi> his Enemies being overcome, did ſack and raze their Towns and Caſtles, driving away great booties, and killing many thouſands of his Enemies. He afterwards pitched his Tents within five miles of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> that they themſelves from the Walls of their Cities might behold the loſs of thoſe things which were moſt pretious to them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the waſting of their Fields, and the burning of their Towns. In the mean time the great Fame over all <hi>Africa</hi> of the Army of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> being overthrown, and of the taking of their Cities being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged, a ſudden wonder and amazement did invade them from whence ſhould ariſe ſo great an overthrow in ſo potent an Eſtate, eſpecially ftom an Enemy overcome: And
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:62253:166"/>
not long after, not onely all <hi>Africa,</hi> but the moſt noble of the Cities having followed the novelty, did revolt to <hi>Agathocles,</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the Conqueror both with corn and money.</p>
            <p>To this calamity of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> the news of their Army in <hi>Sicily</hi> overthrown with their General, did arrive to make up the height of their affliction: For after the deparure of <hi>Agathocles</hi> out of <hi>Sicily,</hi> the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> being become the more ſecure in their Leagure before <hi>Syracuſae</hi> were utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly routed, and cut in pieces by <hi>Antander</hi> the brother of <hi>Agathocles:</hi> Therefore when the fortune of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> was the ſame both at home and abroad, not onely their tributary Cities, but the Kings who were their Confederates revolted from them, weighing the intereſts of friendſhip not by fidelity but ſucceſs: Amongſt others, <hi>Offellas</hi> King of the <hi>Cyrene,</hi> who entertained a vain hope to be maſter of all <hi>Africa</hi> did by his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors enter into a League with <hi>Agathocles,</hi> and accorded with him, that the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> being overcome, the one ſhould obtain the command of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the other of <hi>Africa:</hi> Therefore <hi>Offellas</hi> came with a formidable Army into the ſociety of the war; having often dined together, <hi>Agathocles</hi> who alwayes entertained him with humble
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:62253:167"/>
ſubmiſſions and flattering complements, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Offella</hi> had adopted his eldeſt Son to ſucceed him in the Kingdom, did at the laſt kill him, and having poſſeſſed himſelf of his Army, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> renewing the war with all their might, were overcome again in a great battel, not without much effuſion of blood on both ſides. By this overthrow the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were brought to ſo great a deſperation, that (if there had not been an inſurrection in the Army of <hi>Agathocles) Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar</hi> who was General of the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> had revolted to him with the remainder of his Army: For which offence he was faſtned to a Croſs in the middle of the Market-place, to make the ſame place the monument of his puniſhment which before was famous for the Inſtallation of his honours. But <hi>Bomilcar</hi> with ſo great reſolution endured this cruelty of the Citizens, that he declaimed againſt the wickedneſs of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> from the height of the Croſs, as from the height of a judgement-ſeat: Sometimes he objected how <hi>Hanno</hi> was circumvented by them with falſe accuſation that he aſpired to the Kingdom; ſometimes he did call into their memory the baniſhment of innocent <hi>Giſco;</hi> ſometimes the ſilent ſuffrages againſt his Uncle <hi>Amilcar;</hi> ſometimes he alledged the nature of his own offence, which was that he had rather make
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:62253:167"/>
               <hi>Agathocles</hi> a friend unto them then an Enemy: After he had roared out this in a great Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the people, he expired. In the mean time, <hi>Agathocles</hi> having overcome all in <hi>Africa,</hi> did deliver his Army to his eldeſt Son <hi>Archagathus,</hi> and returned into <hi>Sicily,</hi> conceiving that nothing had been performed in <hi>Africa,</hi> if <hi>Syracuſae</hi> in <hi>Sicily</hi> was any longer beſieged: For after the ſlaughter of <hi>Amilcar</hi> the Son of <hi>Giſco,</hi> the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had ſent a new Army thither: Therefore on his firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, all the Cities of <hi>Sicily,</hi> having heard of his atchievements in <hi>Africa,</hi> did ſtrive (as if in emulation) which firſt ſhould ſurrender it ſelf unto him; and by this means the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> being driven out of <hi>Sicily,</hi> he became the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>olute Maſter of the whole Iland; And returning afterwards to <hi>Africa,</hi> he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by an inſurrection of his Souldiers; for his Son had deferred the payment of the Army until his Father returned. Having therefore called them to an Aſſembly, he ſtroaked them with fair words, and told them that their Pay was not to be demanded of him, but to be ſought for from their Enemy, and that a common victory would produce a common booty: He deſired them to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient but a little until the relicts of the war were ended, and when <hi>Carthage</hi> was taken, he would ſatisfie all their hopes. The military
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:62253:168"/>
tumult being thus pacified, ſome few daies afterwards, he did bring his Army to the Camp of his Enemies, and inconſiderately engaging with them, he loſt the greateſt part of his Army. Therefore when he was fled into his Tents, and ſaw the envie and blame of the ill managed war turned upon himſelf, and feared withal the former offence of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not payed his Army, he fled away about midnight, having not any with him but his Son <hi>Archagathus,</hi> which when his Souldiers underſtood, they were ſtruck with ſo great a fear, as if they had been all taken by their Enemies. They declared that they were twice abandoned by their King in the midſt of all their Enemies, and that their ſafety was forſaken by him who ought by the Law of Arms to take care of their burial. When they would have purchaſed their King who was received by the <hi>Numidians,</hi> they were enforced to fly back unto their Tents; but <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chagathus</hi> was taken by them, who had loſt his Father in the error of the night. In the mean time, <hi>Agathocles</hi> had embarked himſelf for <hi>Syracuſae</hi> in the ſame ſhips which brought him from <hi>Sicily.</hi> He was a ſingular Example; a King, and yet the forſaker of his Army; and a Father, and yet the betrayer of his children: But his Souldiers having articled for an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Africa,</hi> after the flight of the King, did

deliver themſelves to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> having firſt killed the Sons of <hi>Agathocles.

and the moſt rich, and by their ſituation moſt prompt to be injured by their neighbours; for they had driven from <hi>Italy</hi> the Inhabitants of many Cities, who had been <hi>Grecians,</hi> and in war had overcome the <hi>Lucanians</hi> from whom they had derived their Original, and had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made peace with them on equal terms: So great was the wildneſs of their nature, that they would not ſpare their own Original.

His little children depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, did hang upon their father, and embraced him with many doleful complaints. On the other part, his wife who ſhould ſee her husband no more, did weary him with her kiſſes; and no leſs miſerable were the tears of the old man: The Mother and Children bewailed the dying Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Father bewailed his baniſhed wife and children.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perplexed with this doubtful danger, and uncertain what to determine, or whom firſt to aſſiſt, he providently conſulted for the ſafefy of both. For the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him on this ſide, and the <hi>Romans</hi> on the other, it appeared dangerous unto him not to tranſport his Army into <hi>Italy,</hi> but far more dangerous to abandon <hi>Sicily,</hi> leaſt that the

one ſhould not appear forſaken, nor the other loſt for the want of Recruits. In this tempeſt of growing dangers, the ſafeſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Counſels did appear to fight it out in <hi>Sicily</hi> with all the powers he could make; and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> being beaten, to carry his conquering Army into <hi>Italy.</hi> The battels therefore being joyned, although he overcame his Enemies, yet becauſe he withdrew his Army from <hi>Sicily,</hi> he was interpreted to be overcome, and his Confederates revolting from him, he loſt ſpeedily the Kingdom of <hi>Sicily,</hi> as he eaſily did obtain it.

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:62253:172"/>
of all the Citizens, he was created General againſt the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and not long after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards King. His infant Education was a Propheteſs of his future Majeſty; for he was the Son of <hi>Hieroclytus</hi> a noble man, who derived his original from <hi>Gelus</hi> an antient Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of <hi>Sicily,</hi> but his birth on the Mothers ſide was ſordidly ignominious: For he was begotten on a Mayd-ſervant, who was his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and therefore it was commanded by his Father, that he ſhould be expoſed as the diſgrace and diſhonour of his Family. But the Bees having layd honey round about him where he was left, did nouriſh him, being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry young, and wanting all humane comfort for many days; by reaſon of which his Father being admoniſhed by the South<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſayers, who perſaged in their ſongs that the Kingdom was portended to him, did cauſe him to be brought home, and with all his care and endeavor, did inſtruct and bring up to that hope of Majeſty which was promiſed; being but a boy at Shool amongſt his companions, a Wolf ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly appearing, took his book from him; and being a young man, and learning his firſt rudiments in the art of war, an Eagle pearched on his buckler, and on Owl on his Spear; which did preſage, that he ſhould be wary in Counſel, high in courage, and be crown'd a King at laſt. He often fought with thoſe that

challenged him, and always returned a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror; he was rewarded by King <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> with many Military gifts; he was as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable for his ſtrength as for the beauty of his body; pleaſing in diſcourſe, juſt in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, moderate in command, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be ſeen that was wanting in him of a King, but the Kingdom only.</p>

When he approached to the Gate of the City, he commanded the Citadel to be ſeized on, and the two boys to be ſlain, who when they fled to their Mother, they were killed in her very lap as ſhe was kiſſing them; <hi>Arſinoe</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> had committed ſo abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable a crime under the pretence of marriage, and offered herſelf to the Executioners for her children, and oftentimes with her own body ſhe protected the embraced bodies of her children, and would willingly receive the wounds which were intended to them: At the laſt being

            <p>Which when it was reported to King <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus,</hi> he ſaid that the renowned Kingdom of <hi>Macedonia</hi> would ſhortly fall by the raſhneſs of one heady young man. But the <hi>Gauls</hi> under

the commannd of <hi>Belgius,</hi> did ſend Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> to try the Reſolutions of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> offering him peace if he would purchaſe it with money; But <hi>Ptolomy</hi> vaunted to his Subjects, that the <hi>Gauls</hi> did ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate to him to have peace for fear of the war, and did ſpeak as inſolently to the Ambaſſadors as to his Subjects; He aſſured them that he would grant them no peace, unleſs they ſhould give him their Princes for Hoſtages, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up their Arms; for he would not believe them unleſs they were diſarmed.</p>
            <p>This anſwer being returned, The <hi>Gauls</hi> laughed out-right, crying out on every ſide that he ſhould ſhortly perceive whether they offered peace unto him for his advantage or their own. Some few dayes after, the battel was fought; and the <hi>Macedons</hi> being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, were beaten down: <hi>Ptolomy</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived many wounds was taken, his head was cut off, and being fixed on the point of a Lance, it was carryed all about the Army to the terror of the <hi>Macedons:</hi> So fatal was this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, and ſo great the rout, that few of them were preſerved by flight, the reſt were either all ſlain or taken Priſoners. When this was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported throughout all <hi>Macedonia,</hi> the Gates of the Cities were ſhut, all places were filled with mourning; ſometimes they lamented the loſs of their children, ſometimes they feared the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:62253:177"/>
deſtruction of their Cities, they called upon the names of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> as if their Kings had been their gods, and emplored their aſſiſtance under whom they were ſafe, not onely againſt their Enemies, but alſo Conquerors of the World; they emplored them that they would defend their Country, which by the glory of their atchievements, they had made ſecond unto Heaven, and to relieve thoſe now in their diſtreſs, whom the fury and raſhneſs of King <hi>Ptolomy</hi> had deſtroyed. All men deſpairing, <hi>Soſthenes</hi> one of the Princes of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> thinking that in this extremity they muſt uſe deeds as well as prayers, having drawn the youth of the <hi>Macedons</hi> into a body, he both reſtrained the <hi>Gauls</hi> growing inſolent with their Victory, and defended the <hi>Macedons</hi> from the plunderings of their Enemies; for which bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his conduct and valour (many of the Noble men of <hi>Macedonia</hi> affecting the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) he by his birth although ignoble, was advanced above them all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and being ſaluted King by the Army, he compelled the Souldiers to take the Oath of Allegiance, not in name of the King, but of the General.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Brennus</hi> under whoſe command one part of the <hi>Gauls</hi> had poured themſelves into <hi>Greece,</hi> having underſtood of the victory of his Aſſociates, who under <hi>Belgiu</hi> had overcome the <hi>Macedons,</hi> diſdaining that ſo
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:62253:178"/>
rich a booty and laden with the ſpoyls of the Eaſt, ſhould ſo eaſily be abandoned, having amaſſed a body of one hundred and fifty thouſand foot, and fifteen thouſand horſe, did break into <hi>Macedonia:</hi> and having plundred the Towns, and preyed the Fields, <hi>Soſthenes</hi> did advance againſt him with a gallant Army of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> but being not ſo numerous, they were overcome by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and the weaker by the ſtronger. The <hi>Macedonians</hi> being overcome, did hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within the Walls of their Cities, and <hi>Brennus</hi> being Conqueror, did plunder up and down the Country of all <hi>Macedonia</hi> no man oppoſing him; And as if thoſe ſpoyls were too unworthy of his avarice, he turned his minde to the Temples of the immortal gods, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely aſſerting that the gods being rich, ought out of their abundance to contribute unto the poverty of men. He preſently therefore marched to <hi>Delphos,</hi> preferring gold, the temptation of Religion, above the violation of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal gods, who he affirmed did ſtand in no need of riches, it being their cuſtom to beſtow them upon men.</p>
            <p>The Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> is placed at <hi>Delphos</hi> on the Hill of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> a rock everywhere hanging over it, in which place the frequent confluence of men did erect a City, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither in great numbers, to the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:62253:178"/>
of the Majeſty of the god did inhabit on that Rock. The Temple and City is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by Walls, but by precipices not made by hands, but made ſtrong and guarded by Nature; ſo that it is hard to ſay, whether the ſtrength of the place, or the majeſty of the god be more to be admired: The middle of the Rock doth open it ſelf into the form of a Theater, by reaſon whereof, the clamour of men, and the clangor of the Trumpets when they are ſounded (the hollowneſs of the Rocks returning and banding the ſound from one to another and playing with it amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) the ſound is heard more multiplyed by the reboation, and appears greater far then when at firſt it was delivered. This is that which ſtriketh a greater terror of Majeſty into thoſe who are ignorant of the cauſe, and adds a reverent amazement to the admiration; much about this hollow of the Rock on the middle of the height of the Hill, there is a little plain, and in it a deep hole, out of which the Oracle proceeds, which being a cold breath driven up as it were by a winde, doth poſſeſs the minds of the Prieſts with a madneſs, who being filled with god, he doth enforce them to give an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to thoſe who do demand them: By reaſon of this, there were to be ſeen many and very rich gifts, both of Kings and others, who do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by their magnificence both the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:62253:179"/>
of the Givers, and the Anſwers of the gods.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brennus</hi> when he beheld the Temple, did make a halt with his Army, debating whither he ſhould preſently aſſault it, or give his weary Souldiers the reſpite of one night, to refreſh themſelves. <hi>Euridanus</hi> and <hi>Teſſalonus</hi> two Commanders, who joyned themſelves unto him in hope of the booty, did counſel him to cut off all delayes, whiles the Enemies were unprepared, and his new approach had ſtruck a terror into them; but they affirmed that if they ſhould give them the deliberation of one night, the Enemies might put on new reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the acceſs of new ſupplies, and the wayes which now lay open might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. But the common Souldiers of the <hi>Gauls</hi> out of their long want, when they found the Country to abound with wines, and all manner of proviſion, did diſperſe themſelves about the Fields, being no leſs joyful with the abundance they found, then with their victory; and forſaking their Enſigns, they did range up and down as Conquerors to ſeiſe on all things; which gave ſome reſpite to the <hi>Delphians;</hi> for on the firſt report of the coming of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> the Country people were prohibited by the Oracle to bring their Vintage and Harveſt into their Towns: which ſaving counſel was not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood until the abundance of wine and other
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:62253:179"/>
proviſions being left as a temptation and delay to the <hi>Gauls,</hi> the Auxiliaries of the neighbouring Countries had the leiſure to draw together; and the <hi>Delphians</hi> being encreaſed by the acceſs of their Forces, did fortifie their City, before the <hi>Gauls</hi> falling to their ſwill of Wine as to their prey, could be called to their Standards.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brennus</hi> out of all his Army made choyce for this ſervice of threeſcore and five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foot. The Army of the <hi>Delphians</hi> and their Aſſociates did not amount to above fourteen thouſand, in contempt of whom, <hi>Brennus</hi> the more to encourage his men, did ſhew them the greatneſs of the booty, and the Statues drawn with four horſe (of which a vaſt number were ſeen afar off) all with ſolid gold; moreover he affirmed to them that the booty was far more conſiderable in the weight then in the ſhow. With this informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Gauls</hi> being as much inflamed as with their laſt nights Wine, did fall upon the onſet without reſpect of danger. The <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phians</hi> on the other ſide, putting their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in their god, and not in their own ſtrength, did with contempt oppoſe their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and from the top of the Hill, ſome of them with Arms, and ſome with ſtones did overwhelm and repel the <hi>Gauls</hi> in their Scalado. In the heat of this encounter, on a ſudden the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:62253:180"/>
Prieſts of all the Temples, &amp; the Prophets them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their hair diſhevelled in their moſt ſolemn habits and fillets did tremble all with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, &amp; did run forth mad into the Front of the Army: where the fight moſt violently was maintained, They cryed out that their god was come down, &amp; that they beheld him leaping into the Temple, laughing from the opened Roofs thereof; for whiles they moſt humbly emplor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his help, a young man as admirable in his beauty as the tall proportion of his body, with two armed Virgins who were his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions did appear, and did meet them out of the two adjoyning Temples of <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva;</hi> neither did they onely behold them with their eyes, but they heard alſo the twang of his Bow, and the claſhing of his Armour; they therefore conjured them by the utmoſt Imprecations, that they would not delay to make a thorow-diſpatch upon their Enemies, the gods being their Leaders, and to joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Companions with them in the Victory; with theſe words being enflamed, they did all throw themſelves upon the points of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſwords, and immediately they perceived the preſence of their god; For part of the Hill (being torn off by an Earthquake) did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm the Army of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and the moſt thick and pointed wedges did fall to the ground not without ſome wounds to the <hi>Delphians.</hi>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:62253:180"/>
Immediately there followed a great Tempeſt of hayl, lightning, &amp; thunder which devoured thoſe who fainted by reaſon of their wounds. <hi>Bren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> their General, when he could not endure the anguiſh of his wounds, did end his life with his Poynedo. <hi>Belgius</hi> the other of their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, the Authors of this war being puniſhed, departed in a flying march out of <hi>Greece</hi> with ten thouſand of his Aſſociates: But Fortune was not more propitious to them flying; for fearful as they were, there was no night without rain or cold, nor day without labor and danger, but daily ſtorms and ſnow concrete with Ice, and hunger, and wearineſs, and above all the great evil of too much watching did conſume the miſerable Relicks of the unhappy war. The people alſo and Nations through which they marched, did purſue them flying before them as a prey; By which means it came to paſs, that not one of ſo great an Army, who not long before being too confident in their ſtrength and numbers preſumed to plunder the gods, did now remain to witneſs the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of ſo great an overthrow.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Eace being concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Kings, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> and <hi>Antiochus;</hi> when <hi>Antigonus</hi> returned into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> a new E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy did on a ſudden ariſe unto him; for the <hi>Gauls</hi> who were left by <hi>Brennus</hi> to defend the bounds of the Nation, when he advanced into <hi>Greece</hi> (that they alone might not ſeem idle) having armed fifteen thouſand foot, and three thouſand horſe, did invade the <hi>Getes</hi> and <hi>Tribals,</hi> and having overcome them, they did hang like a
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:62253:181"/>
dark cloud over <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and ſent their Ambaſſadors to King <hi>Antigonus</hi> to offer him a mercenary Peace, and to diſcover his ſtrength. <hi>Antigonus</hi> with royal magnificence did invite them to a ſtately Banquet, ſet forth in the higheſt manner that could be deviſed. The <hi>Gauls</hi> admiring the vaſt weights of gold and ſilver, which on purpoſe were layd open to their obſervations, and being provoked by the abundance and variety of the booty, returned more greedy of war, then when they came forth. The King alſo commanded that the Elephants ſhould be ſhewed unto them for a terror, it being a ſight unaccuſtomed to them, and that they ſhould ſee the ſhips laden with Souldiers, and gallantly equipped, being ignorant that he did hereby tempt them by the rlchneſs of the booty, whom he thought to have affrighted by the greatneſs of his power.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadors being returned, made all things greater then they were, and declared both the wealth and the ſecurity of the King; his Tents, they ſaid, were covered with gold and ſilver, and defended neither by works nor ditches: and as if their riches were defence enough, they neglected all Military duties, thinking (belike) that they needed not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Iron, becauſe they abounded with gold: By this relation the deſires of the greedy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were the more provoked to the prey. The
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:62253:182"/>
Example of <hi>Belgius</hi> did the more excite them, who not long before had overthrown the Army of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> and killed the King himſelf. With the general conſent of all, they in the night did invade the Tents of the King, who foreſeeing this tempeſt, did give order the day before to take away all the precious moveables, and privately to hide themſelves in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning woods; neither was the Camp other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe preſerved, then that it was thus abandoned; For the <hi>Gauls</hi> when they ſaw all things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken and not onely without Defenders, but alſo without a Guard, conceiving it to be rather an Ambuſh then a flight, they did forbear for a while, to enter into the Ports thereof. At laſt, they poſſeſſed themſelves of them, rather exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining and ſearching then plundering them, and not long afterwards, taking away what they found, they did carry it to the ſhore; There when too raſhly they thought to ſeiſe upon the ſhips, they were killed by the Sea-men, and by a part of the Land Army, who fled thither with their Wives and children ſuſpecting no ſuch danger: And ſo great was the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> that the report and opinion of this Victory procured peace to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> not from the <hi>Gauls,</hi> but ſome other ſtubborn Enemies who were his Neghbors.</p>
            <p>The yong men of the <hi>Gauls</hi> at that time were ſo numerous that they ſwarmed all over <hi>Aſia,</hi>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:62253:182"/>
neither did the Kings of the Eaſt manage any wars without the mercenary Army of the <hi>Gauls;</hi> neither did thoſe who were baniſhed or beaten from their Kingdoms, addreſs themſelves unto any but to the <hi>Gauls</hi> onely. So great was the terror of their name, or the invincible happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Arms, that the King believed their Majeſtie was not ſafe, nor could they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it being loſt, unleſs they were aſſiſted by the valor of the <hi>Gauls:</hi> Being therefore called by the King of <hi>Bithynia</hi> to his help, and the Victory obtained, they divided the Kingdom with him, and called that Country <hi>Gallograecia;</hi> Whiles theſe things were performed in <hi>Aſia, Phyrrus</hi> being overcome by the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in a battel at Sea, deſired ayd of <hi>Antigonus</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> declaring that if he aſſiſted him not, he muſt be enforced to return into his Kingdom, and ſeek the advancement of his Fortunes from the <hi>Romans.</hi> Which when his Ambaſſadors brought him word was denyed, (having diſſembled the reaſon) he pretended a ſudden departure.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, he commanded hls Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates to provide for the war, and delivered the Government of the Tower of <hi>Tarentum</hi> to <hi>Helenus</hi> his Son and <hi>Milo</hi> his friend. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned into <hi>Epirus,</hi> he immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the bounds of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> where <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> did meet him with an Army, and being
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:62253:183"/>
overcome by him, was put to flight; <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> hereupon did take <hi>Macedonia</hi> into his power, and as if he had ballanced the loſs of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> with the regaining of the Kingdom of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> he did ſend both for his Son and for his friend, which he did leave at <hi>Tarentum. Antigonus</hi> with a few horſemen the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of his flight, being on a ſudden forſaken of all the ornaments of his dignity, did repair to <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> to behold the events of his loſt Kingdom, hiring a mercenary Army of the <hi>Gauls</hi> to renew the war; And being again ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly overthrown by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the Son of <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus,</hi> and in his flight attended but with ſeven men, he not onely loſt all hope of the recovery of his Kingdom, but fled into ſolitary places and made them the beſt procurers of his ſafety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> being now advanced to ſo great a height of ſoveraignty, was not content with that which with modeſty he durſt not aſpire unto in his hopes, but propounded unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Empire both of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia;</hi> he took a felicity and pride in his wars as in his Soveraignty; for no man could reſiſt him whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever he turned his power; but as he was eſteemed invincible in adding Kingdom unto Kingdom, ſo having overcome them and obtained them, he quickly loſt them, being more fortunate to obtain then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve;
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:62253:183"/>
having afterwards tranſported his forces on the other ſide of <hi>Cherſoneſus,</hi> he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Embaſſies of the <hi>Athenians, Achaians,</hi> and <hi>Meſſenians;</hi> And all <hi>Greece</hi> amazed at the glory of his name, and at the wonders of his Atchievements againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> did with a labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expectation attend his arrival.</p>
            <p>His firſt war in <hi>Greece</hi> was againſt the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians,</hi> where he was oppoſed more by the valour of the women then the men: There he loſt his Son <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and the choyceſt men in his Army: For ſo great a multitude of women did preſs in throngs upon him for the defence of their Country, as he was beſieging <hi>Sparta,</hi> that he was enforced to retreat from them, being not more valiantly then modeſty over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Moreover, it is affirmed that his Son <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was ſo able a man of his hands, that he took the City of <hi>Corcyra</hi> being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed onely with threeſcore men. In a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel at Sea, there being but ſeven men with him, he leaped out of his boat into the ſhip of his Enemies, and did enforce it to obedience. And at the aſſault of the City of <hi>Sparta</hi> he gallopped into the middle of the City, and was there killed by the concurſe of the multitude, whoſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:62253:184"/>
when it was brought unto his Father, it is reported that <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> ſaid thar he was ſlain a great while later then he feared or then his raſhneſs did deſerve. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> being bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten back by the <hi>Spartans,</hi> did march to <hi>Argos,</hi> where when he endeavoured to beſiege <hi>Antigonus</hi> ſhut up in that City, he (fighting moſt violently amongſt the thickeſt and the formoſt) was ſlain with a ſtone thrown from the Walls; his head was brought unto <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus,</hi> who uſing the victory with gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, did diſmiſs his Son <hi>Helenus</hi> deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him with <hi>Epirus,</hi> and gave him leave to depart to his own Kingdom, aud delivered him the body of his unburyed Father to be interred in his own Country. Amongſt all Authors the Fame is conſtant and clear enough, that no King either of that or the former Age, was to be compared to <hi>Pyrrhus;</hi> and that not onely amongſt Kings, but other perſonages, there was ſeldom any to be found of a more juſt or a more Religious life. So great was his knowledge in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary affairs, that although he made war with ſo great Kings, as <hi>Lyſimachus, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> and <hi>Antigonus,</hi> yet he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes remained unconquered. In the war alſo of the <hi>Illyrians</hi> and <hi>Sicilians,</hi> and of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> he was
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:62253:184"/>
never inferiour to them, and oftentimes a Conqueror, who though his Country was but narrow, and before ignoble, by the Fame of his atchievements and the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of his converſation he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown it over all the World.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the death of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> there were great motions and tumults of war, not onely in <hi>Macedonia</hi> but in <hi>Aſia</hi> alſo and in <hi>Greece,</hi> for the <hi>Pelopenneſians</hi> were by treachery betrayed to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus,</hi> and according to the ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the Inhabitants, partaking ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of joy or grief, as the ſeveral Cities either hoped for ayd from <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> or were afraid of his power; ſo now they either entred into league with <hi>Antigonus,</hi> or
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:62253:185"/>
flung themſelves upon a war by the mutual hatred amongſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>In this commotion of the troubled Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, the City alſo of <hi>Epirus</hi> was by ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny invaded by <hi>Ariſtotimus</hi> the Prince; by whom when many of the Rulers of the City were ſlain, and more of them driven into baniſhment, the <hi>Aetolians</hi> deſiring of him by their Ambaſſadors, that the Exuls might be permitted to have their wives and children come unto them, he at the firſt denyed it, and afterwards as if he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of what he had denyed, he gave all the Matrons leave to repair unto their ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed husbands, and appointed a day for their departure. They as if they ſhould for ever ſuffer baniſhment with their husbands, taking with them their richeſt moveables, when they had met at the gate of the City to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel all in one troup, they were apprehended and committed to priſon, and plundred of all their goods, the little children being ſlain in the laps of their Mothers, and the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins their daughters raviſhed. All men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amazed at this domineering cruelty, one of their Rulers <hi>Helemat</hi> by name, an old man, and deſtitute of children, and one that feared not the reſpect of age, being not obliged to the reſpect of pledges, having called to his houſe the moſt faithul of his
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:62253:186"/>
friends did exhort them to the revenge of their Country.</p>
            <p>They all debating on a way to conclude the publick with their private danger, and deſiring a time for deliberation, he ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his ſervants, did command them to lock the doors, withall to go unto the Tyrant, and deſire him to ſend ſome of his Guard to apprehend the Conſpirators aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in his houſe, objecting to every one of them, that becauſe he could not be the Author of delivering his Country, he would be the revenger of it being forſaken by them. Hereupon they being ſurprized with a doubtful danger, chuſing the more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way of the two, they conſpired to kill the Tyrant, and <hi>Ariſtotimus</hi> by this meanes was ſlain in the fifth Moneth af er he had uſurped the Tyranny.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Antigonus</hi> being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with ſeveral wars, which he made againſt King <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and a new Army of Enemies from <hi>Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graecia,</hi> having left in his Camp ſome few Companies to defend it againſt the other Enemies, he marched with his chief power againſt the <hi>Gauls:</hi> Which being underſtood, the better to prepare themſelves to the fight, they did offer ſacrifices for the good event of the battel; And a great ſlaughter

and utter deſtruction, being perſaged to them by the entrails of the beaſts, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately turning their fear into a fury, hoping that the threatnings and the anger of the gods could be expiated by the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their Families, they killed their wives and children, beginning the auſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the war with ſuch a deteſtable Parricide: So great was the barbarouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſavage minds, that they did not forbear their Infants and the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that age which even their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies would have ſpared, but made a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>
               <hi>Antiochus</hi> being but fourteen years of age, and greedy of Soveraignty above his years, took hold of the occaſion, but not with that pious minde as it was offered; but deſiring like an Oppreſſor, to force all from his brother, he armed himſelf being but a boy with a

wicked but a manly boldneſs; from his rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous diſpoſition he was called <hi>Hierax,</hi> becauſe in ſnatching away the goods from other men he followed not the life of a man, but of a Bird of prey.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that King <hi>Antiochus</hi> did advance to the ayd and help of <hi>Selencus,</hi> made peace with <hi>Seleucus</hi> for ten years, that he might not fight at once againſt two: But peace being granted by the Enemy, it was reverſed by the Brother, who having drawn unto him a mercenary Army of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> in the ſtead of a Brother did ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf an Enemy. In that war by the proweſs of the <hi>Gauls, Antiochus</hi> was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror; but the <hi>Gauls</hi> believing that <hi>Seleucus</hi> was ſlain in the battel, did turn their ſwords againſt <hi>Antiochus</hi> himſelf, believing they ſhould plunder <hi>Aſia</hi> with more freedom, if they had deſtroyed all the Royal Progeny. Which when <hi>Antiochus</hi> perceived, he ranſomed himſelf from them as from high-way men with gold, and not long after entred into a league with his own mercenaries.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Eumenes</hi> King of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> his Brothers being diſperſed and conſumed with civil diſcords (being as it were to invade the uncertain poſſeſſion of <hi>Aſia)</hi> aſſaulted the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and the Conqueror <hi>Antiochus</hi> at once, who being weary, &amp;c. many of them wounded

in the former encounter, it was not difficult for him to overcome them. In that time, all the wars were deſigned for the deſtruction of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and as one was more powerful then another, he always ſeized upon <hi>Aſia</hi> as a prey. The two Brothers, <hi>Seleucus</hi> and <hi>Antiochus</hi> did wage war for <hi>Aſia; Ptolomy</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt</hi> in pretence to revenge his ſiſter, did alſo greedily covet the Empire of <hi>Aſia;</hi> on this ſide <hi>Eumenes</hi> of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> on the other ſide the <hi>Gauls</hi> being always a mercenary Army, did make a prey of <hi>Aſia;</hi> and amongſt ſo many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there was no man found to be a Defender of it. <hi>Antiochus</hi> being overcome, when <hi>Eumenes</hi> had poſſeſſed the greateſt part thereof, the two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, (the booty being loſt for which they made war) could not yet agree amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but, the forraign Enemy being neglected, they did drive on a war for the mutual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of themſelves: In which <hi>Antiochus</hi> being overcome the ſecond time, and wearyed with flying, which continued many dayes, he at laſt directed his courſe to <hi>Artamenes</hi> his Father-in-law, who was King of <hi>Cappodocia:</hi> He having nobly entertained him at firſt, did not long after contrive to take away his life by treachery, which <hi>Antiochus</hi> having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, did provide for his ſafety by flight. And when wandring up and down, he could finde no place in which he might reſide with
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:62253:191"/>
ſafety, he repaired to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> his Enemy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his aſſurance to be more ſafe then his Brothers, being either conſcious what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to him, or what he had deſerved of him; But <hi>Ptolomy</hi> being not to be reconciled to him, did command him to be kept in cloſe impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from whence by the endeavors of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whom familiarly he knew, he made an eſcape, having deceived his Keepers, and flying away, he was ſeized upon and killed by Thieves. Much at the ſame time, <hi>Seleucus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt his Kingdom (being thrown from his horſe) did loſe his life; and thus theſe two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, being Brothers alſo in baniſhment, after the loſs of their Kingdoms, did ſuffer the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of their tranſgreſſions.</p>

For his part, he underſtood well enough the ringols in that envyed Crown, and the weight of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not by his pleaſures, but by his
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:62253:194"/>
labours and his dangers. He did put them in minde of what he had done for them; how he revenged the revolt of their aſſociates; how he ſuppreſſed the <hi>Dardanians</hi> and <hi>Theſſalians,</hi> inſulting at the death of King <hi>Demetrius;</hi> and at laſt, how he not only defended, but increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the dignity of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> of which ſince they did repent, he d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The people hearing this, were rebuked by their own ſhame, and commanded him ro re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive again the ſoveraignty of Command, which he refuſed untill the Authors of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition were delivered to him to be puniſhed.</p>
            <p>After this he made war upon the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> who alone in the Wars of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> deſpiſed the command of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedons,</hi> and the Arms which were feared by all the world.

            <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> being overcome, not themſelves only, but their wives and children ſuſtained their misfortune with them, with an invincible courage. In the Battel not any one

They all lamented their own condition, that they died not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the liberty of their Country. The Parents did receive into their houſes all that were wounded, they comforted the ſick, and refreſhed all the weak and the weary. In ſo great an overthrow there was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint in the City, no ſign of fear at all; they all lamented rather their publick then their private fortunes: preſently upon this <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> their King (after a great ſlaughter of his enemies) being covered with his own blood, and with the blood of his Enemies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to the City, and having entred into it, he fate not down to demand either meat or drink, nor eaſed himſelf by putting off the burden of his Armour, but leaning againſt the wall, when he beheld that there were but four thouſand left of all his Army, he exhorted them to reſerve themſelves to a better oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to do their Country ſervice; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his wife and children with him, he depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> by whom he was for a long time honourably entertained, and lived in the height of regal Majeſtie: And at laſt
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:62253:195"/>
after the death of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> he and all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were ſlain by his ſon. But <hi>Antigonus</hi> (the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> being utterly overthrown) did lament the fortune of ſo great a City, and ſtrictly did inhibit his Souldiers to plunder; and moreover gave a free pardon to thoſe who remained alive, alledging that he made War not with the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> but with <hi>Cleomenes</hi> in whoſe flight all his anger was appeaſed; and it was more for his own glory that <hi>Lacedemon</hi> was preſerved by himſelf, then if it were taken and plundered by his forces. He therefore ſpared the City and the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the walls becauſe there were no men left to whom he might ſhew indulgence. Not long after he died himſelf, and left his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to his Son <hi>Philip,</hi> being above fourteen years of Age.</p>

Theſe boys being kings, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there were no Governours of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter age, yet every one of them being intent to follow the traces of their Predeceſſors, there ſhined forth a growing light of honour in them all. Only <hi>Ptolomy</hi> as he was nefari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in gaining the Kingdom, ſo he was ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the adminiſtration of the government of it. The <hi>Dardanians,</hi> and other neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nations, who carried an inveterate and a deadly hatred to the Kings of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> in the contempt of this young mans age, did daily provoke him. On the other ſide, his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being round, and he not contented only to defend his own Dominions, deſired to make War againſt the <hi>Aetolians;</hi> and being full of the deſign, <hi>Demetrius</hi> King of the <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyrians</hi> being lately overcome by <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Conſul, did with an humble Petition ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs himſelf unto him, complaining of the injury of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were not content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the bounds of <hi>Italy,</hi> but in an aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:62253:196"/>
hope, promiſing to themſelves the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of all the World, did make War upon all Nations. Thus they affected the ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Sicily, Sardinia</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and greedy after <hi>Africa</hi> made VVar with the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and with <hi>Hannibal</hi> himſelf. They alſo he ſaid brought a war upon himſelf for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe, but that he was a neighbour unto <hi>Italy;</hi> as if it were a treſpaſs for any King to Reign neer the bounds of their Empire; but above all things he was to be an example of Admonition, whoſe Kingdom by how much it was more noble and more neer unto them, by ſo much the <hi>Romans</hi> would be his more eager Enemies.</p>
            <p>He alledged that he would give a place to him in that Kingdom which the <hi>Romans</hi> had poſſeſſed, it being more gracefull to him to ſee a friend and not an enemy to ſtrive with him in the poſſeſſion of the Soveraignty.</p>
            <p>VVith this ſpeech he enforced <hi>Philip</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and to make VVar upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> conceiving the buſineſs of the VVar to be the leſs, becauſe he underſtood that they had been already beaten by <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> at the lake of <hi>Thraſimen.</hi> Therefore at the ſame time that he might not be infeſted with mutual War, he made peace with the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> not that he deſired to tranſlate the War into another place, but that he would
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:62253:197"/>
take care for the ſafety of <hi>Greece,</hi> which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed was never in a greater danger. For the Empires of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> growing up to a great height in the Weſt, to whom the Kingdom of <hi>Macedonia</hi> was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a delay from being Maſters of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> (they having tryed amongſt themſelves for the ſuperiority) the Conquerour would ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly invade the Eaſt.</p>
            <p>He ſaid, he beheld the cloud of that fierce and cruel War ariſing in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the ſtorms already thundring and lightning from the Weſt, which into whatſoever parts of the world the Tempeſt of the Victory ſhould drive, it would pollute all things with a crimſon ſhower of blood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Greece</hi> indeed he ſaid had oftentimes indured vaſt motions of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> ſometimes of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> ſometimes of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> but all this would appear no more then a ſport, if that Army of the <hi>Romans</hi> which was now in <hi>Italy</hi> ſhould pour it ſelf into another Land.</p>
            <p>He beheld what cruel and bloody Wars both the Nations of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians</hi> amongſt themſelves did make, being equal in the ſtrength of their forces, and in the conduct of their Generals, which enmity could never be concluded with the deſtruction of one of the parties only, without the ruine of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="375" facs="tcp:62253:197"/>
It was true indeed, that the fierce minds of the Conquerours were leſs to be feared by the <hi>Macedonians</hi> then by the <hi>Grecians;</hi> for they were more remote in their ſituation, and more ſtrong in their power to exerciſe their revenge howſoever; he was confident moreover that thoſe who now fought in <hi>Italy</hi> with ſo much might, would not content themſelves with that victory, and they ought even in <hi>Macedonia</hi> to fear the approach of the Conquerors.</p>
            <p>With this pretence the War being ended with the <hi>Aetolians, Philip</hi> minding nothing more then the Wars againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> did weigh with himſelf the ſtrength of both Armies. And the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves who were deeply engaged in the War with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> were not free from the fear of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> by reaſon of the ancient va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> and the glory of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Eaſt; &amp; yong <hi>Philip</hi> being induſtrious &amp; prompt to the War, &amp; withall inflamed with an emulation to tread in the victorious ſteps of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> did ſtrike a new terrour into them.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Philip</hi> when he found that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were overcome again by the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in a ſecond Battel, profeſſing himſelf to be an Enemy openly to the <hi>Romans,</hi> he did begin to build ſhips to tranſport his Army into <hi>Italy.</hi> He ſent afterwards an Ambaſſador to <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> with Letters, to enter into a League with
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:62253:198"/>
him who being apprehended by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and brought unto the Senate, was diſmiſſed without any prejudice, not in honour to the King, but that being yet but doubtfull they might not make him an undoubted Enemy. When it was afterwards declared to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> that <hi>Philip</hi> would paſs his forces into <hi>Italy,</hi> they ſent <hi>Levinus</hi> the Praetor with a Fleet well equipaged to hinder him in his paſſage, who when he arrived in <hi>Greece,</hi> he inforced the <hi>Aetolians</hi> with many promiſes to undertake a War againſt <hi>Philip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time alſo <hi>Philip</hi> did ſollicite the <hi>Aetolians</hi> to make War againſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> In the mean time the <hi>Dardinians</hi> began to make ſpoil on the borders of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and having taken thence twenty thouſand Captives, they called back <hi>Philip</hi> from the <hi>Roman</hi> War to defend his own Kingdom. Whiles theſe things were thus in action, the Praetor <hi>Levinus</hi> having entred into a League with King <hi>Attalus</hi> did plunder <hi>Greece,</hi> with which the Cities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſmayed they wearied <hi>Philip</hi> with their Embaſſeys deſiring aid of him; and the Kings of <hi>Illyria</hi> alſo with their daily ſupplications did importune him to perform his promiſe: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boveall, the plundred <hi>Macedons</hi> deſired re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. He being beſieged with ſo great and ſo many difficulties did deliberate with himſelf what War he ſhould firſt undertake, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:62253:198"/>
unto all, that he ſuddenly would ſend ayd unto them, not that he was able to perform what he promiſed, but that having filled them with hope, he might ſtill keep them obliged in the Indentures of their aſſociation. His firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition was againſt the <hi>Dardanians,</hi> who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to make an advantage of his abſence did threaten to fall upon <hi>Macedonia</hi> with a greater weight of War. He made Peace alſo with the Romans, being content that they had deferred the <hi>Macedonian</hi> War. He had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign upon <hi>Philopemenes</hi> General of the <hi>Achae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who (as he had heard) did privately ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the tempers of their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates, which being known and avoided, he by his authority commanded the <hi>Achaeans</hi> to depart from his ſervice.</p>

both banks and the Sea, there was a great Earthquake. In which to the wonder of thoſe who ſailed by, the waters growing ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly hot, there aroſe an Iland out of the Deeps: And on the ſame day an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake in <hi>Aſia</hi> did ſhake <hi>Rhodes</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cities, and bringing a great ruine with in, did wholly devour others.

Moreover the <hi>Macedons</hi> were not to be eſteemed according to their ancient fame, but by their preſent ſtrength; for now they waged not war with <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, whom perchance they heard to be invincible, neirher with his Army who ſubdued the Eaſt, but with <hi>Philip</hi> a boy not yet grown up to maturity of Age, who hardly was able to maintain the bounds of his own Kingdom; and with thoſe <hi>Macedons</hi> who not long ago became a prey to the <hi>Dardanians.</hi> They did only boaſt of the honors of their Anceſtors, but the <hi>Romans</hi> were renowned for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent courage of their Souldiers; for <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and almoſt all the Weſt were not overcome by any other Army but by thoſe Souldiers who were then in the field with him.

ſhould abſtain from the Kingdom of the yong Prince, which was bequeathed to their truſt by the laſt Will of his Father. But theſe Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors being neglected by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> not long after there was ſent from <hi>Rome</hi> another Ambaſſy, who making no mention of their Ward at all, commanded that the Cities (which by the right of War were under the People of Rome) ſhould wholly be reſtored to them. <hi>Antiochus</hi> refuſing it, War was denounced againſt him, which he as haſtily did undertake as unfortunately he did manage. At the ſame time <hi>Nabis</hi> the Tyrant did ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many Cities of <hi>Greece.</hi> Whereupon the Senate (that the <hi>Roman</hi> forces ſhould not at the ſame time be detained in a double War) did write unto <hi>Flaminius,</hi> that if he thought good, he ſhould firſt free <hi>Greece</hi> from <hi>Nabis</hi> as he had delivered <hi>Macedonia</hi> from <hi>Philip.</hi> For this cauſe his Commiſſion was prolonged. The name of <hi>Hannibal</hi> did alſo make the war of <hi>Antiochus</hi> more terrible, againſt whom his adverſaries (who envyed his name in Arms) did in private accuſations complain unto the <hi>Romans</hi> that he had entred into a League with <hi>Antiochus,</hi> alledging that he being accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to military Commands and the arbitrary power of the ſword, would never be content to live under Laws, and that he being weary of the peace of the City, would be always
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:62253:204"/>
looking after new cauſes of War, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, although they were falſly reported, yet amongſt the fearfull they paſſed for truth. The Senate being ſurpriſed with the fear of him, did ſend <hi>Servilius</hi> Ambaſſador into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> to diſcover his Deſigns, and gave him private Inſtructions, that if poſſibly he could, he might kill him by his emulators, and free the <hi>Roman</hi> people from the fear of ſo hated a Name. But <hi>Hannibal</hi> was not long ignorant of the deſign, being a man experienced both to foreſee and to prevent dangers, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for adverſe fortune in proſperity, as thinking of proſperous fortune in adverſity. Therefore after he had the whole day preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf in publick before the face of the Senate of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and of the <hi>Roman</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, the evening approaching, he took horſe and repaired to his Country-houſe, which he had near to the Sea-Coaſt, his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants not knowing of it; and being command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to attend him at the gate of the City. He had there ſhips with Marriners in a readineſs, which lay hid in a Creek, and vaſt ſums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that when occaſion required, neither want nor inconveniency ſhould delay him. With the choiſeſt youth of his Servants, whoſe number the priſoners which he had taken in <hi>Italy</hi> did increaſe, he imbarked himſelf, and directed his courſe to <hi>Antiochus.</hi> On the next
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:62253:204"/>
morning the City expected their Commander in chief, and at that time Conſul, in the place of publick Aſſembly, whom when they found to be departed, they were poſſeſſed with as great a fear, as if the City it ſelf had bin taken. And the <hi>Roman</hi> Ambaſſador, as if a new War already was brought by <hi>Hannibal</hi> upon <hi>Italy,</hi> returned in a private ſilence unto <hi>Rome,</hi> and brought along with him the melancholy ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. In the mean time <hi>Flaminius</hi> (having with him ſome of the aſſociated Cities of <hi>Greece)</hi> did in two battels overcome <hi>Nabys</hi> the tyrant, and left him, as it were, unnerv'd and fainting in his Kingdom: But liberty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtored to <hi>Greece,</hi> and the Garriſons drawn off from the Cities, when the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was commanded back into <hi>Italy, Nabys</hi> being incenſed at the nothingneſs of his empty fortunes, did in a ſudden War invade again many of the Cities, with which the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaians</hi> being affrighted (that the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil might not creep unto them) they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted their Praetor <hi>Philopemenes</hi> to be their General, a man of admirable induſtry, whoſe courage, and whoſe conduct in that War was ſo apparent, that in the Judgement of all he might be compared to <hi>Flaminius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> General.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time <hi>Hannibal</hi> came to <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> and was received as a gift from the gods,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:62253:205"/>
and by his arrival the King was poſſeſſed with ſo great a heat of reſolution, that he thought not ſo much on the war it ſelf as on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the victory. But <hi>Hannibal</hi> who had experience of the <hi>Roman</hi> valour, affirmed that the <hi>Romans</hi> could not be ſuppreſſed but in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi> it ſelf. For the performance of which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he deſired one hundred ſhips, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foot, and one thouſand horſe, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with thoſe unconſiderable forces to make as great a War in <hi>Italy</hi> as he did ever hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and bring unto the King ſitting in his throne in <hi>Aſia,</hi> either a victory over the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> or the equal conditions of a peace; for he ſaid, that there was wanting only a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> inflamed with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to commence the War againſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> moreover was now more known unto him then heretofore; neither would <hi>Carthage</hi> be quiet, but without delay would ſend Auxiliaries to him. Theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels being acceptable to the King, one of the Confidents of <hi>Hannibal</hi> was ſent to <hi>Carthage</hi> to exhort them to the War, being too cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of it, before he repreſented to them that <hi>Hannibal</hi> would immediately be preſent with his forces, and did not communicate to either of the Factions any thing at all, but only that nothing was wanting to carry on this War but the reſolutions of the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> for
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:62253:205"/>
               <hi>Aſia</hi> would defray the charges, and lend them men enough for the War. When theſe things were reported to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger himſelf was apprehendrd by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and being brought into the Sentate (according to the ſubtilty of the Carthaginian wit) he made anſwer, that he was ſent to the whole Senate; for his buſineſs did not belong to this man or that man in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, but did concern them altogether. Whiles they debated many days in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to ſend him to <hi>Rome</hi> to purge the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick conſcience, he privately took ſhipping and returned to <hi>Hannibal;</hi> which was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner diſcovered, but the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently an Ambaſſador to <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> alſo ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that pretence might diſcover the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the King, and either reconcile <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> or by their daily converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him might render him ſuſpected and hated by the King. The Ambaſſadors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they came unto <hi>Antiochus</hi> at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi> they delivered to him the deſires of the Senate; and whiles they attended for an anſwer from him, they miſſed not a day to give a viſitation unto <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that unadviſedly he departed from his Country when the <hi>Romans</hi> with great fidelity did obſerve the peace, not made ſo much with
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:62253:206"/>
the Commonwealth of <hi>Carthage;</hi> as with himſelf; for they found that he made War not ſo much out of any hatred that he did bear unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> as for the love to his own Country, to which the beſt of men do owe their lives. Theſe they ſaid were the publick cauſes of War amongſt the People, but not of private ones amongſt Commanders. They afterwards began to extoll his atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by the diſcourſe whereof he being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, did more often and more greedily converſe with the Ambaſſadors, being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that he ſhould procure hatred with the King by his familiarity with the <hi>Romans:</hi> For <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſuſpecting that he had reconciled himſelf to the <hi>Romans</hi> by his often diſcourſe with them, did refer nothing to him as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore he was accuſtomed, nor made him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of any of his Councels, but did begin to hate him as his Enemy and Betrayer: Thus ſuſpition did corrupt all the preparations for the War, there appearing no General in the field, either to take the Muſters, or to exerciſe the Souldiers. The ſubſtance of the <hi>Roman</hi> Embaſſie to <hi>Antiochus</hi> was, that he ſhould be contented with the Borders and Frontiers of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and not impoſe upon the <hi>Romans</hi> a neceſſity to enter into <hi>Aſia</hi> with an Army: which Meſſage being deſpiſed by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> he made anſwer that it became his Royalty
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:62253:206"/>
and reſolution not to attend a War, but to give it. The Councel of VVar being often called afterwards, and <hi>Hannibal</hi> never ſitting amongſt them, <hi>Antiochus</hi> at laſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he ſhould be ſummoned, not that he ſhould act any thing which he propounded, but that he might not appear to have neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him altogether; and the Councel of every one being asked, at the laſt he demanded his advice, which being obſerved by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he profeſſed that he ſufficiently underſtood that he was called by him to the Councel of War, not that he wanted advice, but to fill up the number of the Sentences; howſoever out of his inveterate hatred to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and his love unto the King, with whom alone he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed a ſafe baniſhment, he was reſolved, he ſaid, to declare unto him the beſt way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king War againſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> Deſiring then to be excuſed for his boldneſs, he profeſſed that he approved not of any thing of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Councels or Enterpriſes, neither did it ſeem good in his Judgement that <hi>Greece</hi> ſhould be the ſeat of the War, when <hi>Italy</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded a far more plentifull ſubject for it. For the <hi>Romans,</hi> he ſaid, could not be overcome but by their own Arms, nor <hi>Italy</hi> be ſubdued but by the <hi>Italian</hi> Forces: for in them both the manner of the War and the People did differ much from other ſorts of men. It was
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:62253:207"/>
of great importance in other Wars to take the firſt advantages of place and time, to lay waſte the fields, and to plunder the Cities of the Enemies; but with a <hi>Roman,</hi> if you firſt either plunder them of their goods, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them in Battel, you muſt alſo wreſtle and tug with them when they are ſubdued and lying on the ground. Wherefore if any ſhall provoke them in their own Country, they may be overcome by their own wealth, by their own ſtrength, and by their own Arms, as he himſelf had done: But if any ſhall draw them out of <hi>Italy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which is the fountain of their ſtrength, he ſhall be as much decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as he who would dry up the Rivers, ſhould attempt it not at the head of the Fountain, but further off by ſome new works and dams which he ſhould make.</p>
            <p>This he ſaid was his Judgement, which he had a long time reſerved in private to himſelf, and freely before did offer it unto them, and did now again repeat it, that they might all underſtand the way of making War with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that although invincible abroad, they are eaſie to be conquered at home: For you may ſooner, ſaid he, deprive them of their City then their Empire, and ſooner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyl them of <hi>Italy</hi> then of the Provinces: they were taken by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and almoſt utterly overthrown by my ſelf; neither was I or my
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:62253:207"/>
Army ever overcome untill we departed from them. But when we returned to <hi>Carthage,</hi> the fortune of the War was ſuddenly changed with the place. The Friends of the King were the Contradictors of this Counſel, not reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the profit of it, but fearing leaſt his advice being approved, he ſhould have the firſt place of reſpect with the King. But <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> was not ſo much diſpleaſed with the Councel as with the Author, and feared leſt the glory of the Victory ſhould be <hi>Hannibals</hi> and not his own; all things therefore were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with the various informations of the flatterers; nothing was undertaken either according to Judgement or to Reaſon.

The King therefore beholding his men to give back at the firſt charge, he brought no ſuccor to them in diſtreſs, but was the foremoſt in the flight, and left his Tents full of Riches for the Conquerors; and the <hi>Romans</hi> being
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:62253:208"/>
intent on the plundring of them, he fled into <hi>Aſia,</hi> where he began to repent of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel he neglected, and having called back <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi> he promiſed to act all things according to his counſell.</p>
            <p>In the mean time it was reported to him that <hi>Livius Menemus,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Admiral, did approach, being ſent by the Senate with four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore <hi>Brazen-beaked</hi> ſhips to make a war by Sea. Therefore, before that his aſſociated Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhould revolt to the Enemies, he reſolved to encounter with the Enemy by Sea, hoping by a new Victory to aboliſh the Infamy of the overthrow lately received in <hi>Greece.</hi> The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy being committed to the charge of <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> the Battel was fought. But neither were the <hi>Aſian</hi> Souldiers comparable to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> nor their Ships to theirs, which were armed with braſs on their ſterns; howſoever the overthrow was the leſs by the policy of the General.</p>
            <p>The report of the Victory had not as yet arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the City was therefore in ſuſpence concerning the creating of Conſuls. But who could be a better Commander againſt <hi>Hannibal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> then the brother of <hi>Africanus,</hi> it being the buſineſs of the <hi>Scipio's</hi> to overcome the <hi>Carthaginians? Lucius Scipio</hi> therefore was created Conſul, and his brother <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus</hi> was given as Legate to him, that <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
               <pb n="397" facs="tcp:62253:208"/>
might underſtand that he placed not a greater confidence in conquered <hi>Hannibal,</hi> then they did in the conquering <hi>Scipio's.</hi> The <hi>Scipio's</hi> being buſie in the tranſporting of their Army into <hi>Aſia,</hi> it was reported to them that the War was everywhere already brought to a period, and accordingly they found <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> overcome in a fight by Land, and <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> in a fight by Sea. Therefore at their firſt arrival, <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſent Ambaſſadors to them to deſire peace, and as a peculiar gift to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricanus,</hi> they brought him his Son, whom <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> had taken, as he was tranſporting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a ſmall Bark into <hi>Aſia.</hi> But <hi>Africa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> returned anſwer, that private benefit ought to be diſtinguiſhed from publick, and that the offices due unto him as a Father were of one Nature, and the Offices due unto his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey were of another, which ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred not only above children, but alſo above life it ſelf. Howſoever he declared, that he very thankfully accepted the gift, and out of his own Fortunes would anſwer the munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the King. As for that which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either to Peace or War; he made anſwer, that he could contribute nothing by way of thankfulneſs, neither could he fall in any pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilio from the rights of his Countrey; for his ſon being taken, he never treated with the King concerning his ranſom, nor ſuffered the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:62253:209"/>
Senate to make mention of it, but as it was worthy of the Majeſty of his reſolution, he profeſſed that he would recover him by arms. After this the Articles of the Agreement were drawn up, That <hi>Aſia</hi> ſhould be ſurrendred to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Antiochus</hi> be contented only with the Kingdom of <hi>Syria;</hi> that he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to the <hi>Romans</hi> all his Ships, Priſoners and Renegadoes, and give full ſatisfaction to the <hi>Romans</hi> for their Charges in the VVar. VVhich when it was reported to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> he made anſwer, that he was not ſo overcome as to be content to be diſpoyled of his Kingdom; and alledged, that what the <hi>Romans</hi> had propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him, were rather provocations to war then any inducements unto peace. Great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations therefore were made for war on both ſides; the <hi>Romans</hi> having invaded <hi>Aſia,</hi> and entred into <hi>Ilium,</hi> there was a mutual gratulation between the Inhabitants of <hi>Ilium</hi> and them; the inhabitants of <hi>Ilium</hi> declared that <hi>Aeneas</hi> and other of their Captains proceeded from them; and the <hi>Romans</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that they received their Original of them.

               </hi> that their Nephews having overcome <hi>Africa</hi> and the VVeſt, did challenge <hi>Aſia</hi> as their Hereditary Kingdom, and they
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:62253:209"/>
ſaid the ruine of <hi>Troy</hi> was not to be lamented, which was revived again in a happy race of ſuch Noble ſucceſſors. On the other ſide, the <hi>Romans</hi> with an unſatisfied deſire did behold the Houſhold Gods, and the Cradles of their Anceſtors, and the Temples and Images of the Gods. The <hi>Romans</hi> being departed from <hi>Ilium,</hi> King <hi>Eumenes</hi> did march with Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to them; And not long after the Battel was fought with <hi>Antiochus,</hi> when in the right wing a <hi>Roman</hi> Legion being beaten, did fly back to the Camp with more diſgrace then danger; one of the Tribunes of the Souldiers, <hi>Marcus Aemilius</hi> by name, being left for the defence of the Camp, commanded his Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers immediately to buckle on their Arms, which being done, he did lead them out of the works, and with drawn ſwords did threaten thoſe that fled back, and declared that there ſhould not a man of them be left alive, unleſs they returned to the Battel, and that their own Tents ſhould be more fatall to them then their Enemies ſwords. The Legion being amazed at ſo great a danger, the Soldiers Armed by the Tribune, accompanying them, they returned into the Battel, and having made a great ſlaughter of their Enemies, it was the beginning of the Victory. There were fifty thouſand of the Enemies ſlain, and eleven thouſand taken. <hi>Antiochus</hi> again deſiring peace, there was
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:62253:210"/>
nothing added to the former conditions. <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus</hi> declared that the <hi>Romans</hi> did neither abate their courage being overcome, neither grew they inſolent with the ſucceſs of Victory. They divided the Cities they had taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt their Aſſociates, judging glory more proper for the <hi>Romans</hi> then poſſeſſions; For the glory of the Victory was to be owned by the <hi>Roman</hi> Name, and the luxury of wealth was left to their Aſſociates.</p>

               <hi>Philip</hi> King of the <hi>Macedons;</hi> And there was a great diſpute in the Senate between <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the Son of <hi>Philip,</hi> whom his father had ſent to ſatisfie the Senate, and the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the Cities; the young man being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed with the multitude of complaints made againſt his Father, did on a ſuddain hold his peace; The Senate being moved with his ſhamefaſtneſs (by which in a private condition he before endeered himſelf to all when he was an Hoſtage at <hi>Rome)</hi> did give him the cauſe: and thus <hi>Demetrius</hi> by his modeſty obtained pardon for his Father, not by the right or plea of defence, but by the patronage of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, which was ſignified by the Decree of the Senate, that it might appear that the King was not abſolved, but the Father rather was given to the Son; Which procured to <hi>Demetrius</hi> not the grace of an Ambaſſador, but the hatred of obtrectation.

and afterwards to be ſuſpected by him; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he did object againſt him the freindſhip of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſometimes treaſon againſt his Father. At the laſt he counterfeited that treacheries were prepared by him againſt his perſon to be put ſuddenly in Execution, to the trial and proof whereof the Judges were ſent for, the ſuborned witneſſes examined, and the Charge was proved which was objected againſt him. By thoſe unjuſt proceedings the Father being compelled to parricide, did make ſad all the Court with the execution of his Son. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> being ſlain, <hi>Perſeus</hi> grew not more dutifull but more contumatious againſt his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and carried himſelf not as an heir of the Kingdom, but as the King himſelf, with which <hi>Philip</hi> being offended, did daily more impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently lament the death of <hi>Demetrius:</hi> and ſuſpecting that he was circumvented by the Treachery of <hi>Perſeus,</hi> he cauſed the witneſſes and the Judges to be tormented; And having by this means diſcovered the deceit, he was no leſs afflicted with the wickedneſs of <hi>Perſeus,</hi> then with the innocent death of <hi>Demetrius;</hi> which he was reſolved to have revenged if he had not been prevented by death; For not long after his diſeaſe encreaſing by the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and perplexedneſs of his ſpirit, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, having left great preparations of war againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> which <hi>Perſeus</hi> afterwards
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:62253:213"/>
employed; For he enforced the <hi>Gaules,</hi> called <hi>Scordiſci,</hi> to joyn in league with him, and he had made a great war againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> if he had not died. For the <hi>Gaules,</hi> the war againſt the <hi>Delphians</hi> being unfortunately mannaged, in which they found the power of God to be more great and preſent then the power of their Enemies, having loſt <hi>Brennus</hi> their Generall, ſome part of them did fly into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and ſome part did wander up and down in <hi>Thracia;</hi> From whence in the ſame path in which they marched forth, they returned to their antient Country. Of theſe a conſiderable number did ſit down in the Confluent of the River <hi>Danubius,</hi> and called themſelves by the name of <hi>Scordiſci.</hi> But the <hi>Tectoſagi</hi> when they arrived at their antient Country of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> were there viſited by the Peſtilence, and recovered not their health untill being admoniſhed by the anſwers of the Diviners, they had drowned all their Gold and Silver which they had got by Sacriledge in the Lake of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> all which <hi>Coepio</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul did a long time afterwards take away. There was in all one hundred and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand weight of Gold, and five millions of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which Sacriledge was the cauſe afterwards of the deſtruction of <hi>Coepio</hi> and all his Army.</p>
            <p>The tumult alſo of the <hi>Cambrian</hi> war did follow the <hi>Romans,</hi> as the revenge of the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>The <hi>Dacians</hi> alſo are a Generation of the <hi>Getes,</hi> who when they fought unfortunately under <hi>Olor</hi> their King againſt the <hi>Baſtarni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> were commanded, that when they were in bed, they ſhould, to expiate their ſloth, lay their feet where they ſhould reſt their heads,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:62253:214"/>
and perform thoſe houſhold offices and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to their wives, which their wives before were accuſtomed to do to them. Neither was this cuſtome changed, untill by their courage they had wiped away the old Ignominy which they had received in the war. <hi>Perſeus</hi> when he ſucceeded in the Kingdom of <hi>Philip</hi> his Father, did excite all theſe Nations to joyn in aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with him againſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> In the mean time there did ariſe a war betwixt King <hi>Pruſias,</hi> to whom <hi>Annibal</hi> fled after the peace granted to <hi>Antiochus</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Eumenes;</hi> Which war <hi>Pruſias</hi> firſt began having broken the League through the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he had in <hi>Annibal;</hi> For <hi>Annibal</hi> (when amongſt other of the <hi>Articles</hi> of the Treaty, the <hi>Romans</hi> did demand of <hi>Antiochus</hi> that he ſhould deliver him up unto them) being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed by <hi>Antiochus</hi> of it, did fly to <hi>Crete;</hi> Where having lived for many years a quiet life, and found himſelf envied by reaſon of his exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive wealth, he depoſed in the Temple of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> pitchers filled with Lead, as the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his fortune; and the City being no wayes jealous of him, becauſe they had his fortunes with them as his, he repaired to King <hi>Pruſias,</hi> his Gold which he carried with him being melted and poured into hollow Statues, leaſt his riches being diſcovered ſhould be a hinderance to his life. <hi>Pruſias</hi> being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:62253:214"/>
by King <hi>Eumenes</hi> by land, and intending to try the fortune of a Battel by Sea, <hi>Annibal</hi> by a new invention was the Author of the Victory; For he commanded that all kinds of Serpents ſtored into earthen Veſſels in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Battel ſhould be thrown into the Ships of their Enemies. It ſeemed ridiculous to the Enemies at firſt, that they ſhould Arm themſelves and fight with earthen Pots, who could not encounter their Enemies with ſwords; But when their Ships began to be filled with the Serpents, they were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented with a doubtfull and double danger, and yeilded the Victory to their Enemies. When theſe things were declared at <hi>Rome,</hi> Ambaſſadors were ſent by the Senate to make a reconciliation betwixt both Kings, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the perſon of <hi>Annibal;</hi> but <hi>Annibal</hi> having notice of it, did take poyſon and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the Embaſſy by death. This year was remarkable by the death of three of the moſt famous Generals in the world; <hi>Annibal, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopemenes,</hi> and <hi>Scipio Africanus;</hi> Moſt certain it is that <hi>Annibal</hi> when <hi>Italy</hi> trembled at the thunder of his Arms, did never ſit down when he did eat, nor did ever drink more at once then one pint of wine; and ſo great was his chaſtity amongſt ſo many Captives, that who would deny that he was born in <hi>Africa?</hi> It was undoubtedly a great Argument of his
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:62253:215"/>
moderation, that when he commanded an Army of divers Nations, he was never ſet upon by any treachery of his own men, nor betrayed by the deceit of others, when his Enemies had oftentimes attempted both againſt him.</p>

had given an Anſwer to the Senate, Whether he would have peace or War with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.</hi> This ſharp propoſition did ſo blunt the minde of the King, that he anſwered that he would obey the Senate.

Having ſecretly departed to <hi>Hoſtia,</hi> under the pretence of hunting, he there took ſhipping with the Companions of his flight; and being brought into <hi>Syria,</hi> he was received with the applauſe of all men; and the young Prince being put to death, the Kingdom

from the Kingdom; and rejoycing that he had offered to him an honeſt Title of the War, he determined to reſtore to him his Kingdom: But <hi>Holofernes</hi> having ungratefully made a League with the <hi>Antiochians,</hi> and growing into enmity with <hi>Demetrius,</hi> he took counſel to expel him from the Kingdom, by whom he was reſtored to it; which although <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> underſtood, yet he ſpared his life, that <hi>Ariathes</hi> might not be freed from the War which his brother <hi>Demetrius</hi> threatned to bring upon him; howſoever having apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, he commanded him to be kept bound at <hi>Seleucia;</hi> nevertheleſs the <hi>Antiochians</hi> being no ways terrified at it, did continue in their rebellion againſt him.

therefore forgetting the baſeneſs of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer condition through the wonderful variety of events being attended with the Forces of all the Eaſt, did make war upon <hi>Demetrius:</hi> and having overcome him, did deprive him at once both of his life and Kingdom: Howſoever <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> wanted neither care nor courage to provide for the War; for in the firſt encounter he routed his Adverſary, and the King again renewing the War, he killed afterwards in battel many thouſands of his Enemies; At laſt, with an invincible courage, he fell fighting moſt gallantly amongſt the thickeſt of his Enemies.

ſeeds, and mingled the good with the hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and having ſteeped them all in the juyce of poyſon, he ſent them as a peculiar gift un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his friends. From this ſtudy, he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Art of making of braſs, and in the invention of tools and things belonging to it, and much delighted himſelf with the melting and the minting of pieces in Braſs.

The care of his Kindred did preſerve the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt from the violence of the Mother, who after the death of <hi>Laodice</hi> (for the people did cut her off by reaſon of her cruelty) did enjoy the Kingdom alone. <hi>Mithridates</hi> alſo being taken away by a ſudden death, did leave his Kingdom to his ſon, who was alſo called <hi>Mithridates,</hi> whoſe Greatneſs after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was ſuch, that he excelled in Majeſty, not only all the Kings of his time, but of the former age, and with various victory held war with the <hi>Romans</hi> for the ſpace of ſix and forty years: whom the moſt famous Generals, <hi>Sylla, Lucullus</hi> and others at the firſt, and <hi>Cneius Pompeius</hi> at the laſt did ſo

overcome, that he aroſe alwaies more great and famous in renewing of the war, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more terrible by his loſſes; and at laſt being overcome by no hoſtile force, he died a voluntarie death in his own Kingdom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very old man, and leaving a Son to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him, many ſigns from Heaven did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage his greatneſs to come; for both on that day in which he was born, and on that in which he began his Reign, at both times there did appear a Comet, which for ſeventie nights did ſhine ſo brightly, as all Heaven did ſeem to be in a flame; for by the greatneſs of it, it took up the fourth part of Heaven, and by its ſplendor it overcame the light of the Sun; and when it did either riſe or ſet, it took up the ſpace of four hours.</p>
            <p>Being in his minoritie, he laie open to, and did endure the treacherie of his tutors, for they did put him upon a wild and an unma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged horſe, and did command him not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ride him, but to exerciſe his horſman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to throw darts from him; but <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi> deluding their deſign, by governing the horſe beyond the expectation of his age, they conſpired againſt him by poyſon, which he ſuſpecting, did oftentimes drink Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes, and with ſuch exquiſite remedies did ſo prepare his bodie againſt it, that being an old man, he could not die by poyſon, though
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:62253:228"/>
attempting it. Fearing afterwards, that his enemies would perform with the ſword what they could not diſpatch with poyſon, he pretended he would ſolace himſelf with the recreation of hunting; wherefore for the ſpace of four years, he neither entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Citie, nor came in the Countrie within the roof of any houſe, but wandred in the woods, and took up his lodging on the tops of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall hills, no man knowing in what place he was, being accuſtomed by his ſwiftneſs of foot, either to purſue wild beaſts, or to flie from them, and ſometimes by main force to grapple with them. By which means he both eſchewed all treaſon that was deſigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and hardned his bodie to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durance of virtue. When afterwards he came to the management of the Kingdom, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately contrived not ſo much how to rule it, as how to enlarge it, and by an incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble felicitie overcame the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who were before invincible, for they had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown <hi>Zopyro</hi> the Lieutenant of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, with thirtie thouſand armed men, and killed <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of the Perſians, with two hundred thouſand Souldiers, and routed <hi>Philip</hi> King of the <hi>Macedons.</hi> Being increaſed in his power, he poſſeſſed himſelf of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and not long afterwards of <hi>Cappadocia;</hi> and going privately out of his Kingdom, he ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:62253:229"/>
over all <hi>Aſia</hi> with a few friends, and thereby gained a perfect knowledge of all the Countrie, and of the ſituation of every Citie. After that, he travailed higher over all <hi>Bithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and being already, as it were Lord of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> he contrived where to laie his beſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities for his following victories. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this he returned into his Kingdom, where it being generally noyſed abroad that he was dead, he found a young childe, which in his abſence <hi>Laodice,</hi> who was both his ſiſter and his wife, had brought forth. But after his long travels, amidſt the gratulations both of his ſafe arrival, and of the birth of his ſon, he was in danger of being poyſoned; for his ſiſter <hi>Laod ce</hi> believing he had been dead, did fall into an incontinent life, and attempting to conceal one ſin by committing a greater, did reſolve to welcome him with poyſon; which when <hi>Mithridates</hi> underſtood by her maid, he revenged the treaſon which was plotted, on the author of it. And winter drawing on, he ſpent his time, not at the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, but in the field, not in ſloth, but in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, not amongſt his companions, but with Kings equal to him, either in the horſe-race, or the foot-race, or by trying the ſtrength of bodie. He alſo by daily exerciſe hardned his Armie to the ſame patience of labour, and being unconquered himſelf, he by theſe acts
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:62253:229"/>
made his Armie invincible. Having after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made a league with <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> and having overcome it, he did ſhare it with his companion <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes.</hi> The Senate being informed that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlagonia</hi> was again in the poſſeſſion of Kings, they ſent Embaſſadors to them both, to command them to reſtore the Nation to her former condition. <hi>Mithridates</hi> when he believed that he was equall to the <hi>Roman</hi> Greatneſs, did return a proud anſwer, which was, that he received his Kingdom by inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and did much wonder that they ſhould trouble themſelves with a Controverſie which did not belong unto them; and being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing terrified with their threatnings, he ſeized upon <hi>Galatia.

<pb n="445" facs="tcp:62253:232"/>
This being made known in <hi>Aſia, Mithridates</hi> being to make war againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> did enter into a league with <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes,</hi> and articled with him, that the Cities and the fields ſhould be the part of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> but the Captives and all the movables ſhould be the portion of <hi>Tigranes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Mithridates</hi> having pondered with himſelf how great a war he had raiſed, ſent ſome Ambaſſadors to the <hi>Cymbrians,</hi> and others to the <hi>Gallogrecians,</hi> to the <hi>Sarmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Baſtarnians,</hi> to deſire aſſiſtance of them.

After this, having called his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to a general Aſſembly, with ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations he did excite them to the <hi>Roman,</hi> or rather the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Wars.

For his own part, he affirmed he had a confidence of the Victory, if they had a generous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to fight: and it was known as much to his ſoldiers as to himſelf, that the <hi>Romans</hi>

that were to be overcome, were they who overthrew <hi>Aquilius</hi> in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> and <hi>Malthinus</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia;</hi> But if other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples would perſwade more then his own Experience, he had heard that <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of <hi>Epirus</hi> commanding an Army of not above five thouſand <hi>Macedons,</hi> did in three battails overthrow the <hi>Romans.</hi> He had heard that <hi>Annibal</hi> had continued a Conquerour in <hi>Italy</hi> for the ſpace of ſixteen years together, and that he might have taken the City it ſelf, were he not hindred by a faction of emulating and envious ſpirits at home, and not by any power of the <hi>Romans.</hi> He had heard he ſaid, how the people of <hi>Tranſalpine Gaule</hi> had invaded <hi>Italy,</hi> and poſſeſſed themſelves of the moſt and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Cities therein, and had there larger territories then they enjoyed in <hi>Aſia,</hi> which was ſaid to be but weak in compariſon of <hi>Rome,</hi> neither was <hi>Rome</hi> only overcome by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> but it was taken alſo by them, and nothing was left them but only the top of one hill, from whence they were removed not by war, but by money. But as for the <hi>Gauls</hi> (whoſe Name was ſo terrible to the <hi>Romans)</hi> he had a great part of them amongſt his own Auxiliaries; for the <hi>Gauls</hi> he ſaid, who do inhabit <hi>Aſia,</hi> do only differ from thoſe in <hi>Italy</hi> by the diſtance of place, but

<pb n="455" facs="tcp:62253:237"/>
               <hi>Rome.</hi> At the ſame time King <hi>Ptolomy</hi> being dead in <hi>Egypt,</hi> his Kingdom and his ſiſter Queen <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who was his wife alſo, was by Embaſſadors preſented to that <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who was King of <hi>Cyrene.</hi> At which <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> much rejoyced, but eſpecially that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conteſtation he ſhould be poſſeſſed in his Brothers Kingdom, to which he knew that the Son of his Brother was appointed both by his mother <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and by the favor of the Princes. Not long after (all being diſpleaſed with him) he no ſooner entred into <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> and commanded all the favourers of the young childe to be put to death; and on that very day in which he married his mother, he killed the young Prince in the mothers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of him, in the midſt of the Banquet and the ſolemnitie of this marriage; and thus he aſcended his ſiſters bed, bloodie with the ſlaughter of her Son. Afterwards, he was not more milde unto the people who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him unto the ſucceſſion of the Kingdom; for licentiouſneſs being given to the forreign Souldiers, all things did daily flow with blood, and at laſt (having by force raviſhed her daughter, and taken her afterwards into mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage) he divorced himſelf from his ſiſter. With which crueltie the people being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, they ſtole away into ſeveral places, and having wilfully baniſhed themſelves, they
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:62253:238"/>
forſook their Country for the fear of death. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> therefore with his own ſervants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left alone in ſo great a City, when he perceived himſelf to be a King not of men, but of empty houſes, did publiſh a declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſolliciting all Strangers to inhabit the City, who coming in great numbers to him, he not long after did go himſelf to meet <hi>Scipio Africanus, Spurius Mummius,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Metellus</hi> the Ambaſſadors of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who made a viſitation into thoſe parts to obſerve the condition and kingdoms of their Confederates.</p>
            <p>But he appeared as ridiculous to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> as bloody to all the Citizens; for he was deformed in countenance, and ſhort in ſtature, and by the obeſeneſs of his ſtrutting belly, more like unto a Beaſt then to a man; which filthineſs, his tiffanies and light gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he had on did encreaſe, as if thoſe parts offered themſelves to be ſeen as through a vail, which Modeſty commands us with diligence to conceal.</p>
            <p>After the departure of the Ambaſſadors, amongſt whom while <hi>Africanus</hi> walked forth to behold the City, he became a ſpectacle of honor himſelf to the <hi>Alexandrians; Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> (being hated by the Strangers alſo that were become Citizens) did ſilently for fear of treachery, depart into baniſhment, having
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:62253:238"/>
taken with him his ſon which he had begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on his ſiſter, and his new wife whom he had married, having put away her mother, and having with money contracted a merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary army, be made war at once on his Siſter, and his Country; After this, having ſent for his eldeſt ſon from <hi>Cyrene,</hi> that the <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drians</hi> ſhould not make him their King againſt him, he put him to death; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the people pulled down his Statues and Images, which he conceiving to be done in favour of his Siſter, he ſlow that Son alſo whom he begot on her, and having divided his Body into ſeveral parts, and put it into a Coffin, he ſent it to his Mother on that day whereon ſhe made yeerly a great feaſt for the ſolemnity of his Birth; which was a ſight not only grievous and much lamented by the Mother, but by all the City alſo, and brought ſo much grief in the height of all their mirth at the banket, that all the Court was filled with a great and a ſuddain lamentation.</p>
            <p>The Inclinations of the Princes being therefore turned from feaſting into mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they ſhewed to the people the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred body of the young Prince, and by the murder of his own ſon did declare what they ought themſelves to expect of their King. <hi>Cleopatra</hi> having ended the dayes of her mourning for the death of her ſon, when
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:62253:239"/>
ſhe perceived that ſhe was oppreſſed by a war alſo from her late husband her brother, ſhe by her Ambaſſadors demanded aid of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> whoſe own fortunes were as various as they were memorable; For when <hi>Demetrius</hi> made war againſt the <hi>Parthians,</hi> as mention hath been made before, and in many encounters overcame them, being on a ſudden ſurrounded by an Ambuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cado, having loſt his Army, he was taken himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arſacides</hi> King of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> in the greatneſs of his royal ſpirit having ſent him into <hi>Hyrcania,</hi> did not only honour him with the Reſpect due unto a King, but gave him his daughter alſo in marriage, and promiſed to reſtore unto him the Kingdom of <hi>Syria,</hi> which in his abſence <hi>Trypho</hi> became Maſter of. After his death, <hi>Demetrius</hi> deſpayring of return, and not enduring Captivity, and loathing a private life, although a fatt one and a wealthy, did contrive with himſelf how he might eſcape into his own Kingdom. His friend <hi>Calamander</hi> was both his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and his perſwader to undertake this journey, who after his Captivity in <hi>Syria,</hi> having hired a guide, did bring him diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in a <hi>Parthians</hi> habit through the deſarts of <hi>Arabia</hi> into <hi>Babylon;</hi> But <hi>Phrahartes</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Arſacides,</hi> by the ſwiftneſs of his
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:62253:239"/>
horſes did cauſe him to be brought back, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overtaken by the compendiouſneſs of their goings; Being brought unto the King, he not only pardoned <hi>Calamander,</hi> but gave him a reward for his fidelity to his friend; but having very roundly checked <hi>Demetrius,</hi> he ſent him to his wife in <hi>Hyrcania,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that he ſhould be obſerved by a ſtricter guard: In proceſs of time, when the children which he had by his wife, did ſeem to be a ſtronger obligation on him for his fidelity, he did endeavour to make his eſcape again, having the ſame friend to be his Companion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by the ſame infelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he was taken again near unto the bounds of his own Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and being the ſecond time brought unto the King, he was looked upon as a hated man, and not ſuffered to come into his preſence. But being then alſo diſmiſſed to his wife and children, he was ſent back into <hi>Hyrcania</hi> and confined to a City, upon a penalty not to go out of it, and in the reproach of his childiſh levity, was laden with golden ſhackles. But no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> nor reſpect of any conſanguinity was the occaſion of this their clemency towards <hi>Demetrius,</hi> but becauſe the <hi>Parthians</hi> affected the Kingdom of <hi>Syria,</hi> they determined to make uſe of <hi>Demetrius</hi> againſt his brother <hi>Antiochus,</hi> as the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:62253:240"/>
of time or the fortune of the war ſhould require. This being underſtood, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> thinking it diſcretion to take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to begin the war, did conduct his Army, which he had hardened with many neighbouring wars againſt the <hi>Parthians;</hi> But his preparation for luxury, was no leſs then for the carrying on of the war, for three thouſand of his black guard followed eight thouſand of the armed men; amongſt whom alſo, a great number were Cooks, Bakers and Players<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all of them ſo abounding with Gold and Silver, that the common Soldiers had their ſhoes enterlaced with Gold, and trod upon that mettal; for the love of which all other Nations do fight with ſteel. In their Kitchings alſo their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments were of ſilver, as if they advanced rather to keep ſome great feaſt, then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute a war.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anticohus</hi> approaching, many Kings of the Eaſt did meet him, who in deteſtation of the <hi>Parthian</hi> Pride, delivered themſelves and their kingdoms to him. Not long after the battail began, and <hi>Antiochus</hi> having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown his Enemies in three ſeveral fields, and poſſeſſed himſelf of <hi>Babylon,</hi> he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Antiochus</hi> the great; And the people in all the neighbouring Nations revolting to him, there was nothing left to the <hi>Parthians</hi>
               <pb n="461" facs="tcp:62253:240"/>
but their own Country, and the boundaries of it. At the ſame time <hi>Phrahartes</hi> ſent <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> into <hi>Syria</hi> with a conſiderable Army of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> to poſſeſs himſelf of his own Kingdom, that upon that account <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> ſhould be called off from <hi>Parthia</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his own Intereſts. And becauſe he could not overcome him by ſtrength, he did every where attempt him by Stratagems. The Army of <hi>Antiochus</hi> abounding with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, the winter coming on, he quartered his Army in ſeveral Cities, which was the cauſe of his deſtruction; For when the Cities beheld themſelves oppreſſed with the billet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; the injuries of the ſoldiers, they revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their old Maſters the <hi>Parthians</hi> and on a prefixed day, by treacheries they did all aſſault the divided Army, that thereby one might be diſabled to bring aſſiſtance unto the other. Which when <hi>Antiochus</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, being reſolved to relieve thoſe who were next unto him, he advanced with that party which with him had their winter quarters.</p>
            <p>In his way, he encountred with the King of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> againſt whom in his perſon he fought more couragio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

fear, he was ſlain. <hi>Phrahartes</hi> did beſtow upon him the ſolemnitie of magnificent funerals, after the manner of Kings, and (being taken with the love of the Virgin) did marrie the daughter of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> which <hi>Antiochus</hi> had brought along with him, and began to repent that ever he ſuffered <hi>Demetrius</hi> to go away; and having ſent in full ſpeed ſeveral troops of horſe to fetch him back, they found him in ſafetie in his own Kingdom, fearing the ſame deſign of <hi>Phrahartes,</hi> and having in vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted all things to reduce him, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their own King.</p>

ſhe raged, and his own coſen German, and the mother of children betwixt them; to this neer relation of conſanguinitie, he added the ſuperſtition of the Temple to which ſhe fled to protect her ſelf, and that the gods were ſo much the more religiouſly to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, as they were more propitious and favourable to him in his conqueſt; beſides, ſhe being ſlain, nothing was diminiſhed of the ſtrength and power of <hi>Cyricaenus.</hi> But by how much <hi>Gryphus</hi> was the more unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, by ſo much her ſiſter was inflamed with a female pertinatiouſneſs, conceiving thoſe words of his proceeded from love and not from pittie. Therefore having called the Souldiers to her, ſhe ſent them her ſelf to kill her ſiſter, who entering into the Temple, when they could not drag her out of it, they cut off her hands, holding faſt on the Image of the goddeſs, and in her laſt words having curſed the Author of the Parricide, the gods beſides being violated, ſhe died but to revenge her ſelf; for not long after, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther battaile being fought, and <hi>Cyricaenus</hi> Conquerour, he took <hi>Gryphina</hi> the wife of <hi>Gryphus</hi> priſoner, who killed her ſiſter, and by her death did parentate to the Ghoſts of his wife.

            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> being terrified with this cruelty of his Mother, did alſo himſelf forſake her, preferring a ſafe and quiet life above a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Cleopatra</hi> fearing that her eldeſt Son <hi>Ptolomy</hi> ſhould be aſſiſted by <hi>Cyricaenus</hi> to be by him reſtored into <hi>Egypt,</hi> did ſend great Ayds to <hi>Gryphus,</hi> and <hi>Seleuce</hi> to be his wife, who muſt now be eſpouſed to the Enemy of her former husband, and by Ambaſſadors called back <hi>Alexander</hi> her Son into the Kingdom, whoſe life when by treachery ſhe contrived to take away, being prevented by him, ſhe was killed herſelf, and yielded up her
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:62253:246"/>
ſpirit not by fate but parricide. Worthy ſhe was of this infamy of death, who drove her own Mother from the bed of her husband, and poſſeſſed her room in it, and ſucceſſively made her two Daughters Widows after their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate marriage with their own Brothers, who baniſhed one of them, &amp; afterwards made war againſt him, and having taken the Kingdom alſo from the other, did endeavor to put him to death by treachery.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Alexander</hi> had the leiſure to repent of this horrible act; for when ever it was known that the Mother was ſlain by the violence of the Son, he was forced into baniſhment by the people, and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> being called back, the Kingdom was reſtored to him, who would neither make War with his Mother, nor take away by Arms from his brother what he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did firſt poſſeſs. Whiles theſe things were thus carryed, his brother begotten on a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine, to whom his Father in his Will did leave the Kingdom of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> did deceaſe, having made the people of <hi>Rome</hi> his Heir; for now the fortune of <hi>Rome</hi> being not content with the bounds of <hi>Italy,</hi> did begin to extend it ſelf to the Kingdoms of the Eaſt.

            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Italie</hi> were firſt the <hi>Aborigines,</hi> whoſe King <hi>Saturn</hi> was repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be of ſo great Juſtice, that no man ſerved under him, neither had he any thing private to himſelf, but all things were undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and common unto all as one patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to them. In the memorie of which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, it was provided that in the <hi>Saturna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> the Intereſts of every one being made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, the ſervants did everywhere in their banquets, lie down along with their maſters. Therefore <hi>Italie</hi> was called <hi>Saturnia,</hi> after the Name of their King; and the Hill where <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> did inhabite, being by <hi>Jupiter</hi> driven from his own Seat, is called the <hi>Capitol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third King who Reigned in <hi>Italie</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, was <hi>Faunus,</hi> in whoſe time <hi>Evander</hi> came into <hi>Italie</hi> from <hi>Pallantheum,</hi> a Citie of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> with a ſmall Retinue, to whom <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> did bountifully aſſign certain fields and a Hill, which he afterwards called the Hill <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine.</hi> At the foot of this Hill he errected a Temple to <hi>Lycaeus,</hi> whom the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Pan,</hi> and the <hi>Romans Lupercus.</hi> The Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of the god is cloathed with the skin of a Goat, in which habit they rnn up and down in <hi>Rome</hi> at the <hi>Lupercals. Faunus</hi> had
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:62253:261"/>
a wife whoſe name was <hi>Fatua,</hi> who being daily filled with a divine Spirit, did as it were in a furie preſage of things to come, from whence thoſe that to this daie are inſpired, are ſaid to <hi>fatuate,</hi> or to foretell the events of Fates to come. <hi>Latinus</hi> conceived in whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, was the ſon of the daughter of <hi>Faunus,</hi> and of <hi>Hercules,</hi> who at that time having kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Geryon,</hi> did drive his Cattle through <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,</hi> the rewards of his Victorie. In the Reign of <hi>Latinus, Aeneas</hi> came from <hi>Ilium</hi> into <hi>Italie, Troy</hi> being ſacked and deſtroyed by the Greeks. He was immediately entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with war, and drawing forth his Armie to battail, <hi>Latinus</hi> ſending a Trumpet to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him, was poſſeſſed with ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of him, that he received him into the ſocietie of the Kingdom, and <hi>Lavinia</hi> being given him in marriage, he was the ſon in law to <hi>Latinus.</hi> After this they had both war with <hi>Turnus</hi> King of the <hi>Rutilians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Lavinia</hi> who before the arrival of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> was betrothed to him, was denied him in marriage. In this war both <hi>Turnus</hi> and <hi>Latinus</hi> periſhed; therefore when <hi>Aeneas</hi> by the Law of Arms commanded over both people, he builded a Citie after the name of his wife <hi>Lavinia.</hi> He afterwards made war againſt <hi>Mezentius</hi> King of the <hi>Tuſcans,</hi> in which dying himſelf, his Son <hi>Aſcanius</hi> did
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:62253:261"/>
ſucceed him, who having abandoned the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <hi>Lavinium,</hi> did build long <hi>Alba,</hi> which for three hundred years was the Metropolis of the Kingdom. After the Reign of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Kings of that Citie, at the laſt <hi>Numitor</hi> and <hi>Amulius</hi> did enjoy the Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when <hi>Amulius</hi> had diſenthroned <hi>Numitor,</hi> who was the more reſpected by reaſon of his age, he politickly devoted his Daughter <hi>Rhea</hi> to a perpetual Virginitie, that there ſhould be no more children out of the race of <hi>Numitor,</hi> to take revenge on him for the uſurpation of the Kingdom; and the better to conceal his deſign, a pretence of honor was added to the injurie, and ſhe ſeemed not ſo much to be a perſon condemned, as a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs elected. Therefore being ſhut up in a Wood ſacred to <hi>Mars,</hi> ſhe brought forth two children at one birth; it is uncertain whether begotten by <hi>Mars</hi> or by inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence with another. <hi>Amulius</hi> his fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing multiplyed by the birth of the two boys, did command them to be expoſed, and laded <hi>Rhea</hi> with chains, by the injurie and burden whereof ſhe not long after died. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune proſpicient to the Original of <hi>Rome,</hi> did provide a Woolf to give ſuck to the children, who having loſt her whelps, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to emptie her teats, did offer her ſelf as a Nurſe to the Infants, and returning often
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:62253:262"/>
to the children, as to her own young ones; <hi>Fauſtulus</hi> the Shepherd obſerved it, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken them from the Woolf, he brought them up amongſt the flocks in a rural life. It is by manifeſt arguments believed, that the boys were begotten by <hi>Mars,</hi> both becauſe they were born in his Grove, and were nurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo by a Woolf, which is a creature under the protection of <hi>Mars.</hi> One of the boys was called <hi>Remus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and the other <hi>Romulus;</hi> being at mans eſtate, in their daily exerciſes amongſt the Shepherds, they did encreaſe their ſtrength and ſwiftneſs, and did often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with prompt induſtrie drive away the Theeves that came to ſteal the Cattle. It ſo fell out that <hi>Remus</hi> at laſt was taken by them, and as if he was himſelf the ſame which he did forbid in another, he was brought unto the King, and accuſed to have been accuſtomed to rob the flocks of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitor;</hi> wherefore the King did deliver him to <hi>Numitor</hi> to be revenged of him. But <hi>Numitor</hi> being moved with the flouriſh of his youth, and his ſuſpition calling to his minde his Nephew expoſed, when the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the ſavor of his daughter, and the time at which he was expoſed, did agree with his age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and held him very doubtful: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold then <hi>Fauſtulus</hi> came unexpectedly with <hi>Romulus,</hi> by whom the Original of the

               </gap>oys being underſtood, the plot immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>y was contrived; the young men were armed or the revenge of their mothers death, and <hi>Numitor</hi> for his Kingdom taken from him. <hi>Amulius</hi> being ſlain, the Kingdom was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tored to <hi>Numitor,</hi> and the Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Neighbors alſo diſdaining that their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhould be married unto Shepherds, the <hi>Sabin</hi> Virgins were taken away by violence, and the Nations about them being overcome by Arms, they firſt obtained the Empire of <hi>Italie,</hi> and afterwards of the world.</p>
            <p>In thoſe times it was the cuſtom of Kings, inſtead of Diadems, to uſe Spears, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call Scepters; for in the beginning of time, the Antients worſhipped Spears for the immortal Gods; in the memorie whereof, Spears at this daie are added to the Images of the gods. In the times of King <hi>Tarquin,</hi> the youth of the <hi>Phocenſians</hi> being brought into the mouth of <hi>Tyber;</hi> did enter into friendſhip with the <hi>Romans;</hi> and ſayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thence into the furtheſt parts of <hi>France,</hi> they builded <hi>Maſsilia</hi> betwixt the <hi>Ligurians</hi> and other fierce Nations of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and performed great atchievements, whiles by Arms they either protected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

            <p>For the <hi>Phocenſians</hi> (being compelled by the barrenneſs of their ſoyl) did live with more induſtrie and alacritie on the Seas, then on the Land, and did lead their lives ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by fiſhing, ſomtimes by trading, but for the moſt part by Pyracie, which at that time was accounted honorable. Therefore having ſailed into the fartheſt Coaſts of all the Ocean, they came into a harbor at the mouth of the River of <hi>Rhone,</hi> and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the pleaſure of the place, on their return to their own Countrie, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to others what they had ſeen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they ſtirred up many men to undertake that voyage. <hi>Furius</hi> and <hi>Peranus</hi> were the Admiral and Vice-Admiral of their Fleet.

Therefore all the Suitors being invited to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the <hi>Ligurians</hi> envying the proſperitie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Citie, did wearie the <hi>Grecians</hi> with daily wars, who in beating back the dangers from them, became ſo glorious, that their enemies being overthrown, they ſent forth many Colonies into the neighboring Countries; from theſe the <hi>Gauls</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, their barbarous manners being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quite laid aſide, or more civilized, they learned the uſe of a more refined courſe of life; as to exerciſe and mitigate the field s with ploughs, and to environ and to defend their Cities with Walls. They then began to live not only by Arms, but Laws; they learned to prune the Vine, and to plant the Olive. And ſo great a beautie and order
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:62253:264"/>
was obſerved both in diſpoſing of the things and men; that <hi>Greece</hi> did not ſeem to come into <hi>Gallia,</hi> but <hi>Gallia</hi> to be tranſlated into <hi>Greece. Senanus</hi> King of the <hi>Segoregians</hi> being dead, from whom the place was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to build the Citie, his Son <hi>Comma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> did ſucceed him in the Kingdom, and a certain King affirming that the time would come, when <hi>Maſsilia</hi> ſhould be the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the neighboring people; did argue that it might be ſuppreſſed in the Original, leſt growing ſtrong by degrees, it might at laſt ſuppreſs him, who gave both an Original and an encreaſe unto it; to the performance whereof he inſerted this following Fable.</p>
            <p>A Bitch great with whelp, did petition to a Shepherd to give her room in which to bring forth her young ones; which being obtained, ſhe petitioned to him again to grant her the ſame room to bring up her young ones; at the laſt her whelps growing into age, and ſhe being ſupported with her Domeſtick numbers, did challenge the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie of the place unto her ſelf.</p>
            <p>So the <hi>Maſsilians</hi> who do now appear to be but ſtrangers, may in a ſhort time become Lords of the Countrie.</p>
            <p>The King being incited by the application of this ſtorie, did attempt by deceits to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the <hi>Maſsilians.</hi> Therefore on the
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:62253:264"/>
Holy-day dedicated to <hi>Flora,</hi> he ſent many luſtie and able men into the Citie, to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained as gueſts, and gave order that many more ſhould be brought in Carts, in which they ſhould be covered with green leaves, whiles he himſelf with his Armie lay hid in the next hills, that they might be preſent when the opportunitie ſerved for their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh, and the Gates in the night being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to receive their Carts, they might with armed men invade the Citie drowned in wine and ſleep.</p>
            <p>But a woman, who by the contiguitie of blood had neer relation to the King, being accuſtomed to play the wanton with one of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> pittying the lovelineſs of the young man in her embraces of him, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the deceit unto him, and deſired him to decline the danger. He immediately inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Magiſtrates with it; and the prepared treacheries being diſcovered, the <hi>Ligurians</hi> were apprehended, and lying hid were drawn out of the Carts, and being all put to death, deceits were prepared for the deceitful King, and ſeven thouſand of the <hi>Ligurians</hi> were ſlain with the King himſelf.</p>
            <p>After this, the <hi>Maſsilians</hi> did alwaies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Holy-daies keep their Gates ſhut, and obſerved a ſtrict watch, and had Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels to walk their Rounds on the walls, and
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:62253:265"/>
to take notice of ſtrangers, and to demand the word; and thus, as if they were inviro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with war, they managed their Citie in the times of peace; ſo punctually good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions are obſerved there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not ſo much by the neceſſitie of the times, as by the cuſtom of doing well.</p>
            <p>After this the <hi>Maſsilians</hi> had for many years great wars with the <hi>Ligurians</hi> and the <hi>Gauls,</hi> which both increaſed the glorie of the Citie, and amongſt the neighboring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, made famous the valor of the <hi>Greeks</hi> by their multiplied Victories.</p>
            <p>And when a new war aroſe from <hi>Carthage,</hi> they having ſurprized the Buſſes of their Fiſhermen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they often overthrew the Armie of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and gave peace unto them, being conquered. They entred into a league with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and almoſt from the firſt foundation of their Citie, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved their friendſhip with the <hi>Romans</hi> with great fidelitie, and in all their wars induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſſiſted their aſſociats, which both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the confidence of their ſtrength, and purchaſed them peace from their enemies.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Maſsilia</hi> flouriſhed therefore with the ſame of their atchievements, the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their wealth, and the glorie of their ſtrength, the neighboring people in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring multitudes did gather themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:62253:265"/>
to root out the name of the <hi>Maſsili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as to extinguiſh a common fire. By the conſent of all, <hi>Caramandus</hi> was choſen Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, who when he beſieged the Citie with a powerful Armie of choſen men, being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted in his ſleep with the viſion of a hard favoured woman, who called her ſelf a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, he offered peace of his own accord to the <hi>Maſsilians,</hi> and having deſired that he might be allowed the libertie to enter into their Citie, and to worſhip their gods, when he came unto the Temple of <hi>Minerva,</hi> and beheld in the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rtalls of it, the image of the goddeſs which he beheld before in his ſleep, he immediately cried out, that that was ſhe who did affright him in the night, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to raiſe the ſiege; and having gratulated the <hi>Maſsilians,</hi> that the immortal gods had care of them, he entred into a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual league with them, having recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the goddeſs with a chain of Gold.</p>
            <p>Peace being obtained, and their ſecuritie eſtabliſhed, the Embaſſadors of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilians</hi> having returned from <hi>Delphos,</hi> to which place being ſent, they had brought gifts unto <hi>Apollo,</hi> did inform them that they heard in the way that the Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> was taken by the <hi>Gauls</hi> and ſet on fire; they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be much afflicted at the loſs, and did proſecute it with a publick funeral, and ſent

their Gold, both what they had in private as well as publick, to make up the ſumme, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving underſtood that they had redeemed their Citie and their peace with money from the <hi>Gauls.</hi> For which benefit, it was decreed by the Senate, that they ſhould be made free of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a place allowed them in the publick Spectacles, and a ſolemn league was again confirmed perpetually to be obſerved with equal Intereſts on both ſides.

There was in him a vaſte knowledge of Letters and of great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which made him to give ſuch a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to Philoſophers and the wiſeſt men of <hi>Greece;</hi> He was but ſhort of ſtature, and not ſtrong, yet able through exerciſe. There were in him ſome things which did diminiſh the glory of his vertues, as his immoderate deſire of praiſe, his ſuperſtitious worſhip of the gods, and a valor more raſh and daring then became an Emperour, whoſe ſafety being the common good of all men, is diligently to be provided at all times, but eſpecially in War. The ardent deſire of glory did ſo much overcome him, that he could not be diſſwaded by an Earthquake nor many other preſages from his Expedition into <hi>Perſia,</hi> no nor by ſeeing in the night a great Globe to fall down as if Heaven fell with it, could he be induced to appoint a more happy time for that War.</p>
