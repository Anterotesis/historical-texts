            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Anſwers to the Reaſons given againſt the Bill for Erecting CO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RTS of CONSCIENCE within the <hi>Weekly Bills</hi> of Mortality.</head>
            <p>
               <label>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the firſt.</label> The Bill only intends to take away Tryals by Jury where the Cauſe is under 40 <hi>s.</hi> which will be a very great eaſe to the Subject, and ſave the Plantiff and Defendant above twice the Debt in Arreſts, putting in ſpecial Bail, and Attorneys and other Fees in proceeding in the Inferiour Courts. And the matter if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 40 <hi>s.</hi> damages for Words or Blows where the Plaintiff and Defendant are of the pooreſt ſort of People that pay no Taxes or Duties to the King, Church, or Poor, and therefore can expect no greater Damages, may with much eaſe be decided by three honeſt Gentlemen of the Neighbourhood, and thereby the Parties fairly reconciled, to follow their Lawful Callings, and conſequently be preſerved from falling to the Charge of the Pariſh.</p>
            <p>
               <label>To the Second.</label> The Parliament in paſſing this Act, doth not prejudice the Law in its Fundamentals, but only puts a Check to the Exorbitancies and Exactions of many perſons in Inferiour Courts, who aim only at Arreſts, and the bringing the Poor and Ignorant People into their Clutches; and are much ſtartled at this Act, fearing the Poor will thereby be relieved againſt their Rapine and Violence.</p>
            <p>
               <label>To the Third.</label> This Bill doth not intend to take away the Tryal of Cauſes in any Court Baron where the proceedings are originally by Summons and Diſtringas under 40 <hi>s.</hi> wherein the Defendant is at liberty either to appear or comply with the Plaintiff by the return of the Summons: nor is the power Veſted only in Shop-keepers, (although in <hi>London</hi> they are moſtly ſuch) for therein the Reaſoner is much miſtaken, by aiming to diſparage the intended Judges not named, and thereby concludes that the Parliament can find out no Judges but Shop-keepers, within this intentionally to be reformed Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>
               <label>To the Fourth.</label> No Juſtices of Aſſizes ever ride in this ſmall charitable Circuit; and it's eaſily demonſtrated that the Parliament may, if they pleaſe, find hundreds of honeſt and able Gentlemen to reconcile ſuch Petty Differences, and ſave the miſpending 5 <hi>l.</hi> to recover ſometimes 40, 20, 10, or 5 <hi>s.</hi> and ſuch like petty ſumms, with the Defence of the Suit, which are the accuſtomed Fees for Plaintiff and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant in any ſuch Suit.</p>
            <p>
               <label>To the Fifth.</label> The fifth Reaſon bears little ſence to preſume that the Parliament will appoint Indigent Perſons to be Judges in the Coure of Conſcience; neither will the Parliament appoint Tally-men, Brokers, or ſuch like Perſons, to be Judges or Commiſſioners, who lend ſuch minute ſumms at great and coſtly Exactions, which hath been a fit bait for Inſeriour Arreſting Juriſdictions; nor can it be believed, that the Judges of the Court of Conſcience will fight or ſcold with their pooreſt Neighbours.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Note.</label> That the Reaſoner obſerves that the Act for the Courts of Conſcience deſigns the preventing of the expence of great ſumms in petty Suits; and then ſpeaks of the eaſe and quickneſs in the recovery in ſuch Courts, and of a Summons or Notice to the Defendant, where the Defendant may tender the money due, and the Plaintiff cannot recover Coſts after ſuch Tender, which is true, but never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth the Exactions and Extortions occaſioned by Arreſts, in Inferiour Courts, which are the great oppreſſion and grievance now under Conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <label>To the Sixth.</label> The ſixth Reaſon tells us, That the Common Law was alwayes extream Careful to preſesve the Kings Peace, which is hoped, will be alwayes <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. And the Court of Conſcience <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Diſeretion and Integrity will reconcile more petty Contracts and Quarrels amongſt the Poor, than ever the Cruelty of Inferiour Arreſting Courts have done or will do, by ruining both parties in ſuch Suits.</p>
            <p>It is agreed, that Juries are of the Neighbourhood, and may be challenged, or have an Attaint brought againſt them, or the Party grieved may have a new Tryal, in which Caſes (Challenge only excepted) the remedy is worſe than the diſeaſe; for the Jurors in Inferiour Courts are ſuch mean perſons, that if an Attaint ſhould be brought againſt them, and they like to be found guilty, it's doubted, few of them would ſtand the Teſt; and the conſequence of the Charges to bring an Attaint, or procure a new Tryal, when the thing in demand is under 40 <hi>s.</hi> or 20 <hi>s.</hi> is obvious to every perſon or unlearned Solicitor, that will ſcorn to ſqueeze his Clients Pocket to ſuch little purpoſe. And as to two of the Kings Menial Servants conteſting for 40 <hi>s.</hi> they may proceed in the old Court, called the <hi>Marſhalls Court,</hi> which was inſtituted only for his Majeſties Servants, and will continue its Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>It is further anſwered, That matters of 40 <hi>s.</hi> and under, which will be moſt relieved in this intended wholſome Court of Conſcience, cannot be difficult, nor any of the matters in the foregoing Clauſe, unleſs the Parliament had put in weaker Judges, than thoſe that make Irrational Objections: and it is plainly evident, that he or they which give the Reaſons againſt the Courts of Conſcience, declare ſo much of his or their intereſt in oppreſſing the Poor by vexatious Suits, that every indifferent perſon will conclude, the Reaſons anſwer themſelves; and the ſubſequent Objections againſt this intended healing Court, muſt certainly flow from <hi>white-Chappel</hi> or <hi>Southwarke,</hi> where ſome perſons there concerned, may much dread a Court of Conſcience, untill they know what it means, and receive the fruit and comfort by the experience thereof.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have in kindneſs followed the Reaſoner, or elſe I might have only given him this enſuing Account: For I muſt conclude, that he writ his Reaſons, (if ſuch they be) before he ſaw the Bill.</p>
            <p>For that Clamour, about Encouraging of Subjects to break the Kings Peace, is wholly cauſeleſs: For the Bill that is humbly propoſed for the Courts of Conſcience, craves Relief only in Matters of Small Detts under 40 <hi>s.</hi> And leaves the buſineſs of Treſpaſſes to the Wiſdom of the High Court of Parliament, <hi>Whether to be in the Act or not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That exception of Enticing people to forſwear themſelves, is as groundleſs as Envious: For the Bill makes proviſion againſt ſuch danger, by leaving of it to the Integrity and Diſcretion of the Commiſſioners.</p>
            <p>For his laſt Charge, That the ſaid Bill is contrary to Law and <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and that it will Revive Antiquated Controverſies, which the Law hath Buried in Oblivion, would never have been Expreſſed much leſs in Print) but by one that is ſo miſerable a <hi>Pauper</hi> in Reaſon, Conſcience and Experience, as to dare to Declame againſt ſo jood a Work, that was manag'd by City Law above fourſcore years: And afterwards by two Parliaments in King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign Eſtabliſied and made a Statute Law, with ſo hearty a Concurrence, that they were pleaſed to charge the Contemners of it, as Enemies to the Gody meaning of the ſaid Act, as may more at large appear in the Act of the third of King <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore further to trace his Trivial and Biaſs'd Cavils', were to fill under the ſame Guilt of Ignorance and Preſumption with the Reaſoner, by too far diſcuſſing what hath been Enacted and Commended by the Supream Authority.</p>
