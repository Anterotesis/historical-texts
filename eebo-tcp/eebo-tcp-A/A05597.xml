         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This labourious Worke then of mine,</hi> depending on this

quam auriti decem) <hi>being the perfit mirrour, and lively

<hi>Criticks,</hi> who run at randon in the fields of other mens

<pb facs="tcp:9042:5"/>
close grounds; and therefore the different disposition of the
<hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad,</hi> doe best concurre with the interchangeable
occurrences of the matter.</p>
            <p>Neverthelesse, for thy more easier understanding, I have
divided this <hi>History into ten Parts, and they also into
three Bookes;</hi> which being seriously perused, doubtlesse
thy Labour shall receive both profit and pleasure. <hi>Accept
them therefore with the same love, that I offer them to
thee, since they cost thee nothing but the Reading, how
deare soever they are to me.</hi> But understand me better,
<hi>I scorne to draw my</hi> Pen <hi>to the ignorant</hi> Foole, <hi>for I
contemne both. To the</hi> Wise <hi>I know it will be welcome,
to the profound</hi> Historian <hi>yeeld</hi> Knowledge, Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and direction: and to the understanding Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
insight, instruction, and recreation: and to the
true bred <hi>Poet</hi> fraternall love, both in meane and manner.
Now as touching the hissing of snakish Papists, a tush for
that snarling Crew; for as this <hi>Worke,</hi> being fensed with
experience and garnished with trueth, is more then able
to batter downe the stinging venome of their despightfull
Waspishnes: so also they may clearely see therein, as in a Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
their owne blindnes, and the damnable errours of their
blind Guiders, Deceiuers and Idolaters: And aboue all the
cruell infliction imposed vpon me, by the mercilesse Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their profession in <hi>Malaga;</hi> which for Christs
sake I constantly suffered, in Tortures, Torments, and
Hunger.</p>
            <p>And lastly, they may perceive Gods miraculous Mercy,
in discovering and delivering me from such a concealed
and inhumane murther.</p>

the like condition of murther: Nay, but then prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
seriously this consequent? may not the scelerate
hands of foure blood-shedding Wolves, facily devoure,
and shake a peeces one silly stragling Lambe? yea, and
most certaine, that unnawares, the harmelesse innocent;
unexpecting evill, may suddenly bee surprized by the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushment
of life-betraying foes. All this I acknowledge;
but whereupon grew this thy voluntary wandring, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constrained
exile? I answere, that being young, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
minority, in that occurrent time, I was not onely invei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled,
but by seducements inforced, even by the greatest
powers,<note place="margin">A Dialogue betweene the Author and Himselfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

growing in yeares, and understanding better the
nature of such unallowable redresses, and the hainous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the offence; I choosed rather (<hi>voti causa</hi>) to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
my selfe from my soyle, and exclude my relenting
sorrowes, to be entertained with strangers; than to have
a <hi>quotidian occular</hi> inspection, in any obvious object of
disastrous misfortune: or perhaps any vindicable action,
might from an unsetled ranckour bee conceived. O! a
plaine demonstrate cause, and good resolution; for true it
is, that the flying from evill, is a flying to grace; and a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
patience is a victorious freedome, and an undaunted
conquerour over all wrongs; <hi>Vengeance is mine</hi> (saith the
Lord) <hi>and I will repay it.</hi> To this I answere; mine eyes have
seene the revenging hand of God upon mine adversaries,

of forraigne Newes; yea, and much more affecteth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9042:12"/>
the sight and knowledge of strange, and unfrequented
Kingdomes, such is the instinct of his naturall affection.
Navigation hath often united the bodies of Realmes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
but Travaile hath done much more; for first to the
Actor it giveth the impression of understanding, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
patience, and an infinite treasure of unexperimable
vertues: secondly, it unfoldeth to the World the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of States, the authority and disposition of Kings and
Princes; the secrets, manners, customes, and religions of
all Nations and People. And lastly, bringeth satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the home-dwelling man, of these things he would
have seene, and could not attempt. Travell hath beene
in more request amongst the Ancients, than it is now with
us in the latter Age. Philosophers, Poets, Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
and learned Divines, how they have perigrinated
to know the life of States, and the fashions of farre Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
would be an endlesse taske for me briefely to relate.
Many (I confesse) long to see the remotest Region of the
Earth, but dare not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

chargeable expences of a Tributary journey, the hard
indurance of flint stones for a soft Feather-bed, the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of thirst, nor the parching heate of the Sun, hunger
in the belly, nor the moist distilling dew to bee a humide
Coverlet to their tender skinne, with innummerable other
insuing miseries. But <hi>Ixion</hi>-like, mistaking <hi>Iuno,</hi> would
by a meere imagination, run out the sleeping course of
an endlesse peregrination. For my part, what I have reaped
is by a deer bought knowledge, as it were, a small content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in a never contenting subject, a bitter pleasant taste,
of a sweet-seasoned sowre, and all in all, what I found, was
more then ordinary rejoycing, in an extraordinary sorrow
of delights.</p>
                  <p>But now to leave the contemplation of attempts, to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:9042:13"/>
come to the reall adventure: After two voyages I made
to the <hi>Orcadian,</hi> and <hi>Zetlandian</hi> Isles; in the stripling age
of mine adolescency, and there after surveighing all <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
Bohemia, Helvetia,</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries</hi> from

                     </gap>ed ten months.
Divers contestations have I had about the equality of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
and <hi>Paris,</hi> in quantity and quality: But having a more
serious subject in hand than this paralell,<note place="margin">A comparison betweene <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Paris.</hi>
                     </note> I conclude thus,
the infinite shipping, and commodious navigation of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
(besides their universall commerse) is more of value,
than the better halfe of <hi>Paris:</hi> compare you the quantity,
for there is the quality of the argument. <hi>Paris</hi> I confesse is
populous, a masse of poore People, for lacques and pages,
a nest of rogues, a tumultuous place, a noctuall denne of
Theeves, and a confused multitude: where contrariwise,
<hi>London</hi> is adorned with many grave, prudent, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Senators, civill, well-taught, and courteous people,
and absolutely, the best governed City on the whole face
of the earth; as well by night, as by day, and nothing infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
in quantity to it.</p>
                  <p>FRom <hi>Paris</hi> (in the the yeare of God 1609. <hi>March</hi> 7) I set
forward, being brought three Leagues on my way, with

where when my kindest thankes had over-clouded
their courtesies, and farewell bid on both sides, I bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
my proceedings to God, my body to turmoyling
paines; my hand to the burthen, and my feete to the hard
bruising way. And as unwilling to make relation of my

comment upon <hi>Italy</hi> in generall. Upon the 40. day after
my departure from <hi>Paris,</hi> I arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> of the which
I will memorize some rarest things, and so proceed. This
City of <hi>Rome</hi> now extant, is not that old <hi>Rome,</hi> which
<hi>Romulus</hi> founded that tempered the morter with the
blood of his brother <hi>Rhemus,</hi> who disdainefully leaped
over the new wals; and was once the mistris of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
for her Triumphs and Antiquities, but is now onely
the Carkasse of the other, of which she retaineth nothing
but her ruines; and the cause of them, her sinnes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rome</hi> which <hi>Romulus</hi> first founded, contained these

                     <hi>Capitolino,</hi> and <hi>Palatino,</hi> with the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley

first was called <hi>Trigonio,</hi> because of the triangle it made

because it was alwayes open, and for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity

third was called <hi>Carmentale</hi> of <hi>Carmenta,</hi> the mother of
<hi>Euander</hi> who dwelt there: It was also named <hi>scelorata,</hi>
or wicked gate in regard of 300. <hi>Sabines</hi> put cruelly to

                  <p>Now after the Monarchy of the <hi>Romanes</hi> had attained

displaying their banner against this glorious and
imperiall City, in the end razed, and subverted their Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces,
equalizing the walles with the ground. After the
which detriment, and overthrow, the late subdued <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
recovering their ruinous habitation, were inforced
to withdraw the situation of the Towne, a little more
downe-ward, in <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> close by the bankes

of <hi>Tibris;</hi> and transported the stones of these ransacked

the Epitome of the world, the Kingdome of <hi>Mars,</hi>

Kings who reigned there; and also acknowledging
seven severall Rulers, <hi>Kings, Consuls, Decemviri, Tribunes,
Dictators, Emperours,</hi> and now <hi>Popes.</hi> During the felicity
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> this City was never taken, but by the
<hi>Gauls,</hi> which being recovered they made a Law that
<hi>Priests</hi> (being otherwise exempted) should goe to Warre, if

                  <p>The River <hi>Tyber</hi> which runneth through her bosome,

drowne the whole Mansions, as grieving to grace the
Walls of such a wicked and imperious a place: who having
lost her former preheminent glory, and domination over
the world would not alledge and ascribe a second prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
over the soules of men, the Heavens, the Hells, the

Kings: the former was done by the undaunted courage
of the invincible sword, the latter by presumption, Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,
insinuation, and absurd lies.</p>
                  <p>I remember of a pretty observation of Saint <hi>Katharine,</hi>

visited all the Monuments, supposed Holy places, and
Religious relicks there, for the space of five dayes: At last
she came to take view of the Popes Palace, where having
spent a whole day, strictly remarking the gesture and
carriage of the Popes servants: She saw nothi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

prophannation, and irreligious living, and
worser than in <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe: Whereupon suddenly, the

distant; pittifully bewayling her journey, and the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
livers she saw in <hi>Rome.</hi> Protesting alwayes after

never came from the East,<note place="margin">Meaning of <hi>Sodomy.</hi>
                     </note> blowing Westward to
<hi>Siena,</hi> but shee thought the filthinesse of the Popes Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
and the beastlinesse of <hi>Rome,</hi> ever stunke in her
nose.</p>
                  <p>This River of <hi>Tyber</hi> especially made muster of his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
disgorgements, at that time when Pope <hi>Clement</hi>
the eighth was Crowned Duke of <hi>Ferrara, auno</hi> 1589. and
that same night hee returned to <hi>Rome, Tyber</hi> waxed so
proud of his arrivall, that impetuously inunding his
bankes to make him welcome, hee overwhelmed the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:9042:15"/>
halfe of the Town: And if it had not been for the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
charges of the Pope, and desperate toyle of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the violent force of his rage swelling courtesie, had
absolutely subverted and carryed away the rest of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The like inundation was never seene of <hi>Tyber,</hi> as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this Coronation, portending, that as the first <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morah</hi>
was destroyed by fire, so this second <hi>Sodome</hi> should
be sommerssed by water. The beginning of this River
springeth from the <hi>Ombrian</hi> and <hi>Aquilean</hi> hills, joyning
with the Alpes <hi>Apenine:</hi> whose course is fourescore and
sixteene miles; dis-burthening it selfe in the Sea <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrene</hi>
at <hi>Ostia</hi> twelve miles from <hi>Rome.</hi> The mouth and
haven whereof have beene long dammed up, to stoppe
the passage of hostile and Moorish incursions, least the
City should be surprised on a suddaine. By which slavish
Ecclesiasticke feare, <hi>Rome</hi> is shamefully defrauded of
Shipping and forraigne trafficke: and if it were not for the
Clergy, which are the two parts of the Inhabitants (besides
the <hi>Iews,</hi> and Curtezans, which are the greatest imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the other third part) it would become the most
miserable Towne in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And notwithstanding that for the space of 12 miles
round about <hi>Rome,</hi> there are neither Cornes nor Wines,
nor Village, Plantage, or Cultinage, save onely playne
and pastoragious fields; intermingled at all quarters with
ancient Watch-towers, being an old policy of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
to prevent any sudden surprise of their enemies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that at my first view of <hi>Rome,</hi> I imagined the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were all famished, or in danger of famishing.</p>
                  <p>But by your leave, being once entred the City, I found
abundance of all things necessary for life, at so easie and
gentle a rate, that never a Town in <hi>Europe</hi> hitherto could
shew mee the like. The common Wine that is drunke in

                     <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Vin Romanisco,</hi> the better sort <hi>Albano, Muscatello,
Sheranino,</hi> but as for <hi>Lachrimae Christi,</hi> the teares of
Christ, I drew so hard at that same weeping Wine, till I
found my purse begun to weepe also; and if time had not
prevented the sweetnesse of such teares, I had been left for
all the last miserable mourner. As for the place where the
Pilgrimes finde one Dinner, called the <hi>Popes</hi> Table,<note place="margin">The Pilgrim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thus: there is a certaine low roome at Saint <hi>Peters</hi> palace,
and without the gate, where every day at our nine of the
clocke, there meet 21 pilgrimes; 14 from the Trinitie, one
having a bullet for all, and seven from Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentialls:
where being received, the seven Jesuite Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
get the upper place, and sit alone, yet all of them
alike served, each of them having four dishes of meat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
bread and abundance of wine. The dinner done, their
fragments are wrapt up in cleane paper, which they carry
with them, and so departing, they, or like company come
no more there. They are daily served with a very venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Prelate, and a few other serviceable Priests, but for
the <hi>Popes</hi> presence with them, there is no such matter.
That liberty being spoyld by a drunken <hi>Dutch-man</hi> about
60 yeares agoe, who in presence of the <hi>Pope</hi> gave up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
his good Cheare and strong Wines, with a freer

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9042:19"/>
by <hi>Ianus, Anno Mundi</hi> 1925. From whom sprung the

a thousand, it is false, for I have trod foure severall times

upon the steppes, that discend from the Chappell to the
Church-floore, five hundred more came to visite her
with salutations of Saint, Saint, O ever blessed Saint. Now
it was Friday in the fore-noone, and the woman having
travelled all night, and to save charges of fish, had eaten a
cold bit of her owne meat privately in the Taverne, with
halfe a <hi>Buckale</hi> of red Wine: The people more admiring
this imaginary heavenly trance, than the reliefe of the
woman; at last said I, brother <hi>Arthur,</hi> I will goe open
yonder womans breast, and I did so: and holding up her
head before all the people, there sprung a flood of <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garbo</hi>

Child being brought, I was amazed in that sight, to
behold the deformity of Nature; for below the middle
part there was but one body, and above the middle
there was two living soules, each one separated from
another with severall members. Their heads were both
of one bignesse but different in Phisnomy: the belly of
the one joyned with the posterior part of the other, and
their faces looked both one way, as if the one had carried
the other on his backe, and often before our eyes, hee
that was behind, would lay his hands about the necke of
the foremost. Their eyes were exceeding bigge, and their
hands greater than an infant of three times their age. The
excrements of both Creatures issued forth at one place,
and their thighes and legges of a great grouth, not sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blable
to their age, being but sixe and thirty dayes old;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9042:34"/>
and their feet were proportionably made like to the foote

received their food with an insatiable desire, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
mourned with a pittifull noise; that sorrowfull man
told us, that when one slept the other awaked, which
was a strange disagreement in Nature, The Mother of

                  <p>On our left hand toward the Maine, wee saw an Iland
called Saint <hi>Maure,</hi> formerly <hi>Leucas,</hi> or <hi>Leucada;</hi> which
is onely inhabited by <hi>Iewes,</hi> to whom <hi>Bajazet</hi> the second
gave it in possession, after their expulsion from <hi>Spaine:</hi>
The chiefe City is Saint <hi>Maure,</hi> which not long agoe
was subject to <hi>Venice.</hi> This Ile Saint <hi>Maure</hi> was anciently
conriguate with the continent, but now rent asunder,
and invironed with the Sea: In the meane while of
our navigable passage, the Captaine of the Vessell espyed
a Saile comming from sea, hee presently being moved
therewith, sent a Mariner to the toppe, who certified him
she was a <hi>Turkish</hi> Galley of <hi>Biserta,</hi> prosecuting a straight
course to invade our Barke. Which suddaine affrighting
newes overwhelmed us almost in despaire. Resolution
being by the amazed Master demanded, of every man
what was best to doe, some replyed one way, and some
another: Insomuch, that the most part of the passengers
gave Counsell rather to render than fight; being confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
their friends would pay their ransome, and so relieve
them. But I the wandring Pilgrime, pondering in my pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
breast, my solitary estate, the distance of my Country
and friends, could conceive no hope of deliverance. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the which troublesome and fearefull appearance of
slavery, I absolutely arose, and spoke to the Master,
saying:<note place="margin">A counsaile to fight.</note> 
                     <hi>The halfe of the Carmosalo is your owne, and the
most part also of the loading:</hi> (all which he had told me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
<hi>wherefore my Counsaile is, that you prepare your selfe
to fight; and goe encourage your Passengers, promise to your
Mariners double wages, make ready your two pieces of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:9042:38"/>
Ordnance, your Muskets, Powder, Lead, and halfe-pikes:
for who knoweth, but the Lord may deliver us from the thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of these Infidels:</hi> My exhortation ended, hee was
greatly animated therewith, and gave me thankes; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
assembling the passengers &amp; Mariners, he gave good
comfort and large promises to them all: so that their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
hopes was converted to a couragious resolution;
seeming rather to give the first assault, than to receive the
second wrong.</p>
                  <p>To performe the plots of our defence, every man was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
in the worke, some below in the gunner-roome, others
cleansing the Musket, some preparing the powder &amp; balls,
some their swords and short weapons, some dressing the
halfe-pikes, and others making fast the doores above: for
so the Master resolved to make combate below, both to
save us from small shot, and besides for boarding us on a
suddaine. The dexterous courage of all men was so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to defend their lives and libertie, that truely in mine
opinion we seemed thrice as many as were. All things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and above being cunningly perfected, and every one
ranked in order with his Harquebuse and pike to stand on
the Centinell of his owne defence, wee recommend our
selves in the hands of the Almighty; and in the mean while
attended their fiery salutations.</p>
                  <p>In a furious spleene, the first <hi>Hola</hi> of their courtesies,
was the progresse of a Martiall conflict, thundring forth a
terrible noyse of Gally-roaring peeces. And wee in a sad
reply, sent out a back-sounding Eccho of fiery flying shots:
which made an Equinox to the Clouds, rebounding back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in our perturbed breasts, the ambiguous sounds
of feare and hope. After a long and doubtfull fight,
both with great and small, shot, (night parting us) the
<hi>Turkes</hi> retired till morning, and then were mindfull to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:9042:39"/>

pleased him, who never faileth his, to send downe an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistable
tempest, about the breake of day wee escaped
their furious designes; and were enforced to seeke into
the Bay of <hi>Largastolo</hi> in <hi>Cephalonia,</hi> both because of the
violent weather, and also for that a great leak was stricken
into our ship. In this fight there were of us killed three
<hi>Italians,</hi> two <hi>Greekes,</hi> and two <hi>Iewes,</hi> with eleven others
deadly wounded, and I also hurt in the right arme with a
small shot.<note place="margin">A notable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Infidels, we are not assured thereof, save onely this, wee
shot away their middle Mast, and the hinder part of the

could our Harquebusadoes much annoy them, in respect
they never boarded. But howsoever it was, being all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked

had an ignorant guide: But this I remember, amongst
these Rocks my belly was pinched, and wearied was my
body, with the climbing of fastidious mountaines, which
bred no small griefe to my breast. Yet notwithstanding
of my distresse, the remembrance of those sweet sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
Songs of <hi>Arcadian</hi> Shepheards, which pregnant

answer the famous relations, given by ancient Authors
of the excellency of that land, but the name onely; the
barbarousnesse of <hi>Turkes</hi> and Time, having defaced all
the Monuments of Antiquity: No shew of honour, no
habitation of men in an honest fashion, nor possessours of
the Countrey in a Principality, But rather prisoners shut
up in prison, or addicted slaves to cruell and tyrannicall
Masters: So deformed is the state of that once worthy
Realm, and so miserable is the burthen of that afflicted
people; which, and the appearance of that permanency,
grieved my heart to behold the sinister working of blind
<hi>Fortune,</hi> which alwayes plungeth the most renowned
Champions, and their memory, in the profoundest pit of
all extremities and oblivion.</p>

<hi>Scanderberg</hi> be witnesses hereto; but especially, that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian
Alexander,</hi> whose fortunes ever followed him,
rather than fled him, till his last dissolution; wherein I may
say his Greatnesse rose, like to a mighty and huge Oak,
being clad with the exuvialls, and Trophies of enemies,
fenced with an Army of boughes, garnished with a coat of
Barke, as hard as steele; dispised the force and power of
the windes, as being onely able to dally with the leaves
and not to weaken the root: But the Northerne winde,
that strong Champion of the airy Region, secretly lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in the vault of some hollow Cloud, doth first mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
at the aspiring Oak, and then striketh his Crest
with some great strength; and lastly with the deepest
breath of his Lungs, doth blow up the roote: Even so
was it with <hi>Alexander,</hi> who from a stripling came to be a
Cedar, and from the sorrow of no more worlds, was
soone cut off from the world he was into: For destiny is
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:9042:45"/>
no mans drudge, and death is every mans Conquerour,
matching the Scepter with the Spade, and the Crowned
Prince with the praiselesse Peasant: And in a word, there
was never any to whom Fortune did sooner approach, nor
never any from whom shee did more suddenly flye, than
from <hi>Alexander,</hi> leaving him a cleare mirrour of the
worlds inconstancy.</p>
                  <p>Now as concerning the government of <hi>Greece,</hi> termed
by the <hi>Turkes Rum Ili,</hi> that is, the <hi>Roman</hi> Countrey:
It is ruled by a <hi>Beglerbeg,</hi>

valiant Captaines and Commandars than any City in the

when any man was growne too wealthy or potent, he was

at last it was sacked by <hi>Lysander,</hi> and her Virgin body

                  <p>And in a word, <hi>Athens</hi> being stained with intestine

learned of the theevish way I had to <hi>Canea,</hi> I advised
to put my money in exchange, which the Captaine of
that strength very courteously performed; and would also
have disswaded me from my purpose, but I by no perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of him would stay. From thence departing all alone,
scarcely was I advanced twelve miles in my way, when
I was beset on the skirt of a Rocky Mountaine, with
three <hi>Greeke</hi> murthering <hi>Renegadoes,</hi> and an <hi>Italian Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dido,</hi>

and could not speak the <hi>Cretan</hi> tongue, began to aske me
in his owne language where was my money? to whom
I soberly answered, I had no more than hee saw, which
was fourescore Bagantines: which scarely amounted to
two groats English: but hee not giving credit to these
words, searched all my Cloathes and <hi>Budgeto,</hi> yet found
nothing, except my linnen, and Letters of recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I had from divers Princes of Christendome,<note place="margin">A happy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</note> especially
the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> whose subjects they were, if they had
beene lawfull Subjects: which when hee saw, did
move him to compassion, and earnestly entreated the
other three theeves to grant me mercy, and to save my
life: A long deliberation being ended, they restored
backe againe my pilgrimes Cloathes, and Letters, but my
blew Gowne and Bagantines they kept: such also was
their theevish Courtesie towards me, that for my better
safeguard in the way, they gave me a stamped piece of clay,
as a token to shew any of their companions, if I encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred

                  <p>Leaving them with many counterfeit thankes, I travai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

young <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, a Protestant, borne neare
<hi>Monpeillier</hi> in <hi>Langadocke;</hi> who being by chance in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

apprehended by a fall in his flight, was afterward
condemned by the Senators to the Gallyes induring
life. Now the Gallyes lying here sixe dayes, he got leave
of the Captaine to come a shoare with a Keeper, when
he would, carrying an Irom bolt on his legge: In which
time wee falling in acquaintance, he complained heavily
of his hard fortune, and how because he was a Protestant,
(besides his slavery) he was severely abused in the Galley;
sighing forth these words with teares, <hi>Lord have mercy
upon mee, and grant me patience, for neither friends, nor
money can redeeme mee:</hi>

For I was in <hi>Venice,</hi> at that same time when this accident
fell out, yet would not tell him so much: But pondering
seriously his lamentable distresse, I secretly advised him
the manner how he might escape, and how farre I would
hazard the liberty of my life for his deliverance, desiring
him to come a shoare early the next morning. Meane
while I went to an old <hi>Greekish</hi> woman, with whom I was
friendly inward, for shee was my Landresse; and reciting
to her the whole businesse, she willingly condiscended to
lend me an old Gowne, and a blacke vaile for his disguise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

over-came his sences. Whereupon conducting my friend
to the appointed place, I disburdened him of his Irons,
clothed him in a female habite, and sent him out before
mee, conducted by the <hi>Greekish</hi> woman: and when se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
past both Guard and Gate, I followed, carrying
with mee his cloathes, where, when accoasting him by a
field of Olives, and the other returned backe, we speedily
crossed the Vale of <hi>Suda,</hi> and interchanging his appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
I directed him the way over the Mountaines to a

relation, consulting with them, what way I could come
to the <hi>Italian</hi> Monastery Saint <hi>Salvator,</hi> for there I say;
(the vulgar Towne affording neither lodging nor beds)
They answered me, they would venture their lives for my
liberty, and I should enter at the Easterne (the least fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented)

sixe Gally souldiers runne to lay hold on mee: whereat
the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> unsheathing their swords, vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly

At the last the Captaines of the Garrison approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

drove backe the other to the Gallyes. A little thereafter
the Generall of the Gallyes came to the Monastary, and
examined mee concerning the fugitive, but I clearing
my selfe so, and quenching the least suspition hee might
conceive (notwithstanding of my accusers) hee could lay
nothing to my charge: howsoever it was, hee seemed
somewhat favourable; partly because I had the Duke of

halfe in length, for they being all three rolling within the

many build upon false reports, but experience teacheth

                  <p>Some others also Historize, that if a Woman here, bite
a man any thing hard, hee will never recover: and that

found a <hi>Grecian</hi> Bishop, who kindly presented me with
grapes of <hi>Maluasie,</hi> and other things, for it was in the

me, he caused to make ready an Asse, and a servant, who
went with me to <hi>Candy,</hi> which was more than fifteene

                  <p>I remember along this sassinous and marine passage, I

<hi>Smith</hi> knowing where I used sometimes to diet,

for the mischiefe: which when hee saw his treachery

                  <p>Remarking the fidelity and kindnesse that <hi>Smith</hi> had

him a good deed in some part of acquittance, and thus it
was: At his first comming to <hi>Venice,</hi> he was taken up as
a Souldier for <hi>Candy:</hi> where, when transported, within a
small time he found the Captaines promise and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
different, which inforced him at the beginning to
borrow a little money of his Lieutenant: the five yeares
of their abode expired, and fresh Companies come from
<hi>Venice</hi> to exhibite the charge, <hi>Smith</hi> not being able to
discharge his debt, was turned over to the new Captaine
for five yeares more, who paied the old Captaine his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
and his time also worne out, the third Captaine came,
where likewise he was put in his hands serving him five
yeares longer.</p>
                  <p>Thus having served three Captains fifteene yeares, and
never likely able (for a small trifle) to attaine his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
I went to the Captaine and payed his debt, obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:9042:56"/>
also of the Rector his licence to depart; and the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
of the State for his passage, which was Wine and
Biscot-bread: Thereafter I imbarked him for <hi>Venice</hi> in
a <hi>Flemish</hi> ship, the Master being a <hi>Scotsman, Iohn Allen</hi>
borne in <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and dwelt at <hi>Middleborough</hi> in <hi>Zeland,</hi>
his debt was onely forty eight shillings sterling.</p>
                  <p>Here I stayed in <hi>Canea</hi> twenty five dayes before I could

not beene for my designes; in regard of their great cheere

They are wild, and onely killed by small shot; but I

seeke into a creeke, betwixt two Rocks, for safety of our

                  <p>The dead men being found on shoare, we buried them;
and I learned at that instant time, there were seventeene
boats cast away on the Coast of this Island, and never a

heavily, fasting and praying. I rejoycing and thanking

                  <p>Upon the seventh day, there came downe to visit us,
two Gentlemen of <hi>Venice,</hi> clothed after the <hi>Turkish</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
who under exile, were banished their Native Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
ten yeeres for slaughter; each of them having two
servants, and all of them carrying Shables, and two
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:9042:67"/>
Guns a piece: which when I understood, they were
<hi>Italians,</hi> I addressed my selfe to them, with a heavy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
against the <hi>Greeks</hi> in detaining my <hi>Budgeto,</hi> and
compelling mee to endanger my life for their goods:
whereupon they accusing the Patron, and finding
him guiltie of this oppression, belaboured him sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with handy-blowes, and caused him to deliver my
things, carrying mee with them five miles to a Towne
where they remained, called <hi>Rhethenos,</hi> formerly <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia,</hi>
where I was exceeding kindly entertained ten days:
And most nobly (as indeed they were noble) they bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on mee forty Chickens of Gold at my departure, for
the better advancement of my Voyage, which was the
first gift that ever I received in all my travels. For if the
darts of death had not been more advantagious to mee,
then <hi>Asiaticke</hi> gifts, I had never been able to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone
this tributary, tedious, and sumptuous peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
The confluence of the Divine Providence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotting
mee means, from the losse of my dearest consorts
gave mee in the deepnesse of sorrow, a thankfull rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nigroponti</hi> was formerly called <hi>Euboea,</hi>

The <hi>Turks</hi> cognominate this Isle <hi>Egribos:</hi> The Town of
<hi>Nigropont,</hi> from which the Isle taketh the name, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in by <hi>Mahomet</hi> the second; <hi>Anno</hi> 1451, and in this Isle
is found the <hi>Amianten</hi> stone, which is said to be drawne
in threeds, as out of Flax, whereof they make Napkins,
and other like Stuffs; and to make it white, they use to
throw it in the fire, being salted: The stone also is found
here, called by the <hi>Greeks Ophites,</hi> and by us <hi>Serpentine.</hi>
The circuit of this Isle is three hundred forty sixe miles.
It is seperated from the firme land of <hi>Thessalia,</hi> from the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:9042:67"/>

channel, over the which in one place there is a bridge
that passeth betwene the Isle, and the main continent

which ebbeth and floweth six times night and day.
Within halfe a mile of the bridge, I saw a Marble co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne,
standing on the top of a little Rocke, whence
(as the Islanders told me) <hi>Aristotle</hi> leaped in, and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

                  <p>The Mountaine it selfe is somewhat steepe and sterile,

her onely grace and garment royall, is like a naked table
wherein nothing is painted: even so is <hi>Thebes</hi> and her past

Gentlemen, as if the spring-tide had been taken from the

and runne the Galley a shoare: Upon this they were
entertained in service, but the Providitor caused to
burne the Galley, fearing least the <hi>Turks</hi> should thereby
forge some quarrell. The yeare following, an other
Galley attempted the same, but the poore slaves having
past the Castles, had been so wounded and killed with

respects, the said <hi>Constantine</hi> sonne of Saint <hi>Helen,</hi>
and Emperour of <hi>Rome</hi> (which afterward the Pope u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped)
was sirnamed the Great. He first in his plantation
called this Citie new <hi>Rome;</hi> but when he beheld the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing,
and multiplying of all things in it, and because of
the commodious situation thereof, he called it <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinopolis,</hi>
after his owne name. This Emperour lived
there many prosperous years, in most happy estate: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
many of his Successours did, untill such time, that
<hi>Mahomet</hi> the second of that name, and Emperour of the

great and glorious Dominions of Christians; especially
this famous Citie, that so flourished in his eies, by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
circumstances, collected his cruell intentions, to
the full height of ambition; whereby hee might abolish
the very name of Christianity, and also puft up with a
presumptuous desire, to enlarge his Empire, went with a
marvellous power, both by Sea and Land, unto this mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Mansion.</p>
                  <p>The issue whereof was such, that after divers batteries
and assaults, the irreligious Infidels broke downe the
walls, and entred the City, which breach was about forty

paces long, as by the new colour being built up again, is
easily knowne from the old walls, where when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
they made a wonderfull massacre of poor afflicted
Christians, without sparing any of the <hi>Roman</hi> kinde, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
male or female. In the mercilesse fury of these infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Imps, the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> was killed, whose
head being cut off, was carried upon the point of a Lance
through all the City, and Campe of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> to the

Daughters, and other Ladies, after they were abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

                  <p>By this overthrow of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> this <hi>Mahomet</hi>
took twelve Kingdoms, and two hundred Cities from
the Christians, which is a lamentable losse, of such an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
Empire. Thus was that Imperiall Citie lost, in
the yeare 1453, <hi>May</hi> 29, when it had remained under
the government of Christians, 1198 yeares. It is now the
chief abode of the great <hi>Turk Sultan Achmet,</hi> the fifteenth

and not without great feare of his <hi>Ianizaries</hi> and
<hi>Timariots,</hi> who twice in three yeeres have lately made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
against him. This Emperour <hi>Achmet,</hi> who was
alive when I was there, was more given to Venery, then
Martiality, which gave a greater advantage to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>
in their defensive wars.</p>

                  <p>The form, or situation of this Citie, is like unto a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle,
the South part whereof, and the East part, are invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned
with <hi>Hellespontus,</hi> and <hi>Bosporus Thraicus;</hi> and the
North part adjoyning to the firme land. It is in compasse
about the walls, esteemed to be 18 miles: in one of these
triangled points, being the Southeast part, and at the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>Bosphore</hi> and <hi>Hellespont,</hi> standeth the Palace of
the Great <hi>Turke,</hi> called <hi>Seralia</hi> and the Forrest wherein
he hunteth; which is two miles in length.</p>
                  <p>The speciall object of Antiquitie, I saw within this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
was the incomparable Church of Saint <hi>Sophia,</hi> whose
ornaments and hallowed Vessels, were innumerable, in the
time of <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Emperour, who first builded it; but
now converted to a <hi>Mosque,</hi> and consecrated to <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
after a diabolicall manner.</p>
                  <p>I saw also the famous <hi>Hyppodrome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hyppodrome.</note> and the Theater
whereon the people stood, when the Emperours used to
run their Horses, and make their Princely shows on so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
dayes, which is now altogether decaid: There is a
great Columne in that same place, in the which all these
things memorable, that have bin done in this <hi>Hyppodrome,</hi>
are superficially carved.</p>
                  <p>Upon the West corner of the City, there is a strong,
Fortresse, fortified with seven great Towers, and well
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:9042:78"/>
furnished with Munition, called by <hi>Turks, Iadileke:</hi> In
this Prison, are Bassawes, and Subbassawes imprisoned,
and also great men of Christians, if any offence be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
Their place of Exchange is called <hi>Bezastan,</hi>
wherein all sorts of commodities are to be sold; as Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,
Silkes, Velvets, Cloth of Silver and Gold, and the
most exquisitely wrought Hand-kerchiefes, that can be
found in the world; with infinite other commodities, the
relation of which would be tedious.</p>
                  <p>I have seene men and women as usually sold here in
Markets, as Horses and other beasts are with us: The
most part of which are <hi>Hungarians, Transilvaniaus, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindians,
Istrians,</hi> and <hi>Dalmatian</hi> Captives, and of other
places besides, which they can overcome. Whom, if no
compassionable Christian will buy, or relieve; then must
they either turne <hi>Turke,</hi> or be addicted to perpetuall sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
Here I remember of a charitable deed, done for a
sinfull end, and thus it was; A Ship of <hi>Marseilles,</hi> called
the great <hi>Dolphin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A French Palliard.</note> lying here forty dayes at the <hi>Galata,</hi>
the Master Gunner, named <hi>Monsieur Nerack,</hi> and I fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in familiar acquaintance, upon a time he told me se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
that he would gladly for Conscience and Merits
sake, redeeme some poore Christian slave from <hi>Turkish</hi>
Captivity. To the which, I applauded his advice, and
told him the next Friday following I would assist him to
so worthy an action: Friday comes, and he and I went for
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> where the Market of the slaves being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
we spent two houres in viewing and reviewing five
hundred Males and Females. At last I pointed him to
have bought an old man or woman, but his minde was
contrary set, shewing me that he would buy some virgin,
or young widdow, to save their bodies unde floured with
Infidels. The price of a virgin was too deare for him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:9042:78"/>
a hundred Duckets, and widdows were farre under,
and at an easier rate: When wee did visit and search them
that wee were mindfull to buy, they were strip'd stark na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
before our eyes, where the sweetest face, the youngest
age, and whitest skin was in greatest value and request:
The <hi>Iews</hi> sold them, for they had bought them from the
<hi>Turkes::</hi> At last we fell upon a <hi>Dalmatian</hi> widdow, whose
pitifull looks, and sprinkling teares strook my soule al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
to death for compassion: whereupon I grew earnest
for her reliefe, and hee yielding to my advice, shee is
bought and delivered unto him, the man being 60 yeares
of age, and her price 36 Duckets. We leave the Market
and came over again to <hi>Galata,</hi> where hee and I tooke a
Chamber for her, and leaving them there, the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
I returned early, suspecting greatly the dissembling
devotion of the Gunner to be nought but luxurious lust,
and so it proved: I knocked at the Chamber doore, that
hee had newly locked, and taken the key with him to the
ship, for he had tarried with her all that night; and she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
me with teares, told mee all the manner of his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
wishing her selfe to be again in her former captivity:
whereupon I went a shipboord to him, and in my griefe I
swore, that if hee abused her any more after that manner,
and not returned to her distresse, her Christian liberty; I
would first make it knowne to his Master the Captaine of
the Ship, and then to the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour: for hee
was mindfull also,<note place="margin">The Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Widdow relieved.</note> his lust being satisfied to have sold her
over againe to some other: At which threatning the old
<hi>Pallyard</hi> became so fearfull, that he entred in a reasonable
condition with mee, and the Ship departing thence sixe
dayes there after, he freely resigned to me her life, her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and freedome: which being done, and he gone, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my hand before divers <hi>Greekes,</hi> I subscribed her liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:9042:79"/>
and hired her in the same Taverne for a yeare, taking
nothing from her, for as little had she to give me, except
many blessings and thankefull prayers: This <hi>French</hi> Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
was a Papist and here you may behold the dregs of
his devotion, and what seven nights leachery cost him,
you may cast up the reckoning of 36 Duckets.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Constantinople</hi> there have happened many fearefull
fires, which often have consumed to ashes the most part
of the rarest Monuments there, and the beauty of infinite
Palaces; as <hi>Zonoras</hi> the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher

It is subject also to divers Earth-quakes, which
have often subverted the Towers,<note place="margin">Pestilence and Earth-quakes.</note> Houses, Churches, and
Walles of the City to the ground. Especially in the yeare
1509 in the raigne of <hi>Bajazeth,</hi> the ninth Emperour of
the <hi>Turkes,</hi> in which time, more then 13000. persons
were all smothered and dead, and laid up in heapes unbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.
And commonly every third yeare, the pestilence is
exceeding great in that City, and after such an odious
manner; that those who are infected (before they die)
have the halfe of their one side rot, and fall away: so
that you may easily discerne the whole intrailes of their
bowels. It is not licentiated here, nor else where in all

Truly I may say of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as I said once of the
World, in the <hi>Lamentado</hi> of my second Pilgrimage;
<q>
                        <l>A painted Whoore, the mask of deadly sin,</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>For indeed outwardly it hath the fairest shew, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
in the streets being narrow, and most part cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the filthiest and deformed buildings in the world; the
reason of its beauty, is, because being situate on moderate
prospective heights, the universall tectures, a far off, yield
a delectable shew, the covertures being erected like the
backe of a Coach after the <hi>Italian</hi> fashion with gutterd
tile. But being entred within, there is nothing but a stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deformity, and a lothsome contrived place; without
either internall domestick furniture, or externall decore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Fabricks palatiatly extended. Notwithstanding
that for its situation, the delicious wines and fruits, the
temperate climate, the fertile circumjacent fields, and for

From thence I went to the black Sea: but commonly
<hi>Mare Euxinum,</hi>

                        <hi>Pompeys</hi> Pillar.</note> where I saw <hi>Pompeyes</hi> Pillar of Marble,
standing neer the shoare, upon a rocky Island: and not far
from thence, is a Lanthorne higher then any Steeple,
whereon there is a pan full of liquour, that burneth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
night to give warning unto ships how neer they come
the shore; It is not much unlike these Lanthornes of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorne</hi>
and <hi>Genua.</hi> The water of this Sea is never a whit
blacker then other Seas: but it is called blacke, in respect
of the dangerous events in darke and tempestuous nights,
which happen there; and because of the Rockes and
Sands which lye a great way from the main shore upon
which many vessels many times are cast away. The blacke
Sea is not farre from <hi>Galata,</hi> for I both went and returned
in one day, being forty miles out, and in: For I went by
boate, and not by land, through the pleasant <hi>Euripus,</hi>
that runneth between the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea and <hi>Hellespont:</hi>
And by the way, I cannot but regrate the great losse Sir
<hi>Thomas Glover</hi> received by the Duke of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> who
chargeably entertained him two yeares in his house, and
furnished him with great monies, and other necessaries fit
for his eminency: This Duke or Prince of <hi>Bugdonia</hi> was
derpaved of his Principalities by <hi>Achmet,</hi> and fled hither
to the Christian Ambassadours for reliefe: To whom
when all the rest had refus'd acceptance, only Noble Sir
<hi>Thomas</hi> received him, maintaining him, and seriously
wrought with the Grand Signior and his Counsell, to
have had him restored againe to his Lands, but could not
prevaile.</p>
                  <p>In the end, Sir <hi>Thomas Glovers</hi> five yeares time of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadry
being expired, and the Duke hearing privately

the halfe of his moneys, the other halfe he was forced
to forgoe for divers importunate respects. Nay, I must
say one thing more of this Knight, hee relieved more
slaves from the Galleys, payd their ransomes, and sent
them home freely to their Christian stations, and kept a
better house, than any Ambassadour did, that ever lay at

                  <p>The <hi>Turkes</hi> have no Bels in their Churches, neither the
use of a clocke, nor numbring of houres, but they have
high round Steeples, for they contrafact, and contradict
all the formes of Christians: when they goe to pray, they
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:9042:81"/>
are all called together by the voice of crying men, who go
upon the bartizings of their Steeples, shouting and crying
with a shrill voice: <hi>Lailla, Eillalla,</hi> Mahomet <hi>Rezul allah,</hi>

for the <hi>Turks,</hi> the Saturday for <hi>Iews,</hi> and the Sunday

at three of the clock in the afternoon: The fourth is, at
the Sun-setting, Summer and Winter: Fifthly, the last
houre of Prayer, is alwayes two or three houres within
night. Many of them will watch till that time, and not
sleep; and others sleeping, will awake at the voice of the
Cryer, and go to Church.</p>
                  <p>In signe of reverence, and in a superstitious devotion
before they go into their <hi>Mosquees,</hi> they wash themselves
in a <hi>Lavotoio,</hi> beginning at the privy members, next their
mouthes, faces, feet and hands: And entring, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
their heads downwards to the earth; and falling on
their knees, doe kisse the ground three times. Then the

And somtimes will abruptly sing the Psalmes of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
in the <hi>Arabick</hi> tongue, but to no sense, nor veritie of

the Scriptures. And at their devotion, they will not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate
any women in their company, lest they should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
their minds and affections from their present zeale:
But the men observe their turns and times, and the women
theirs, going always when they goe, either of them alone
to their devotion: The like custome, but not after the
same manner have I seen observed among the Protestants
in <hi>Transilvania, Hungaria, Moravia, Bohemia,</hi> and <hi>Silesia;</hi>
who when they come to Church on the Sabbath day,
there is a Taffata Curtaine drawne from the pulpit to the
Church wall over against it: The men sitting on the right
hand of the preacher, the women on the left; whose eyes
and faces cannot see other during Divine Service, save on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Minister that over-toppeth both sides; and truly me
thought it was a very modest, and necessary observation.

                  <p>They hold all mad men in great reverence, as Prophets
or Saints, and if they intend any far journy, private purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
or otherwise, before they go to battaile, they come to
crave counsell of these <hi>Santones,</hi> to know if they shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper,
or not, in their attempts. And whatsoever answer
these Bedlem prophets give, it is holden to be so credible,
as if an Oracle had spoken it. The <hi>Turkish</hi> priests are for

him downe to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to be a Factor in his Merchandise,

also deceitfull, variant and fraudulent, as may appeare
in his Satanicall Fables, expressed in his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> where
oft one saying contradicteth another, both in words,

him for a divine Prophet; imparting, the same unto her

new affinity, he not onely seduced his Father in law, but
also the whole linage of that family; by whose acceptance,

and somtimes death it selfe; which plainly doth demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate

                  <p>I have often heard <hi>Turkes</hi> brawle one with another,

dare they for feare of severe punishment imposed to
such quarrellers: But they will injure and strike Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
who dare not say it is a misse, or strike again. It is a
common thing with them, to kill their seruants for a very
small offence, and when they have done, throw them like
Dogs in a Ditch. And oftentimes (if not so) will lay
them downe on their backes, hoysing up their heeles,
bind their feete together, and fasten them to a post, and
with a cudgell give them three or foure hundred blows
on the soles of their feete: whereupon peraduenture,
some ever go lame after. Their servants are bought and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:9042:87"/>
sold, like bruit beasts in Markets; neither can these mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
drudges ever recover liberty, except they buy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
free, either by one means or other. Their wives are
not far from the like servitude, for the men by the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi>
are admitted to marry as many women as they will, or
their ability can keep. And if it shall happen, that any one
of these women (I mean either Wife or Concubine) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ftituteth
her selfe to an other man besides her Husband;
then may he by authority, binde her hands and feet, hang
a stone about her neck, and cast her into a River, which by
them is usually done in the night.</p>
                  <p>But when these Infidels please to abuse poore Christian
women against their Husbands will, they little regard the

the villain being strip'd naked, and his hands bound

he fals, with a rattle, among the iron pikes, hanging either
by the buttocks, by the brests, by the sides, or shoulders;

                  <p>The <hi>Turkes</hi> in generall, whensoever they loath or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
their wives, use to sell them in Markets, or otherwise
bestow them on their men-slaves: And although their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

eat together, for commonly the women stand, and serve

their Husbands at meate, and after that, that eate a part
by themselves, secretly; without admission of any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
in their company, if they be above fourteen years
of age. They go seldome abroad, unlesse it be each Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day

for the dead, always covering their faces, very modest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with white or black Maskes, which are never unce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,

fancie to follow their folly, and blindnesse, to overtop
the ignorance of Nature, drawing all their drifts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

who transported the seat of the Empire from <hi>Rome</hi> to

And from <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great in the East, to the

Emperours: of whom <hi>Constantine</hi> the sixth, sonne to <hi>Leo</hi>

that now reigneth, <hi>Charlemaine</hi> being the hundred

                  <p>Now to reckon the <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperours, I will first begin

eleven Emperors: The number of which are onely twenty,

shall be rooted from the earth.</p>

                  <p>Now as concerning his riches, the chiefest three parts
of Commerce of all kind of merchandise, and abounding
in silver and gold in all the <hi>Turkes</hi> dominions, as well in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:9042:93"/>
                     <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Affrick,</hi> as <hi>Europe,</hi> are these <hi>Constantinople</hi> in
<hi>Thracia</hi> of <hi>Europe: Aleppo</hi> in <hi>Syria</hi> of <hi>Asia major;</hi> and
Grand <hi>Cairo</hi> in <hi>Aegypt</hi> of <hi>Affrick:</hi> for these are the three
Magezines of the whole Empire, that draw the whole
riches, money, and trafficke to them of all the Imperiall
Provinces:<note place="margin">The Great <hi>Turks</hi> yeerly rent.</note> It is thought that ordinarily and annually the
Rent of the great <hi>Turke</hi> amounteth to sixteen Millions of
Gold, notwithstanding that some do make it lesser: But
because it is so hard to judge of any Monarchs Rents; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
like the infinite concavities of the earth, sending, and
receiving so innumerable wayes their streames of riches,
I'le desist from any other instances: And yet the great
<hi>Turks</hi> revenues, are no way answerable to his great and
large Dominions: The causes arising hereupon are many,
of whom I will select three or foure of the chiefest rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
First the <hi>Turkes</hi> being more given to armes, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
to destroy and ruine, and to consume the wealth of
the people they overcome, leaving them destitute, of nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riture;
rather then any way to give course for their encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and stablishing of trafficke, out of which should flow
the Royall advantages. And the reason why they keepe
their subjects poore, and frustrate themselves of great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits;
is onely to weaken, and enfeeble them, whereby they
should not have wherewith to move insurrection or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
against them.<note place="margin">Certain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> And on the other part, the <hi>Greeks</hi> are
as unwiling to be industrious in Arts, Trafficke or Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage;
seeing what they possesse is not their owne, but is
taken from them at all occasions, with tyranny &amp; oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
For what gaines the sower, if another reape the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit?
So in the <hi>Ottomans</hi> estate, there be great Forrests, and
desartuous Countries; proceeding of the scarcity of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to inhabit there, the multitudes being drawn from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
to strengthen the frontiers of his dominions in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:9042:94"/>
And besides there is another reason of the dispopulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of these parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wit, when the Great <hi>Turkes</hi> Army
is to march to a farre Country to make warres, then
must their vulgar subdued peasants, perhaps twenty or
thirty thousands go along with them, to carry their victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
and all manner of provision, being taken from the
plough, are constrained to this servitude, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the halfe of them never returne againe: Partly,
because of the change of food, and aire, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their long travels and insupportable service, both
in heate and cold: And to these of the first reason, there
is an other perpendicular cause; to wit, that the whole
commerce of all commodiites in <hi>Turkey,</hi> is in the hands of
Iewes and Christians, to wit, <hi>Ragusans, Venetians, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
French,</hi> and <hi>Flemmings,</hi> who so warily manage their
businesse, that they enjoy the most profits of any trading
there, dissappointing the <hi>Turkes</hi> owne subiects of their
due, and ordinary trafficke.</p>
                  <p>The last and most principall reason is,<note place="margin">Parcels of ground for <hi>Timariots.</hi>
                     </note> which is a great
deale of more importance than his Revenues; to wit, the
great number of his <hi>Timars:</hi> for the <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperours,
being immediate Maisters of the lands they ouercome,
they divide the same in <hi>Timars</hi> or commandements: lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
little or nothing at all to the ancient Inhabitants;
they dispose upon these proportions, to valorous Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that have done good service: And with this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they maintaine, and have alwayes in readinesse
Horses for the warres: which is an excellent good order
for the preservation of his Empire; for if these Timariots
were not rewarded, with such absolute possessions of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
grounds, the state of his power would suddenly runne
to ruine: for the profit of which lands, maintaining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
their horses and their families, maketh them the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:9042:94"/>
more willing to concur in the infallible service of their
Emperour: These <hi>Timars</hi> or grounds, entertain through
all his Dominions, about two hundred and fifty thousand
horses, that are ever in readinesse to march at the first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement,
without any charge to the great Signior, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bound to maintaine themselues in during the warres:
And yet these <hi>Timariots,</hi> and their horses cannot yearely
be maintained under the value of ten Millions of Gold:
The consideration whereof, makes me astonished, when I
recall, the relation of some ragged Authors, who dare
compare the great <hi>Turkes</hi> Revenues unto our petty
Princes of Christendome.</p>
                  <p>This establishment of <hi>Timars,</hi> and the by past election
of <hi>Azamglians,</hi> or young children to bee made <hi>Ianisaries</hi>
haue been the two strong Foundations, that supported so
inviolably the <hi>Turkes</hi> Empire. The <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours
for a long time vsed the selfe same manner for the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of their persons, and estate, in election of yong males
to be their guard. They were called the Pretorian Army,
and this taxation of children was the first thing that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> to revolt against the <hi>Romanes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Turkish</hi> Cavalrie, they sustaine two impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
effects,<note place="margin">Policies of <hi>Turks.</hi>
                     </note> first they keepe under awe and subjection, the
great <hi>Turks</hi> subiects who otherwise perhaps wold teuolt:
And next they are ordained for any dependant interprise
for field Garrisons, yea, and the principall finewes of the
warres: and yet the election of the grand Signior, lieth
most in the hands of the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> who cannot perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say hee is Emperour before they confirme him in his
Throne.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turkes</hi> have three things in their Armies which
are very fearefull, to wit, the infinite number of men,
great Discipline, and force of Munition: And for Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:9042:95"/>
they are not onely gouerned with great silence, and
obedience, but they are ruled also with signes of the eye,
and being tractable, they are tied to main condusements:
And although their multitudes have often bred confusion
to them, so that little Armies have broke and overcome
them; yet in their flight they are so cautulous, that a small
number can do them no absolute violence nor finall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw:
for as they assail, so they flie without feare.</p>
                  <p>The first Residence of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperour after his
comming from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> was at <hi>Priusa</hi> in <hi>Bythinia:</hi> thence
it was transported to <hi>Andreanople,</hi> and then to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
where it abideth to this day: Besides, all his

and the fourth in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> &amp;c. And in <hi>Asia major,</hi> and

and <hi>Persia,</hi> &amp;c. For <hi>Arsenals</hi> hee hath foure for Sea, to wit,
one at <hi>Perah,</hi> or <hi>Galata,</hi> containing a hundred thirty and
three Galleys: The second at <hi>Gallipoli</hi> of twenty Galleys:
The third <hi>Arsenall</hi> is at <hi>Savezza</hi> upon the Red Sea, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
of twenty five Galleys: And the fourth is at <hi>Belsara</hi>
in <hi>Arabia foelix,</hi> towards the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulfe, depending of
fifteene Galleys, which are kept there to afflict the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals,</hi>
remaining in the Isle of <hi>Ormus;</hi> and other parts
adjacent there.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> have a custome, when they are Masters of
any Province, to extermine all the native Nobilitie,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:9042:95"/>
chiefly those of the blood Royall of the Country: And
neverthelesse they permit to all and every one of theirs to
live and follow his own Religion as hee pleaseth without
violence or constraint.</p>
                  <p>Amongst the <hi>Turkes</hi> there is no Gentilitie, nor Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
but are all as ignoble and inferiour members, to one
mayne body the Great <hi>Turke,</hi> lineally descending of
the House of <hi>Ottoman:</hi> whose magnificence, puissance,
and power is such, that the most eloquent tongue cannot
sufficiently declare: His thousands of <hi>Ianizaries, Shouses,</hi>
and others daily attending him: which are the nerves and
sinews of the Warlike bodie of his whole Monarchy
and Imperiall Estate: His hundreds (besides his Queene)
of Concubines, hourely maintained by his means, and
monethly renewed: His Armies, <hi>Bashawes, Emeeres,
Vizier-bashawes, Sanzacks,</hi> Garrisons, and forces here
and there dispersed amongst his Dominions, would be
impossible for mee briefly to relate. The inhumane poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of the <hi>Turks</hi> to avoid civill dissention is such, that
the seed of <hi>Ottoman</hi> (all except one of them) are strangled
to death: Wherefore, as <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> said of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>
in the like case, It is better to be the Great <hi>Turkes</hi>
Dog, then his Sonne. His Daughters or Sisters are
not so used, but are given in Marriage to any <hi>Bassa,</hi>
whom so they affect; yet with this condition; the King
saith to his Daughter, or Sister, I give thee this man
to be thy slave; and if he offend thee in any case, or be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
to thy will, here I give thee a Dagger to cut off
his head; which always they weare by their sides for the
same purpose.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> differ much from the <hi>Turks,</hi> in nobilitie,

which for the spaciousnesse, furniture, and magnificent
workmanship was accounted one of the seven Worlds
Wonders: It was two hundred yeares in building, being
foure hundred twenty five foot long, and two hundred

There is a kinde of Serpent said to be in it, so friendly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

and by some called <hi>Dionisa</hi> and <hi>Naxus,</hi> an Island both
fruitfull and delightfull. As we sailed by the west part of
the Isle, a <hi>Greekish</hi> passenger shewed mee the place,
where (as he said) <hi>Ariadne</hi> was deceived of <hi>Theseus,</hi>
which is not farre from the irriguate plaine of <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mille.</hi>

                  <p>Continuing our Navigation,<note place="margin">Excellent Swimmers.</note> I saw the little Isle <hi>Eph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosh,</hi>
where the <hi>Turks</hi> told me, that all the Islanders
were naturally good swimmers, paying no more tribute
to their great Lord the <hi>Turke,</hi> save onely once in the yeare
there are certaine men and women chosen by a Turkish
Captaine, who must swimme a whole league right out in
the Sea, and goe downe to the bottome of the waters, to
fetch thence some token they have got ground: And if
they shall happen to faile in this, the Island will be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
againe to pay him yearly rent. This I saw with mine
eyes, whiles we being calmed, there came a man, and two
women swimming to us, more than a mile of way, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with them (drye above the water) baskets of fruite
to sell, the which made me not a little to wonder. For
when they came to the ships side, they would neither
boord, nor boat with us, but lay leaning, or as it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
themselves on the Sea, upon their one side, and sold
so their fruits, keeping Complements and discourses with
us above an houre. Contenting them for their ware,
&amp; a fresh gale arising, we set forward, accoasting the little
Isle of <hi>Samothracia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Isle of <hi>Samothracia,</hi> was called of old <hi>Dardania,</hi>
and now by the <hi>Turks Samandracho;</hi> a place of small
note, considering the quantity of the Isle, &amp; the few num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

a hope for blessednesse, which indeed more wish for, then

to be one of the seven earthly Wonders, and so it
might justly have beene: The quantity whereof (as yet)
may amaze the minde of the beholder: It was erected in
the Image of a man, being eighty Cubits high, and so
big that the little finger of it was as big as an ordinary
man: between whose legs, (it standing in the Harbours
mouth, with a leg on each side of the entery) Ships were
wont to passe under with taunt sails: When <hi>Mnavi</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
of <hi>Caliph Osman</hi> first united this Isle to the <hi>Mahometan</hi>

the brasse whereof was said to be so much that it loaded
nine hundred Camels.</p>
                  <p>This Isle belonged once to the Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:9042:101"/>
were then sirnamed <hi>Knights of the Rhodes,</hi> but they
came first out of <hi>Acre</hi> in the Holy Land; who were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Knights of St. Iohn;</hi> who viriliously expulsed the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razens</hi>
from thence, <hi>Anno</hi> 1308. who had formerly taken
it from the divided <hi>Grecians:</hi> These Knights sorely in
vested the <hi>Turkes</hi> for the space of two hundred yeares,
till <hi>Solyman</hi> the magnificent, at last invaded and subdued
it: The <hi>Rhodians</hi> were ever good freinds to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
in somuch that when all the other Mediterranean Islands
revolted to <hi>Mythridates</hi> of <hi>Pontus,</hi> this onely adhered to
the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Isle of <hi>Rhodes</hi> within the space of 25 yeares was
three times mightily indangered by violent and extreame
impetuosities of raine: in such sort that the last flood did
drowne the greatest part of the Inhabitants:<note place="margin">Inundation of waters.</note> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
in the Spring-time did continue to Summer, and
in all this time, it broke violently downe their houses, and
in the night killed the people lying in their beds; and in
the day time such as were sheltered under safegard of
their dwelling: which was a miserable destruction, and
the like of it scarcely heard of since the universall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.</p>
                  <p>But true it is, as these Ominous judgments falling upon
particular parts &amp; parcels of people are justly executed;
yet they serve for Caveats for all others in generall (sinne
being the originall of all) to take heed of offending the
Creator, in abusing the bestuse of the Creature.</p>
                  <p>The Citie of <hi>Rhodes</hi> hath two strong Fortresses, in
one of which these Knights (<hi>Lilladamus Villiers</hi> being

three hundred Galleys, for the space of sixe months. The

chiefe obstacle, and impeaching of so great an Army

And on <hi>Christmas</hi> day <hi>Solyman</hi> entred the Towne as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
though hee might justly have said (as <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>

it from time to time, by the tradition of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors:
And because of the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and other

detain their names in that Countrey. Some hold,
that Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> extended over all the Earth. But
contrariwise, it manifestly appeareth by the second
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:9042:110"/>
Chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi> 2. 20. that this Garden, which we call
Paradice, wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was put to dresse it, was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
place on earth, containing a particular portion of a
Country, called <hi>Eden,</hi> which boundeth on the River <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

To this, and all the rest, I answer, no certainty
can be had of the place where <hi>Eden</hi> was, either by reading
or travelling, because this River hath been oft divided in
sundry streams: And it is said, that <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when he wonne
<hi>Babylon,</hi> did turn the main channell of <hi>Euphrates</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
course. But howsoever, or wheresoever it be, I resolve
my self, no man can demonstrate the place, which God for
the sins and fall of man, did not onely accurse; but also the
whole face of the Earth.</p>

we had dangerous travelling, being oft assailed with

in point of choaking for lacke of water. The
confusion of this multitude, was not onely grievous in
regard of the extreame heate, providing of victuals at
poore Villages, and scarcity of water, to fill our bottles,
made of Boare-skinnes; but also amongst narrow and
stony passages, thronging, we oft fell one over another

abide a man to walke in turnes, or stand to eate; their
usage being such that when they come from the horse
backe, presently sit downe on the ground, folding their
feete under them, when they repose, dine, and sup. So
doe also their Artizans and all the <hi>Turkes</hi> in the World

and magnanimous virility: for my part, I must needs
say, the diligent care of that benigne Caravan extended
over mee, was such, that whensoever I remember it, I am
not able to sacrifice congratulations sufficiently to his

too seek a redresse. For often times an inconvenience
is most convenient; and as the great corrupter of youth
is pleasure, and the violent enemy of age is griefe; even so

                  <p>The obligation of my bounden duety, taught me to

the sonne of <hi>Cham:</hi> secondly, the <hi>Land of Promise,</hi> because
it was promised by the Lord to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his seed to

And now sixtly, <hi>terra sancta,</hi> the holy Land, because here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
was wrought many wonderfull miracles, but especially
the work of our salvation. It is in length 180, and in
breadth 60 miles: yet of that salubrity of aire and fertility
of soile flowing with Milke and Honey that before the
comming of the <hi>Israelites</hi> it maintained thirty Kings,
with their people, and afterward the two potent King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes

by the blessing of God, it was the most fruitfull
Land in the World: But by experience, I finde now the
contrary, and the fruitfulnesse thereof to be changed, God
cursing the Land together with the <hi>Iews,</hi> then the (but

and surely the two eyes of Day and Night, with the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,

nor warme as they have been: Time from old antiquity,
running all things to devasted desolation, making the

                  <p>The day following, imbracing our way, we passed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a little pleasant Mountain, where the <hi>Armenian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarke</hi>

was very likely to have beene the place: the auncient

                  <p>Continuing our journey, wee saw Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> on our

                     <hi>Aprill</hi> the 20 day, about ten of the clocke (passing

                     </note> and told the Caravan, that I saw that
House standing in <hi>Italy,</hi> which (as the <hi>Romanists</hi> say) was
transported by the Angels: O, said he, we <hi>Armenians</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
believe that, neither many other assertions of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church; for wee certainly know by Christians, that
have from time to time dwelt here ever since, that this is,
both the place, and stones of the House: Let Papists coine
a new Law to themselves, wee care not, for as they erre in
this, so doe they erre in all, following meerly the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of men, they run galloping post to Hell. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
being informed by the laughing Caravan of these
news, asked me in disdain (thinking it had been an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of my beliefe) if I saw that House, or believed that
the Chappell of <hi>Loretta</hi> was such a thing: to whom I
constantly answered, I did not believe it, affirming it was
onely but a Devillish invention, to deceive the blind-fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
people, and to fill the Coffers of the <hi>Roman</hi> priests:
Now thou bottomlesse Gulfe of papistry, here I forsake
thee, no Winter-blasting Furies of Satans subtile storms,
can make shipwrack of my Faith, on the stony shelves of
they deceitfull deeps.</p>
                  <p>Thus, and after this manner too: are all the illusions of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:9042:121"/>
their imaginary and false miracles, first invented partly
by monasteriall pouerty, then confirmed by provincial
bribery, and lastly they are faith-sold for consistoricall
lucre. In the time of our staying here; the <hi>Emeere</hi> or Lord
of the Towne sent six women, conducted by 12 of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
to an <hi>Armenian</hi> Prince, that was a Pilgrime in our
company: to be used by him and others whom so he
would elect to be his fellow labourers:<note place="margin">Libidinous leachery.</note> Which indeed he
did kindly accept, and invited me to that feast: but I gave
him the refusall, little regarding such a frivolous commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.
He, and fome of the chiefe Pilgrimes entertayned
them for the space of three houres, and sent them backe,
giving to their Conductors fifteene Piasters in a reward.
Truly if I would rehearse the impudency of these whoors,
and the brutishnesse of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> as it is most igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
to the actors; so no doubt, it would be very loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to the Reader.</p>
                  <p>Such is the villanie of these <hi>Orientall</hi> slaues under the
<hi>Turkes;</hi> that not onely by conversing with them, learne
some of their damnable Hethnick customes, but also go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beyond them in beastly sensualnesse, become worse
then bruite beasts: This maketh me remember a worthy
saying of that Heathenish <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius,</hi>
who in consideration of fleshly lusts, said; that
although he were sure, that the gods would not punish
him for the offence; yet he would forbeare it, in regard
of the filthinesse of the fact it selfe: Indeede of a Pagan
a noble and vertuous resolution, when such base and beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Christians, these wretched <hi>Armenians,</hi> committed
with these Infidelish harlots a twofold kind of voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
abhomination, which my conscience commands me
to conceale: least I frequent this Northen World, with
that which their nature never knew, nor their knowledge
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:9042:122"/>
have heard hearing of the like: but God in his iust judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that same night, threatned both to have punished
the doers, and the whole company for their sakes: For
wee having resolved to travell all that night, and because
the way was rocky and hard to be knowne, and peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for <hi>Arabs;</hi> we hired a Christian guide named <hi>Ioab,</hi>
and agreed with him to take us to <hi>Lidda,</hi> which was two
dayes journey. But before we advanced to our passage,
<hi>Ioab</hi> had sent a privie messenger before us, to warne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
three hundred <hi>Arabs</hi> (who had their abode on the
South side of Mount <hi>Carmell</hi>) to meete him at such a
place as he had appointed;<note place="margin">A villanous plot.</note> giving them to know, wee
were rich and well provided with Chickens and Sultans
of Gold, and Piasters of silver, and that he should render
us into their hands for such a recompence and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as their savage judgement should thinke fit; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the spoyles and booties they should obtaine, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the miserable murder and losse of our lives.
This being done, and unknown to us, we marched along,
travelling faster then our ordinary pace, some on horse,
and some on foot, for my pilgrimage was ever pedestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
which our guide suspecting that by our celerity wee
should goe beyond the place appointed for his treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
plot, began to crosse us grievously; leading us up
and downe amongst pools and holes, whither he listed;
where many of our Camels &amp; Asses were lost, and could
not be recovered, because wee all began to suspect and
feare; which was the cause that the owners durst not stay
to relieve their perished beasts.</p>
                  <p>In the end, the Captaine and <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> intreated him
earnestly to bring us in the right way; but the more they
requested, the more obdurate was his heart, replying, he
was mistaken, and could not finde it, till day light: upon
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:9042:122"/>
the which words, the company was stayed, and in the
mean-while there came a <hi>Turke,</hi> one of our S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon, they straight bound him with ropes,
on a horse back, threatning him with death, to cause him
confesse the truth.</p>
                  <p>In the midst of this tumult, I having got sight of the
North-starre, (which seem'd exceeding low to me) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
thereby, that the Villaine had led us more to the
Southward, then to the Westward, which was our way to
Jerusalem: <hi>Whereupon I intreated the Caravan to turne
our faces Northward, otherwise we should be cut off, and
that suddenly: for although (said I) it may peradventure
be, that we are three or foure miles short of the place inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for our massacre, yet they missing us, will like ravening
Wolves hunt here and there; wherefore, if wee, incline to
the North, (God willing) wee shall prevent their bloody
designes.</hi> To the which advice (being duely pondered)
they yielded; and so I became their Guide, in that darke
night, till morning: for none of them knew that Starre,
neither the nature of it. At last this desperate wretch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that either by our vanquishing, or the enemies
victory, hee could not escape, sith his Treason was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed;
began to beg pardon of the Caravan, saying that
if he could have any surety of his life, he would sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
informe us, how to eschew these iminent dangers, for
we were all in extream perill of our lives; and not so much
courage not comfort left us, as the very smallest hope of
any relief.</p>
                  <p>The Captain being distracted with feare, replied hee
would, and thereupon swore a solemne oath, so did the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:9042:123"/>
                     <hi>Ianizaries</hi> sweare by the head of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> for the like ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
Which being done, he was untied, and confessed, that
if we had continued in our way he led us, we had been all
put to the edge of the Sword: and falling downe on his
knees, cried oft with teares, mercy, mercy, mercy.</p>
                  <p>All that night we went with that <hi>Starre,</hi> and against

expence of men, money, and great labour to conquer
it, being then separated from the mayne Continent, by
the Sea, but now joyned to the firme Land: and before
you come to the City, there lieth a great banke of sand,
where it is likely the Sea hath beene in <hi>Alexanders</hi> time:
Though now, as time altereth every thing, the Sea be fled
from that place, which maketh that ruinous Town seem
more desolate. At the breake of day, I and certain <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
went to visit this decayed Towne, and found the
most famous ruines here, that the Word for memory
can affoord, and a Delicious incircling Harbour, inclos'd
within the middle of the Town, fit to receive small Barks,
Frigots, and Galleots: the compassing fore-face whereof,
being all of foure squared Marble and Alablaster stones:
the most part of all which Houses have stood on pillars
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:9042:123"/>
of the same stones: the infinite number whereof may as
yet be,<note place="margin">The ruines of <hi>Tyrus.</hi>
                     </note> (above and below the sands) perspectively beheld.
There be onely some nineteene fire houses here, which are
<hi>Moores:</hi> and is now under the <hi>Emeere</hi> of the <hi>Drusians,</hi>
who remayneth in <hi>Sydon.</hi> The East part of this Country
aboundeth in Balme, Honey, and Oile, and was the Seat
of <hi>Asher,</hi> of whom <hi>Moses</hi> prophecied, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 24. that
he should dip his feet in Oile.</p>
                  <p>Here these <hi>Egyptian Moores,</hi> for so they were first bred
there: brought us a pillar lying upon the ground, of nine
severall colours of Marble, being one intire stone, and the
length of it was twenty two of my measure, and eight in
compasse: Which said they, was one of the Pillars that
<hi>Sampson</hi> pulled downe upon the <hi>Philistims</hi> at the
houre of his Death.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sampsons</hi> Pillar.</note> To whom I answered, that
<hi>Sampson</hi> died at <hi>Azath,</hi> the furthest South-west part of
<hi>Palestine</hi> where he bore down the House of <hi>Dagon</hi> upon
the <hi>Philistims:</hi> And I thinke the ancient <hi>Tyrians,</hi> said I,
could not transport that Pillar so far hither: But they the
more constantly affirmed it, and so did these <hi>Armenians</hi>
that were with me confirme it also, some of whom, had
been twice there before: yet howsoever it was, I brought
home a pound weight of it, and presented the half there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
to King <hi>Iames of blessed Memory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here by accident, in returning back to the Caravan, I
met with an <hi>English Factor,</hi> named Master <hi>Brockesse,</hi>
who then remayned at <hi>Sydon,</hi> eighteene miles from this
place, and had beene down at <hi>Acre</hi> about some negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
Who indeed eftsoons, and kindly tooke mee into a
<hi>Moorish</hi> House by the Sea side, and one of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
where instantly wee swallowed downe such joviall
and deep carouses of <hi>Leatick</hi> Wine, that both hee and I,
were almost fastned in the last plunge of understanding:
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:9042:124"/>
Yet neverthelesse, he conveyed me backe to my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and put me safe into the hands of the Caravan, with
whom afterwards I diverse times met with here at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi>
to whose kindnesse I celebrate the memory of these
lines.</p>
                  <p>But now the Sunne discovering the earth, and the
night banished to the inferiour world, we were all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
for the light of the day lends comfort: The
Captaine (sending backe that false <hi>Iudas,</hi> for so was hee
sworne to do) sent a post to <hi>Tyrus</hi> for a new guide, who
came forthwith, and brought us in our way to Mount
<hi>Carmell,</hi> for by it we behoved to go; and in our way we
met with the desolate Towne of <hi>Sarepta</hi> nigh thereunto
adjoyning, where <hi>Elias</hi> was sustained in a great famine by
a Widdow,<note place="margin">A corrupted Caravan.</note> whose sonne he raised from death.</p>
                  <p>Great are the mercies of God, for as hee hath made
man an excellent creature, so hath he also indued him
with two great powers in his minde: The one a wise po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of understanding, by which he penetrateth into the
knowledge of things: the other a strong power of dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
resolving; whereby he executeth things well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
for we having judged the worst, resolved the best:
and by his Almighty providence were freed from that
apparent danger, although the former dayes whoredome,
and unnaturall vices, deserved a just punishment.</p>
                  <p>This I intimate to all Travelers in generall, that if
they would that God should further them in their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
blesse their voyages, and grant them a safe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to their native Countries (without the which, what
contentment have they for all their pains?) that they
would constantly refraine from whoredome, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and too much familiarity with strangers: <hi>For a
Traveller that is not temperate, and circumspect in all his
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:9042:124"/>
actions, although he were headed like that Herculean Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi>
Hydra, <hi>yet it is impossible he can returne in safety from
danger of the</hi> Turkes, Arabs, Moors, <hi>wild beasts, &amp; the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
operative extremities of heat, hunger, thirst, and cold.</hi>

                     <hi>Carmell,</hi> and leaving it upon

beheld a farre off upon the top of the hill, the place where
<hi>Elias</hi> ascended to Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

foure miles of length, lying South and North, the North

<hi>Ptolomaeis,</hi> and the South end joyning with the borders
of <hi>Samaria,</hi> through the which confine we past.</p>
                  <p>Leaving <hi>Samaria</hi> on our left hand, wee entred into a
faire Plaine,<note place="margin">Samaria.</note> adorned with fruitfull Trees, and all other
ornaments that pleasant fields afford; but no Village
wee saw. Marching thus about the declining of the
Sunne from the Meridian, wee came in sight of two
hundred Pavillians, all pitched in rankes; yeelding the
prospect of a little City, by a brooke side of water:
which being perceived, the Captaine began to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
what they might bee; and immediately there came
riding towards us, sixe naked fellowes, well mounted
on <hi>Arabian</hi> Geldings, who demanded what wee were?
and whither we were bound with such a multitude; and if
there were any <hi>Franks</hi> of <hi>Christendome</hi> in our company.
To whom the <hi>Ianisaries</hi> replyed, we were purposed to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
and that there was but one <hi>Franke</hi> with them:
Upon the which they presently sought mee, demanding
<hi>Caffar, Caffar;</hi> that was tribute for my head, &amp; caused me
perforce notwithstanding of the resisting <hi>Caravan,</hi> and
<hi>Ianisaries,</hi> to pay them presently for my life seven
Chickens of Gold, seven times nine shillings sterling:
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:9042:125"/>
And this is, because sayd they, our King is resident in these
Tents, and therefore we haue tripled his tribute: And
yet were they discontented, because there were no moe
Franks in our company, for from the <hi>Armenians,</hi> they
could not, nor would not seeke any tribute, because they
were tributary slaves and subjects to the great <hi>Turke:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there
also of any other Christians borne in his dominions,
when they shall happen to fall into their hands.</p>
                  <p>They returning backe to their Prince, with the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of my heart, and the sorrow of a Pilgrimes purse,
we marching on in our way, that day wee travelled above
thirty foure miles, and pitched at a Village called <hi>Adoash,</hi>
being composed of threescore <hi>Moorish</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi>
Houses, standing in a fruitfull and delicate Plaine;
and garnished with Olive, Date, and Figge-trees,
which were both pleasant and profitable: where we
found also good Hearbs to eate, and abundance of
Water to drinke, and also to fill our emptied bottles:
As wee lay downe to sleepe after a hungry supper, on
the hard ground, and our guard watching us; that same
King of the <hi>Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>bians</hi> came a little before mid-night,<note place="margin">The Savage <hi>Arabian</hi> King</note>
with twenty four wel horsed Runagates, and naked Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
being armed with bowes and arrowes, and halfe-pikes,
pointed at both ends with hard Steele; and asked
for the <hi>Caravan,</hi> who presently awoke, and went to salute
him, laying his hand on his breast, bowed his head very
low; which is the usuall courtesie amongst the Infidels
and Christians in these parts: For they never uncover
their heads to any man; and after some short parley, they
sate all downe on the grasse. The <hi>Caravan</hi> presented
his rude like maiesty with water, bread, hearbes, figs,
garlike, and such things as he had.</p>
                  <p>As they were thus merry, at this poore banquet, the

were any more <hi>Franks</hi> there then I; and he having sworne
the truth: the King by a malignant informer, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently
caused mee to bee brought before him; and
staring mee in the face, asked my Interpreter where
were my companions? Who replyed I had none: then
said hee, tell that dogge, or <hi>Elishole,</hi> hee must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
me with five peeces of gold more, otherwise (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a signe to his owne throate) I shall cut off his head,
because (said he) I will not loose this nights travell for
nothing: The which I being informed, and knowing
that by no condition;<note place="margin">Exaction of tributes.</note> there was resistance against such
a scelerate Prince, gave it him forth of mine owne hand,
having consulted with my Captaine before, and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
with a halfe smiling countenance; which hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking,
told the rest, it seemed I gave it with a good
heart and a cheerefull gesture, and to recompence my
outward behaviour, he drunke a great draught of water
to me: thinking thereby, he had done mee more honour
then all the Chickens of gold I gave him now, and in
the morning would doe him profit or pleasure: pleasure
they could doe him none, for they were unlawfully
and dishonestly got, and too delivered from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
sorrow of my sighing soule; and no wonder, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
spent two yeares great charges in <hi>Turkey,</hi> before
this time, but that I should have beene exceeding penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
of money, and thereupon desolate of reliefe and
comfort.</p>
                  <p>Truely this was one of the greatest tributes I payed
for one dayes journey, that I had in all my voyage, in
<hi>Asia.</hi> There are two Kings in <hi>Arabia,</hi> the one who
liveth on <hi>Euphrates,</hi> the desarts of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in <hi>Arabia Felix,</hi> and in some parts of <hi>Syria:</hi> And
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:9042:126"/>
the other was hee to whom I paid this money) wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
with his Tribes, Tents, and Bestiall, one while in

                     <note place="margin">Two <hi>Arabian</hi> Kings.</note> and <hi>Deserta,</hi> and sometimes in the <hi>Holy
Land,</hi> as hee findeth good pastorage, and fresh Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.
These two Kings are mortall enemies: and if by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
they meete, they fight most cruelly, bringing dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
rapine, and destruction to themselves, and their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers:
for it is a difficult thing in them to dominate their
inordinate passions, being untamed Savages, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarders
of civility, who continually contend to corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
the malignity of their dispositions, with bloody
and inhumane interprises. And yet al the rest of that night,
after his returne from us, we still expected some treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
surprise, which made our Souldiers stand stoutly on
their guard, and we Pilgrims to our vigilant and naked
defence: For the <hi>Turkes</hi> will not suffer Christians to carry
weapons in al these Dominions, neither any where, where
they command. And for all this great tribute, and nights
danger of my life, here was my present resolution:
<q>
                        <l>The more I am beset, with dreadfull snares</l>
                        <l>Begirded round, in shelfie gulfes of wracke;</l>
                        <l>And shipbroke left, on rockes of deepe despaires,</l>
                        <l>Where helples care, with tort 'ring thoughts me racke:</l>
                        <l>Then stoutly stand I, hoping for the end,</l>
                        <l>That time will change, and God will better send.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now by the way I recall the aforesaid <hi>Turke,</hi> the
master of the Mule that carried my provision, and on
whom in the journey I had bestowed the most part of my
Tobacco: When I had no more to give him, and hee sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
the contrary, was councelled bee his associats to
beate me soundly, and dismount my Victuals and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from the Mules backe, till I propined him with the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:9042:126"/>
rest. Which intention being by me understood; I forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
run to the Caravan and complained: whereupon my
friend was bravely belaboured with a cudgel, and my bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
safety procured: Thus was his former shew of love
quickly expelled, and an inward grudge suddenly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
for it was the smoak, and not my self he respected.</p>

                     <l>As marish roots dissolve, even as they breed:</l>
                     <l>An humane creature, inhumanely taught,</l>
                     <l>Is worser given to ill, than evill fraught:</l>
                     <l>Things in themselves, be not so bad as ill,</l>
                     <l>The cause exeem'd, corruption hath free will:</l>
                     <l>Mans frail affection, is a cloudy mist,</l>
                     <l>Whose vapours fall, and fogge, as passions list:</l>
                     <l>Bad counsell's worse, than nature ill applies,</l>
                     <l>Weak judgement duls, when fear in reason flies:</l>
                     <l>Thus sad eclips'd, the dark eclipsed Moon</l>
                     <l>Did change, ere mine eclipsed light was won.</l>

                     <l>Came crawling on, as Snails advance the way.</l>

from <hi>Lydda,</hi> through the curling playnes of fat-fac'd
<hi>Palestine,</hi> scarcely were wee well advanced in our

shoure of Arrows, to the great annoyance of all our

shot off their Gunnes on a sudden, and stood manly also
to it, with their Bows and Arrows for our defence, wee

perished. But the nature of the <hi>Arabs</hi> is not unlike to the

                  <p>In that momentany conflict, on our side there were

killed nine Women, five Men, and about thirty persons

came, we stayed still in that same place, (expecting the
dangerous mutability of our austere fortune) and at our
departure thence, wee buried the slayne people in deep
graves, whereby <hi>Iackals</hi> should not open up their graves,
to eate their Corpes: for such is the nature of these cruell
beasts, that they onely love to live on mans flesh: these

that at that time, when the Cities of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>

They are also innumerable over all the Turkish Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

of Christ, that they use to say in detestation of any thing,
<hi>I would I might die a Iew;</hi> neither will they permit a <hi>Iew</hi>

                  <p>To reforme which enormities <hi>Matathias</hi> and his five

and plainly understand the Monuments I saw within
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the circumjacent places of <hi>Iudea;</hi> I
thought best to prefixe the description thereof, by the
severall dayes as I saw them, not much condemning,
neither absolutely qualifying them, but shall (as it were)
neutrally nominate, and recapitulate these places, as I
was informed by the <hi>Padre Guardiano, Gaudentius,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:9042:134"/>
Saybantus</hi> a <hi>Veronesen</hi> born; whence hee, and every one
of them every third yeare are changed and recalled backe
to Christendome, and other new Friers sent in their
places: And especially the information of <hi>Iohn Baptista,</hi>
the <hi>Trenchman,</hi> who dwelt and had stayed twenty
five yeares in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and from whom the Friers
themselves have their informations: for a stranger
that understandeth not promptly the <hi>Italian</hi> tongue,
which they usually speake,<note place="margin">The igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers.</note> when they demonstrate these
places unto us, hee shall conceive ignorantly, dispose
his judgement blind-foldedly, and knows not how to
distinguish the circumstances and qualities of the things
delivered. As I have knowne some of these <hi>Franks,</hi> in
my company, simply mistaken, even when the exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of every object was largely manifested unto them;
and precisely declared such a thing to have beene there,
although perhaps the matter it selfe, be evanished and
transported.</p>
                  <p>About two of the clocke on <hi>Palm-sunday</hi> after dinner,
for all of us eat, drunk, and lay in the Monastery, each of
us paying a <hi>Piaster</hi> a day for our diet, sixe shillings ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
besides all other costs and charges: The <hi>Guardian</hi> I
say, departed from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to <hi>Bethphage:</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with twelve Friers, and many other Orientall Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
which were come thither to that Festivall time, but
I by no means would go, neither would the six <hi>Germans,</hi>
but reposing our selves on the top or platforme of the
Cloyster, wee stayed till their return: And yet from this
place, wee saw their back-comming from <hi>Bethphage</hi> as
they crossed the lower and South side of <hi>Olivet;</hi> deval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
downward, toward the Valley of <hi>Iehosophat</hi> to
ascend Mount <hi>Syon,</hi> for the greater performance of their
foolery.</p>

                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:9042:134"/>
The ridiculous Ceremony which that day they use, is
thus: In an Apish imitation of Christ, at the foresaid
<hi>Bethphage,</hi> there was an Asse brought to the <hi>Guardiano,</hi>
whereupon hee mounted (being as it were, the greater
Asse, riding upon the lesser) and came riding to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
the people cutting downe boughs of Trees,<note place="margin">A superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ceremony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> and also dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyling
themselves almost to the skin, bestrewed the way
as hee rode along, crying, <hi>Hosanna, Hosanna, the Sonne
of</hi> David, <hi>blessed is hee that commeth in the Name of the
Lord:</hi> untill they came to the South gate of <hi>Syon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> where
the <hi>Guardian</hi> thought to have entred, riding through <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
to his Monastery, with this shouting Convoy of
sixe thousand Orientall Christians, because their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs
have not that liberty to doe so, as this <hi>Italian</hi> Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian:
Notwithstanding, the clamour of the people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
so the Turkish <hi>Garrison</hi> lying at this Gate, that
they not onely abused the poore Christians in their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
devotion, but they pulled the Guardian also from
the Asses backe, beating him most cruelly, and all the
rest of the Friers and Francke Pilgrimes that were with
him: Where at last entring the Covent, most of them
came in groaning, and loaden with blacke and bloody
blowes; whereat I, and the other Protestants, did laugh
in our sleeves to behold their foolish Procession, so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially
rewarded. At night after Supper, the <hi>Guardiano</hi>
knowing that I was a Protestant, and also these other <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
made an Oration, saying: <hi>You Pilgrims, who refuse
to be participant with us in the Sacraments, nor will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to our Masses, Processions and Ceremonies which we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of the Roman Church: I would therfore intreat you (your
liberty being here as much as mine, whereby you may doe as
you please) onely to abstaine from scandaling and mocking
our Rites and ordinary Customes, which at this great Feast
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:9042:135"/>
we must perform<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

tended no way to hurt the inward disposition of our
souls.</p>
                  <p>In the conclusion of his long Exhortation, he disclosed
this admonition, saying: All of you <hi>Travellers</hi> must in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
be indued with these three worthy gifts, <hi>Faith, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi>
and <hi>Mony: Faith,</hi> to believe these things you shall

                     <note place="margin">A flattering beggery.</note> to endure the
apparent injuries of Infidels; and <hi>Money,</hi> to discharge
all Tributes, and costs, which here (meaning in his own
Monastery) and about this City must be defrayed. His
Sermon hee concluded like a Grey Frier, as indeed hee
was: for I am fully perswaded hee little cared for our
Faith, and Patience, providing, that our purses could
answere his expectation, as truly wee found the condigne
triall thereof afterward: making our Patience to startle,
our Faith to over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

slave to his greed; and wee left the last tributary spoyles
of two extortionable flatterers, <hi>Avarice,</hi> and <hi>Ignorance;</hi>
with the which our Reverend Guardian was fully inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monday</hi> early, wee Pilgrimes went forth to view the
Monuments within the City, being accompanied with
the <hi>Padre Viccario,</hi> and a <hi>French Predicatore:</hi> the places
of any note wee saw were these: first they shewed us the
place where Christ appeared to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> who said:
<hi>Touch mee not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father,
Iohn</hi> 20. 15. and this place by them is supposed to be the
Centre, or middle part of the World. Next, where Saint
<hi>Iames</hi> the first Bishop of the Primitive Church was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed:
then the House of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> but that is
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:9042:135"/>
doubtfull (say they) because it is not yet confirmed by the
Papall Authoritie: From thence they brought us to the
place where <hi>Annas</hi> one of the High Priests dwelt, and
also the Tree to the which our Saviour was bound, whiles
<hi>Annas</hi> was making himselfe ready to leade him to <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas;</hi>
but that I will not believe, for that Tree groweth
yet, being an Olive Tree. They shewed us also the house
where Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was imprisoned, when his fetters were
shaken off his legs, and the prison doores cast open,
and hee relieved: And where <hi>Zebedeus</hi> the Father of
<hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> dwelt, which are nothing but a lump of
Ruines.</p>
                  <p>Thence we came to the decayed Lodging of <hi>Caiphas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

without the City, upon the Mount <hi>Syon,</hi> whereupon
there is a Chappell builded, and at the entry of that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<hi>Domo,</hi> wee saw the stone, on which the Cock crew,
when <hi>Peter</hi> denied Christ. Within the same place is the
stone that was rolled to the Sepulcher doore of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
being now made an Altar to the <hi>Abasines.</hi> These <hi>Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines,</hi>

he was brought to the Judgement Hall. Upon the
same side of <hi>Syon,</hi> we saw the place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where Christ did
institute the Sacraments: and not far hence, a decayed
House where (say they) the Holy Ghost discended vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the Apostles, and also the Sepultures of <hi>David,</hi> and
his sonne <hi>Salomon:</hi> Over the which, their is a <hi>Moskie,</hi>
wherein no Christian may enter, to see these monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
For the <hi>Turkes</hi> doe great Reverence, to most of
all the ancient Prophets of the old Testament.</p>
                  <p>From thence wee returned and entred in <hi>via dolorosa,</hi>
the dolorous way, by which our Lord and Saviour passed
when hee went to be crucified, carrying the Crosse upon
his Back: And at the end of the same street (say they) the
Souldiers met <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> and compelled him to
helpe Christ,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pilats</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Hall.</note> to beare his Crosse when hee fainted. <hi>Pilats</hi>
Judgement Hall, is altogether ruinated, having but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
betweene the two sides of the Lane, an old Arch of
stone, under the which I passed, standing full in the high
Way: Here they shewed us the place, where Christ first
took up his Crosse, and on the top of that Arch, wee saw
that place called <hi>Gabbatha,</hi> where Jesus stood, when <hi>Pilat</hi>
said to the <hi>Iews, Ecce homo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A little below this, they brought us to the Church of
Saint <hi>Anna,</hi> where (say they) the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was born.
And going down another narrow Lane, they pointed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a House, and said, hee <hi>Dives</hi> the rich Glutton dwelt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who would not give to <hi>Lazarus</hi> the Crums of Bread that
fell from his Table: this I suspend, amongst many other
things, for all hold it to be a Parable, and not a History:
And although it were a History, who can demonstrate the
particular place, <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> having been so often transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by alterations.</p>

                  <p>From thence we came without the Eastern gate, (stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on a low Banke, called the daughter of <hi>Syon,</hi> that
over-toppeth the valley of <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi>) unto an immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
stone, upon the which they said St. <hi>Stephen</hi> was sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to death, the first Martyr of the Christian faith; and
the faithfull fore-runner of many noble followers. As we
returned to our own Convent, they brought us to Mount

                        <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith.</note> and shewed us the place where <hi>Abraham</hi> offered

but not answerable to the state and magnificence of
the former: For besides the poverty and smalnesse of it,
there wanted five things which were in the other: First, the
Ark of the <hi>Covenant:</hi> Secondly, the pot of <hi>Manna:</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the rod of <hi>Aaron:</hi> Fourthly, the two Tables of the <hi>Law,</hi>

Great, (that killed the young Infants for Christs sake,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:9042:137"/>
who suffered for him, before he suffered for them) built
another much inferiour to the first, and superiour to the
second. And although some Authors would have him but
to repaire the second Temple, yet it is most certaine, he
did even from the foundation raise its greatest beauty
and glory. For this <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Ascolinite,</hi> was an <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite</hi>
stranger, or <hi>Idumean,</hi> who having gotten the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

to be offended therewithall, to procure their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
did build to them a third Temple: This was it, in
which our Saviour, and his Apostles did daily Preach;
and was set on fire by <hi>Titus</hi> the tenth day of <hi>August;</hi>
on which day likewise the first Temple, was burnt by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar.</hi>
And lastly, there is another great Temple

reserved by <hi>Turkes,</hi>

                  <p>This present Temple hath two incircling Courts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed

whereof we cannot see, save on Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> which is

                  </p>
                  <p>These are all the monuments which in one day, I saw

souldiers, sixty Hors-men, and forty Foot-men, to
take with him the day following, for his conduction to

Christ fasted; which is his usuall custome once every yeare
between <hi>Palme Sunday</hi> and <hi>Easter,</hi> returning again before
<hi>Good-friday.</hi> These places cannot be viewed, save onely
at that time; neither may a Pilgrime goe along with the
Souldiers, unlesse hee give the value of seven Crownes or
Piasters (as a propine unto the Lievtenant, being forty
two shillings sterling: and if the Traveller will not goe to
that charge, hee may stay there till their return, which
I would not wish him to doe, if possibly hee may spare
the money, for the sight of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Iordans</hi> sake.

In all this deformed Countrey, wee saw neither

Before wee came neere to <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

of it, before wee could arrive at that place of <hi>Iordan</hi>

our Company through: Whereupon they all dismoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

were in great danger of perishing, although the robust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

which betwixt this Lake and the Red Sea, extend to 300
miles; there is no such matter, as Brooke, or strand, much
lesse a River, neyther hath it any intercourse with the

the earth under the Wildernesse, unto the Red Sea. And
that is doubtfull, although it may appeare probable, in

the ground in the exterior <hi>Aethiopia:</hi> and divers other
Rivers also after the same manner, obscuring themselues
under Rockes, Mountaines, and planures for many
miles: which particulars, by my owne experience, I could
denote.</p>
                  <p>But as for this River, the question may arise, whether
ran it during the time of these five Cities of the plaine

and doubtlesse yes, and the course of the River keeping
still its former condition: And for moderne examples,
how many Cities, Mansions, and Stations, have beene
sommerssed with water: nay innumerable, and so remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to this day, place, beauty, and being, all defaced:
As now in Scotland neere to <hi>Falkirk,</hi> rests the last and

                  <p>It breedeth nor reserveth no kinde of fishes; and if by

immediately dye. Although <hi>Iosephus</hi> witnesseth that in

his time, there was an Apple grew upon the banks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
like to the colour of gold, and within was rotten, and
would consume to powder; yet I affirme now the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
For there is not such a thing (whatsoever hath bin
in his days) as either Trees, or Bushes, grow neere to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
by three miles: such is the consummation of that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiferous
Gulf.</p>
                  <p>Divers Authors have reported, that nothing will sinke
into it, of any reasonable weight, as dead men, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kasses
of beasts: but by experience I approve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
For it beareth nothing at all;<note place="margin">Wrong infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations made.</note> yea, not the weight
of a Feather, nor the pile of withered Grasse, but it will
sinke therein, with the which my hands made sundry

the lying World, and all doting varieties of ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
                  <p>The water it selfe, is of a blackish colour, and at some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the yeere, there are terrible shapes, and shews of
terrour in it, as I was informed at <hi>Iericho</hi> by the <hi>Arabian</hi>
inhabitants there, which is the neerest Town that borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
thereupon.</p>
                  <p>This contagious and pestilentious Lake of <hi>Sodom,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth
much (as may be supposed) that infernall Gulfe
of Hell: but in my opinion, I hold it to be the purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Papists: for they say <hi>Limbus Patrum</hi> is neere, or in
the second roome to Hell, which I thinke must needs
be <hi>Sodome:</hi> for although it be not Hell it selfe, yet I am
perswaded, it is a second Hell, having (as some report) no
bottome. Wherefore I conclude thus, that since Papists
will have a purgatory, I absolutely affirme, it must be
such a purgatory, as the purging of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi>
which was with fire and brimstone, to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>

About the breake of day on Wensday morning, wee
past by the ruines of an old house; where (as they say) S.
<hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist remained, when he baptized those that
came from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and other Regions about; which is
but the flight of an arrow from <hi>Iordan.</hi>

safegards, stayed as Bulwarks for our protection, &amp; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivall
obligation for two repugnant defences: Time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
the awfull opportunity of both occasions. In this
place, as the <hi>Guardian</hi> said, was <hi>Christ</hi> baptized of Saint
<hi>Iohn,</hi> when the Holy Ghost came downe in a bodily
shape, like a <hi>Dove</hi> upon him, and their was a voyce from

well pleased.</hi> I saw also an apparant like testimony, of a
quadrangled stone, lying on the bank side; where upon are
ingraven letters of <hi>Hebrew, Greeke, Latine,</hi> testifying the
same thing: and may be also conjectured, in regard of the
auncient Habitacle, of that precursor, which is not far
from thence.</p>
                  <p>This river <hi>Iordan</hi> beginneth in Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> of two

different in quantity and colour; and not unlike other in
their courses: For <hi>Iordan</hi> falleth in the old <hi>Gomorah,</hi> and
<hi>Tibris</hi> runneth through the new <hi>Sodome.</hi> A history of
such evidence, as travell taught me by experience: For it

The Rivers themselves are both of a muddy colour, and
their quantity not far different from other, which <hi>Iordan</hi>
for greatnesse retaineth, and the length of their courses
are much semblable to other. The water of <hi>Iordan</hi> hath
beene transported to <hi>Venice</hi> in barrels, for that purity it
hath; which will reserve unspoiled, both moneths and

and to drink it, is an excellent remedy for the Fever <hi>quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>

                  <p>Considering the ancient reputation of this famous Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,

                     </note> which grew
within the limited flood, a little above where I left my

down a fair hunting Rod of the heavy and sad <hi>Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
Tree, being three yards long, wondrous straight, full
of small knots, and of a yellowish colour; which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,

present it (as the rarest Jem of a Pilgrimes treasure) to
his Majesty. But I remember in the choosing thereof an

broad obscuring leaves, the Friers and Souldiers remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
keeping their course towards <hi>Iericho:</hi> but within

but the feare of death for the present expel'd the griefe
of that unlooked for paine. Approaching on the safe
side of my company, one of our Souldiers broak forth
on horsebacke, being determined to kill mee for my
staying behind: Yea, and three times stroke at mee with
his halfe-pike; but his horse being at his speede, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
his cruelty, first by falling downe, next by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

and saw my naked body, hee presently pulled off his

secrets of nature: By which meanes (in the space of an

After Dinner wee arose, and went to the House of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus:</hi>
(this was hee who sate uppon a Tree to see our

many ruinous lumpes of the Wals, and demolishings of
the old Towne, which is a little from this distant, about
a short quarter of a mile. Here I saw two most dainty

                  <p>There is no way to ascend upon this Hill, save one,
which hath been hewen out of the Rock by the industry
of men, experimented in Masonry; (which was done at
the cost of Queene <hi>Helen</hi>) going up by the Degrees of
forty five turns. In all our Company there were onely one
<hi>Frier,</hi> foure <hi>Germans,</hi> and I, that durst attempt to climbe
the Mountain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thursday</hi> early at the breake of day, wee sixe made us
for the Mountaine, leaving our Souldies to guard the
passage below, lest some stragling <hi>Arabs</hi> should have
stolne after us for our Destruction. Where after divers
turnings, traversings, and narrow foot passages, having
come with great difficulty to the top, wee entred first into
a umbragious Cave, joyning to, and under the Chappell,
where the <hi>Frier</hi> told us, that in this place <hi>Christ</hi> did fast
forty dayes: and here it was, where hee rebuked Sathan.

carried on my back hither: From which place we saw the

At last in our Returne and fearfull descending, there
would none of us go down foremost: For although the
<hi>Frier</hi> led us freely upwards, yet first downward for his
life he durst not go: and that because at the narrow end of
every turning, there was aye betweene the upper and the
lower passage, about my height, and some were twice my
height, of the flat face of the Rocke, whereon there was
nothing but dimples and holes to receive our feet, which
in descending was perillous.<note place="margin">Dreadful dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantaram.</note> Now the greatest danger, at
every turn, was in the down going of the foremost, who
was to receive them all, one by one, and foot their
feet in the shallow dimples: of which if any of them had
missed, his sliding down had miscarried them both over
the Rock.</p>
                  <p>Now for the noble <hi>Germans</hi> sake, two of whom were
great Barons, <hi>Signior Strowse,</hi> and <hi>Signior Crushen,</hi> and
borne Vassalls to the Marquesse of <hi>Hanspauch,</hi> I resolved
to imbrace the danger: Where downe I went, receiving
every one of them, at every turne, first leading their
feet by my hands, and then by inveloping them with
mine arms: Well, having past halfe way downwards,
wee came to the most scurrile and timorous Discent of
the whole passage, where with much difficulty, I set safe
the foure <hi>Germans</hi> in our narrow Rode hewen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Whence he comming downe from above, with his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and face to the Rocke, holding his hands grumbling
above, the fellow fell on trembling; and as I was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
his feet in the holes, distempered feare brought
him downe upon mee with a rushling hurle: Whereupon
straight I mainly closed with my left arme his body fast
to the Rock, keeping strongly my right shoulder to the
same place: For I could not have saved my selfe, and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:9042:143"/>
letting him fall, but he would have caught me head-long
with him, over the Rock: And yet the <hi>Germans</hi> cried still
to me, <hi>Lascia ti quel furfanto cascar alla fondo conil Diavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,
esalva caro fratello la vita vostra,</hi> viz. <hi>Let that Villaine
fall to the ground with the Divell, and save, O deare brother,
your own life:</hi> But I neither would nor durst: at last his

him to slide s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the solid path: Where by and by, hee fell downe upon
his knees, and gave me a thousand blessings, vowing for
this, hee would do me a great good deed before I left <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At last towards the afternoon, wee safely arrived at the
foot of the Mountaine, and having saluted the <hi>Guardian,</hi>
and all the rest, who then were ready to take journey, the
<hi>Frier</hi> told his Reverence how I had saved his life: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the <hi>Guardian,</hi> and the other <hi>Friers,</hi> did imbrace

                  <p>And now the Souldiers and we being advanced in our

                        </hi> Abbey.</note> where (say they) Saint <hi>Ierome</hi>
dwelt, and was fed there by wilde Lions: Having tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
sore and hard that afternoone, wee arrived at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
an houre within night, for the Gate was kept o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
a purpose for us and our <hi>Guard:</hi> and entring our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery,
wee supped, and rested our selves till midnight;
having marched that halfe day, more then 34 miles. A
little before midnight, the <hi>Guardian</hi> and the <hi>Friers,</hi> were
making themselves ready to go with us to the Church
of the <hi>Holy Sepulchre,</hi> called <hi>Sancto Salvatore;</hi> where
we were to stay <hi>Good-friday</hi> and <hi>Saturday,</hi> and <hi>Easter-Sunday</hi>
till mid-night: They tooke their Cooke with
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:9042:144"/>
them also to dresse our Diet, carrying Wine, Bread,
Fishes, and Fruits hither in abundance. Mean while, a
<hi>Iew,</hi> the <hi>Trench-man</hi> of the <hi>Turkish Sanzacke,</hi> came to
the Monastery, and received from every one of us <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes,</hi>
first two Chickeens of Gold for our severall
heads, and entry at <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> and then nine Chickeens a
piece, for our in going to the <hi>Holy Grave;</hi> and a Chickeen
of gold a man, to himselfe the <hi>Iew,</hi> as being due to his
place.</p>
                  <p>Thus was there twelve Chickeens from each of us dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
for the <hi>Turke:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Our tributes for the Holy Grave.</note> And last one, and all of us, beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to give to the <hi>Guardian</hi> two Chickeens also for the
Waxe Candles and Fooleries he was to spend in their idle
and superstitious Ceremonies, these three aforesaid
nights: which amounted in all to every one of us, to
fourteen Chickeens of gold, six pounds six shillings ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
So that in the whole from the six <hi>Germans,</hi> foure
<hi>Frenchmen,</hi> and nine commercing <hi>Franks</hi> in <hi>Cyprus</hi> and

                  </p>
                  <p>This done, and at full mid-night wee came to the
Church, where wee found twelve Venerable like <hi>Turkes,</hi>
readie to receive us, sitting in the Porch without the
Doore; who forthwith opened at randon the two
great Brazen halfes of the Doore, and received us very
respectively: We being within, the doore made fast, and
the <hi>Turks</hi> returned to the Castle, the first place of any
note wee saw, was the place of Unction, which is a foure
squared stone; inclosed about with an iron Revele, on
which (say they) the dead body of our Saviour lay, and
was imbalmed; after hee was taken from the Crosse,
whiles <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> was preparing that new <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher</hi>
                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:9042:144"/>
for him wherein never man lay: from thence wee
came to the holy Grave. Leaving Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> on our
right hand toward the East end of the Church; for they
are both contained within this glorious edifice.</p>
                  <p>The Holy Grave is covered with a little Chappell,
standing within a round Quiere,<note place="margin">The Holy Grave.</note> in the west end of the
Church: It hath two low and narrow entries: as wee
entred the first doore, three after three, and our shooes
cast off, for these two roomes are wondrous little, the
<hi>Guardiano</hi> fell downe, <hi>ingenochiato,</hi> and kissed a stone,
whereupon (hee said) the Angell stood, when <hi>Mary
Magdalen</hi> came to the Sepulchre, to know if Christ was
risen, on the third day as he promised: And within the
entry of the second doore, wee saw the place where
Christ our Messias was buried, and prostrating our selves
in great humility, every man according to his Religion,
offered up his prayers to God.</p>
                  <p>The Sepulcher it selfe, is eight foote and a halfe in

utter sides of it, and the inward incirclings of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
Quiere, there are alwayes burning above fifty
Lampes of oyle, maintained by Christian Princes, who
stand most of them within incircling bands of pure
Gold, which is exceeding sumptuous; having the names
of those, who sent or gave them, ingraven upon the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
edges of the round circles: each of them having

with supporters of pure Gold, rich and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
The fairest whereof was sent thither by King

and Crowne curiously indented, I demanded the <hi>Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diano</hi>
if any part of the Tombe was here yet extant, who
replied, there was, but because (said he) Christians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorting

the place, carried away a good part thereof, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
S. <hi>Helen</hi> inclose it under this stone; whereby some
relicts of it should alwayes remaine. I make no doubt but
that same place is <hi>Golgotha,</hi> where the holy Grave was,

                  <p>In which second Gallery we strangers reposed all these
three nights we remayned there: whence wee had the full

To which wee ascended by 21 steps, 18 of them were of

I saw a most glorious and magnifick roome, whose covert
was supported all about with rich Columnes of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyre</hi>

                  <p>There are seven sorts of Nations, different in Religion,

                  <p>The number of those, who are tied to this austere life,
are about three hundred and fifty persons, being <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Greeks, Armenians, Aethiopians, Iacobins,</hi> a sort of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
<hi>Christians, Nestorians,</hi> and <hi>Chelfains</hi> of <hi>Mesopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The day before the Resurrection, about the houre of
mid-night, the whole Sects and sorts of Christians O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rientall
(that were come thither in Pilgrimage, and dwelt
at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) convened together, which were about
the number of sixe thousand men, women, and children:
for being separated by the Patriarchs in two companies,
they compassed the Chappell of the Holy Grave nine
times; holding in their hands burning Candles, making
the beginning pittifull, and lamentable regreetings, but
in the ending, there were beating of Kettle-drums, soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Horn-trumpets, and other instruments, dancing,
leaping, and running about the Sepulchre, with an intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
tumult, as if they had been all mad, or distracted
of their wits.</p>
                  <p>Thus is the prograce of their procession performed in
meere simplicitie, wanting civilitie, and government.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:9042:147"/>
But the <hi>Turkes</hi> have a care of that, for in the midst of all
this hurley burley, they runne amongst them with long
Rods, correcting their misbehaviour with cruell stroaks:
and so these slavish people, even at the height of their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious
devotion are strangely abused.</p>
                  <p>But our Procession begun before theirs, and with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
regard, because of our Tributes: The <hi>Turkes</hi> meane
while guarding us, not suffering the other Christians to
be participant in the singular dotage of the <hi>Romish</hi> folly,
being after this manner: First, the <hi>Guardian,</hi> and his <hi>Friers</hi>
brought forth of a <hi>Sacrastia,</hi> allotted for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
the wooden portracture of a dead Corps, represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our <hi>Saviour,</hi> having the resemblance of five bloody
Wounds,<note place="margin">An abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Idolatry.</note> the whole body of which Image, was covered
with a Cambrick Vaile: Where having therewith thrice
compassed the Chappell of the <hi>Holy Grave,</hi> it was carried
to Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> and there they imbalmed the five
Timber holes; with Salt, Oile, Balme, and odoriferous
perfumes.</p>
                  <p>Then the <hi>Guardian,</hi> and the other twelve <hi>Friers</hi> knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
downe, and kissed each one of the five Suppositive
Wounds: the <hi>Turkes</hi> meane while laughing them to
scorne in their faces, with miserable derision. Thence
they returned, and laid the senslesse blocke upon the <hi>Holy
Grave,</hi> whence being dismissed the Papall Ceremony
ended.</p>
                  <p>Truly hereupon, may I say, if the <hi>Roman</hi> Jesuites,
<hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Franciscans,</hi> there Resident in certain
speciall parts of the <hi>Turkes</hi> Dominions, had onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
themselves as their politick charge required, and
dismissed from the Paganisme eyes, onely their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Images, veneration of Pictures, Crosses, and the
like externall superstitious Rites. These Infidels I say, had
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:9042:147"/>
long ago (without any insight of Religion) beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to the Christian Faith. For besides all this blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
what infinite abominable Idolatries commit they
in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spaine;</hi> in clothing the Pictures of dead Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots,
Monks, Priors, Guardians, and the better kinde of
Officiall Friers and Priests, with Robes of Sattin, Velvet,
Damask, Taffaty, long gowns and coules of cloth,<note place="margin">Damnable &amp; intolerable superstition.</note> shirts,

in silver, gold, gilded brasse, iron, stone, tinne, lead, cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
clay, and timber shapes, adorned with double and

rich bracelets, silk grograims, and Cambrick Vails,
chains, smocks, ruffs, cuffs, gloves, collers, stockings, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
pumps, nose-gayes, beads, and costly head-geire,
setting them on their Altars, O spectaculous Images!
adoring them for gods, in kneeling, praying, and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Masses before them: Yet they are none of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed,

they be bastards and wooden blocks, yet are they
better clad, then their lupish legitimate ones, no, I may
say, as the best Kings Daughter alive. Which is a sinfull,
odious, and damnable idolatry; and I freely confesse at
some times, and in some parts I have torne a pieces those
rich garments from their senslesse Images &amp; Blocks, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                  <p>Here the <hi>Guardiano</hi> offered for ten pieces of gold (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

Knight of the holy Grave, or of the order of <hi>Ierusalem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <pb n="272" facs="tcp:9042:148"/>
which I refused, knowing the condition of that dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
Oath I behoved to have sworne; but I saw two of
these other Pilgrimes receive that Order of Knight
hood.</p>
                  <p>The manner whereof is thus: First, they binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with a solemne vow, to pray (during life) for the
Pope,<note place="margin">The Knights of the Holy Grave.</note> King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> from
whom the Friers receive their maintenance; and also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciall,
for the <hi>French</hi> King, by whose meanes they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
their liberty of the Great <hi>Turke,</hi> to frequent these
monumentall places. Secondly, they are sworne enemies
to Protestants, and others, who will not acknowledge
the superiority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Thirdly, they
must pay yearly some stipend unto the Order of the
<hi>Franciscans.</hi> These attestations ended, the Frier putteth
a gilded Spurre on his right heel, causing the yong made
Knight stoop down on his knees, and lay his hands on the
holy Grave: after this hee taketh a broad sword from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his gray gown (being privately carried for feare of the
<hi>Turks</hi>) which is (as hee said) the Sword, wherewith
victorious <hi>Godfrey</hi> conquered <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and giveth this
new up-start <hi>Cavaliero,</hi> nine blows upon the right shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Lo here the fashion of this Papisticall Knighthood,
which I forsook.</p>
                  <p>Indeed upon the Knighthood they have certain privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
among the Papists, of which these are two: If a
Malefactour being condemned and brought to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
any of these Knights may straight cut the rope and
relieve him: The other is, they may carry and buy silks
through all <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> or else-where, and pay
no Custome, neither in comming nor going, nor for any
silke ware, where the <hi>Romish</hi> Church hath any comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</p>

                  <p>In that spacious place we saw twenty foure Chambers
hewen out of a Marble Rocke. Each roome hath a

done by the skilfull Art of Masons, that the rarest spirit
of ten thousand cannot know how these doores have
beene made, so to moove as they do, being a firme Rocke
both below and above; and the doores have neither iron
nor timber-worke about them: but by cunning are made
so to turne, and in that same place where they grew they
are squared; yea and so exquisitely done that the most

the same <hi>Fransciscans</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> being onely sixe <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:</hi>
After Supper we went all of us (having Candles) to
the place, where our Saviour was borne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> over the which,
there is a magnificent Church builded: yea, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Asia,</hi> or <hi>Affrick,</hi> being decored with an hundred and fifty
Pillars. But before wee came where the Crib had beene,
wee passed certain difficile wayes; where, being arrived,
wee entred in a gorgeous roome, adorned with <hi>Marble,
Saphyre,</hi> and <hi>Alabaster</hi> stones; and there they shewed
us both the place and the resemblance of the Crib:<note place="margin">Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </note> ouer
which were hanging lampes of pure Gold, and within
their circles oile continually burning. Not farre from
that place, and within the body of the admirable
Church, they shewed us the part, over the which, the
Starre stayed, that conducted the three Wise-men from
the East, who came out of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> to worship Christ,
and presented gifts unto him. From thence they brought
us to a Caue without the Townh, wherein (say they)
the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was hid, when <hi>Herod</hi> persecuted the
Babes life, (from which also being warned by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell)
Shee and <hi>Ioseph</hi> fled downe into <hi>Aegypt</hi> with the
Child.</p>
                  <p>In this time of her feare, say they, the milke left her
blessed breasts, so that the Babe was almost starved, but
Shee praying to the Almighty, there came forthwith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance,

come from farre Countries, to fetch of this Earth. I
have seene the nature of this dust practised, wherefore
I may boldly affirme it, to have the force of a strange
vertue. Of the which Earth I brought with me a pound
weight, and presented the halfe of it to our sometimes
Gracious Queene <hi>Anne</hi> of blessed Memory, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other rare Relicts also, as a Girdle, and a paire of

                     <hi>Wednesday</hi> following, wee hired foure and twentie

the Angels brought the glad tidings of salvation unto the

It produceth commodiously, an infinite number of

there; also in, and about <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> In our way, as we
came backe to the City, the next day following the <hi>Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cario</hi>
shewed us a little <hi>Moskee,</hi> kept by <hi>Turkes,</hi> in which
(said he) was the Tombe of <hi>Rachell, Iacobus</hi> wife, who
died in that place; as shee was travelling from <hi>Padan-Aram,</hi>

                  <p>The ruines also of a house, where <hi>Habacuk</hi> the Prophet
dwelt; a <hi>Turpentine</hi> tree growing yet by the way side,
under the which (say they) th Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was wont
to repose her selfe in traveling. Wee saw also a naturall

as though the tender flesh of man could leave the

from this, hee shewed us the place, where the Starre ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to the wise men, after they had left <hi>Herod</hi> to seeke
for the Saviour of mankind.</p>
                  <p>Approaching Mount <hi>Syon,</hi> we saw a quadrangled, dry

was Washing, when <hi>David</hi> looked forth from the toppe

wee saw the ruines of a Palace wherein <hi>David</hi> dwelt,
which had beene one of the Angles of the ancient Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and standeth at the division of the valley <hi>Ennon,</hi>
which compassed (as a Ditch) the North part of Mount

the narrow Valley of <hi>Iehosophat,</hi> which invironeth the

City, wee came to a place, on the skirt of <hi>Syon,</hi> where (say
they) <hi>Peter</hi> after his deniall of Christ his Master wept
bitterly.</p>
                  <p>Descending by the side of that same Hill, we crossed

the Valley <hi>Gehinnon,</hi> and came to <hi>Acaldema</hi>

Roome, oppositive to the devaling side of the South-falling
<hi>Syon:</hi> three parts whereof are invironed with a
naturall Rocke, and the fourth square bordering with
the Valley, is made up of stone worke: The top is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and hath three holes, where through they let
the dead Christians fall downe, for it is a buriall place of
Pilgrimes to this day. As I looked downe, I beheld a
great number of dead corpes; some whereof had white
winding sheets, and newly dead, lying one aboue an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a lumpe; yeelding a pestilent smell, by reason
they were not covered with earth, saue onely the art<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chitecture
of a high vault, which maketh that in a long
time the corpes cannot putrifie and rot.</p>
                  <p>Neare unto this <hi>Campo,</hi> we entred into a dark Cave,
where (say they) the Apostles hid themselues, when
<hi>Christ</hi> was taken. At the foote of the same valley, wee

them in the hollownesse thereof; and so slue them:
and lest their crying should have moved any compassion
towards them, they made a thundring noise with Drums,
and other Instruments, whereupon the place was called
<hi>Tophet,</hi> mentioned in <hi>Ier.</hi> 7. 31. Hence wee came to the
<hi>Poole</hi> of <hi>Siloam,</hi> in which wee washed our selves, the
water whereof falleth down through a Rock, from
the City above, running straight to the Valley of <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophat;</hi>
                     <pb n="282" facs="tcp:9042:153"/>
and there we saw also the remnant of that sacked
Towre of <hi>Siloam.</hi> Neare to this wee saw a Fountaine,
where (say they) the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> used oft to wash the
Babes cloaths and linnen clouts. From thence wee cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Brooke <hi>Cedron</hi>

                     </note> (which guttereth through the
Valley of <hi>Iehosophat:</hi> and is always dry, unlesse it be in

moneth together, which is all the Winter they have in
these parts: during which time none may labour, nor tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,
but forced to keepe themselves within Houses:
Having past, I say, this Brook we came to the Tombes of
<hi>Absolom</hi> and <hi>Zacharias,</hi> and the Cave wherein Saint
<hi>Iames</hi> was wont to hide himselfe from the persecuting
<hi>Iews.</hi> Ascending more upward on the Hill, in the way
of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> wee saw these places, where <hi>Iudas</hi> hanged
himselfe, over which there is a Vault erected, like a
halfe Moone, in memory of his selfe murther: and hard
by they shewed us where the withered Fig-tree grew, the
place being inclosed within a high stone Dike; and halfe
a mile thence wee came to the ruined house of <hi>Simon</hi> the
Leper.</p>
                  <p>Arriving at <hi>Bythania,</hi>

                     </note> we saw the Castle and Tombe of
<hi>Lazarus,</hi> on whom Christ shewed a Miracle, in raising
him from the Grave, after hee had been foure dayes dead.
It is a singular and rare Alablaster Tombe, and so exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely

being inclosed within a delicate Chappell under the

the decayed House where <hi>Martha,</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>
inhabited, and the stone whereon Christ sate (say they)
when hee said to <hi>Martha,</hi> Mary <hi>hath chosen the best

Leaving this moorish <hi>Bythania,</hi> being now a Village
of no qualitie, wee returned by beggerly <hi>Bethphage,</hi> and
finding it farre worser, about mid-day wee arrived on
the top of Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> where wee dined on our owne
provision carried with us, and then proceeded in our
sights.</p>
                  <p>From this place we had the full prospect of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi>

                        </hi> and the places of note there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note>
For the City standing upon the edge of a Hill, cannot be
seen all at one sight; save on this Mountain, which is two
times higher then Mount <hi>Syon.</hi> These are the Monuments
shewn us upon the Mount of <hi>Olives:</hi> First, the print of
the left foot of our Saviour, in an immoveable stone,
which he made when hee ascended to Heaven; the <hi>Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diano</hi>
told us further, that the right foots print was taken
away by the <hi>Turks;</hi> and detained by them in the Temple
of <hi>Salomon:</hi> But who can think our Saviour trod so hard
at his Ascension, as to have left the impression of his feet
behind him.</p>
                  <p>Next the place where hee foretold the judgement to
come, and the signes, and the wonders, that should be
seene in the Heavens before that dreadfull day. Thirdly,
the place where the <hi>Symbolum Apostolorum</hi> was made,
which is a fine Chamber under ground, like a Church,
having twelve pillars to support it. Fourthly, where
Christ taught his Disciples the <hi>Pater noster,</hi> and where
hee fell in an Agony, when hee sweat blood and water.
Fifthly, where <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> slept, whiles our
Saviour prayed, and returned so oft to awake them; and
also below that, where the other Disciples were left. Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Garden of <hi>Gethsemaine,</hi> where Christ used com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
to pray; in the which place he was apprehended
by the Officers of the high Priests, and it was also where
<hi>Iudas</hi> kissed him, and the Serjants fell backward on the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:9042:154"/>
ground. Seventhly, they shewed us a stone marked with
the Head, Feet, and Elbows of <hi>Iesus,</hi> in their throwing of
him down, when as they bound him, after he was taken,
and ever since (say they) have these prints remayned
there.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, at the foot of Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> in the Valley
of <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> we descended by a paire of staires of forty
three steps, and six paces large, in a faire Church builded
under the ground: Where (say they) the Monument of
the Assumption of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is, and did shew
it unto us, whom (they think was born in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> dwelt
at <hi>Bethleem,</hi> and <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and died upon Mount <hi>Syon.</hi> I
saw also there, the Sepulchres of <hi>Ioseph</hi> her Husband,
<hi>Ioachim</hi> her Father, and of <hi>Anna</hi> her Mother. And for
which sights paying sixteene <hi>Madins</hi> a man,<note place="margin">Sacred and singular Tombes.</note> to certaine
<hi>Moores:</hi> we returned to our Monastery again night to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
us, having seen all the Antiquities and places of note,
were to be seen, in, and about all <hi>Iudea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lo, I have plainly described all these Monuments, by
the order of these twelve severall days: The like hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
was never by any Travailer so punctually, and so tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and so curiously set down, and made manifest to the
intellective Reader. But as I said in the beginning of my
Description, so say I now at the conclusion, some of these
things are ridiculous, some of manifest untruths, some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
doubtfull, and others, somewhat more credible, and of
apparant truth. The recapitulation whereof, is only by
me used, as I was informed, by <hi>Gaudentius Saybantus</hi> the
father <hi>Guardian, Laurenzo Antonio il Viccario,</hi> and the
Trenchman <hi>Iohn Baptista.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> we the eleven <hi>Franks</hi> stayed three
dayes longer, preparing our selves for a new Voyage to
go down to <hi>Aegypt</hi> with a Caravan of <hi>Grand Cayro:</hi> In
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:9042:154"/>
which time the aforesaid <hi>Frier Laurenzo,</hi> whose life I had
saved on the <hi>Quarantanam,</hi> propined mee privatly with
twelve Crosses made of the Olive Wood of Mount <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet:</hi>
Each Crosse having 24 Relicks indented in them,
with forty pair of Chaplets made of that same Wood, two
<hi>Turkish</hi> Handkerchiefs, and three paire of Garters and
Girdles of the <hi>Holy Grave:</hi> All wrought in silke and
Gold, with divers other things, &amp;c. Which were not

Here our Guard kept a strict Watch about us all night;

greater drouth, wee approached to the first Castle, where
the Captaine thereof received us kindly, causing our

cease, for feare of overflowing all the lower land, the red

                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:9042:161"/>
At <hi>Saleack</hi> we overtook a great Caravan of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
people, &amp; twelve hundred Camels and Dromidores,
which were loaden with the ware of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and came
from <hi>Damascus,</hi> intending their Voyage for <hi>Cayro,</hi> whose
company we subtilly left, and marched before them, for
receiving of water by the way for our selves and beasts out
of Cisterns, which we left dry behind us.</p>
                  <p>A Dromidore and Camell differ much in quality, but
not in quantity,<note place="margin">The nature of Camels &amp; Dromidores.</note> being of one height, bredth, and length;
save only their heads and feet, which are proportionated
alike; and the difference is such that the Dromidory hath
a quick and hard-reaching trot, and will ride above 80
miles in the day, if that his Rider can indure the pain. But
the Camell is of a contrary disposition: For hee hath a
most slow and lazie pace, removing the one foot from
the other, as though hee were weighing his feet in a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance;
neither can he goe faster although hee would: But
hee is a great deale more tractable then the other: For
when his Master loadeth him, hee falleth downe on his
knees to the ground, and then riseth againe with his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
which will be marvellous great, sometimes 600 or
800 weight.</p>
                  <p>The Red Sea, which we left to the Westward of us, and
our left hand, is not red as many suppose, but is the very
colour of other Seas: The reason for which it hath beene
called <hi>Mare rubrum,</hi> is only because of the banks, rushes,
sands and reeds that grow by the shore side, which are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
red. Some others have called it so, in respect of the
Brooks which <hi>Moses</hi> turned to red blood, who miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struing
the true sense, took Seas for Rivers.</p>
                  <p>It is vulgarly termed <hi>Sinus Arabicus,</hi> whose length is
1600 miles. This Sea is famous for the miraculous pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of the <hi>Israelites</hi> through it, and the drowning of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:9042:161"/>
                     <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his people: and because of Spices that were
brought from <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Arabia</hi> to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> from
whence the <hi>Venetians</hi> dispersed the same through all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
and the <hi>Mediterran</hi> Coasts of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Affricke:</hi>
But this Navigation is now discontinued by the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals,
English</hi> and <hi>Dutch;</hi> which bring such Wares to
their severall homes by the back side of <hi>Affricke:</hi> So that
the Trafficke of <hi>Alexandria</hi> is almost decayed,<note place="margin">

contracted, with the long and tedious carriage
thereof.</p>
                  <p>This aforesaid <hi>Saleack,</hi> is thought to be seated on the

meddle with all they left behind them, under this excuse,
that he would be answerable to their friends for it, at his
returne to <hi>Venice:</hi> Well, I am left to bury them, and
with great difficulty bought one grave for them all three

that God so much the more, might show his incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible

sixe foote. The Basis, or bottome whereof, being twelve
hundred paces in Circuite, allowing every square of the
foure faces three hundred paces, and every pace two
foote and a halfe. Every Pyramide having outwardly
to ascend upon (though now for the most part demolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
three hundred fourescore and nine steps or degrees;
each degree being three foot high, and two foote and a
halfe broad. By which computation, they amount in
heigh, to the afore-said Relation, allowing to every
foote, twelve inches. At last having ascended upon
the South side of this greatest Pyramide to the top, and
that with great difficulty, because of the broken degrees
here and there; I was much ravished, to see such a large
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:9042:168"/>
foure squared plat-forme, all of one intire stone, which
covered the head; each square extending to seventeene
foot of my measure.</p>
                  <p>It is yet a great marvaile to mee, by what Engine, they
could bring it up so safe to such a height: But as I conceive
it, they behoved certainely still to rayse it, and take it
with them, as they advance the Worke, otherwise the wit
nor power of man, could never have done it. Truely the
more I beheld this strange Worke, the more I was strick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
in admiration: For before we ascended, or came neare
to this Pyramide, the top of it seemed as sharpe as a
poynted Dyamond; but when we were mounted thereon,
we found it so large, that in my opinion, it would have
contained a hundred men.</p>
                  <p>In the bottome whereof wee found a great Cell,<note place="margin">The greatest Pyramide of the three.</note> and
within that through a straight and narrow passage, a
foure angled Roome, wherein there was standing the
Relicks of a huge and ancient Tombe, where belike
hee that was the first founder of this Pyramide was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed.
From the top of this Pyramide, our <hi>Ianizary</hi>
did shoote an Arrow in the ayre with all his force, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby it should have falne to the ground; but as
wee discended downe-wards, we found the Arrow lying
upon the steps, scarce halfe way to the ground: From
this, wee came to the middle Pyramide which a far off
looked some-what higher then the other two, but when
we came to the roote thereof, we found it not so, for the
stone-work is a great deale lower, but the advancement
of the height, is onely because of a high ground whereon
it standeth.</p>
                  <p>It is of the same fashion of the first, but hath no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
to ascend upon, neither hath the third Pyramide
any at all; being by antiquity of time, all worn and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:9042:168"/>
demolished, yet an admirable worke to behold such
Masse, and (as it werre) erected Mountaines all of fine
Marble. The reason why they were first founded is by
many ancient Authors so diversly coniectured, that I will
not meddle therewith. They were first called <hi>Pharaones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet the first and greatest is said to have beene builded
by <hi>Cheops,</hi> who in this worke imploied 100000 men
the space of twenty yeares: In which time, the charges
of Garlicke,<note place="margin">The charges of the greatest Pyramide.</note> rootes, and Onions onely came to 1600
talents of silver; the Basis whereof in circuit, was sixty
Acres of ground. It is recorded by <hi>Iosephus,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured
by many good witnesses, that the Brickes which
the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were inforced to make, where part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imployed about the insides of these Pyramides, whose
outsides were adorned with Marble; neither can I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the drift of that effeminate <hi>Cheops,</hi> who in end wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
money did prostitute his daughter to all commers,
by which detestable meanes he finished his building, and
shee besides the money due unto her unnaturall Father,
desired for her selfe of every man that had the use of her
body one stone, of whom shee got so many, that with
them shee builded the second Pyramide, almost equall to
the first. Besides these three huge ones, there are a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of smaller, whereof some were transported to <hi>Rome</hi>
in the time of her supreame domination.</p>
                  <p>Betwene the biggest Pyramide, and <hi>Nylus,</hi> I saw a
<hi>Colosse,</hi> or head of an Idoll, of a wonderfull greatnesse;
being all of one Marble stone, erected on a round Rock:
it is of height (not reckoning the Columne) about 815
foote, and of circuite, 68. <hi>Plini</hi> gave it the name <hi>Sphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi>
and reported much more of the bignesse, large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and length of it: but howsoever he erred in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
yet I resolve my selfe, it is of so great a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:9042:169"/>
that the like thereof (being one intire piece) the world
affordeth not, and may be reckoned amongst the rarest
Wonders: Some say, that anciently it was an Oracle, the
which so soone as the Sunne set, would give an
answere to the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> of any thing by them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
                  <p>In our way as we returned, our <hi>Dragoman</hi> shewed us
(on the bank of <hi>Nylus</hi>) where a Crocodile was killed the
yeare before, by the ingenious policie of a <hi>Venetian</hi>
Merchant, being licentiated by the <hi>Bassaw.</hi> The match
whereof for bignesse and length, was never seene in that
River, whose body was twenty two foot long, and in
compasse of the shoulders eight foot, who thus was
slaine: This beast for foure yeares together kept alwayes
about one place of the River, being seven miles above
<hi>Cayre;</hi> where for a mile of ground, there was no tillage
nor pastorage, being for feare of him laid waste: and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse
he had devoured above forty sixe persons: his
custome was to come forth of the River every morning,
about our eight houres; where here and there hee would
lurke waiting for his prey till ten, for longer from water
he could not stay.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Venetian</hi> leaving his ship at <hi>Alexandrea,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A resolute <hi>Venetian</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant.</note> and
comming to <hi>Cayre,</hi> was informed by the <hi>Consull</hi> my
adversary of the great spoil done by this beast: and
herewith generously hee undertooke to kill it, the <hi>Vice gerent</hi>
licentiating him: Whereupon going to his ship,
fetched thence his Gunner and a peece of Ordonance to
<hi>Cayre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next day in the afternoone, hee being well hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and accompanied with twenty <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> the peece
is carried to the <hi>Crocodiles</hi> accustomary place of forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming:
where straite there was an Asse slaine, and
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:9042:169"/>
hung upon two standing and a thwarting tree, with his
open belly to the flood, and same twelve score paces
therefro: Behinde this carkasse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> about other twelve

being charged with cut iron; and a traine of powder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the touch-hole, and above it a night house to keepe
the traine dry from the nights serene; having a cock fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thereto, and in it a burning match, to which a string
was tyed: Then forty paces behinde the piece, was there
a pit digged to hide the Gunner; wherein he was put,
holding the strings end in his hand, and his head vayled
with a wooden cover.</p>
                  <p>After this, and about midnight, the Horse-men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
themselves two miles off: The morning come, and
the convenient time: the <hi>Crocodile</hi> courts the land: where
when he saw the carkasse, came grumbling to it, and
setting his two formost feet on the Carrions middle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to make good cheare of the intrales: whereat the
squink-eyed Gunner perceiving his time, drew the string,
and giving fire, off went the peece, and shot the <hi>Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile</hi>
in three parts: well, his deadly wounded, and
making a horrible noise, the Gunner lay denned, and
durst not stirre; meanwhile the beast striving to recover
the water, tyred and lying close on his belly there hee
died.</p>
                  <p>After the shot, the horse-men drew neare, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the beast slain, relieved the Gunner, and brought with
them this monstrous creature to <hi>Cayre;</hi> where now
his skinne hangeth in the <hi>Consuls</hi> Hall, which I saw du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
my stay in his house. For this piece of service, the
Merchant was greatly applauded, &amp; scorned to take from
the City 500 Sultans of Gold as a reward for his paines,
which they freely offered him, and hee as freely refused.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="316" facs="tcp:9042:170"/>
Now to discourse of <hi>Nylus,</hi> this flood irriguateth all
the low plaines of the Land, once in the yeare, which
inundation, beginneth usually in the latter end of <hi>Iuly;</hi>
and continueth to the end of <hi>August:</hi> Which furnisheth
with Water all the Inhabitants; being the onely drinke
of the vulgar <hi>Aegyptians;</hi> and of such vertue, that when
<hi>Pescennius Niger</hi> saw his Souldiers grumble for Wine:
<hi>What</hi> (saith he) <hi>doe you grumble for Wine, having the
Water of</hi> Nylus <hi>to drinke?</hi> And now because many
schollers,<note place="margin">The true knowledge of the flowing <hi>Nylus.</hi>
                     </note> and learned men, are meerely mistaken about
the flowing of <hi>Nylus,</hi> I will both show the manner and
quality or course of its inundation, and thus. There is a
dry pond called <hi>Machash</hi> digged neare unto the brinke
of the river, in midst whereof standeth a pillar of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
Cubites height, being equall with the profundity
of the ditch, whereby they know his increasing: and
in the yeare following if they shall have plenty or scarcity
of things.</p>
                  <p>Now betwene the river and this pond, there are
sixe passages or spouts digged through the Banke; where
when the River beginneth to swell, it immediately fals
downe through the lowest passage into the Pond, and
being discovered there comes forth of <hi>Cayre</hi> certaine of
the Priests called <hi>Darvishes,</hi> accompanied with a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>Ianizaries,</hi> and pitch their Tents round about this
Quadrangled pit. In all which time of the Inundation,
they make great Feasting, rare Solemnities, with Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
Singing, toucking of Kettle drumms, sounding of
Trumpets, and other ostentations of joy.</p>
                  <p>Now as the Water groweth in the River, and so from
it debording, so it groweth also upon the Pillar stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this pond, which pillar is marked from the roote
to the top, with Brasses, handfuls, a foote, a span, and
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:9042:170"/>
an inch: And so if it shall happen that the water rise but
to ten Brasses, it presageth the yeare following, there shall
be great Death, Pestilence, and Famine. And if it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth
to twelue Cubits, then the sequell yeare shall be
indifferent. And if it swell to fifteene Brasses, then the
next year shall be copious and abundant in all things: And
if it shall happen to flow to the top eighteen Brasses, then
all the Country of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> is in danger to be drowned and
destroyed.</p>
                  <p>Now from the body of <hi>Nylus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Many Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers mistaken about <hi>Nylus.</hi>
                     </note> there are about three
thousand Channels drawne through the plain, on which
passing Ditches, are all the Boroughs and Towns builded;
and through which Channels the river spreads it selfe
through all the Kingdome: Which when scoured of filth
and Wormes, and the water become cleare, then every
house openeth their Cisterne window and receiveth as
much water, as is able to suffice them till the next Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation:
Neyther doth ever the River flow any where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the bankes, for if it should, it would overwhelme
the whole Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>All which Channels here, or there do make intercourse
for their streames again, to the body and branches of
<hi>Nylus.</hi> Now Stoicall fools hold the opinion, that it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floweth
the whole face of the Land, then I pray you,
what would become of their Houses, their Bestiall, their
Cornes and Fruites: for the nature of violent streames do
ever deface, transplant, and distroy all that they debord
upon, leaving slime, mud and sand behind their brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and therefore such inunding cannot be called che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishings.</p>
                  <p>There are infinite venemous Creatures bred in this
river, as Crocadiles, Scorpions, Water-Snakes, grievous
mis-shapen Wormes, and other monstrous things, which
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:9042:171"/>
oft annoy the Inhabitants, and these who Trafficke on
the Water. This famous flood is in length almost three
thousand miles, and hath his beginning under the <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall</hi>

not being intangled to wife and children, they might bee

in a moment, them of the Villages came downe on horse

of the truth, I brought them with all possible celerity to
the very place: where forthwith the Horse-men broke
upon them, wounding divers, before they were all taken,
for some fled to the Rocks, and some were in the coverd
fields hunting their prey: At last they were all seazed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

thanked God for mine escape, and me for discovering

                  <p>After I had sup'd and going to bed, in came these afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said

me with stroaks, and consulted my Death. Then I
cryed to my Host for helpe, but hee stood dumbe, for hee
was their Companion, and to second their intention his
wife made fast the lower door. Whereat being moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with deadly feare, I pulled my Turkish gowne from
my backe, and opening my Sacket; said; Now Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Gentlemen, I know you are distressed, and so am
I, come search my cloathes and Budget, and if you find
what you looke for, let me dye: Alas, I am a poore stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
newly come from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the sepulcher of

nought, wherefore you should, were a lamentable

                  <p>This spoken, and much more, they never seatched me,
nor touched my Wallet, but went to Counsell, where
they concluded vpon my forwardnesse in opening my
body and other things to them, that I had no money,
and therefore confirme my life, which for the former
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:9042:180"/>
respect, and the <hi>Holy Graves</hi> sake was granted. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
packing up my Relicks againe; they called for
Wine, and drunke divers times to mee, and after a long

me for my bed: Whither, when led by my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stesse,
I privily made the doore fast suspecting still a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine

for their owne ends.</p>
                  <p>All which time I stood Centinell, and the morning
come, my Host confessed, that onely hee had saved my
life; for swearing himselfe of their former sight; but said
he, certainely they are Murderers. Leaving him with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
thankes, I arrived at <hi>Furges:</hi> where I learned

was arraigned, hanged, and quartered, the house razed,
and his wife put to death; and ever since the French King,
kepeth a guard of Horse-men there to keepe that filthy
and dangerous Wood free from Murderers. For now
may I say, like to a ship that after a long Voyage, is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in greatest danger, or else cast away entring the

cast in the most eminent perill, that I had in all my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes,

above all, and principally by Travellers, and Voyagers in

confirmeth the true Science thereof; and can best

other respects, it holdeth true that the heart of man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable

                  <p>Here in the <hi>Canton</hi> of <hi>Bierne</hi> neere to <hi>Vrbs,</hi> wee went

truely qualified by her Parents, friends, Physitians,

their legges, &amp; opening their wretched Wombs. Lo there
is the chastity of the Romish Priests, who forsooth may
not marry, and yet may miscarry themselves in all abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

                     </note> whose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
sprung first from the House of <hi>Saxon:</hi> For <hi>Berold</hi>
or <hi>Berauld,</hi> being a neer Cousin to the Emperour <hi>Otton</hi>
the Third, and brother to the <hi>Saxon</hi> Duke; the Emperour
gratified him with these Lands of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and parts of

him to this present Duke now living, named <hi>Charles E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi>
there have been only eight Dukes, and some of
them of short lives. And yet of all the Christian Dukes,
the most Princely Court is kept here, for Gallants, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and Knights.</p>
                  <p>At the same time, of my being there, this present Duke
had wars with his own brother in Law <hi>Philp</hi> the Third,
about the Marquesade of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and Dutchy of

was I discovered to the Governour of <hi>Pistoia,</hi> a noble

him with the undeserved cruelty of the <hi>Badgello:</hi> not
that I never wore a Stilletto, but under pretext of that, had
robbed mee of three-score and twelve pieces of Gold:
Whereupon the Governour perceiving the knavery of
the Villaine, and that he had not acquainted him with my
apprehending, to whose place it belonged, he grew discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
and forthwith sent post to his Highnesse, shewing
him the trueth of the businesse: Whereupon the <hi>Badgello</hi>

his roguery, could not deny it: well, my gold and my

territory of <hi>Pistoia</hi> for ever, with his Wife and Children:
and I received in compensation of my abuses, from his
Highnesse Chamber or Treasury there, fifty <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
Crownes of gold, being modified by the Duke him

wracke in seeking my overthrow and brought me such a

                  <p>Thanking God for this ioyfull crosse, and approaching
<hi>Florence,</hi> I found one <hi>Iohn Browne</hi> there, whose compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

                  <p>The Towne is of no quantity nor quality, in regard of
the obscurenesse and solitarinesse of the Countrey, the
better sort of their Gentry living at <hi>Naples:</hi> having left
the lower, and entred the higher <hi>Calabria,</hi> wee arrived at
the Bourge of <hi>Allauria;</hi> and the next morrow traversing
close and couert mountaines twelve miles along, in the
midst of our passage wee were beset with foure Bandits
and foure Guns: To whom holding up my hand, and
imploring for our lives, shewing them mine adventures
and former travells, they unbend their fire-locks, and
reading my parent of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> uncouered their heads,
and did me homage, notwithstanding they were absolute
murderers: Our lives and liberty is granted, and for a
greater assurance, they tooke us both into a great Thicket
of wood, where their timber Cabin stood, and there
made merry with us in good Wine and the best cheare

                  <p>And now because there were Forty more Bandits their
companions among these mountaines, one of themselves
for our safeguard, came along with us, and as neare <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellucia</hi>
as hee durst; making mee sweare that I should not
shew the Baron of that place of their private residence, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

so gave him many hearty, and deserved thanks.</p>
                  <p>These Bandits or men-slayers,<note place="margin">The liberty of <hi>Bandits</hi> in <hi>Calabria.</hi>

                  <p>This is an ancient liberty which <hi>Calabria</hi> hath ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and so is through the most part of all the <hi>Spanish</hi>

thereof made much of mee, &amp; wondred that I had safely

Bourge of <hi>Saramutza,</hi> belonging to a young Baron, and

and appertaining to an other young Noble youth, I
rose and marched by the breach of day where it was my

and their horses standing tyed to a bush beside them;
whereat being greatly moved,<note place="margin">Two young Barons killed at combat.</note> I approached them, and

and so it was, for they had fought the combat for

my heart sprung for joy, and taking five rings off their
foure hands, I hid them and the two purses in the ground,
halfe a mile beyond this place: And returning againe,
leapt to one of their horses, and came galloping backe to
<hi>Saramutza;</hi> where calling up my host, I told him the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident;
who when he saw the horse gave a shout for sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and running to the Castle told the Lady the Barons
Mother: where in a moment, shee, her children, and the

some naked, some on foote, and some on horse: where,
when come grievous was it to behold their wofull and

soyle: And although the people barbarous and disdaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
countenances were awfull, yet we two went still free
of tributes, as not being a thing with them accustomary, to
execute exaction on <hi>Francks</hi> as the <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Moores</hi> do

theirs, which oft I wished had beene as blacke as their
uglines. In this misculat journeying of paine and pleasure,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:9042:194"/>
we found every where strong Wines, abundance of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
bread, and the best, and greatest Hens bred on the
earth, with plenty of Figs, Fruits, Olives, and delicious
Oile, yea, and innumerable Villages, the Houses whereof
are all builded with mud, and platformed on their tops;
and so are they in <hi>Asia,</hi> and all <hi>Affrick</hi> over.</p>
                  <p>Upon the fourth day having past the Plains, we entred
in a Hilly Countrey, yet pastorable; where I beheld here
and there clouds of Tents, filled with maritine people,
that were fled hither from the Sea coast for the fresh and
cooling aire.</p>
                  <p>And upon these pleasant and umbragious heights, I saw
the fields overclad with flocks of Sheep and Goats: which
Sheep are wondrous great, having from their rumps and
hips, broad and thick tayls growing, and hanging to the
ground, some whereof when sold, will weigh 16, 18, or
20 pounds weight, and upwards. Here among the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,<note place="margin">My arrivall at <hi>Fez.</hi>

had first liberty of life, and then reliefe of food; for hee
came up in the Reare, with a hundred Horse-men charged
with halfe Pikes, headed at both ends with sharpe Steele:

burnt with the Sunne, and his age like to my owne, of 33

and all the foure Tribes of <hi>Lybia</hi> worship onely for their

There is a merry secret heare concerning the women,
which often I recited to King <hi>Iames</hi> of Blessed memory,
showing him also three Certificats of this my Desartu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
wandring: one of which was confirmed by English
<hi>Ward</hi> at <hi>Tunneis</hi> upon the <hi>Dragomans</hi> Report; though
now they with all my other Patents are lost, in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition
of <hi>Malaga.</hi> This former savage Prince, sent a
Guide with vs for foure dayes journey, the condition of
his mans Wages being made by himselfe, and franckly
advised us that <hi>Tunneis</hi> was our best and nearest recourse.
Which being forcibly considered, I was constrained to
renew my bargaine agayne with the <hi>Dragoman,</hi> at the
rate of forty five Sultans of gold to bring mee safely hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Sabunck</hi> Guide, to whom I gave five Sultans, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
five shillings, brought us through the most Habitable
vallies, and best cled passages of the Countrey with
Tents: where every day once wee found Water, Bread,
Garlick and Onions, and sometimes Hennes at twenty
<hi>Aspers</hi> the piece, two shillings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which we would Rost, or
scorch dry (if trueth may have credite) at the very face
of the Sunne, and so eate them. Upon the fift day, our
Guide leaving us in the after-noon, well setled among
foure hundred Tents of <hi>Numidian Moores,</hi> or bastard
<hi>Arabians,</hi> pitched in a pleasant Valley between two
sources of Water, wee stayed still there Reposing our

being thus. The Oven is first spred over with warm
Camels dung, and upon it the Egges closing the Oven.</p>
                  <p>Then behind the Oven, there is a daily conveyance of
heate, venting through a passage beneath the dung just
answerable to the naturall warmnesse of the Hens belly;
upon which moderation, within twenty dayes they
come to naturall perfection. The Oven producing at one

time, three or foure hundred living Chickens, and where
defection is, every sharer beareth a part of the losse; for
the Hatcher or Curator, is onely Recompensed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

an usuall thing, almost through all <hi>Affricke,</hi> which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
that the Hennes with them are so innumerable every

                  <p>And now it was my good fortune, after five Weekes

In this time of their staying,<note place="margin">Captain <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers</hi> employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> came one Captaine <hi>Danser</hi>
a Fleming, who had beene a great Pirate and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

being imployed by the French King in Ambassage, to
relieve two and twenty French Barkes that were there
Captivated, done by the policy of the <hi>Bashaw,</hi> to draw
<hi>Danser</hi> hither; notwithstanding that he was then Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

                  </p>
                  <p>Well, he is come, and Anchored in the Roade, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with two <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen: Two of which
came a shoare, and saluted the <hi>Bashaw</hi> in <hi>Dansers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe:
they are made welcome, and the next day the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw</hi>
went franckly aboord of <hi>Danser,</hi> seconded with
twelve followers: <hi>Danser</hi> tooke the presence of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw</hi>
for a great favour, and mainely feasted him with
good cheare, great quaffing, sounding Trumpets, and
Roaring shots, and none more familiar then the dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<hi>Bashaw,</hi> and overjoyed <hi>Danser,</hi> that had relieved
the Barks, for they were all sent to him that morning, not

                     <pb n="382" facs="tcp:9042:203"/>
After deepe cups, the <hi>Bassaw</hi> invites him to come a
shoare the day following, and to dine with him in the
Fortresse: To the which unhappy <hi>Danser</hi> granted, and
the time come, he landed with twelve Gentlemen, and
approaching the Castle, was met with two <hi>Turks</hi> to receive
him: where having past the draw-bridge, &amp; the gate shut
behind him,<note place="margin">The untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death of Captain <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser</hi> a Fleming born.</note> his company was denied entrance: where
forthwith <hi>Danser</hi> being brought before the <hi>Bassaw,</hi> was
strictly accused of many ships, spoiles, and great riches he
had taken from the <hi>Moores,</hi> and the mercilesse murther of
their lives, for he never spared any: Whereupon he was
straight beheaded, and his body throwne over the walles
in a ditch; which done, off went the whole Ordnance of
the Fort, to have sunke <hi>Dansers</hi> two ships; but they cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their Cables, with much adoe escaped; but for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

they hoised Sailes for <hi>Marseilles.</hi>

                  <p>Loe there was a <hi>Turkish</hi> policy more sublime &amp; crafty,
then the best <hi>Europian</hi> a live could have performed. A litle
while thereafter, the aforesaid <hi>Hollander</hi> being readie to

                  <p>The fift day of my staying here, I saw a <hi>Spanish</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier

in a Galleyot; but not one <hi>Bugeron</hi> stirred, being

here, as they are of divers Nations, so have they diuers
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:9042:203"/>
manners and inclinations; how soever they of the better
sort, are resolute in their atchievments.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Maltezes</hi> anciently did adore the Goddesse <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi>
whose Temple was superbiously adorned with rich

                  <p>Now as for the order of Knight-hood, the oath
which is made at their receiving the order of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
or of the Religion of the holy Hospitall of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>

                     </note> is

                  <p>After this, the Chappell clarke, a Priest of the order,
receiving him with divers ceremonies, taketh a blacke

Knight, saying, Receive this signe in the name of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
the blessed Mother of God, the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and
of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> for the augmentation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick

the enemies of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> thou shalt happen to
flee, and leave his holy Signe behind thee, thou shalt of
good right be depraved of this holy religious order, and
of our company: This done, hee knitteth the Gordon of
the cloak about him saying; Receive the yoke of our Lord
that is sweet, and light and thou shalt finde rest for thy
soule: Thus spoke, he kisseth the Gordon, and so doe all
the circumstanding Knights, and there are made unto
him divers Orations and precepts, contained in the Book
of their Ordinances: They have a Priest-hood too of
this same order, being Masse-Priests that weare this badge
of the white Crosse.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sicilia</hi> was first named <hi>Trinacria</hi> (whose figure is <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetria</hi>)

                  </p>
                  <p>The most of the Townes and Villages within land,
are builded on the highest hills and greatest heights in the
Countrey; the reason is two-fold; first it serveth them for
strength: and a great defence in time of cursary invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of which divers be so strait in ascending that one
man may easily resist and beat downe five hundred. The
second is,<note place="margin">Towns set on heights re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve good ayre.</note> because their dwellings being farre above the
parching plains, these situations are good preservatives
for their health, where on they have a sweet and cooling
ayre, which in such a hot climat, is the soveraigne salve
to prevent sicknesse.</p>
                  <p>Their Villages be farre distant, some sixe, ten, fifteene
twenty miles, one from another; in all which grounds
there is no sequestrate house, unlesse (being a high way)
it bee a Fundaco or Inne. About the sides of the hills,
whereon their Townes stand, grow all their Winds, and
on the Plaines nothing but red wheat, which for god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is unparralleled, and the best bread and a bundance
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:9042:205"/>
of it in the world is here. <hi>Sicilia</hi> was formerly devided
in three Regions, to wit, the valley of <hi>Demonia,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Aetna, Catagna, Messina,</hi> and that angle of <hi>Cap di

thinke that <hi>Sicilia</hi> was rent from <hi>Italy</hi> by the violence
of waters, at the generall Deluge, some by infinit Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,
and some simply conjecture the cause to have
proceeded from combustious <hi>Aetna,</hi> which is meere ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</p>
                  <p>There are divers grounds and valleys in this Isle, that
abound so in Wheat, that the Inhabitants recoile a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
measures for one, and commonly are called the
fields of a hundred measures.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sycilians</hi> for the most part are bred Orators,
which made the <hi>Apulians</hi> tearm them, men of three
tongues: besides they are full of witty sentences, &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
in their rancounters,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sicilians</hi> are brave Orators</note> yet among themselves, they are
full of envie (meaning their former kindnesses was unto
strangers) suspicious and dangerous in conversation, being
lightly given to anger and offences, and ready to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of any injury committed: But indeed I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
more generously than the <hi>Italians,</hi> who murder
their enemies in the night; for they appeale other to
single combat, and that manfully without fraudulent
practices.</p>
                  <p>They are curious, and great lovers of novelties, and
full of quicknesse and rare inventions in all kind of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
great intelligencers and lovers of histories: As I
found in divers of them, who knew the passages formerly
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:9042:205"/>
of my Countrey so exquisitely that I was astonished at
their relations so agreeable with the trueth and times
past. The Parlament of <hi>Sicily</hi> hath a wonderfull great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
in so much that the <hi>Viceroy</hi> cannot have the free
gift (as they call it) which is every third yeare, nor no
extraordinary thing, nor the renewing of any matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the common-wealth, without the generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the whole Kingdome: The generall Counsell
whereof is composed of three branches called by them
the armes of the Kingdome:<note place="margin">The great Counsell of <hi>Sicilia.</hi>
                     </note> viz. first the Prelats, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Clergy men named the arme Ecclesiastick: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly

the Commissioners of Cities and Townes intitulated the
arme Signioriall: The Crowne-rent of this Kingdome
amounteth, to a million and a halfe of Duccats yearely,
which being disbursed euer for intertaining of Captaines,
Garrisons and of Gallies and cursary ships, the Badge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes

and watches about the coasts, the reparations of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
high-wayes, Lords pensions, and other defrayings,
there rests little, or nothing at all to the King.</p>
                  <p>I remember in my twice being in this Kingdome, (es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
the second time, wherein I compassed the whole
Island, and thrise traversed the middle parts thereof from
Sea to Sea) I never saw any of that selfe Nation, to begge
bread or seeke almes; so great is the beatitude of their
plenty. And I dare avow it (experience taught mee)
that the poorest creature in <hi>Sicily</hi> eateth as good bread,
as the best Prince in Christendome doth. The people are
very humane, ingenious, eloquent and pleasant, their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
in many words is neerer the <hi>Latine,</hi> then the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian,</hi>
which they promiscuously pronounce, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

wonderfull kind to strangers. In the moneths of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
and <hi>August,</hi> all the Marine Townes every yeare, are
strictly and strongly guarded with them of the inland Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages
and Bourges, both on foote and horse-backe: who
are compelled to lie there at their owne charges, so long
as this season lasteth; in which they feare the incursions
of the <hi>Turks;</hi> but the rest of the yeare, these Sea-coast
Townes are left to the vigilant custodie of the Indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</p>
                  <p>This Countrey was ever sore oppressed with Rebells
and Bandits,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Sona</hi> Vice-roy of <hi>Sicilia.</hi>
                     </note> untill such time that the military Duke of
<hi>Sona,</hi> came to rule there as <hi>Viceroy, Anno</hi> 1611. where in
the first yeare he brought in five hundred; some whereof
were hanged, some pardoned, and some committed to
the Gallies: So that within two yeares of his foure yeares
government, there was not a Bandit left at random in

Justice that this Duke before whose face the silly ones

tremble.</p>
                  <p>And in a word, he has no suppressor of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
(as many now be) to satisfie either licentious
humours, or to inrich light-headed flatterers, but serving
Justice, he made Justice serve him: for the equity of
Justice of it selfe, can affond none, neither of any will it
be offended; unlesse the corrupt tongue and hand of the
mercenary Judge suffer sound judgment to perish for
temporary respects; which this noble Governour could
never doe, neither suffer any inferiour Magistrate to
doe the like under him: As it well appeared by his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

did not slaughter my good wil; and yet my patience could

him to say Masse for a yeare, without satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the mans life: so the Duke inhibited the Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker
to make shooes for a yeare, and neverthelesse
allowed him two shillings a day to maintaine him for that
time.</p>
                  <p>Many singular observations have I of his government,

                  <p>There arrivalls are usually in the night, and if in day

yet gathering on all parts so narrow to the top, as if it
had been industriously squared, having a large prospect
in the Sea; about the lower parts whereof grow exceeding

is the greatest of the three now burning in <hi>Aetna:</hi> whose

hearing toward the further end, ascriking noise, as if it
had beene the croaking of Frogs, the hissing of Serpents,
the bussing of Bees, or snarling of Wolves; we demanded
our Guide from whence such a sound proceeded: Who
answered, they were Dragoris and flying Serpents, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Whereat I laughing, Replyed, there was no such matter;

him on the dry stones. Where indeed, I must confesse,
I grew affrighted, for my legs, fearing to be interlaced

I arrived (the way of <hi>Ferrara</hi> and <hi>Padua</hi>) at <hi>Venice.</hi> Who
then was levying an army against the <hi>Croation</hi> Scokes of
<hi>Gradisca,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Grasso</hi> now Emperour, of
which Army Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> was generall, and with
whom I crossed the Gulfe to <hi>Pola</hi> in <hi>Istria,</hi> and from
thence to the siege of <hi>Gradisea:</hi> The discourse whereof,
I have here formerly avouched in the second part of my

hee is more then praise-worthy and fortunate, that
hath faced the Low Countries, reviewed <hi>Briscia</hi> in <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy,</hi>
and footed and sighted the Arsenal of <hi>Venice;</hi> then
his eyes have first seen, the sonnes, the force, the policies

                  <p>Now leaving both the armies barking at other like to
<hi>Hercanian</hi> wolves, I traced the fertile soyles of <hi>Carindia,

greatnesse, strength, or wealth: for the Towne rising
upon a moderate height circular, is but of small compasse
without, nor passing two <hi>English</hi> miles.</p>
                  <p>The suburbs round about, being twice as great as the
Towne; and the strength of it is no way comparable to a

so much to be admired, being depraved of Seas, shipping,

dry land Townes.</p>

Having now traversed all the countrey to <hi>Grana,</hi> and so

So fram'd that every one supplieth an other, for they of

                  <p>This custome of idolatrous obeysance came first by
one <hi>Rangavistah,</hi> who being chosen to be their Emperor,
would try their promptnesse and good will of obedience
towards him, commanding seven of his chiefest Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and head Governours under him of the people, to
to kill their infants, with their own hands.</p>
                  <p>And notwithstanding the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mmandement seemed
verie rude and intolerable, yet they fearing the common
people, who esteeme their Emperours to be the divine
Kinsmen (as it were) of God; they did cut the throats
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:9042:222"/>
every one of them, of their owne Children, before his
owne eyes, and the sight of the people.</p>
                  <p>Insomuch, that ever since, the life and death of the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi>
depend upon the good-will, and word of the King,
which no way they dare contradict; such is the ignorant
reverence they carry toward him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tartarians,</hi> for the most part are small of body,
their eyes grosse, and bolstring out, their faces bee broad
and without haire, saving that in their upper Lippe and
Chin, they have thinne and moist haire; they bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
slender in the middle; they shave their heads
from one eare to the other, by the top of the Crowne
to the hinder part, keeping long haire like unto a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
whereof they make two folds or pleats, and so
binde them both behind the eares; and so bee all other
shaven that live amongst them. They be excellent horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and ill foote-men; and therefore none goeth a foot,
but rides either on horse-back, or upon some other beast,
as Oxen, or Cowes. They take great pride to hang Bells
and other Tassells of silke about their horses necks, to
make them shew comely, and a meanes because of their
Bells, to keepe them from tyring, being hung at their
eares: When they drinke, they powre it in till they bee
drunken, which they take as a great glory or Conquest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, who can carry most drinke; a custome too
much used here in <hi>England,</hi> which I could wish were left;
For the glory of a drunkard is his owne shame. They
have no bread, nor use any baking, nor Table-cloaths,
nor Towells; they use no handkerchiefs, nor seldome or
never doe they wash their hands, body, or aparrell. They
eate no pot-hearbes, nor pulfe; but onely the flesh of all
kind of living things, not caring whether cleane or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
creatures, as dogges, horses, &amp;c. They roast the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:9042:222"/>
bodies of such parties as they take in warre, to shew
their cruelty, and desire of revenge: And where many
meet together in the eating of them, they teare them
with their teeth like Wolves, and drinke their blood,
which they reserved before in Cups, otherwise they drink
Cowes Milke.</p>
                  <p>It is a hainous thing with them to suffer any drinke to
be lost, or any meate cast away; and therefore they cast no
bones to Dogs, before they have broken the bones and
taken out the Marrow. In warre they have swords of a
yard long: their horse-men are very skilfull in discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Pistolls. Their Princes never enter into warre,
but standing afarre off, they call unto their owne compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
to be of good courage, and exhort them to bee reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
and fight manfully. They most commonly carry
their wives and children with them, because their wives
are attired like men: they also carry Images of men on
Horse-backe to their warres, which they thinke is a point
of policy, that they may seeme a great number, and to
dis-hearten their enemies. They count it no dishonour
or shame to runne away from their enemies, if they finde
themselves to be too weake for them. And if they do get
the victory, they spare none, neither women nor children,
young, nor old: They give quarter to none, but onely to
those who are Artificers, and handy-crafts men, whom
they reserve for their owne uses: They are very inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
and therefore they are suffered to take as many
wives as they please; they except none, neither mother,
daughter, or sister, and they are given much to <hi>Sodomy.</hi>
They do not esteem of any other wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as of their wives,
nor doe they thinke her worthy of any Dowry, before
that she hath brought forth a child: They may refuse any
wife which they have, if they bee barren, and may take
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:9042:223"/>
another. They that are taken in the act of Adultry, are
surely put to death by their Law, having no pitty shewed
them. No man maketh water in his house, if he doth,
he is sure to be slaine: if necessity compeld him, that hee
could not stay, then his Tent and other things therein, are
purified and aired with fire, and other curious scen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>When they chuse and elect their Prince, they meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in a large field, and then they set him a stately
Throne richly guilded, placed in the view of all that are
then present, and falling downe before him, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
all after this sort, and with one consent. <hi>Wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech,
we will, and command, that thou beare rule over us.</hi>
Then their new King which is chosen answereth: <hi>If you
will have this done of me, it is necessary, that you be ready
to doe all that I shall command you: When I call<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to come:

be ready;</hi> he saith againe, <hi>Therefore my word shall bee my
sword;</hi> then all the people clap their hands with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing.
Then the Noble men take him from the Regall
Seat, and make him to sit softly upon a Cushion, or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
upon the ground, saying thus: <hi>Looke up, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

they adjoyne unto him his dearest and best beloved
wife, and lifting them both up with the Cushion, they
salute them as their Emperour and head.</p>
                  <p>Then to such as be present at this Ceremony, of other
Nations, he commandeth gifts to be given them out of
hand: there is also all the treasure and jewells which the

late deceased Emperour left, wherewith this new Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
rewardeth every Noble man; and that which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

nor come they at any time in his sight, except
they, and their presents which they bring with them, have

of his meanest Noble men, to whom, when, and how long
soever he speaketh, they ought to give eare upon their
knees bowed, and so attend; and they that deliver the
Emperours minde, dare not erre so much as in a word.</p>

This fugitive Earle stayed me with him ten dayes,

in the bosome of two gracelesse Sisters, Ignorance and

                  <p>This Kingdom is divided in foure provinces, although
some allude five, that is, Easterne and Westerne <hi>Maith,</hi>

                  <p>And this I dare avo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, there are more Rivers, Lakes,
Brooks, Strands, Quagmires, Bogs and Marishes, in
this Countrey, then in all Christendome besides; for
Travelling there in the Winter, all my daily solace, was
sincke downe comfort; whiles Boggy-plunging deeps
kissing my Horse-belly; whiles over mired Saddle, Bodie,

                  <p>And now I call to memory (not without derision)
though I conceal the particular place and prelate, it was
my Fortune in the County of <hi>Dunagale,</hi> to bee joviall

true it is, to make a fit comparison, the <hi>Barbarian</hi>
Moore, the Moorish <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the <hi>Turke,</hi> and the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish-man,</hi>
are the least industrious,<note place="margin">The ignorant and sluggish life of the common <hi>Irish</hi>

thereby a greater necessity they have to live, than any
pleasure they have, or can have in their living.</p>
                  <p>Their Fabricks are advanced three or foure yards
high, Pavilion-like incircling, erected in a singular
Frame, of smoak-torne straw, greene long prick'd
turffe, and Rain-dropping watles. Their severall Rooms
of Palatiat divisions, as Chambers, Halls, Parlours, Kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins,
Barnes, and Stables, are all inclosed in one, and
that one (perhaps) in the midst of a Mire; where, when
in foule weather, scarcely can they finde a drye part,
whereupon to repose their cloud-baptized heads. Their
shirts be woven of the wooll or Linnen of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and their penurious food semblable to their ruvid
condition.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, these onely titular Christians, are so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in their superstitious profession of Popery, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they, nor the greatest part of their Priests know, or
understand what the mystery of the Masse is; which

they daily see, and the other celebrate, nor what the name
of <hi>Iesus</hi> is, either in his divine or humane Nature: Aske
him of his Religion, he replieth; what his father, his great

<hi>Sabuncks,</hi> and <hi>Garolinean Moores</hi> of <hi>Lybia:</hi> Indeed
of all things, (besides their ignorance) I onely lamented
their heavie bondage under three kind of Masters; the

<hi>Irish</hi> Rent-masters have any voyage for <hi>Dublin,</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
superspended at home in feasting of strangers;
then must these poore ones be taxed and afflicted with the

otherwise in supporting their superfluous charges for
<hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O! what a slavish servitude doe these silly wretches
endure? the most part of whom in all their lives, have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a third part of food, natures cloathing, nor a secure

                  <p>The miserable sight whereof, and their sad sounding
groanes, have often drawne a sorrowfull remorse from
my humane compassion.</p>

                     <pb n="434" facs="tcp:9042:229"/>
As for their Gentry, such as are brought up here at
<hi>London,</hi> learne to become a great deale more civill, than
those who are brought up at home after their owne
rude and accustomed manner: And this I observed,
in my traversing the whole Kingdome I never saw one or
other, neither could moove any of that selfe Nation, to
pledg or to present his Majesties health; but as many other
healths as you list; they will both fasten and receive from
you, till they fall in the muddy hotch potch of their dead
Grand-fathers understanding: indeed for intertainement
of strangers they are freely disposed: and their Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of any good sort reserve ever in their houses, <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Sack, and <hi>Irish Vscova,</hi> and will bee as tipsy with
their wives, their Priests, and their friends, as though
they were naturally infeft in the eleven royall Taverns of
<hi>Naples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now amongst many, there are two intolerable
abuses of protections in that Kingdome:<note place="margin">Two intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable abuses in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                     </note> The one of
Theeves and Wood-carnes, the other of Priests and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists:
I discourse of these corruptions now as I found
them then.</p>
                  <p>The first is prejudicall to all Christian civilnesse, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quill
government, and a great discouragement for our
colloniz'd plantators there, belonging to both soyles of
this Island; being daily molested, and nightly incombered
with these blood-sucking Rebells.</p>
                  <p>And notwithstanding of their barbarous cruelty, ever
executed at all advantages, with slaughter and murder
upon the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>English</hi> dwellers there; yet they have
and find at their owne wills Symonicall protections,
for lesser or longer times; ever as the confused dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,
have their law-sold hands, filled with the bloody
bribes of slaughtered lives, high-way, and house
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:9042:229"/>
robbed people: And then thereafter their ill got meanes
being spent, like unto dogs, they returne back to their
former vomit; so jugling with their in, and outgoings,
like to the restlesse Ocean, that they cannot nor never did
become true subjects to our King, not faithfull friends
to their Country: Unlesse by extremity of Justice, the
one still hanged before the other,<note place="margin">The filthy corruption of <hi>Irish</hi> Priests and Wood-Carns, thie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish Rebels.</note> the remnant by the

are but the Hounds of their hunting Priests a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
what faction soever, their malicious malignity is
intended: partly for intertainement, partly for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
spleens, and lastly, for a generall disturbance of the
Countrey, for the Priests greater security and stay.</p>
                  <p>The other abuse is, their Libertinous Masses; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
whereof, I first to the Heavens, and then to my
Prince bequeath; whose Sabboth recusant mony, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they bragge (as they say) in derision of our luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme
dispensation, tendeth to none other purpose, but
to obombrate the true light of the Gospell, and to feed
their absurd, and almost irrevocable ignorance.</p>
                  <p>And neverthelesse at their daily meetings (experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
taught mee) there was never a more repining peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
against our Prince and Church as they be: for in this

The one was their manner of Tillage, Ploughes drawne

is as bad a husbandry, I say, as ever I found among the

to pay twenty shillings a yeare, before they will change

                  <p>The other as goodly fight I saw, was women travelling
the way,<note place="margin">Northerne <hi>Irish</hi> woman giving suck to their Babes, behinde their shoulders.</note> or toyling at home, carry their infants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their necks, and laying the Dugges over their

their backs, without taking them in their armes: Such
kind of breasts me thinketh, were very fit to bee made

more than halfe a yard long, and as well wrought as any

                     <hi>Ireland</hi> is an excellent Country to live in for cheapnes
and all variety of mans sustenance: therefore I would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
the Reader to take this description of it, (though
already spoken of before, but not so fully.)</p>
                  <p>This Country of <hi>Ireland</hi> lyeth farre in the West Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and is accounted by the most expert in that kinde,<note place="margin">The length of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                     </note>
to be in length very neare three hundred Miles, from
North to South: in bredth, from East to West, one
hundred and twenty Miles: It much resembleth the
forme of an Egge; being as it were blunt at each end,
and smooth or plaine on the sides; not extending it
selfe forth to sea in Nooks and Armes of Land, as <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
doth.</p>
                  <p>The Country it selfe lyeth low, and is very waterish,
And containeth in it divers little Islands,<note place="margin">The manner of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</note> and is much
troubled with Bogs and Marishes. Some of their high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Hills, I have seene them had standing pooles of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
on their tops; the Country of it selfe is very fruitfull
in all sorts of Cattell, and very plentifull of all manner
of graine: The aire is very wholsome, yet not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so cleare and subtle as <hi>England.</hi> The inhabitants are
much troubled with sicknesse, as defluxion of Rhumes,
and bloody Flixes; and for prevention and helpe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they drinke <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> which they conceive doth
dry up the Rhume, and keepe them healthfull: It hath
beene very full of Wood, and but little Champaigne
ground: It is mightily inhabited by our <hi>English,</hi> and
much civilized of late, by the great care of those which
are and have beene their Governours.</p>
                  <p>Sea-coale and Turffe is most of their fuell; it hath
great store of horses, but of no great stature, as they bee
in <hi>England:</hi> They have plenty of Fish and all manner of
Fowle: Great store of Bees, which yields them no small
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:9042:231"/>
profit: Sheepe are the fewest and scarcest of all other
Cattell, and those are but small, and yield very course
Woole, whereof the women spinne and make their
Rugges and Mantles, which they weare about them.
No Venemous or Creeping Beast is bred, brought
forth, or nourished there, nor can live there if it were
sent in; and therefore the Spider of <hi>Ireland</hi> is well known
not to be venemous or hurtfull.</p>
                  <p>The most part of the better sort of people are inclined
to vertue,<note place="margin">The nature of the people.</note> and Religion; wondrous kinde, amorous, and
loving, where they take their first love; but very revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and spleenfull otherwise. There are many Sorcerers
and Witches amongst this Nation. The gentlemen are
excellent horse-men; delighted with exercise of warlike
Armes, and are both stout and couragious; and very
free and bountifull in their Almes, and hospitality. At
the death of any friend or kindred, they follow the dead
corpes to the Grave with howlings and bitter cryings;
pittifull in outward shew. They are very apt to believe
and give credit to Miracles and old Prophesies, Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and foolish sayings. They are very desirous of
praise and honour; but very fearefull of dishonour.
They love an excellent Poet, who can or will extoll
Saint <hi>Patricke</hi> and their owne Nation, and will bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
reward them.</p>
                  <p>As for any other customes they have, to avoid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixitie
I spare; onely, before my pen flee over Seas, I
would gladly shake hands with some of our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
there, for better are the wounds of a friend, than
the sweet smiles of a flatterer, for love and truth cannot
dissemble.</p>
                  <p>Many dissembling impudents intrude themselves in
this high calling of God, who are not truly, neither
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:9042:231"/>
worthily thereunto called, the ground here arising either
from a carnall or carelesse presumption, otherwise from
needy greed, and lack of bodily maintenance.</p>
                  <p>Such is now the corruption of time, that I know here
even Mechanick men admitted in the place of Pastors:<note place="margin">An Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</note>
yea, and rude bred Souldiers, whose education was at
the Musket mouth, are become there, both <hi>Lybian</hi>
grave, and unlearned Churchmen: Nay; besides them
professed; indeed professed Schollers: whose warbling
mouthes ingorged with spoonefu's of bruised Latine,
seldome or never expressed, unlesse the force of quaffing,
spew it out forth from their empty Sculs: Such I say,
interclude their Doctrine, betweene the Thatch and
the Church-wall tops; and yet their smallest stipends
shall amount to one, two, three, or foure hundred pounds
a yeare.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon you may demand mee, how spend they, or
how deserve they this? I answer, their deserts are nought,
and the fruit thereof as naughtily spent: for Sermons and
Prayers they never have any, neither never preached any,
nor can preach.</p>
                  <p>And although some could, as perhaps they seeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
would, they shall have no Auditour (as they say)
but bare Walles, the plants of their Parishes, being
the rootes of meere <hi>Irish.</hi> As concerning their carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
in spending such sacrilegious Fees, the course is
thus.</p>
                  <p>The Alehouse is their Church, the <hi>Irish</hi> Priests their
Consorts, their Auditors be Fill, and Fetch more, their
Text <hi>Spanish</hi> Sacke, their Prayers carrousing, their

                  <p>Loe, there are some of the abuses of our late weak, and
stragling Ecclesiasticks there, and the soule-sunk sorrow
of godlesse Epicures and Hypocrites.</p>
                  <p>To all which, and much more have I beene an occular
Testator, and sometimes a constrayned consociate to

to know the behaviour and conversation of such
mercenary <hi>Iebusites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Great God amend it, for it is great pitty to behold
it, and if it continue so still, as when I saw them last;
O farre better it were! that these ill bestowed Tythes,

idle and prophane <hi>Parasites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here another generall abuse, I observed that
whensoever any <hi>Irish</hi> dye, the friends of the defunct (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
other fees) paying twenty shillings to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
Curat, shall get the corpes of the deceased to bee

<pb n="441" facs="tcp:9042:232"/>
one enter the gates of <hi>Sion;</hi> to worship the Lord,
nor conforme themselves to true Religion.</p>
                  <p>Truely such and the like abuses, and evill examples
of lewd lives, having beene the greatest hinderance of
that lands conversion; for such like wolues have beene
from time to time, but stumbling blocks before them;
regarding more their owne sensuall and licentious ends,
than the glory of God, in converting of one foule unto
his Church.</p>
                  <p>Now as concerning the conscionable carriage of the
<hi>Hybernian</hi> Cleargie,<note place="margin">Ministeriall officer strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abused.</note> aske mee, and there my reply:
As many of them (for the most part) as are Protestant
Ministers, have their Wives, Children, and Servants, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
Papists; and many of these Church-men at the
houre of their death (like Dogs) returne backe to their
former vomit: Witnesse the late Vicar of <hi>Calin,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the late and last, <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of <hi>Desmond,</hi>
who being on death-bed, and having two hundred
pounds a yeare; finding himselfe to forsake both life
and stipend, send straight for a Romish Priest, and
received the Papall Sacrament: Confessing freely in my
audience, that hee had beene a Roman Catholicke all
his life, dissembling onely with his Religion, for the
better maintaining of his wife and children. And being
brought to his burial place, he was interted in the Church,
with the which he had played the Ruffian all his life; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
openly carried at mid-day with Jesuites, Priests, and
Friers of his owne Nation, and after a contemptible
manner, in derision of our profession, and Laws of the
Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>Infinite more examples of this kinde could I recite, and
the like resemblances of some being alive; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and so concludeth this Cleargicall corruption
there. Yet I would not have the Reader to thinke, that <hi>I</hi>
condemne all our Cleargie there, no, God forbid, for
I know there are many sound and Religious Preachers of
both Kingdomes among them, who make conscience of
their calling, and live as <hi>Lanthornes,</hi> to uncapable Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
and to those stragling <hi>Stoicks</hi> I complain of, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnatory

It was my fortune, as St. <hi>Domingo</hi> to enter the Towne
Church accompanied with two <hi>French</hi> Puppies, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

father and the sonne, two <hi>Burboneons</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> going in
Pilgrimage to St. <hi>Iames,</hi> it was their lot to lodg here in
an Inne: Where supper ended, and reckoning payed, the

his owne purse in the young mans Budget.</p>
                  <p>On the morrow early, the two innocent Pilgrims Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the hard brusing way, were quickly over hied by
the Justice, where the Host making search for his purse,
found it in the Sonnes bagge. Whereupon instantly
and in the same place hee was hanged, and left hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there, seasing on their money by a sententiall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture.</p>
                  <p>The sorrowfull Father (notwithstanding) continued
his pilgrimage to <hi>Compostella,</hi> where, when come,
and devotion made, our Lady of mount <hi>Serata,</hi> appeared
to him saying: <hi>Thy Prayers are heard, and thy groanes
have pearced my heart, arise and returne to Saint</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo
<hi>for thy Sonne liveth.</hi> And hee accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
found it so, and the Sonne-hanged Monster,
after 30 dayes absence, spoke thus from the Gallowes,
<hi>Father, go to our Host, and shew him I live, then speedily
returne.</hi> By which direction the old man entred the
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:9042:236"/>
Towne, and finding the Host at Table, in breaking up of
two roasted Pullets, told him and said: <hi>My sonne liveth,
come and see.</hi> To which the smiling Host replyed, he is as
surely alive on the Gallows,<note place="margin">A damnable delusion of a devillish mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</note> as these two pullets be alive
in the dish. At which protestation, the two fire-scorched
fowles leapt out suddenly alive, with heads, wings, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and feete, and cakling, took flight thrice about the
Table. The which amazing sight, made the astonished
Host to confesse his guiltines, and the other relieved from
the rope, he was hung up in his place, allotting his house
for an Hospitality to Pilgrimes for ever.</p>
                  <p>There are still two Henns reserved here, in memory
of this miracle, and are changed, as they grow fat for
the Priests chops, being freely given to the place. And
I dare swearing say, these Priests eate fatter Henns,

I was no sooner entred the Towne, and drawing up
a private way to my lodging, to shun company and
acquaintance, for that night was I to have imbarked for
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> but I was suddenly surprised in that nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
depopulated street with 9 <hi>Alguozilos,</hi> or Sergeants,
who inclosing me on both sides, laid violent hands on
me, wrapping mee up in a blacke frizado cloake, and
gripping my throat to stop my crying, they carried mee
on their armes to the governours house, and inclosed me
in a low Parlour.</p>
                  <p>To which when the Governour came,<note place="margin">A sad request to a mercilesse Governour.</note> for I was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with him before, I sadly spoke, saying <hi>My most
noble Governour, and worthy Lord, I humbly beseech your
goodnesse to shew me for what offence or cause, I am thus vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
brought before you, knowing that in me, and from my
carriage there is no injury committed.</hi> Whereat, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
answere and shaking his head, hee inclosed mee in a
little Cabinet within the parlour till he went to Masse,
commanding them with all possible dilligence to fetch
hither, the Captaine of the Towne, <hi>Don Francesco de
Cordava,</hi> the <hi>Alcademajor,</hi> and the States <hi>Scrivan,</hi> enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them to conceale my apprehending till further tryal
under the paine of death.</p>
                  <p>At last hee from the Masse, and they come hither, the
Sergants were dismissed, the doores made fast, and I
was brought forth before these foure <hi>Cavallieros,</hi> all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in chaires, and the Scrivan-table set, with pen and
paper to write my Confession. Whereafter long silence,
the governour asked mee of my Nation, and how long,
and how often I had beene out of my Countrey, and
whether I was bound? and how long I had beene in
<hi>Spaine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To whom I punctually returned my dividuat answers:
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:9042:241"/>
Whereupon being inclosed in my former Cabinet, within
a while <hi>Don Francesco</hi> entred my Roome, demanding me
if I had been in <hi>Sivilia,</hi> or was come from it; and clapping
my cheeks with a <hi>Iudas</hi> smile, made this entreaty. <hi>My deare
brother, and gallant companion, confesse freely that you have
beene in</hi> Sivilia, <hi>for your countenance bewrayeth, there
are some hidden purposes in the closet of your brest, and</hi>
Para fuyr mas malo, <hi>you had best in time relate to mee the
truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereat I saying no, as truth acquired, he went back,
resolving them of my stiffe deniall, and they therewith
incensed, I was invited to their former presence, and main
accusations ensuing. First, the Governour made me sweare
and hold up my hand, that I should tell the particular
truth of everything he was to demand of me; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
I did according to my knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Then hee inquired if the <hi>English</hi> Generall, was a Duke,
or great Signior, and what could be the reason, that hee
refused to come ashoare there; for that was the first im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of their false conceived jealousie. Next; hee
asked mee, if I knew his name, and the other Captains
and what their names were? and what their intention
was? or if I had knowne of their comming abroad, or
preparation for it, before my departure from <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Scrivan writing downe mean-while every word
hee spoke and what I answered: well; to all the former
particulars giving condigne satisfaction, and to the last,
denying that I knew of the forth comming of the Fleet,
they all foure gave a shout in the contrary. Whereupon
the Governour swearing, cursed and said, <hi>Thou lyest like
a Villain, thou art a Spie and a Traytor, and camest directly
from</hi> England <hi>of purpose to</hi> Spaine; <hi>and hath beene lying
nine moneths in</hi> Sivilia, <hi>getting sure intelligence, when
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:9042:241"/>
the</hi> Spanish <hi>Navy was looked for from the</hi> Indies; <hi>and
that thou expresly here, came to meete with the</hi> English
Armado, <hi>(knowing of their drift) to give them credible
knowledge thereof: And that by thy information, they
might the more readily compasse their ends, and thus thy
treachery and subtilty, hath been imployed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereat I being astonished, and seriously answering
for the intention of the English Fleet, and my owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie
concerning them: Hee threatning said, I was
seene familiar a Board and a shoare, with the whole
Captaines, and knowne to be of their speciall acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
besides three hundred other Gentlemen, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
with whom, and they with thee, were so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
that it far exceeded the kindnesse of accidentall
meeting.</p>
                  <p>All this wee saw, and hourely remarked (said hee) and
thou art newly come from the Generall when thou wast
taken, where consulting with their Connsell of Warre
this morning, (concerning what they assigned thee to
accomplish) thou hast delivered thy opinion, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of <hi>Sivilia,</hi> touching the return of his Majesties
<hi>Armado di Plato;</hi> and therefore thou art a <hi>Spiono,</hi> a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
and a scelerate <hi>Velacco:</hi> for wee are not ignorant
(said he) of the burning of Saint <hi>Thome</hi> in the West <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi>
for there and then, wee had a certaine evidence of
the English infidelitie, and treacherous exploits in time
of Peace: Wherefore these <hi>Lutherans</hi> and sonnes of
the Devill, ought not from us, good Catholicks, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no credit.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon I besought him, to send for some sufficient
English Factors, there sojourning, who would testifie the
contrary in my behalfe, their Countrey and their Fleete,
but that hee would not, for my being discovered. At last
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:9042:242"/>
seeing his damnable opinion, and to cleare my selfe of
such false imputations: I requested him to send a Sergeant
to my <hi>Possado</hi> or lodging for my Cloakbag, where he
should see a more evident Testimony of my carriage and
honest purpose, and thereupon, the approbation of my
Prince.</p>
                  <p>This demaund liked him well, thinking thereby to
finde out all the secrets and practise of my Negotiation
with the English Fleete: Whereupon forthwith, and with
close Circumspection he had it brought unto him, my
hostage House not knowing where I was.<note place="margin">His Majesties Letters and Seals misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</note> The Cloakbag
I opened my selfe, and showing him his Majesties Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in parchment, and under his Hand and Seale, dated
at <hi>Theobals 1619. Iuly</hi> 17, and compiled and wrot by Mr.
<hi>Thomas Read,</hi> then secretary for the Latin Tongue, done
in my behalfe, and my intended Resolution for <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi>
the Kings safe Conduct hee mis-regarded, giving it
neither respect nor trust.</p>
                  <p>After which, I show'd him divers patents, Seales, and
the great seale of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Pasports, and my Booke
of armes, called <hi>Liber amicorum,</hi> wherein I had the
hand writs, and armes of sundry Kings, Dukes, Princes,
Vice Royes, Marquesses, Earles, Lords, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
&amp;c. done in Prose and Verse, in Greeke, Latine, or
their maternall tongues, being as propitious pledges of
their favour, in commendation of mee, and of my
Travailes.</p>
                  <p>But all these would not satisfie him, nay rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
a greater jealousie of his former suspition: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
misconstruing all, they seased absolutely upon my
Cloak-bag, viewing and detaining all I had at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
including me the third time. This done, and with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in
night, being Represented againe, the Governour
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:9042:242"/>
commanding me to subscribe my Confession, which I vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
obeyed; though they still urged me further and
further to confesse. Meane while, these foure Complices
consulting about my Imprisonment, the <hi>Aleade</hi> or chief
Justice, would have had me along with him to the Towne
Jayle, but the <hi>Corrigidor</hi> refused, saying <hi>Para non star

Country-men, it behoveth me to have a care of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment:

well enough.</p>
                  <p>Upon the knowledge of this,<note place="margin">An injust robbery by unjust Judges.</note> that I was secretly to
be incarcerate in the governours Palace, entered the Mr.
Sergeant, and begged my money, and Licence to search
for it: and liberty granted, he found in my pockets eleve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their eyes, even to my shirt, and searching my breeches,
he found in my Doublet necke, fast shut between two
Canvesses, one hundred thirty seven double peeces
of gold. Whereat the <hi>Corrigidor</hi> arose and couu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my gold, being five hundred forty eight Ducats,
he said to the Sergant, cloath him againe, and inclosed
him there in the Cabinet till after supper, meanewhile
the Sergeant got the eleven duccatons of Silver; and my
gold, which was to carrie me for <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
seased upon, giving afterwards two hundred
Crowns of it to supply the new laid foundation of a
<hi>Capuschine</hi> monastery there, reserving the rest (being
348 duccats for his own avaritious ends.</p>
                  <p>This done, and mid night come, the Sergant and two
Turkish slaves releasing mee from the inferiour Roome,
brought mee through certaine ascending passages, to a
chamber, in a sequestrate side of the Palace, toward the
Garden, and right about his summer Kitchin: Where
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:9042:243"/>
there, and then the Sergeants, and the two slaves, thrust
on every ancle an heavy bolt, my legs put to the

sit up nor walke, nor stand, nor turne mee; but lay
continually on my back, the irons being thrice heavier

                  <p>Whereupon beholding my inevitable misery,<note place="margin">A miserable and helplesse Lamentation.</note> and such
monster-made irons, my sighing soule replyed thus:
<hi>Alas Sergant, and you two Slaves, remarke in mee the iust
Iudgments of god; and loe how the Heavens have reduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
mee to this meritorious reward, and truely deserved; for

and vaporous curiosity! woe worth the fury of your as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring

                  <p>Thus and more lamenting the destiny of nature, they
left mee with solacious words, and straight returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
with victuals, being a pound of boild Mutton, a
wheat bread, and a small pint of Wine: which was the
first, the best, and the last of this kinde, that ever I got
in that woefull <hi>Mansion.</hi> The Sergeant leaving me (ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

carry the keyes to <hi>Areta,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and keeper of the

                  <p>A little while after hee was gone the other drudge left
me also, who was newly turned Christian: where being

onely for a naked suspition, mistaking the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
intention of the <hi>English</hi> Armado, I am as a spy

                  <p>Where upon the silly Slaue falling downe on his knees,

                     <hi>para tomar pacenza, &amp;c.</hi> Brother, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it is much needefull for you to take all in patience,
for it is impossible now you can escape some fearefull
tryall, and there upon a horrible punishment even unto
death; and alasse to relieve you, if I durst, (as I dare not
under death) to discover you to your Countrey-men,
I would doe it upon my knees; and leaving mee with a
weeping goodnight, hee made fast the doores, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
the keyes, as he was directed.</p>
                  <p>The day following the Governour entred my Prison
alone, intreating mee to confesse I was a spy, and hee
would be my friend, and procure my pardon, neither
should I lacke (intirim) any needefull thing: But I still
attesting my innocency, hee wrathfully swore I should
see his face no more, till grievious torments should make
me doe it, and leauing mèe in a rage, hee observed too
well his condition.</p>
                  <p>But withall in my audience, he commanded <hi>Areta,</hi> that
none should come neare mee, except the slave, nor no
food should be giuen mee, but three ounces of moosted
browne bread, every second day, and a <hi>Fuleto</hi> or <hi>English</hi>
Pint of water, neither any bed, pillow, or coverlet to be
allowed mee: And close up, said he, this window in his
roome, with lime and stone, stop the holes of the doore
with double Matts, hanging another locking to it, and to
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:9042:244"/>
withdraw all visible and sensible comfort from him, let
no tongue, nor feete be heard neare him, till I have my
designes accomplished: And thou <hi>Hazior</hi> I charge thee,
at thy incommings to have no conference with him, nor
at thy out goings abroad to discover him to the <hi>English</hi>
Factors, as thou wilt answere upon thy life, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
torments can be devised.</p>
                  <p>These directions delivered, and alas, too accessary to
me in the performance; my roome was made a darke-drawn
Dungeon, my belly the anatomy of mercilesse
hunger, my comfortlesse hearing, the receptacle of
sounding Bells, my eyes wanting light, a loathsome lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
in dispaire, and my ground lying body, the

his bloody and mercilesse purpose before <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
Holy dayes, lest the expiring of the twelfth day,
I should bee utterly famished, and unable to undergoe
my tryall, without present perishing, yet unknowne to
me, save onely in this knowledg, that I was confined to
die a fearefull and unacquainted death: for it is a current
custome with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that if a stranger be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
upon any suspition, he is never brought to open
tryall, and common Jaile, but clapped up in a Dungeon,
and there tortured, impoisoned, or starved to death.
Such meritorious deeds, accompany these onely titular
Christians: for the <hi>Spaniard</hi> accounteth it more to bee

called a Christian, then either to beleeve what hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth,
or to conforme himselfe to the life of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity:
yea, I sparingly avouch it, he is the worst and
baddest creature of the christian name; having no more
Religion (and lesse respective to devation) then an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall

                  </p>
                  <p>In end, by Gods permission, the scourge of my fiery
tryall opproaching; upon the forty seventh day after
my first imprisonment, and five dayes before <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas;</hi>
about two of clock in the morning, I heard the
noyse of a Coach in the fore streete, marvelling much
what it might meane</p>
                  <p>Within a pretty while I heard the locks of my Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son-doore
in opening;<note place="margin">My transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from prison to the fields to be racked.</note> whereupon bequeathing my
soule to God, I humbly implored his gracious mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and pardon for my sinnes: for neither in the former
night, nor this could I get any sleep, such was the force
of gnawing hunger, and the portending heavinesse of my
presaging soule.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile the former nine Sergeants, accompanied
with the <hi>Scrivan,</hi> entered the room without word
speaking, and carrying mee thence, with irons and
all, on their armes through the house to the street, they
laid mee on my backe in the Coach: where two of
them sat up beside me, (the rest using great silence) went
softly along by the coach side.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Baptista</hi> the Coach-man, an <hi>Indian Negro</hi>
droving out at the Sea gate, the way of the shoare
side, I was brought Westward almost a league from the
Towne, to a vine-pressehouse, standing alone amongst
Vineyards, where they inclosed mee in a roome till

day light, for hither was the Racke brought the night
before, and privily placed in the end of a Trance.</p>
                  <p>And all this secresie was used, that neither <hi>English,
French,</hi> or <hi>Flemings,</hi> should see or get any knowledge
of my Tryall, my grievous Tortures, and dreadfull dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch,
because of their trecherous and cruel proceedings.</p>
                  <p>At the breach of day the Governour <hi>Don Francisco,</hi>
and the <hi>Alcalde,</hi> came forth in another Coach: where
when arrived, and I invited to their presence, I plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for a Trench-man, being against their Law, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse

                  <p>And now after long and new Examinations, from

Confession so runne in one, that the Governour
swore, I had learned the art of memory: saying, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is it possible hee can in such distresse, and so long
a time, observe so strictly in every manner the points of
his first Confession, and I so often shifting him too and

                  <p>Well, the Gouernours interrogation and my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession

besought mee earnestly to acknowledg and confesse my

After this the <hi>Alcalde,</hi> and Scrivan being both Chaire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,

went under both my armes running on two rings of

and the lids of my knees being crushed, and the
Cords made fast, I hung so demayned, for a large

                  <p>At last the <hi>Encarnador,</hi> informing the Governour that

adjoyning stance and gave direction to teare a sunder,
the name and Crowne (as hee said) of that Heretike
King, an arch-enemy to the Holy Catholike Church:
Then the tormentor laying the right arme above the
left, and the Crown upmost did cast a cord over both
armes seven distant times: And then lying downe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his backe, and setting both his feete on my hollow-pinched
belly, he charged and drew violently with his
hands, making my Wombe suppor the force of his
feete, till the seven severall Cords combind in one place
of my arme (and cutting the Crowne, sinewes, and flesh

                  <p>Thus lay I five howers upon the Racke, between foure

all begored with blood, and cut through in every part, to
the crushed and bruised bones, I pittifully remained, still
roaring, howling, foaming; bellowing, and gnashing my

undone, and my body loosed.</p>
                  <p>True it is, it passeth the capacity of man, either sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly

lighted, and doore locked; the inquisitor after diverse
frivolous questions, demanded me if I was a Roman
Catholik, and acknowledged the Popes Supremacy.
To whom I answered, I was neither the one, or did
the other. And what power (said I,) have you to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
me of my Religion, since it is a chiefe Article, of

                  <p>The next morning, the three Ecclesiastickes returned,

and assuredly believed his revealed will in the Gospell,
professed in the Reformed Catholike Church; which
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:9042:252"/>
being confirmed by Grace, I had the infallible assurance
in my soule, of the true Christian Faith.</p>
                  <p>To these words hee answered, thou art no Christian,
but an absurd <hi>Hereticke,</hi> and without conversion, a

Sir, the nature of Charity and Religion, doe not consist
in opprobrious speeches; wherefore if you would convert

This done, they fastned a small cord about each one

<hi>Ellenors</hi> compassion; but as my miseries were multiplied,

adversity it selfe: And of all men, that man is most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,<note place="margin">An impatient mind in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is a triple torture.</note> to whom God in his troubles hath not given
Patience; for as the violent enemy of age is griefe, so is
the mindes impatiency, the arch corruptor of all our
troubles: But indeede in the weakenesse of judgement,
when men seeme lost by long affliction to themselves,
then they are often and ever neerest to God: for who
would have thought, that I who had seene so many sexs
and varieties of Religion, dispersed over the face of the

I will tell thee Christian, it was the grace of God in

had for wrongs past, no, neither (alasse) for any present

great states, decline under the selfe-same constellation of

of the inconstancy of fortune; what shall I then in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
life, and publicke pilgrimage expect, but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
calamity of this age, and the irrevocable redresse
of my miseries sustained, for this Crowne and Kingdom
of <hi>England,</hi> which shall be presently cleared: yet would
to God, I might do, as <hi>Xerxes</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> King did, that
when the <hi>Greekes</hi> had taken <hi>Sardis,</hi> the Metropole of
<hi>Lydia,</hi> he commanded one of his servants to stand before

concerning my suite) vnto Sir <hi>Thomas Coventrey</hi>
Lord keeper of <hi>Englands</hi> great Seale; and through whose
office my businesse should have passed: which order was
delivered unto him, by Mr. <hi>Iames Maxwell</hi> Knight of
the blacke Rod, and one of his Majesties Bed chamber,
in behalfe of the Lords of the upper house: the order
thus being reserved then with the Lord Keeper for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,

apprehended by command of the Governor and Magistrates
there as a Spie, whom they suspected, had of purpose beene
left behind by our Generall, and us of the Counsell of Warre,
for the Discovery of that place, and other adjacent parts:
Whereupon being secretly imprisoned in the Governours
Palace; and after serious examination of our intention;
he was without any cause done, or offered by him, most
uniustly put to the cruell Racke and tortures; besides all
other his vnspeakable miseries, which for a long time he su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained

And now to conclude this Tragical discourse, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious

wayes here extended. First, his powerfull providence
in my long and admirable preservation in Prison: hunger,

Secondly, the pittifull kindnes of his All<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Eye, in the miraculous Wonder of my Discovery,
when the perverted policy of subtile Serpents, had scele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly
suggested my concealement. Thirdly, his vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
mercy in my vnlooked-for deliverance, beeing by
hopelesse me, not thought, nor sought; and yet by his
munificence was wrought. And lastly, his gracious
goodnesse, in the recovery (after some large measure) of
my health and vse of my body againe; all praise and glory
be to his infinite Majesty therefore.</p>
