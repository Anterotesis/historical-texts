            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>I DO humbly present to Your MAJESTY a Summary of the Laws and Customes of Your ancient Kingdom of <hi>SCOTLAND, which can be no where so fitly Plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as under the Rayes of Your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Protection:</hi> I am confident it will tend to the Honour and Renoun of Your MAJESTY, and Your Princely Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, that You have Governed this Nation so long and so happily, by such just and convenient Laws, which are here offered to the view of the World, in a Plain, Rational, and Natural Method; In which, Material Justice (the common Law of the World) is in the first place orderly deduced from self evident Principles, thorow all the several private Rights thence arising: And in the next place, the Expedients of the most Polite Nation, for Ascertaining and Expeding the Rights and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of Mankind, are Applyed in their proper places; especially these which have been invented, or followed by <hi>this Nation;</hi> so that a great part of what is here offered, is common to <hi>most Civil Nations,</hi> and is not like to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to the Judicious and Sober any where, who dote not so much upon their own Customes, as to think that none else are worthy of their notice. There is not much here asserted upon meer Authority, or Imposed for no other Reason, but
<pb facs="tcp:109710:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>quia majoribus placuerunt,</hi> but the Rational Motives inductive of the several Laws and Customes, are therewith held forth: And though the Application of those common Rules, to the varietie of Cases determined by our Statutes, our ancient Customes, and the more recent Decisions of our Supream Courts, be peculiar to us; Yet even the <hi>Quadrancy</hi> of these to the common Dictates of Reason and Justice, may make them the less displeasing; and that no Nation hath so few words of Art, but that almost all our Terms are near the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Vulgar Acceptation; Yea, the Historical Part relating the Helps and Expedients for Clearing and Securing the Rights of Men out of the Word of GOD; the Moral and Judicial Law contained therein; the Civil, Canon and Feudal Laws, and many Customes of the Neighbouring Nations Digested, as they fall in with the Common Rules of Justice, may probably be acceptable to these who may, and will allow time for their perusal, <hi>a quaint and gliding Stile,</hi> much less the Flourishes of Eloquence, the ordinary <hi>Condiment and Vernish, which qualifie the pains of Reading,</hi> could not justly be expected in a Treatise of Law, which of all Subjects doth require the most <hi>Plain and Accurate Expressions;</hi> to ballance which, the Nausiating burden of Citations, are as much as can be left out.</p>
                  <p>We do not pretend to be amongst the Great and Rich Kingdoms of the Earth, yet we know not who can claim preference in Antiquity and Integrity, being of one Blood and Lineage, without mixture of any other people, and have so continued above two thousand years; during all which, no forreign Power was ever able to setle the Dominion of a Strange Lord over us, or to make us forsake our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance to Your MAJESTIEs Royal Ancestors, our Native and Kindlie Kings; Whereas, most of the other Kingdoms are Componds of Diverse Nations, and have been subjugated to Princes of different and opposite Families; and oftimes Forreigners. The great Monarchies which did design Universalitie, are all broken in pieces; and there is no Familie that can claim a just Title to Redinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grat any of them. There is no Emperor nor King, <hi>except Your Self,</hi> but knows to what other Families their Predecessors did Succeed, and when, and by what means It is evident what a mixture hath been in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> and elsewhere. This Nation hath not been obscure and unknown to the World; but the most famous Nations have made use of our Arms, and have still in grateful remembrance, retained Trophies and Monuments of our Courage and
<pb facs="tcp:109710:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Constancy. There be few Wars in <hi>Christendome,</hi> wherein we have not had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Bodies of Souldiers, Regimented and Commanded by themselves, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times general Officers Commanding them; and whole Armies of Strangers, with great Reputation and Gallantry, which did advance them above the Natives of these Countreys where they served. Neither have we wanted the fame of Learning at home and abroad, in the most eminent Professions, <hi>Divine or Humane.</hi> And as every where the most Pregnant and Active Spirits, applie themselves to the Study and practice of Law; so these that applyed themselves to that Profession amongst us, have given great Evidence of sharp and piercing Spirits, with much readiness of Conception, and dexterity of Expression; which are necessary Qualifications both of the Bench and Bar, whereby the Law of this Kingdom hath attained to so great Perfection, that it may without Arrogance be compared with the Laws of any of our neighbouring Nations, for we are happy in having so few and so clear Statutes. Our Law is most part Consuetudinary, <hi>whereby, what is found inconvenient is Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literat and forgot:</hi> Our Forms are plain and <hi>Prompt,</hi> whereby the generality of the Judicious, have with little pains much insight in our Law, and do with the more Security enjoy their Rights and Possessions, which by our publick Records are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter known then any where, by which, we may with the greatest assurance Trust our Purchase, seing no Land-Right is effectual against Purchasers by Consent or by Law, but where the ultimate perfection thereof, by Seasing or other Evident, is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Record in Registers, set apart for the several Rights, without mixture of any other, whereof there are Authentick Minute-books keeped, with the Records in each Shire and Jurisdiction, whereby with the least pains or expence, all the Rights affecting any Land within the course of Prescription, can easily be found. We are not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the Labyrinth of many and large Statutes, whereof the posterior do ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narly Abrogate, or Derogate from the prior, that it requires a great part of a life to be prompt in all these Windings, without which, no man with sincerity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, can Consult or Plead; much less can the Subjects by their own Industrie, know where to rest, but must give more implicite Faith to their Judges and Lawers, then they need or ought to give to their Divines; and we do always prefer the Sense to the subtility of Law, and do seldom trip by niecities or formalities. The greatest Fixation and Improvement of our Law hath been by the Establishment of the Supream Civil Judicature of the Kingdom, by King <hi>JAMES</hi> the fifth, in the Institution of the Colledge of Justice, consisting of fifteen ordinarie Senators, in place of the Kings daily Council, which followed His Residence and Court, and of the Lords of Session, who came in their place, and were nominated of the Estates of Parliament Ambulato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
<pb facs="tcp:109710:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the Senators of the Colledge of Justice were Invested with the powers of both, and their persons and the place of Judicature became fixed, and hath so continued near the space of an hundred and fifty Years. This Court was much improven by Your MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JESTIEs Royal Grand-Father, who <hi>delighted</hi> exceedingly in it, and honouredit frequently with His Presence while He was in <hi>Scotland:</hi> So did Your Royal Father when He came to <hi>Scotland</hi> to be Crowned: And Your <hi>MAJESTY</hi> hath owned and encouraged it more then any.</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>MAJESTY</hi> doth not demand or expect great Revenues from this Kingdom; that which we can be useful in to Your <hi>MAJESTY,</hi> is our personal Service, and our firm adherence to Your Crown and Monarchy, and to Your Royal Family, in which we have a peculiar Interest; and which no time can communicate to any of Your other Dominions, which they neither can claim, nor should invy that You are of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and hath Governed us during twenty Centuries and more, and by us You are the most Ancient King in the World, which is the most Noble and Resplendent Jewel in Your Crown; What Family on Earth can parallel that Motto, which an hundred Years ago, was Written about Your Royal Ensignes, upon Your Palace,
<q>
                        <l>— Nobis haec invicta miserunt</l>
                        <l>Centum sex proavi.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore Your Royal Family hath been betroathed to a Virgin Crown, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew another Husband; and though it hath been darkened with Clouds and Recesses, yet never was, and I hope never shall be in Widuity. The mutual Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt Your <hi>MAJESTIES</hi> Royal Family and this Nation, is a prime Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to both, which should be much incouraged and improven: Your <hi>MAJESTY</hi> without just ground of Jealousie to Your other Kingdoms, may own a peculiar Care of us; and weought to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> a singular kindness to, and confidence in Your <hi>MAJESTY,</hi> and Your Royal Successors; This might he so promoved, that Your <hi>MAJESTY</hi> might by Treaties, have Armies of this Nation abroad, Intertained without Your Charge, and ready at Your Call, as You had <hi>Dowglas</hi> Regiment in <hi>France,</hi> which might secure Your Peace at Home, and make You stand in need of less Aids from Your People. You might also have thriving Plantations abroad, if these who every year go from this Nation, to seek their Fortunes abroad, were directed and encouraged; And it is certainly a great Interest to keep the Nation at Home, in constant Affection</p>

                     <p>MY Design being to give a Description of the Law and Customes of <hi>SCOTLAND,</hi> such as might not only be profitable for Judges and Lawers, but might be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and useful to all persons of Honour and Discretion; I did resolve to Raise my Thoughts and theirs, to a distinct Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Fountains and Foundations of the Peculiar Laws of all Nations, which Common Reason makes Intelligible to the Judicious, when plainly and orderly proposed: And therefore, have always in the first place set forth, that Common Rule of material Justice, by which Mankind ought to Govern themselves, though they had no Positive Statutes or Customes; and then shewing how these are thence Introduced. I have therefore chosen the Method I thought fittest for this Purpose, and the Terms most Intelligible in common use; and have as much as I could, forborn the Terms of Art. No man can be a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109710:12"/>
Lawer in any Nation, who hath not well pondered and digested in his Mind, the Common Law of the World, from whence the Interpretation, Extensions and Limitations of all Statutes and Customs must be brought. I have therefore begun with the Common Principles of Law, and thence have laid down the Method I follow, and have Explained the general Terms, commonly made use of in Law.</p>
                     <p>There is no Term of which men have a more common (but confused) apprehension, than what Law is: and yet there be few Terms harder to be distinctly conceived or described. The clearest Conception of it I can find, is thus;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Law is the Dictat of Reason, determining every Rational Beeing to that which is congruous and convenient for its Nature and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; this will extend to the determination of indifferency of all Rational Beeings.</p>
                     <p>God Almighty, though he be accountable to, and controllable by none, and so hath the absolute freedom of his Choice; yet doth he unchangeably determine himself by his <hi>Goodness, Righteousness and Truth;</hi> which therefore make the Absolute, Soveraign, Divine Law: The same is also the Law of all Rational Creatures, by which they ought to determine and rule their free Actions; but the congruity and conveniency of their Nature affords them other Dictates of their Reason, which quadrat not with the Divine Nature; such as Adoration, Obedience, common to Angels and Men. And Reason doth determine Mankind yet further from the conveniency of his Nature and State, to be humble, penitent, careful and diligent for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himself and his kind; and therefore to be sociable, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and to do only that which were convenient for Mankind to be done, by every one in the same condition, whereof the Rule in the Gospel is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Test,
<q>
                           <l>Quodtibi fierinon vis, alteri ne feceris.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thence also are the three Common Precepts in the Roman Law, <hi>Honeste vivere, Alterum non ledere, Suum cuique tribuere;</hi> All which are evidently the common Interest and Advantage of mankind.</p>
                     <p>This is that Eternal Law which cannot be altered, being founded upon an unchangeable Ground, the congruity to the Nature of God, Angels and Men; and therefore God cannot deny himself, or act unsuitably to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perfections: And therefore it is said, <hi>Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do justly? And that it is impossible for God to lie;</hi> Not by any fatal necessity, as if he had not power and freedom enough, but because his Goodness, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Truth, are as certain by his free Choice, as are his Omnipotency and Soveraignty.</p>
                     <p>This is also called <hi>the Law of Nature,</hi> because it ariseth from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity or conveniency of Nature, and thence is known by the Light of Nature.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Correspondent to these Dictats of Reason, wherein Law consists, which are in the Understanding; There is an Inclination in the Will to observe and follow these Dictats, which is Justice: and therefore it is described, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stans &amp; perpetua voluntas suum cuique tribuendi,</hi> where, by the Will, is not understood the Faculty, but the Inclination thereof, determined by the Law, to give every one that which the Law declareth to be due; and it is divided into Distributive and Commutative Justice.</p>
                     <p>Distributive Justice, is the Inclination to retribute Rewards to the Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109710:12"/>
and Punishments to the Vitious, proportioned to their actings, which is now almost wholly devolved upon Publick Authority; little remaining, but Incouragement and Praise to the Virtuous, and Discouragement and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance to the Vitious.</p>
                     <p>Commutative Justice, is the Inclination to give every man his Right; and though the Name is taken from the Interchange of private Rights, yet it reacheth to all Prestations, which are not by way of Reward or Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>There being nothing here proposed but the private Rights of Men, it is only requisite to consider the Laws by which private Rights are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute, Conveyed or Destitute, and these are either Divine or Humane.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Divine Law is that mainly which is Written in Mans Heart, according to that of the Apostle, <hi>For when the Gentiles who have not the Law,</hi> (to wit, written in the Word) <hi>do by nature the things contained in the Law, these are a Law unto themselves, which sheweth the works of the Law written in their hearts; their conscience also bearing them witness, and their thoughts in the mean while accusing or excusing one another;</hi> This is called the Law of Nature, because it is known Naturally, either immediately, like unto these Instincts which are in the other Creatures, whereby they know what is necessary for their preservation: So the first Principles of this Natural Law are known to men, without Reasoning or Experience, without Art, Industry or Education, and so are known to men every where through the World; though they keep no Communion nor Intercourse together, which is an unanswerable demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the being of this Law of Nature. It is said to be written in the Hearts of Men, because Law useth to be written on Pillars or Tables, for certainty or conservation: So this Law is written by the Finger of God upon mans Heart, there to remain for ever. Such are the common practical Principles, that God is to be obeyed, Parents honoured, our selves defended, violence repulsed, Children to be loved, educate and provided for.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. With these common Principles, With which God hath sent Men into the World; he gave them also Reason, that thence they might by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, deduce his Law in more particular Cases; and this part of the Natural Law, is called <hi>the Light or Law of Reason.</hi> It is called by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the Candle of the Lord, searching the inward parts,</hi> Proverbs 20. verse 27.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This Law is also called Conscience, which is said in the forecited place, to bear Witness, and thereby our thoughts do either accuse or excuse one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to the Judgement or Testimony we have of our own Thoughts, as good or evil, consonant to, or dissonant from, the Law of Nature, <hi>shining in the heart.</hi> This Natural Law, as it is derived from these Principles, the nearer it is thereto, it is the clearer; and by the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate consequences it be derived, it is the surer: for as the Body in its progressive motion, from one step to another, walketh surest by the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est steps; so doth the Mind in deducing this Divine Law: whence it is, that this part of the Law of Nature is not equally evident to all men; but the more of Reason they have, the more clearness they have of it, which hath made men of Reason, especially these who have exercised themselves in the inquiry of Right, to be had in high esteem and admiration amongst men, who, though their Invention was not so eminent, yet their Judgement closed and went along with that, as having a native Obligation in it. And so many times these <hi>responsa prudentium,</hi> have been received with as much Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and more heartiness for Laws, than the Dictates of Soveraigns. <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> in his Oration, <hi>Pro Milone,</hi> Doth excellently set forth and distinguish
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109710:13"/>
                        <hi>this Natural Law, from Positive Law; for, saith he,</hi> Hac non scripta sed nata lex, quam non didicimus, accepimus, legimus verum ex natura ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa arripuimus, hausimus, expressimus, ad quam non docti, sed facti; non instituti, sed imbuti sumus, ut si vita nostra in aliquas insidias, si in vim, aut in tela, aut inimicorum, aut latronum inciderit, omnis honesta ratio esset expedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae salutis.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. This Law of Nature is also called Equity, from that Equality it keeps in all persons; and is not framed or fitted for the Interest of any, as many Laws of mens choice be; from the rigour whereof, recourse ought to be had to this Natural Equity: for though mens Laws may be profitable and ne, cessar for the most part; yet being the Inventions of frail men, there occurs many, <hi>casus incogitati,</hi> wherein they serve not. But Equity takes place, and the Limitations and Fallancies, Extensions and Ampliations of Humane Laws are brought from Equity, though Equity be taken some times for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the extremity of Humane Laws; yet it doth truly comprehend the whole Law of Nature; otherwise it could not possibly give remeid to the rigour, and extremity of positive Laws in all Cases.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Law of Nature is also termed the Moral Law, being the absolute and adequat Rule of the Manners of men, for all times, places and persons; and this denomination, it hath commonly in opposition to the Judicial and Ceremonial Law.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Law doth sometime take the Law of Nature in a most strict sense, as it excludeth the Law of Reason, and as it is founded in the Nature of man, in so far as is common with other Animals; and therefore they define it to be <hi>quod natura omnia animalia docuit,</hi> as the conjunction of Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male: or Marriage, the Procreation or Education of Children, &amp;c. But even in that Law, the Law of Nature is extended and distinguished into the Original and Primitive Law; and that which is derived thence, such, as for the most part, is the Law of Nations: and there is no doubt, but there is more of the Law of Nature founded in the rational Nature of man, as he is a rational and sociable Creature; and even that which appeareth to be in the Sensitive Nature, is truely founded in the Rational Nature; and therefore is not properly communicable unto the Beasts, who have no Law but their natural Instincts, having only some resemblance to the Law of Nature.</p>
                     <p>The Law of Nature, as it is imprest in our hearts; so in the goodness of God, it is exprest in his Word, wherein he hath not only holden forth these Sacred Mysteries, which could only be known by Revelation, as having no Principle in Nature from whence they are deducible; but also, because through sin and evil Custome, the Natural Law in mans Heart was much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, disordered and erroniously deduced: he hath therefore Re-printed the Law of Nature in a viver Character in the scripture, not only having the Moral Principles, but many conclusions thence flowing, particularly set forth. This Analogie of the Law of Nature, even in the Hearts of Heathens, and as it is set down in the Law of God, evidenceth sufficiently, that both of them proceed from the same Omniscient Author.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Beside this natural, necessar and perpetual Law, God hath also given to men voluntar and positive Laws, which, though not at the pleasure of men, yet in themselves are mutable; and as they had a beginning, so some of them had, and others of them shall have an end, when the occasion, exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and utility for which they were constitute, shall cease: such were the Ceremonial Laws, which containing a Figurative and Typical Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Worship of God, shadowing forth Christ and his Propitiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109710:13"/>
of himself; now when the Sun of Righteousness hath arisen, these shadows have flown away, and are in the Scripture repealed; in lieu where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is the outward Order of the Worship and Government of the Christian Church, and the Laws of God relating thereto, though we are to expect no change of them while Time is, and are as binding to all, to whom their Lines are gone, as the Natural Law, yet are they no part of it, for they are not written in the heart of man, nor deducible by Reason from any such Principle. Such are the Sabboth on the first day of the week, the particular Offices in the Church, their Authority and Maintainance; for though the Law of Nature doth teach, that God is to be acknowledged and adored, yet the impowering of some certain persons to be leaders in the Publick Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the fixed time thereof, either as it was under the Law, or as it is under the Gospel, cannot be reached thence, but had its beginning, and hath been altered. Some also do account Marriage, and the degrees for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in <hi>Levit.</hi> to be a positive Law of God, though they acknowledge it, not only to be given to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but to all men; yet the natural and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal aversion of Marriage in these degrees, and abhorrence of that brutish commixtion, without discretion of degrees, which is observed in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whom corrupt custome hath not so far depraved, as to forget, not only this, but most of the uncontroverted Laws of Nature, do sufficiently evince the contrair; for if Parents and Posterity be all accounted as one Degree, there is nothing prohibited by the Law of God, but the very next degree of these who are in the place of Parents, as Uncles and Aunts, or in the place of Children, as Nephews, Neices, or Brethren and Sisters, so that there can be no doubt, but the prohibition of commixtion of Ascendents and Descendents, is purely Natural.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The prime Positive Law of God, is the Judicial Law, which God by the Ministry of <hi>Moses,</hi> prescribed to the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> wherein the Lord was pleased to be the particular Law-giver, and Judge of that People whom he had chosen from among all Nations, for a peculiar People to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and to whose Inclinations it is befitted; there are not a few who esteem the Judicial Law oblieging to all Nations, mainly, because it doth not appear in the Gospel, to be abolished as the Ceremonial Laws are, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of its excellency beyond the Laws of Heathens, or other men, who might not only err in expediency, rendring their Laws unprofitable; but also might make them unjust and inconsistent with the Immutable moral Law of Nature: which Reasons do sufficiently infer, that in the constitution of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws, chief respect ought to be had to the Judicial Laws of God; and they assumed where the Inclination of the People and their condition, do not render them inconvenient. But that these Laws were accommodate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their proper temper, is evident in the Law, concerning the Bill of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorcement, which beareth, to be permitted for the hardness of their hearts, which was natural and peculiar to them, of Jealousie and bitterness against their Wives; therefore the Lord not only appointed tryal, neither natural, necessar, nor accustomed elsewhere, by those tokens of Virginity, for eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Wifes faithfulness in not giving a polluted Woman for a chast; but also the extraordinar and miraculous Tryal, by the Water of Jealousie; and therefore Christ did expresly abrogate that Law, and shew us that <hi>Moses</hi> did not command to Divorce, but for the hardness of their hearts, only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it, and did command, that when the Husband would put away his Wife, he should give her a Bill of Divorce; but it doth not follow, that the Judicial Law is in it self a Law to all Nations, or that the Lord purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it so to be: but on the contrar, it appeareth that his Purpose was only to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109710:14"/>
deliver it, for a peculiar Law to <hi>Israel,</hi> when he saith, <hi>What Nation is so great, that hath Statutes and Judgements sorighteous, as is all this Law which I set before you this day,</hi> Deut. 4. vers. 8. And again, <hi>he sheweth his Word un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jacob, his Statutes and Judgements to Israel, he hath not dealt so with every Nation, and as for his Judgements, they have not known them,</hi> Psal. 147. vers. 19. And therefore the same Law was not to <hi>Israelits</hi> and to Strangers, even to Proselytes, as appeareth in the matter of Usury and Bondage, which were allowed as to Strangers; but the former simply forbidden, and the latter li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited as to <hi>Israelits:</hi> neither is there any necessity of an abolition express of this Law in the Gospel, seing it was not given to all Nations; and it doth yet bind the <hi>Jews,</hi> so far as it doth not build upon the Ceremonial Law: And therefore that part of the Judicial Law, which is founded upon, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to the Moral Law, may be well received by other Nations, to whose Inclinations the same expediencies will agree, as most of the Criminal Laws are: And though they could suit with the frame and current of the Laws already established, yet would they be far from making up a Law to rule any Nation now, after mans Pravity hath so much increased Vice and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that which was sufficient in the simplicity of these times, would come far short.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Humane Law is that, which for Utilities sake is introduced by men, which is either by tacit consent, by consuetude or custome, or by express Will or Command of these in Authority, having the Legislative power, and these were ofttimes written, though sometimes also they were not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; as were <hi>Licurgus</hi> Laws, which not only were not written, but a Law against it, that they should not be written: Hence is the distinction of Laws, in written and unwritten, because of their Original; for, <hi>ex post facto,</hi> Customes or other unwritten Laws may be written by private persons; but they were not at first written by the Law Giver.</p>
                     <p>It is true, the Law is sometimes strictly taken in opposition to Custome, as it comprehendeth Equity or the Natural Law, and the Edicts and Statutes of Nations, and their Law givers. And sometimes more strictly, as in the Vulgar Distinction of Law, Statute and Custome; in which, Law sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth Equity, or the Common Law, as Statutes and Customes do the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar recent Laws of several Nations. And though that be only the Law of man, which is voluntar and positive, constitute by man; yet Equity and the Natural Law, in so far as it is allowed, declared and made effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual by man, is in so far accounted among the Laws of men.</p>
                     <p>The Laws of men are either common to many Nations, or proper to one Nation, or peculiar to some Places or Incorporations in the same Nation; as were the <hi>Municipal</hi> Laws in the <hi>Roman</hi> Republick; and such are still in most Nations, not only in matters of lesser moment, but in the highest matters of private Rights, as in Succession, which is diversified in many Provinces, in <hi>France, Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> as may be instanced in the Gavil kind of <hi>Kent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Law common to many Nations, is that which is commonly called, the Law of Nations, which stands in the customs owned and acknowledged by all, or at least the most civil Nations, which for the most part, are nothing else but Equity, and the Law of Nature and Reason; though in part also, there be positive Laws introduced, by common consent of Nations, and which do no less obliege these Nations, as importing their obligatory consent, then do the customs of particular Nations and Incorporations: Such are the Laws of Captivity and Bondage, of these taken in War, the safety of Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors, though more guilty of the common quarrel, than the rest of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109710:14"/>
from whom they are sent; yet for common utilities sake, while they act in, and conform to that Capacity, they are safe, otherways there could be no Commerce, orderly Indiction of War or Pacification. And therefore the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they had to do with barbarous Nations, who did not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this Law, did send their Ambassadors to their Borders, and there did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Reparation, and denunce War because they could safely go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and for the same reason (though Slavery be against the Natural Law of Liberty) yet it is received for conveniency by the Nations, being more willing to lose Liberty than Life. Such also are the Laws of Hospitality, or the mutual Trust betwixt the Host and the Guest, whom he hath willingly received in his House, whereby neither of them can act any thing prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the Life or Liberty of the other, while in that relation; though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they had just reason, and might do the same; yet the doing of it then, were a violating of the Law of Nations. But for the most part, the Law of Nations is nothing else but Equity, and the Law of Nature and Reason, which standeth as the common Rule among men, appointed of God, by which they may know, and crave each from other their Rights; and in case of refusal, may vindicate the same by force, wherein they are still regulat by the common Law of Reason, and the Customs of Nations, keeping a just proportion betwixt the Wrong and Reparation, though taken by force: And not like <hi>Draco,</hi> who made the punishment of all his Laws Death; and therefore were said to be written in Bloud, so by making the Issue of every Quarrel to be the Conquest of the debelled, and the swallowing up of all their Rights, as if they had pactioned to put them all upon the Issue of that War; whereas there is nothing in question by either Party, but the striving for Reparation of that Injury which the one owneth, and the other denyeth to acknowledge as an Injury, or refuseth Reparation thereof. This Law is chiefly understood, when the Common Law is named amongst us; though the <hi>English</hi> so name the common Current of their Civil Law, as opposite to Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute and their late Customes, which is sometimes so taken with us: and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the Common Law, we understand the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, which in some sort is common to many Nations.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The Law of each Society of People under the same Soveraign Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is called, <hi>The Civil Law, or the Law of the Citizens of that Commonwealth;</hi> though that now be appropriate to the Civil Law of the <hi>Roman</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, as the most excellent. And because of that Assinity that the Law of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath with it, as have also the Laws and Customes of the Chief Nations, to which the Victorious Arms of the <hi>Romans</hi> did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagat it, and its own worth, even after the ruine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empyre, which hath so commended it, that though it be not acknowledged as a Law, binding for its Authority; yet as a Rule, followed for its Equity: it shall not be amiss to say something here of it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> were first Governed by Kings who gave them Laws, which being Collected by <hi>Papirius,</hi> in the time of <hi>Tarquinius Superbus;</hi> were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the <hi>Papirian</hi> Law, <hi>Tarquinius</hi> and Monarchy being thrown out, the <hi>Papirian</hi> Law Collected in his Time and Name, was partaker of his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and Contempt of the People; and there was no fixed, nor written Law among the <hi>Romans,</hi> till they sent the <hi>triumviri, posthumus, Maulius</hi> and <hi>Sulpitius,</hi> to the Greek Republick, to understand the Laws of these Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, and thence to frame a Model of Government, and Laws for the <hi>Roman</hi> State, which they did, and made up the Law of the twelve Tables, which being comprehended in few Words and marrowy Sentences, all Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon twelve Tables, was fixed upon the most publick Mercat place

at <hi>Rome,</hi> that they might be easily known, and keeped in mind by all the Citizens.</p>
                     <p>These were so acceptable and satisfactory to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they have been the Foundations and Principles of all that great Body of Law, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they had; all which was ordered to that Ancient Law, as Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Limitations of it, which was done at first by parts, by the <hi>Plebisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> Laws, Inacted by the Suffrage of the People, or by the <hi>Senatus Consulta,</hi> or by the Edicts of the <hi>Pretor.</hi> or by the <hi>Responses</hi> of the <hi>Jurisprudents,</hi> who were authorized to give answer in dubious Cases; as <hi>Cornelius, Nasica, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauf. Cato, Gallus, Ariciusidius, Manlius, Scevola, Crassus, Iuventius, Ulpianus, Paulus, Julianus</hi> and others; and when the Soveraign Power was devolved upon the Emperour by their Edicts, Rescripts and Decrees, until the <hi>Roman</hi> Law increased unto so great a bulk, that there were thousands of Books of Law, in which the Brevity and Perspicuity of the twelve Tables was then lost, as now the body of them, through the injury of time has perished. But at last the Emperour <hi>Justinian,</hi> did by the pains of seventeen Select <hi>Juriscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults,</hi> pick out the Marrow of all the Ancient Laws, and digest them into some Method, into the fifty Books of the <hi>Digest or Pandects,</hi> which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have the Authour of every Law prefixed to it; he did also by <hi>Triboni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and others, Collect the Rescripts, Decrees, and all the Edicts of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, which before were more imperfectly compiled in their <hi>Theodosian Codex,</hi> and which thereafter he perfeited, and named the <hi>Justinian Codex,</hi> as Posterior Constitutions of the Emperours were gathered together in nine Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, which were called the <hi>Novel Constitutions. Justinian</hi> did also cause frame the four Books of the <hi>Institutes,</hi> as the Sums and Elements of the whole Law. But as nothing Humane is stable, shortly after this greatest perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, in the time of <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperour, who Raigned fourth after <hi>Justinian,</hi> and died in the year, 565. The <hi>Roman</hi> Empire being opprest by the Irruption of the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Longobards,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Law did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so lye under Ashes above the space of five hundred years, until a new shape of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empyre, being set up in <hi>Germany, Lothaius</hi> the Emperour, who flourished in the eleventh Century, did again revive and restore the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, which thence was every where Taught in the Schools, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged with more vast heaps of Commentaries and Treatises, then were these of the Ancient <hi>Lawers,</hi> though not claiming the like Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. In the Interim, did the Feudal Law or Customs take rise among the <hi>Longobards,</hi> and other Nations, who having expulsed out of <hi>Italy</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Empyre, were willing to change their Barbarity, and to be succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours to the <hi>Romans</hi> in Seats and Civility; and that they might maintain their Conquests, gave out all their Lands to their Souldiers and Assecls, as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices to them for their Service, and Assistance in their Wars: the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of which, and the new Interest it afforded to Soveraigns, to have all their Territories to hold of themselves; and most of their Subjects by that new relation, to become their Feudatars and Vassals, hath given the Feudal Law wings, whereby it hath spread it self over most of the World.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. In the declining also of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empyre, the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mounted himself unto the Imperial Eminence of Universal Bishop, did in imitation of the Emperours Cause, Compile the Cannon Law; and first, that part which is called <hi>Decretum,</hi> which was perfeited by <hi>Gratian</hi> the Monk, out of the Fathers, Doctors and Counsels, though much thrown and vitiat towards the Interests and Errours of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. And after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109710:15"/>
were Compyled by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth, out of the Decretal Epistles of the Popes, which <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth augmented by addition of the sixth Book of the Decretals; The first whereof, is in imitation of the Digests made of the Sentences of the ancient Lawers; and it out of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the Fathers, Doctors and Councils of the Church; and the latter, in resemblance of the <hi>Codex,</hi> compacted of the Rescripts of the Popes, and that nothing may be improportional unto the Noval Constitutions, do an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the Clementins and Extravagants. This Pontifical Law extended unto all persons and things, belonging to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and separate from the Laity, all things that may relate to Pious Uses, or which may be claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be under the protection of his Holiness, as Orphans, the Will of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functs, the matter of Marriage and Divorce, all which he had obtained to be exempted from the Civil Authority of these Soveraigns, who were devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that See. These things being holy, were not to be temerat by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane hands of Princes or free people; and so deep hath this Canon Law been rooted, that even where the Popes Authority is rejected; yet considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must be had to these Laws, not only as to these by which Church Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices have been erected and ordered, but as to these which contain many equitable and profitable Laws, which, because of their weighty matter, and being once received, may more fitly be retained than rejected.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Before we come to the Customes of <hi>Scotland,</hi> there lies this Block in the way of all Humane Laws; that seing, as hath been said, Equity and the Law of Nature and Reason is perfect and perpetual, all Laws of mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, seem not only to be dangerous, in that they may Impinge upon the perfect Law of God; but also to be useless and unprofitable, seing men may live better, and more safely by the Divine Dictats of God written in our hearts, than by the devices of men, so that it may be thought, that those, who in stead thereof, imbrace the Laws of men, may meet with the reproof of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who were said <hi>to reject God from raigning over them.</hi> This Reason is so pressing, that if the Law of Nature, and of Reason, were equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to all men, or that the Dispensers thereofcould be found so know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and so just, as men would, and ought to have full confidence and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in their Sentences, it would not only be a folly, but a fault to admit of any other Law; but the prime Interests of men being to enjoy their Rights, not only in safety and security, but in confidence and quietness of mind, that they may clearly know what is their Right, and may injoy the same: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Humane Laws are added, not to take away the Law of Nature, and of Reason, but some of the effects thereof, which are in our power. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as by the Law of Nature, man is a free Creature, yet so as he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himself, and being ingaged by the same Law of Nature he must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: so mens Laws are nothing else, but the publick Sponsions of the people, which therefore, even by the Law of Nature, they may and must perform, and therefore are they introduced.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> For clearing and condescending on the Law of Nature, and of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; such Laws can none quarrel, because they do not alter, but declare Equity, and that very necessarily, because, though Equity be very clear in its Principles, and <hi>in thesi;</hi> yet the deduction of Reason further from the Fountain, through the byass and corruption of Interest, may make it much more dubious, <hi>in hypothesi,</hi> when it comes to the Decision of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Case, in all its Circumstances; and therefore it is necessar it be so fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and cleared by Statutes and Customs, suitable thereto, that the people may be secured.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> There be many points of Rights competent to men in Equity, as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109710:16"/>
it may be more profitable for the people to forbear the pursuance of them, than to be at the trouble and expenses of the pursuit; as when Humane Laws do cut offmatters of less concernment, and in them, rathertake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the honesty of their party, than to compulsion by remeids of Law; such are the Remuneratory Obligations of Gratitude, and the inward Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of the Mind, as of Affection, Love, Kindness, &amp;c. according to the Proverb, <hi>we cannot poind for unkindness.</hi> It is not to be doubted, but there be more such obligations, than are the Obligations relating to outward performances of some palpable or sensible thing; and it might easily appear, what vexation it might breed, if not only the latter, but also the former might all be pursued, and extorted by compulsion of Law. And none can think the Law of Nature injured, because of common consent, men will spare themselves the labour to pursue those things which they may easily dispense with; and so likewise for the same reason, though by the Moral Law, we are obliged to love our Neighbour as our Selves: From whence arise Duties of Charity and Mercy, Assistance and Relief; yet for the most part, men do not compel for the negative of these Commands, but only for the contrary acts of Injury, by doing evil in stead of good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For the security of the people and anticipation of Error and Fraud, and that evident probation may be had, Men do most profitably order deeds to be done in such a palpable and plain form, as may easily appear; in which there can be no injury, seing the manner of doing these deeds, is free, and in our power: Thus, though the dispositive will of the Proprietar be sufficient to alienate any thing that is his, and to constitute the Right thereof in another; Yet by the Civil Law and custome of most Nations, delivery, or apprehension of Possession, for conveying the Right of Goods; and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing is necessar for conveying of the Rights of Lands by the Feudal Law; and so by our Customs, Assignations are not effectual to transfer Personal Rights, till Intimation follow: Our Custome also appoints Write to be made, where it is easie and ordinar to be done: and therefore as the penalty of the neglect, or contempt thereof doth exclude Witnesses, in matters of importance, and admitteth only Write, or Oath of party, in cases where Write is accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; So the <hi>Romans</hi> ordained, that because the agreements of the people, when they stood in meer Conference, that words were easie to be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by themselves or Witnesses; that therefore the parties should perfeit such Contracts by a solemn stipulation, wherein the one party did interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat, if the other did agree to such terms as he exprest, and the other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly repeated his answer, closing with him in terms: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if they did not so stipulate, they refused them Action upon naked paction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Nations for the flourishing of their Families, do otherwise dispose of their Estates and Possessions, and their Laws do order them otherways than the Law of Nature doth; for in the most part, the Heretage and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in the whole Land-rights belongs to the eldest Son, as Stem and Line of the Family; and the Parents are presumed to provide the rest of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with competent Portions; though by the Law of Nature, the Right of Succession doth belong to all: and even in this positive Law, altering the course of the Law of Nature, hath its example from the Judicial Law of God, by which the Males exclude the Females, and the eldest hath a double Portion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> According to the humours and inclinations of People, men do lay the heavier penalties upon the Transgression of such Laws as stand in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereunto, which may be altered when these inclinations alter. And
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109710:16"/>
so the Lord did frame the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> for the humors of that People, in some things permitting, without punishing the transgression of the most pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable and weighty Laws of Nature, as in Poligamy and Divorce; and also extending the proportion of Equality, observed in the Law of Nature, in Restitution and Retribution, as in Theft: hence it appears how necessar the Laws of men are; yetsurely they are most happy whose Laws are near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to Equity, and most declaratory of it: And lest altering of the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, except in cases eminently profitable, like unto these now pointed at; yea, and the Nations are more happy, whose Laws have entered by long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, wrung out from the Debates upon particular Causes, until it come to the Consistence of a fixed and known Custome, for thereby the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies and inconveniencies through a tract of Time, are experimentally seen; so that which is found in some cases convenient, if in other cases afterward it be found inconvenient, it proves abortive in the womb of Time, before it attain the maturity of a Law. But in Statutes, the Lawgiver must at once ballance the conveniencies and inconveniencies, wherein he may, and often doth fall short, and there do arise, <hi>casus Incogitati,</hi> wherein the Statute is out, and recourse must be had to Equity. But these are best which are approbato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or correctory of experienced Customs, and in a customary Law, though the people run some hazard at first of their Judges Arbitriment: Yet when that Law is come to a fulness and consistence, they have by much the advantage in this, that what custom hath changed, is thrown away, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literat without memory, or mention of it; but in Statutory Written Law, the Vestige of all the alterations remain, and ordinarily increase to such a Mass, that they cease to be Evidences, and Securities to the people, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Labyrinths, wherein they are fair to lose their Rights, if not themselves, and must have an implicite Faith, in these who cannot comprehend them without making it the work of their life.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. <hi>Our Customes,</hi> as they have arisen mainly from Equity, so they are also from the Civil Canon and Feudal Laws, from which the Terms, Tenors and Forms of them are much borrowed; and therefore, these especially (the Civil Law) have great weight, namely in cases where a custome is not yet formed; but none of these have with us the Authority of Law: And therefore are only received according to their Equity and Expediency, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum bonum &amp; equum;</hi> And though it may appear from some Narratives of our Statutes, that the Parliament doth own the Civil and Canon Law, to be our Law, as in the Revocation of King <hi>James</hi> the fourth, <hi>Parliament</hi> 1493. <hi>c.</hi> 51. where it is said, <hi>and since it is permitted by the constitution of Law, Civil and Canon, that Minors may revoke, Par.</hi> 1540. <hi>cap.</hi> 80. So likewise Nottars, Forgers of false Writs, are ordained to be punished after the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Common Law, <hi>Par.</hi> 1551. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. And in the Act establishing Religion, all Acts contrair, or Constitutions, Canon, Civil, or Munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, are abrogated, <hi>Par.</hi> 1567. <hi>cap.</hi> 31. Yet these amount to no more, then that these Laws are an example; after the similitude whereof, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proceeded. And though in the cases of Falshood, the punishment be assumed as in the Civil Law, which will make that a part of our Law, it will not infer that in so far it was our Law before, much less in the whole. And there is reason for the Abrogation of the Canon Law, at the establishing of the Protestant Religion; because in the Popish Church, it was held as an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative Law: but since it is only a Law as to these Cases, that were acted by it when it was in vigour; and in the rest only as our Customes assume some particulars thereof, according to the weight of the matter: But for the full Evidence of the Contrair, there is an express and special Statute, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109710:17"/>
this Kingdom subject only to the Kings Laws, and no other Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns Laws, <hi>Par.</hi> 1425. <hi>cap.</hi> 48. <hi>Par.</hi> 1503. <hi>cap.</hi> 79. Yea, the Law of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> regulats the Succession, and Rights of <hi>Scottish</hi> men in <hi>Scotland,</hi> though dying abroad, being resident there, as was found in the case of Collonel <hi>Hendersons</hi> Children, who having died in <hi>Holland,</hi> Legatted upon Heretable Bonds, according to the custome there; yet they were found not to be conveyed by Testament, but belonging to his Heirs, according to the Law of <hi>Scotland, Dury,</hi> 9. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1623. The like betwixt <hi>Melvil</hi> and <hi>Drummond, Dury,</hi> 3. <hi>July</hi> 1634. and lately, in the case of the Executors of <hi>Williami Schaw,</hi> Factor at <hi>London,</hi> dying there, it was found, that a Nuncupative Testament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in <hi>England,</hi> being contrair to the Law of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which admits of none such, was null, and the nearest of Kin preferred to the Executor, and universal Legatar named there, <hi>January</hi> the 19. 1665. <hi>Schaw contra Lewens;</hi> but as to the manner of Probation, or Subscription, the Law of the Place Regulates. <hi>Dury,</hi> 11. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1627. <hi>Falconer contra</hi> the Heir of <hi>Beatty,</hi> and the 27. <hi>July</hi> 1623. <hi>Gordoun contra Morley,</hi> 15. <hi>Feb.</hi> 1630. <hi>Harper contra Jaffray.</hi> So a Bond by an <hi>English</hi> man to a <hi>Scottish</hi> man, residing there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the Style of <hi>England,</hi> payment thereof was found probable by Witness, and by the Oath of the Cedent against the Assignay, 28. <hi>June,</hi> 1666. <hi>Mcmorlan contra Melvil;</hi> yet a Bond granted by <hi>Scottish</hi> men to an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> man in <hi>England,</hi> found regulate by the Law of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and not to be taken away by Witness, being after the Style of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Registrable in <hi>Scotland, Decemb.</hi> 8. 1664. <hi>Scot contra Henderson</hi> and <hi>Wilson.</hi> But the Law of <hi>England</hi> and other Forraign Nations, is matter of Fact to us, probable by the Declaration of the Judges there. <hi>January</hi> 18. 1676. <hi>Cunningham con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Brown.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Law of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as of all other Nations, at first, could be no other, than <hi>equum &amp; bonum,</hi> Equity and Expediency; for it is not to be supposed, that any Nation at their first association and owning of a Government, did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point positive Laws, nor could they have Customes anterior to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution; and yet it is necessarily implyed, that they must submit to, and be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by a Law, which could be understood no other, than what their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Authority should find Just and Convenient. It may be some Cities at their first Constitutions, might have enacted Laws; but it cannot be found in all the Records of Antiquity, that ever any Nation or Countrey did so, whatsoever be said of the <hi>Salique</hi> Law of the <hi>French,</hi> which they hold so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and fundamental: It is either fictious or long posterior to their constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, into a Nation. And therefore, as in Arbitriments, parties are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to submit themselves to Arbiters, <hi>Secundum Arbitrium boni viri;</hi> So Nations of old submited to their Princes, choosing rather to refer their Interests and Differences to the Determination of their Soveraign, than that every one should be a Judge to himself, and should take and hold by force, what he conceived to be his Right, without any Superiour Judge than himself to appeal to, and thereby live in perpetual War: whence Government neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily implys in the very beeing thereof, a yielding and submitting to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Soveraign Authority, in the differences of the People, though one, or either party should conceive themselves injured, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by private opinion may give place to publick Authority, although they had natural power, sufficient to withstand the same; otherways they behooved to dissolve Authority and Society, and return to the Soveraignity of their private judgement, and their natural force, from which they did flie unto the Sanctuary of Government; which though it may sometimes err, yet can
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109710:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be nothing like to these continual errors, when every one owns himself as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Judge in his own Cause.</p>
                     <p>Next unto Equity, Nations were ruled by Consuetude, which declareth Equity and constituteth Expediencies. In the third place, positive Laws of Soveraigns became to be accustomed; Customes always continuing, and proceeding, so that every Nation under the name of Law, understand their ancient and uncontroverted Customs, time out of mind, or their first and Fundamental Law: So the <hi>Romans</hi> accounted their Laws of the twelve Tables, and when they did express any thing to be <hi>ipso jure,</hi> they meaned it to be such, by that ancient Law, in opposition to their recent Customs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by their Pretors and Constitutions of their people, Senat and Princes. The <hi>English</hi> also, by their Common Law, in opposition to Statute and recent Customs, mean their ancient and unquestionable Customs. In like manner we are ruled in the first place, by our Ancient and Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial Customs, which may be called our Common Law, though sometimes by that name, is understood Equity, which is common to all Nations; or the Civil <hi>Roman</hi> Law, which in some fort is common to very many. By this Law is our Primogenitur, and all degrees of Succession, our Legittime Portions of Children, Communion of Goods betwixt Man and Wife, and the division thereof at their death; the Succession of the nearest Agnats, the Terces of Relicts, the Life-rent of Husbands by the Courtesie, the exclusion of Deeds on Death-bed, which are anterior to any Statute, and not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in any, as being more solemn and sure than these.</p>
                     <p>In the next place are our Statutes, or our Acts of Parliament, which in this are inferiour to our ancient Law, that they are lyable to Defuetude, which never Incroaches on the other. In this, we differ from the <hi>English,</hi> whose Statutes of Parliament, of whatsoever Antiquity, remain ever in Force till they be repealed, which occasions to them many sad debates (publick and private) upon old forgotten Statutes. But with us, the Lords of Session, being, by their Institution, Authorized with Power, to make Rules and Statutes, to be observed, in the manner and order of Proceeding, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of Justice, <hi>Par.</hi> 1537. <hi>cap.</hi> 43. <hi>Par.</hi> 1540. <hi>cap</hi> 93. Their Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are final and irrevocable, when solenmly done, <hi>in foro contradictorio;</hi> and thereby, recent Custome or Practique is established, both by their Acts of Sederunt and Decisions, which extend, not only to the Interpretation of Acts of Parliament, but to the Derogation thereof; especially so far as concerns the Administration of Justice, which is specially committed to them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all the old Acts of Parliament, concerning the forms of Process, are in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetude, and in several points more recent Statutes; for instance, albeit by the Act of Parliament, 1621. <hi>cap.</hi> 81. Reductions of Infeftments are appointed to be sustained by exception or reply; yet the Lords seeing that this is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the necessar and ordinar form of Process, whereby Rights cannot be annulled or reduced, till the parties and their authors be called, that the same maybe first produced, therefore they do not take away Infeftments by exception or reply, notwithstanding of the said Statute: But there is much difference to be made betwixt a custome by frequent Decisions, and a simple Decision, which hath not like force, especially if it be invested with many Circumstances of Fact. But such are more effectual, if they be in any abstract point of Law. Yet frequent agreeing Decisions, are more effectual than Acts of Sederunt themselves, which do easily go into Desuetude. Where our ancient Law Statutes, and our recent Customs and Practiques are defective, recourse is had to Equity, as the first and universal Law, and to expediency, whereby Laws are drawn in consequence, <hi>ad similes casus;</hi> but if it appear,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109710:18"/>
that such cases have been of purpose omitted by the Parliament, the Lords will not extend the same, as albeit by the Act of Parliament, 1621. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. Composition to Superiours for receiving Apprisers, be appointed, and the same in the next Act omitted, as to Adjudgers. Therefore the Lords pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming thence, from the propinquity of these Acts, that such compositions were omitted of purpose, they would not extend the benefite of the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to a composition in Adjudications. <hi>Dury,</hi> 21. of <hi>July,</hi> 1636. <hi>Greirson contra Closburn,</hi> but now it is extended to Adjudications; that in these, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour hath a composition by the Act of Parliament, 23. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1669. How far the Civil, Common, or Feudal Law have place with us, hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready said. But it is not to be thought, that the Feudal Law is our proper Law, as <hi>Craig</hi> relates, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>dig.</hi> 8. <hi>sect. per.</hi> there being scarce any thing as a Common, Feudal Law, but it is Local and customary to every place, and doth not extend to the half of our Rights: <hi>Craig</hi> doth very well observe, near that place, that these Books called <hi>Regiam Majestatem,</hi> are no part of our Law, but were compyled for the Customs of <hi>England,</hi> in 13. Books, by the Earl of <hi>Chester,</hi> and by some unknown and inconsiderate hand, stollen thence, and resarcinate into these four Books, which pass amongst us; which though they be mentioned, to be revised and reformed with our former ancient Laws, <hi>Par.</hi> 1425. <hi>cap.</hi> 54. <hi>Par.</hi> 1487. <hi>cap.</hi> 115. yet these do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them, as already become our Laws; but as such, as by alteration thereof, may become our Law.</p>
                     <p>The Law of <hi>Scotland</hi> in its nearness to Equity, plainness and facility in its Customes, Tenors and Forms, and in its celerity and dispatch in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration and Execution of it, may be well parralleled with the best Law in <hi>Christendom,</hi> which will more plainly appear, when the proportion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquity of it to Equity shall be seen.</p>

Before we come to the Common Principles of Law, this Question would be resolved, <hi>Whether Law may, or should be handled as a Rational Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, having Principles from whence its Conclusions may be deduced?</hi> Most Lawers are for the Negative part, commonly esteeming Law, especially the positive and proper Laws of any Nation, incapable of such a deduction, as being dependent upon the will and pleasure of Law-givers, and introduced for Utilities sake, and so frequently alterable, that they cannot be drawn from prior common Principles, and keep the artificial method of rational Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines; and therefore they rest satisfied with any order, whereby the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Heads and Titles may be found, whereunto the confused Order of the Civil Law (which is the greatest blemish in it) hath been instrumental; for there is nothing more ordinar for learned men, than to maintain their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and through their respect to them, not to be sensible of their tollerable Errors. There is little to be found among the Commentars and Treatises upon the Civil Law, arguing from any known Principles of Right; but all their Debates is a Congestion of the Contexts of the Law, which exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nauseates delicate ingines, finding much more work for their memory, than judgement in taking up and retaining the Lawgivers Will, rather than search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his reason; yet there are not wanting of late of the learnedest Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who have thought it both feasible and fit, that the Law should be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Rational Discipline, and have much regrated that it hath not been effectuated; yea, scarce attempted by any, as <hi>Duarrenus, de ratione di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendi docendi<expan>

wholly in these Practical Principles, which are created in, and with the Soul of Man, and arise in him without reasoning or debate, as naturally as the Heat doth from the Fire, or the Light from the Sun: and in these Rules of Righteousness, which are deduced thence by evident Reason, so that Law is Reason it self, as it is versant about the Rights of men, and therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Law of Reason: and can there be any thing more congruous to a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Discipline, than Reason it self, and its Principles?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> God in his Goodness hath given man more radiant Rays of Reason, and preserved it more after his Fall, about his Rights, <hi>meum &amp; tuum,</hi> than in any other Science or Knowledge, which for the most part are dubious and conjectural, and attainable only with great pains: but in the matters of Right, a man of Reason, though without Education, if not blinded or by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assed with Affection or Interest, or marred with the Statutes and Customes of men, which are but as their Contracts and matters of Fact to him, would be able to discern right from wrong, though he cannot be so distinct, as by reflecting on his own Knowledge, to take up, and hold forth the Grounds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he doth proceed, or to reach matters of Intricacy or Difficulty, which require <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>As to the difficulties which seem to arise from the variety and multiplication of positive Laws, it will say nothing; for seing positive Law is only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare Equity, or make it effectual, and in some cases to lay aside the effects of it, for the profite of man now in his lapsed estate, it may be easily order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by bringing it to the parts of Equity, whereunto it doth relate; and as a mans body may well be described, though it be not naked, and in its pure naturals, and have its hair cut and ordered, and ornaments upon it; all which will fall to be described as Appendicles, to the several parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which they adorn: for, Equity is the body of the Law, and the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of men are but as the ornaments, and vestiture thereof; and in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of every part of it, it will most fitly fall in: But the best demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of this will be occular, by delineation of Equity and positive Law together.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The Principles of Law are such as are known without arguing, and to which the judgement upon apprehenosin thereof, will give its ready and full assent; such as God is to be adorned and obeyed, Parents to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and honoured, Children to be loved and entertained; and such are these common Precepts which are set forth in the Civil Law, to live honestly, to wrong no man, and to give every man his Right: but here we shall speak of the most general Principles, which have influence upon all the Rights of men, leaving the more particular ones to the Rights flowing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</p>
                     <p>The first Principles of Equity are these, that God is to be obeyed by man. 2. That man is a free creature, having power to dispose of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and of all things, in so far as by his obedience to God he is not restrained. 3. That this freedom of man is in his own power, and may be restrained by his voluntar ingagements, which he is bound to fulfil, or take them up more Summarly. The first principles of Right are Obedience, Freedom and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.</p>
                     <p>There are also three prime Principles of the positive Law, whose aim and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109710:19"/>
terest is the profite and utility of man, as the Natural Law is, <hi>in equo,</hi> so the positive Law is, <hi>in bono,</hi> or <hi>utili;</hi> and upon those two legs doth Justice move, in giving every man his Right: If man had not fallen, there had been no distinction betwixt <hi>bonum</hi> and <hi>equum;</hi> nor had there been anything more profitable, than the full following of the Natural Law: but man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now depraved, and wanting Justice, or that willingness to give every man his Right, and apt to fraud or force; therefore, in this estate it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for him, to quite something of that which by equity is his due, for peace and quietness sake, rather than to use compulsion and quarrelling in all things, and to find out expedients, and helps to make equity effectual: And therefore, to make up societies of men, that they may mutually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend one another, and procure to one another their Rights, and also to set clear limits to every mans Property, and to maintain Traffick and Commerce among themselves and with others; so that the three Principles of Positive Law, may be Society, Property and Commerce. The Principles of Equity are the efficient cause of Rights and Laws; the Principles of Positive Law, are the final causes or ends, for which Laws are made, and Rights constitute and ordered, and all of them may aim at the maintenance, flourishing and Peace of Society, the security of Property, and the freedom of Commerce, and so the Narratives of Statutes, do commonly bear the motives introducto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, towards some of these Heads.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. <hi>Obedience</hi> is that submission and sequacity of the mind and will of man, to the Authority and Will of his Maker, immediately oblieging without any tye upon him by himself, intimate to him by the Law of Nature, Light of Reason, and the Conscience, whereby man distinguisheth betwixt Right and Wrong, betwixt what is Duty, and what is not Duty; hence do arise these Obligations upon man, which are not by his own consent or ingagement, nor by the Will of Man, but by the Will of God; and therefore, these are fitly called <hi>Obediential Obligations.</hi> The first and most general of these, is, <hi>To Love the Lord our God with all our heart, and our Neighbour as our Selves; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>hangeth all the Law and the Prophets,</hi> Matth. 22. vers. 40. which is a clear demonstration from his Mouth, of the dependence of the Moral Law, upon this Principle: such are also the Obligations betwixt Husband and Wife, Parents and Children, and the Obligations of Restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Reparation, and Remuneration; in all which we are ingaged, not by our will and consent; and such are the Obligations, which the <hi>Civilians</hi> call <hi>Quasi ex contractu,</hi> because they find them Obligatory, and yet not by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and not adverting this their rise from Obedience, reduce them to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts by <hi>a quast.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="19">19. Where <hi>Obedience</hi> ends, there <hi>Freedom</hi> begins, and man by Nature is Free in all things, where this Obedience has not tyed him, until he obliege him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. It is a great mercy to man, that God hath oblieged him only in a few necessar moral duties, and has left him free in much more, without any tye upon him, as to the matter, but with a liberty, <hi>ad contradictoria,</hi> that he may do or not do; and <hi>ad contraria,</hi> that he may do this or the contrair, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding that whatsoever he do (even where he is free) be ordered and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the Glory of God. It hath been the opinion of some, both Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pious, that there is nothing indifferent, <hi>in actu exercito;</hi> or as it is invested with the Circumstances, but that then every thing is a duty or a sin, and that because all things must be done to the Glory of God, and to mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al edification, from whence there is no exception, and so are not free; that we <hi>must make account of every idle word;</hi> and that we are oblieged, <hi>to try all things, and to hold that which is best:</hi> These Reasons indeed conclude, that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109710:19"/>
there is nothing free, as to this contradiction, either to be done to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, or not, and to Edification and Use, or not; but do not conclude that there is duty, or necessity in the matter of the Action it self, of which, either part of the contradiction may be chosen, so that either part be useful and ordered to the Glory of God, as saith the Apostle, <hi>He that observeth a day, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth it to the Lord, and he that observeth not, doth so to the Lord.</hi> And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife in that undenyable instance of Marriage, wherein the Apostle debating of the conveniency to Marry, or not to Marry, doth conclude so, <hi>that he that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth doth well, but he that Marrieth not doth better;</hi> whereby both parts of the contradiction are approven; and that which is less profitable, is said <hi>to be well done:</hi> Therefore, there is a great difference betwixt duty which is necessar, and wherein we are oblieged, though we mistake or be wilfully ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant by the very weight of the matter, and absoluteness of the Command, wherein the ordering of what is forbidden to Gods Glory, will not justifie, as <hi>we may not do evil, that good may come of it;</hi> as those who killed the Apostles, were far from being justified, though they thought <hi>they did God good service thereby.</hi> These things are, <hi>bona honesta, &amp; mala inhonesta;</hi> but matters of expediency, are but <hi>bona utilia,</hi> or, <hi>mala inutilia,</hi> and not <hi>inhonesta;</hi> and therefore, our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in these, is that which we conceive <hi>most to be for the Glory of God, and good of our selves and others;</hi> but if we do mistake, and choose that which is less expedient for these ends, we are free. God seemeth to do with men, as Princes do with their Ambassadors, to whom they give some express instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, wherein they have no latitude in their Negotiations, and for the rest to do as they shall judge most fit upon the place, wherein, if acting <hi>bona fide,</hi> they mistake, and do not that which is most fit, they are not culpable. So man being sent into the World to behold the Works of God, and to Glorifie him, for doing whereof, he hath some Rules written in his Heart by the Law of Nature, and in the Word of God, and for the rest, is allowed to do as he conceiveth most conducible thereto, <hi>that whether heeat, or drink, or whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever else he do, he do all to the glory of God.</hi> It were a sad Rack to the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men, if their errors and mistakes in the matters of expediency, were to lyeas a guilt upon their Consciences, but that <hi>bona fides,</hi> or, <hi>conscientia illesa,</hi> so much spoken of in the Law, is that which cleareth and acquitteth men in such mistakes.</p>
                     <p>From this Freedom doth arise, not only our Personal Freedom and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereby men are <hi>sui juris;</hi> but also their power of the disposel of other things within their reach, or that <hi>Dominion</hi> (which God hath given them) <hi>over the Creatures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="20">20. As Freedom began, where Obedience ended; so Ingagement begins where Freedom ends; it being our voluntar oblieging of our selves, where by Nature we are Free; every such Obligation, is a diminution of that Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for thereby, we are either restrained from that power of disposel of the Creatures, or may be constrained to some performances contrair to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Liberty. Some hold it not lawful for us, <hi>To give away our Native Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doom, in whole, or in part, or to bind our selves where God has left us free, and that such Ingagements, except where they are profitable for us, or for an equivalent cause, are not obligatory;</hi> which shall be more proper to debate, when we come to the Obligations by Paction, Promise, or Contract, all which do arise from the Principle of Ingagement; but it shall be sufficient here, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with the Law, that there is nothing more Natural, than to stand to the Faith of our Pactions; This much for the <hi>Common Principles of Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="21">21. As to the Object thereof, the formal and proper Objects of Law, are the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109710:20"/>
Rights of men; a Right is a power given by the Law, of disposing of things, or exacting from persons that which they are due; this will be evident, if we consider the several kinds of Rights, which are three, our Personal Liberty, Dominion, and Obligation; Personal Liberty, is the power to dispose of our Persons, and to live where, and as we please, except in so far, as by Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or Ingagement we are bound: Dominion is the power of disposal of the Creatures in their Substance, Fruits and Use: Obligation is that which is correspondent to a Personal Right, which hath no proper Name, as it is in the Creditor, but hath the Name of Obligation, as it is in the Debitor; and it is nothing else but a legal tye, whereby the Debitor may be compelled to pay, or perform something, to which he is bound, by obedience to God, or by his own consent and ingagement, unto which Bond the Correlate in the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor is the power of exaction, whereby he may exact, obtain, or compel the Debitor to pay or perform what is due, and this is called a personal Right, as looking directly to the person oblieged; but to things indirectly, as they belong to that person; So Dominion is called a real Right, because it respecteth things directly; but persons as they have medled with these things, by which it is clear, that all Rights consist in a Power or Faculty, the Act whereof is Possession, Injoyment, or Use, which is a matter of Fact, and no point of Right, and which may be, where no Right is, as Right may be, where these are not.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>LIBERTY</hi> is that Natural Power which man hath of his own person, whence a Free Man is said to be <hi>suae potestatis, in his own power,</hi> and it is defined in the Law, to be a Natural Faculty, to do that which every man pleaseth, unless he be hindred by Law or Force.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That there is such a Right, distinct from the Dominion of the Creatures, and from Obligation, it is evident from this, that it can be referred to none of these, and yet is the most native and delightful Right of man, without which, he is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of no other Right; so Bondage exeemeth man from the account of persons, and brings him rather in among things, <hi>quae sunt in Patrimonio nostro,</hi> and the incroachments upon, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries against the Right of Liberty, of all others, are the most bitter and attro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; for the non-performance of Obligations, or Duties to us, or the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, or detaining of the things of our Property, are not to be compared with the laying violent hands on our persons.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This Right ariseth from that Principle of Freedom, that man hath of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109710:21"/>
himself, and of other things beside man, to do in relation thereto, as he pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, except where he is tyed thereunto by his Obedience or Ingagement, and this part of it which concerneth Personal Freedom, is maintained by that Common received Principle in the Law of Nature, of self-defence and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, for as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith in his Oration, <hi>Pro Millone, Haec &amp; ratio doctis &amp; necessitas barbaris, &amp; mos Gentibus, &amp; feris natura ipsa prescripsit, ut omnem semper vim quacun<expan>

                     <p n="4">4. Opposite unto Liberty are Restraint and Constraint, Restraint hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth man to be where, and go whither he will; and Constraint forceth him to do what he will not; Restraint is exercised by Imprisonment and Captivity, or in the hinderance of the use of things necessar for Life, as Meat, Drink, Sleep, &amp;c. Constraint is exercised by Beating, Wounding, or the like Force upon the Body, or the fear of it, whereby any thing is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted.</p>

Though Liberty be the most precious Right, yet it is not absolute, but limited; <hi>First,</hi> by the Will of God, and our Obediential Obligations to him, and to men by his Ordinance; and so though man hath power of his own person, yet hath he no power of his own Life, or his Members, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of them at his pleasure, either by taking away of his Life or Amputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or hurting of any Member by himself, or by giving power to any other so to do, unless it be necessary for preserving the whole, but he is naturally oblieged to God to maintain his Life: so likewise men may be restrained, or constrained by others, without Incroachment upon the Law of Liberty, in the pursuance of other Obediential Obligations; as a Husband hath power to restrain his Wife, from her Liberty of going where she will, and may keep her within the bounds of conjugal Society; so may Parents restrain their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and also constrain them to the performance of moral duties, and that without any Ingagement or Law; we may also without any injury, restrain a furious person, or one who is inferring violence to himself, in his Life or Limbs, because this is not against any Act of his lawful Liberty, and is done as a duty in us, of Love and Mercy: But in matters of utility and profite, where the Natural Liberty is not hemmed in with an Obligation, there, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less by his own delinquence or consent, man cannot justly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained, much less constrained upon pretence of his utility or profite; for Liberty, as far preferable to profite, and in the matter of utility, every man is left to his own choice, and cannot without injury to God and Man, be hindred to do what he pleaseth, or be compelled to do what he pleaseth not, in things wherein he is free, as <hi>Grotius</hi> saith, <hi>De jure belli, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. <hi>pag.</hi> 2. <hi>Non enim si quid alicui ntile est, id statim mihi licet, ei per vim impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere, nam his qui rationis, habent usum, libera esse debet utilium multilinimve ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio, nisi alterijus quodam in eos quaesitum sit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Liberty may be diminished or taken away by our Delinquence, in the way of punishment, for seing it is a Right in our own power; as Goods and Debts may be forfaulted by our Delinquence, so may our Liberty, in whole or in part.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> our Ingagements do commonly import a Diminution of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Liberty, but much more, of that Natural Liberty of things without us; whence it is that the Law alloweth personal Execution or Restraint, and Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration of the Debitors Person, until he do all the deeds that are in his power, for the satisafction of his Creditor.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Liberty is diminished by subjection unto Authority; for as man by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109710:21"/>
is a free creature in his own power, he doth then become in the power of others; whether it be in the power of a Society, where the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage of the plurality is preferred to the natural and free choice of particular persons, or whether the Authority be stated in a few persons, or in one So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign?</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Liberty is wholly taken off by Bondage, Slavery, or Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which is Diametrically opposite to Liberty; for as Liberty is that power, by which men are <hi>sui juris,</hi> so by Servitude, they became <hi>alieni juris,</hi> in the power of another, unto whom they became as the rest of their Goods in their Patrimony, and are possessed by them, and may be gifted, legated, sold, and otherways disposed of at their pleasure, <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>ff. de statu hominis, l. qui in servitute, ff. deregulis juris,</hi> so that Masters had among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every where, power of Life and Death of their Slaves, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>ff. de his qui sunt sui vel alieni juris,</hi> though the constitutions of the Emperors did restrain that power to moderate chastisement, as appears by the former Law, §. 2. and next ensuing Servants being wholly their Masters, they could have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their own, <hi>l. acquiritur de acquirendo rerum Dominio;</hi> so that their <hi>peculium,</hi> which their Masters committed to them, to Negotiat with, was wholly in their Masters power, and might be taken away at his pleasure, <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>ff. de peculio,</hi> neither could they be lyable to any Obligation, <hi>l. nec servus</hi> 41. <hi>ff. de peculio;</hi> neither could there be any Civil Action for, or against them, <hi>l. in personam, ff.</hi> 22. <hi>de regulis juris,</hi> neither could they be Witnesses, Procuratoss, or Arbiters, <hi>l. cum serv. ff. de regulis juris;</hi> yea, and they were accounted as no body, or as dead men, <hi>l.</hi> 32. <hi>de Reg.

                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. Bondage was introduced by the Law of Nations, and it is among the positive Laws of Nations, settled by common Consuetude, and it took first place in the these who were taken in War, who being under the power of their enemies Sword, did loss their Liberty in lieu of their Life; such also were these, who sold their Liberty, and gave it up, and were content to be perpetual Slaves, as were the <hi>Jewish</hi> Bond-men, whose ears were pierced with an Aul, as the solemnity of their perpetual and willing Servitude, the offspring of Servants remained in their servile condition; and by the Custome of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, it followed the Mother and not the Father, <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus sequitur ventrem,</hi> and in some cases, both by the Judicial Law, and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Law, free Parents might sell and give their Children into Bondage.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Bondage,</hi> though contrair to the nature of Liberty, yet it is lawful; Liberty being a Right alienable, and in our disposel, so that the Natural Law constitutes us free, but puts no necessity on us, so to continue; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Servitude is both approven in the Old Testament; and in the New, it is cleared against that obvious Objection, that being <hi>made free by Christ, we should not become the servants of men,</hi> to which the Apostle answereth, <hi>Art thou called, being a servant (or slave) continue so, for nevertheless thou art Christs free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi> But yet Christian Lenity and Mercy, hath almost taken away Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, except amongst the <hi>Spaniards, Portugals,</hi> and other Christian Nations, bordering upon the <hi>Turks,</hi> where, because the <hi>Turks</hi> do extreamly exercise Slavery, especially upon Christians, their neighbours do the like, that they may have Slaves to exchange with Slaves: little of Slavery remains elsewhere among Christians, except the <hi>Ascriptitii,</hi> who are not absolutely Slaves, but they and their Posterity are bound to several Services, to Ferms and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, to which, by reason thereof only, they are in Bondage, and their Masters cannot apply them to other Ferms, or to other Services, but those are fixed to, and follow those Ferms, and they are convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:109710:22"/>
therewith; such are the <hi>English</hi> villains, but in <hi>Scotland</hi> there is no such thing.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. There was formerly a kind of Bondage, called Man-rent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by free persons became the men or Followers of these who were their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons and Defenders, and these were rather <hi>in clientele,</hi> than in Bondage, but it is utterly abolished, both by Act of Parliament, 1457. <hi>cap.</hi> 78. and by Custome.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. From Servitude arise Manumission, and the Right of Patronage; Manumission is the dimission of Servants, and the making of them Libertines, whereby they become Free, but with remaining thankfulness, reverence, and obsequiousness, and some other Duties and Offices, to their former Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, then become their Patrons, and if in these they failed, they forefault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their new acquired Liberty, and returned to their former condition of Servitude.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. In these therefore, stood the Right of Patronage, and from this condition of Libertines, arose that distinction of men, into these who were always free, who were called <hi>ingenui,</hi> and in these who were bound, who were called <hi>servi,</hi> and in these of a middle condition, who having been Slaves, became Free, and so were neither fully free, but had some duties ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them to their Patrons, neither were fully bound as Servants.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. The Servants which now retain that name, are judged free persons, and have at most but hired their labour and work to their Masters for a time, which is a Contract betwixt them; of which afterward.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. The Customs of this Nation have little peculiar, in relation to Liberty directly, but the injuries done against the same, especially constraint, fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the consideration of Delinquencies, and are so punished.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> had express Laws, <hi>de libero homine exhibendo,</hi> and <hi>de privatis carceribus inhibendis,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> have their Action of false Imprisonment, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining with much exactness, in what cases Imprisonment is lawful, and in what not, and how remeidable.</p>
                     <p>It is also provided in the Judicial Law, against stealers of men; but amongst us, as these Crimes are very rare; so, if unlawful Restraint, or unjust Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment should fall out, it remains among Delinquencies to be punished according to the Circumstances and Attrocity, and according to Equity, and thence also a civil Action for damnage and interest ariseth.</p>

                        </gap> of Dominion and Property, do therefore come under consideration next unto Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The same Right as it is in the Creditor, it is called a Personal Right; but as it is in the Debitor, it is called an Obligation, Debt, or Duty, which is retained as the more proper name, <hi>Inst. de Obligationibus in principio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obligation</hi> is a Legal Tye, by which we may be necessitate, or constrained to pay, or perform something; this Tye lyeth upon the Debitor, and the power of making use of it, in the Creditor, is the personal Right it self, which is a power given by the Law, to exact from persons that which they are due.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Obligations</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> are distinguished in four kinds; in Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>ex contractu vel, quasi ex contractu maleficiovel, quasi ex malificio,</hi> which distinction insinuats no reason of the cause, or rise of these distinct Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which is requisite in a good distinct division; and therefore, they may be more appositly divided, according to the Principle, or Original from whence they flow; in Obligations Obediential and by Ingagement, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Conventional, or by the will of God, and by the will of man.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Obediential Obligations</hi> are these, which are put upon men by the will of God, not by their own wills, and so are Natural, as introduced by the Law
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:109710:23"/>
Nature, before any addition made thereto by Ingagement, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> which we are bound to perform solely by our obedience to God, as Conventional Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations are, such as we are bound by, and through our own will, Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Consent.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Obediential Obligations are either by the will of God immediatly, or by the mediation of some fact of ours; such are Obligations by Delinquence, whereby we become bound to reparation and satisfaction to the party injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and are lyable in punishment to God, which may be exacted by these who have his Warrand for that effect; of these Obediential Obligations, there be some which tye us to God alone, whereby there is no right constitute in man to exact the same as his own due, or any Warrand or Command given him by God to exact them on his behalf; and some, though they constitute not a right in man, yet man is commanded and warranted to vindicate them; as the Crimes of Witchcraft, Blasphemy, Beastiality and the like, for which there is an express Command to inflict punishment, though there be no injury done therein to man, of which there could be any reparation; for the Command, <hi>Thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live,</hi> takes place, though the Witch have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no Malifice against the Life or Goods of man: But these Obligations being among the publick Rights, belongs to the Magistrate, on whom is devolved that Authority, to vindicate for God, as his Vicegerent: We shall not here insist on them, nor on these other Obligations, whereby no right of execution is constitute in man for vindication, &amp; <hi>quae solum Deum habent ulto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi> (being only now about the private Rights of men) such are the Love and Fear we owe to God, and dependence on, and confidence in him.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. We shall therefore insist only on the Obediential Obligations that are betwixt Husband and Wife, Parents and Children, Tutors and Pupils, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators and Minors, and the Obligations of Restitution and Remuneration, and the Obligations of Reparation of Delinquence, and damnage, and then we shall proceed to Conventional Obligations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> There is another distinction in the Law of Obligations, <hi>viz.</hi> Natural and Civil; Natural Obligations are these, which have a tye by the Law of Nature, and do raise a Right in the person to whom they relate; but the Civil Law, or Customs and Constitutions of men, do not second them with legal remedies or executions, but they remain only as bonds upon the good. will and honesty of these who are thereby bound.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> There be many Natural Obligations which have no civil effect, either because they obliege to inward duties of the mind, which Law doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, <hi>Philosophum spectant quae mente tenentur, juridicum quae manu tenentur:</hi> Or, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because though they obliege to outward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, yet the manner and measure is left to the discretion and arbitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the oblieged, as before hath been showen, though that in matters of expediency or utility, there be an Obligation to do that which is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to these common ends, to which we are oblieged, yet in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, our acting, <hi>bonafide,</hi> makes us free: Or, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Because, though Absolute Obligationslye upon the oblieged, yet they relate to duties perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God, whereof he hath given no power nor command to man; that there be some such Obligations that God hath authorized or commanded man to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate for him, and not all such, may be gathered from his own Judicial Law, in which many such are exprest, and many others omitted; though these Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations be to duties relating to man, yet there is no correspondent Right or Power of Compulsion in man, and so the Creditor is God, and man is the third party, to whose behoove the Obligation is imposed, but who hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power of exaction for himself, nor of vindication for God; such are the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109710:23"/>
Obligations of Beneficence, generally and particularly; of Charity to the poor, assistance to these in hazard, and relief of the oppressed; for Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reason will teach us, that though these do naturally obliege us, yet they in whose favours they are, cannot compel us; for example, we are bound <hi>is give alms to the poor,</hi> yet none will affirm, that the poor can extort it, or take it by force. It is true, that by the positive Law of any Nation, by their Consociation together, there is in the very Nature of the association, a duty of assistance for the common interest, into which they are associat; but that is not a Natural, but a Voluntary Obligation flowing from their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntar association or union. Likewise, all the people are bound to concur and assist legal executions, and in some places to contribute by such a proportion to the poor, but these are only positive Laws, having the force and nature of Contracts: Legal compulsion is also laid aside in matters of smallest moment, and in some things of greater importance, wherein a way of procedor is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, and as a penalty of none-observance of that order, legal remedies are denyed, when done any other way; as naked pactions among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were ineffectual, because they did not interpose Stipulation. And with us, agreements requiring Write, are ineffectual, and may be resil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from, unless Write be interposed; and in most matters of importance, Obligations with us are ineffectual, unless proven by Oath of Party, or Write.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Civil Obligations,</hi> are these which have a civil effect and execution, though perhaps they be not naturally oblieging; as with us, an Obligation in Write, doth Civilly obliege, and hath execution at the Instance of the Creditors Heir, or Assignay, though the Debt was payed to the Cedent, or Defunct, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Debitor hath not been so cautious to keep a Discharge in Write; but most part of Obligations, are both Natural and Civil: There are many such particular Obligations which will occur in their proper places.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. There is a third Distinction of Obligations in Principal and Accessory, such are the Cautionary Obligations of Surety and Pledges, which are acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory to all other Obligations.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The fourth Distinction of Obligations, is in these which are Pure, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, and to a day: Conditional Obligations are such as do depend upon a condition, and so are but Obligations in hope, till the condition be existent; but Obligations to a day, are such as are presently binding, but the effect, or execution thereof is suspended to a day, betwixt which, there is this main dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that in Conditional Obligations, the Condition must necessarily be uncertain, either as being in the power of mans will, or an accidential event: For if the Condition be a thing certainly to come, though it may be conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the Terms of a Conditional Obligation, yet it is indeed an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a day, as if <hi>Titius</hi> be oblieged to pay <hi>Maevius</hi> ten Crowns, if an Eclipse shall be such a day; upon which day, by the certain Rules of Astronomy, it is known that it is to be, though perhaps it was uncertain to both, or either party; yet it is not a conditional Obligation: but the time of the Eclipse is the term thereof: so likewise, if the condition be impossible, <hi>de facto,</hi> or impossible, <hi>de jure,</hi> that is, unlawful, (<hi>nam id possumus quod de jure possumus</hi>) then, though the Obligation be conceived in Terms Conditional; yet because the Condition is not depending, and in it self uncertain, the Obligation is not truely Conditional, but is void and elusory in the case of the legal impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Condition; and if it be in the power of the Creditor, or any third
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109710:24"/>
party, so that it may be an occasion to move them to do wrong, the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is valide and pure, and the Condition is void, as not adjected, <hi>nam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio Illicita, est quasi non adjecta;</hi> Hence it appears, that such Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as are without conditions, are pure, and such are simple which are not clogged with the running of a course of time, the adjection whereof is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in favours of the Debitor, as to the intervenient time; and in this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, in favours of the Creditor, that he needs use no Interpellation, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition for performance, <hi>sed dies interpallat pro homine,</hi> and the day being past, the Debitor is in <hi>mora;</hi> but in simple obligations, delay is only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on demand, and whensoever it is required, upon non-performance, the Debitor is <hi>in mora.</hi> Obligations, <hi>ad diem incertum,</hi> are in effect Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, <hi>nam dies incertus, habetur pro conditione,</hi> as a Sum payable at such an age, which is frequently in provisions of Children, if they die before that age, the sum is not due to their Representatives; even after they might have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that age, as was found, <hi>January,</hi> 17. 1667. <hi>Edgar contra Edgar, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> 22. 1677. <hi>Belshes</hi> of <hi>Toftes contra Belches.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Conditional Obligation doth necessarily imply an uncertainty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of the effect of the Obligation, upon the existence of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for, if the Condition fail, the Obligation is void: and ofttimes, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations are conceived in conditional terms, though in effect there be no uncertainty of the condition, as to the beeing thereof, though it may be uncertain, as to the Contracters knowledge; as in Obligations where the condition is made of something past, or of something that cannot but come; the coming whereof, is the Term of Performance, and not a Condition, and it is an Obligation to a day, and not conditional: As on the contrair, a Conditional Obligation may be, when it is not yet conceived in Terms Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, as when it is conceived to a day, if it be uncertain, whether by the course of Nature that day will ever come, it is no Term, but a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. These uncertain Conditions are of two kinds, voluntar, which depends upon the free choice of some persons; and casual, which depends upon the casual event of that which cannot Naturally be foreknown. Amongst voluntar Conditions, these are not to be numbred, which consist in the mutual Obligations of the Creditor, which he is positively oblieged to perform, and so are not looked on by the Contracters, as an uncertain event in his choice; and therefore, though frequently such Obligations in mutual Contracts, are conceived by way of provision or condition, and so may stop the effect, or execution of such Obligations, till the Creditors part be performed; yet that is rather as the failzie, or delay of the mutual cause of the Obligation, then as the non-existence of the condition: and therefore, such Contracts may, and ordinarily do reserve execution, by Poynding, and Apprising, before the performance of these provisions; which executions are not null, but will be preferred by their dates, to others proceeding upon pure Obligations, or to a day, after the day is past, yea, the other Creditors cannot object the non-implement of the provisions, except they had interest, in so far as the fulfilling thereof would be to their behoove; which certainly they could do, if they were proper Conditions, as they can do, when the condition is casual, or when it is voluntar, not being a part of the Creditors mutual Obliegement.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, the end and intent of an Obligation, or the manner of performance thereof, is ordinarily exprest as a condition, though these be not real conditions, rendering the Obligation uncertain.</p>

                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:109710:24"/>
A condition is ofttimes implyed in an Obligation, though it be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest, as when a Tocher is promised; this tacit condition is implyed, if the Marriage hold, and the condition may either be exprest, or imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as relating to the Contracting, or to the performing of the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as if the Debitor said, on such conditions I shall become oblieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which differeth from this, that I obliege my self to pay, or perform, when, or upon condition that such things shall exist; for in this case there is a present Contract, though the effect be uncertain: and therefore Arrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Inhibition might be used thereupon: But in the former, the very ingagement is uncertain, as if one should promise to <hi>Titius,</hi> if he mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Maevia,</hi> that he should Contract with him, for such a Tocher, before such a Marriage, Contracted or Solemnized, neither Arrestment, nor Inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition would be granted thereupon. An offer hath the like implyed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the other parties acceptance, and in that it differs from an absolute promise; so that if the acceptance be not adhibit presently, or within the time exprest in the offer; in which the other party hath Liberty to accept. There ariseth no Obligation, as was found, <hi>June,</hi> 25. 1664. <hi>Alexander Allan contra</hi> Mr. <hi>John Collier;</hi> and in mutual Contracts, the one party subscryb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is not oblieged till the other subscribe, as being his acceptance: And a Cautioner subscribing, is not oblieged, unless the principal party sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, that being implyed as a tacit contradiction of his being Cautioner.</p>

                     <p>THE first Obligations God put upon man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, were the Conjugal Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which arose from the Constitution of Marriage before the Fall; from whence have arisen, Rights of the greatest conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; as of the Husbands power over the Wife, and her Goods; the mutual so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Families, which is the only socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty immediatly Institute of God, in the Law of Nature; and from whence, is the power of Parents over Children; and oeconomical Government of Families, which of all other is the most absolute, and full, extending not only to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Civil Rights, but to the punishment of all Crimes, till by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of greater Civil Societies, many of these powers have been devolved upon the common Authority of the Societies; and therefore, these Obligations do deserve the first consideration.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:109710:25"/>
1. Though Marriage seem to be a voluntar Contract by ingagement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the application of it is, and ought to be of the most free consent; and because in matters circumstantial, it is voluntary, as in the Succession of the Issue, and the Provision of the Wife and Children; yet, that Marriage it self and the Obligations thence arising, are <hi>Jure divino,</hi> it appears thus; First, Obligations arising from voluntar Ingagement, take their Rule and Substance from the will of Man, and may be framed and composed at his pleasure; but so cannot Marriage, wherein it is not in the power of the Parties, though of common consent, to alter any Substantial, as to make the Marriage for a time, or take the power over the Wife from the Husband, and place it in her or any other; or the right of Provision or Protection of the Wife, from the Husband, and so of all the rest; which evidently demonstrateth, that it <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s not a Humane, but a Divine Contract.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That Marriage ariseth even from the <hi>Primitive Law</hi> of Nature, and that as it is the Conjunction of two single Persons; is evident not only from that natural Affection, which all sorts of Men in all places of the World (where no common Example nor Consent can reach) have unto a married Estate. But as the Lawers say, that it is founded in the common nature of Man, with other Creatures, who have a resemblance of it in themselves, and it is given for the very Example of the <hi>Natural Law,</hi> as contradistinct from the Law of Reason, and Law of Nations; for most part of the living Creatures live and converse in pairs, and keep the common Interest of their off-spring, as is clear in all Fowles, whose Wings have freed them from mans comptrol, and many of the Beasts of the Field: And it is like, all of them would be so inclined, if their natural Liberty were not restrained by Man, by pursuing such as are Wild, and making use of the Tame, as they may be most profitable, preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most of the Female for Increase, and Destroying the Male.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Affection of the Property and Chastity of Women, and Animosity and Jealousy that ariseth in Men, naturally upon the Breach thereof, doth evince, that by the Law of Nature, every Man ought to content himself with his own Wife, and Women not be common: for as no Man can indure the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own, so it must necessarily follow, that he should not incroach upon others Property: and seing Nature holds not out a proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Male and the Female, whereby every man might appropriat more, it must therefore subsist in one; and so was the first Institution by God, and all the Posterior Directions in his Word are for a man, and his Wife, not his Wives; and as the man hath not power over his Body, but the Wife: so it were an absurd Inconsistency, if that power were in many, and so behoved to resolve in a management by the common consent of the Wives.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Degrees in which Marriage is allowed or forbidden are, by divine Institution; for the next Degree collateral, is only forbidden; for of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendents and Descendents, there is properly no Degree, the great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, being in that regard as near as the Mother; and so the next collateral to all Ascendents and Descendents is in the same Degree with Brothers and Sisters, and Uncles and Aunts, Nephews and Nieces, are alike in the Propinqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Blood, with these, and the great Grandmother's, Sister, with the Mothers Sister; else if these were different Degrees, there would many Degrees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terveen betwixt a Person and his great Grand Aunt; But that there is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral abhorrence of that Promiscuous Commixtion of Blood, it is commonly acknowledged over all the World, as to all Ascendents and Descendents.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109710:26"/>
And as to the next Collaterals, the Word of God cleareth it, not to have been a <hi>Positive Law</hi> given to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but to have been a <hi>Common Law</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> also: and therefore, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. where the Degrees of Marriage are exprest, and unlawful Commixtion forbidden, It is subjoyned, <hi>v.</hi> 24, 25. <hi>Defile not your selves in any of these things, for in all these the Nations are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, which I cast out before you, and the Land is defiled; therefore do I vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit the Iniquity thereof upon it.</hi> But unless these Degrees of prohibite Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, were a part of the Law of Nature written in Man's heart, or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon positive Law known to the Nations; the Lord, who hath declared that he will judge men by that Law, which is known, would not so have judged the <hi>Caananites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Perpetuitie of Marriage is also evident, by our Saviour's Sentence against Arbitrary Divorce, which was permitted by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> for the hardness of that Peoples hearts; but the Lord cleareth up the Ancient Law of Nature, <hi>from the beginning it was not so;</hi> which sheweth the Perpetuity of that Law, and that it was before the Judicial Law; and therefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, <hi>that whosoever putteth away his Wife, except for Fornication, is an Adulterer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. For understanding of these <hi>Conjugal Rights,</hi> it will be necessar, 1. To consider the Constitution of Marriage. 2. The Dissolution of it. 3. The Rights and Interests thence arising: For the first; Marriage is defin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Modestinus,</hi> to be the Conjunction of Man and Woman, to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorts for all their Life, with a Communication of Rights Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>ff. de ritu. nuptiarum;</hi> so the essence of it consists in the <hi>Conjugal Society;</hi> the special nature of which Society, appeareth by the state, Interest, and Terms that the married Persons have thereby.</p>
                     <p>It may be questioned, whether the Conjunction wherein Marriage consists, be a Conjunction of mindes by mutual consent to the married state; and that whether privatly or in the publick Solemnity; or whether rather it be, a Conjunction or Commixtion of Bodies. For clearing whereof, consider, that it is not every consent to the married state that makes Matrimony, but a consent <hi>de presenti,</hi> and not a promise <hi>de futuro Matrimonio;</hi> for this Promise is only the Espousals which are premised to Marriage, and that so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn an Act might be with dew Deliberation; and therefore though as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Promises and Pactions, Espousals be naturally obligatorie and effectual also by the Canon Law, whereby the espoused Persons may be compelled to perfect the Marriage, unless there arise some eminent Discoverie of the Corruption or Pollution of either Party, or defect or Deformity, through Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or some other Accident. <hi>C.de literis extravag. de sponsalibus, &amp; cap.</hi> 2. <hi>eodem, c. ult, de Conjug.</hi> yet by the Civil Law, there is place for either party to repent and renunce the Espousals, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>Cod. de sponsalibus,</hi> which is also the custom of this Nation; for Marriage uses not to be pursued before Solemnization, <hi>r<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The publick Solemnity is a matter of Order, justly introduced by positive
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109710:26"/>
Law, for the certainty ofso important a Contract, but not essential to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: thence arises only the distinction of publick and solemn, privat or clandestine Marriages, and though the Contraveeners may be justly punished, (as in some Nations, by the Exclusion of the Issue of such Marriages from Succession) yet the Marriage cannot be declared void, and annulled; and such exclusions seem very unequal against the innocent Children, But by our Custome, Cohabitation, and being commonly repute Man and Wife, validats the Marriage, and gives the wife right to her Terce, who cannot be excluded therefrom, if she were reputed a lawful Wife, and not questioned during the Husbands life, till the contrary be clearly decerned, <hi>Par.</hi> 1503. <hi>cap.</hi> 77. So also, a Contract of Marriage was found valid, against the Husbands Heir, though the Marriage was never solemnized in Kirk nor Congregation, <hi>Hope. t.</hi> Husband &amp;c. <hi>William Barklay contra Anna Naper.</hi> The like found to exclude the bastardy of the Children, by the Father and Mothers, being repute Married, and keeping house and society together, for several years; <hi>Nicolson, de Agno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendis liberis, Brok contra</hi> but the contrair was found, where it was positively proven, that the Defunct had another Wife, <hi>Ibid. Archibald Chirnside contra Isobel Grieve</hi> and <hi>John Williamson.</hi> So likewise, in the former case, a Contract of Marriage was found valid, and the Man thereby oblieged to Solemnize the Marriage, seing he had procreate Children with the Woman, and by his missives had acknowledged he had Married her, though by a Contract, posterior to the Contract of Marriage, she had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunced the same, <hi>Nicol. de sponsalibus, Barclay contra Janet Kelly;</hi> But where a Man by his Write had acknowledged, that such a Child was got under promise of Marriage, and promised to solemnize the same, yet the Lords, on the mans al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgance that the woman had born a Child to another, and her answer, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to be presumed his, would not sustain that presumption, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing their conversing together, <hi>medio tempore, January</hi> 31. 1665. <hi>Christian Barclay contra George Baptie.</hi> It was also found lately relevant, for validating a Contract of Marriage, sixteen years Cohabitation, and being repute Man and Wife, <hi>Elizabeth Grierson contra</hi> Laird of <hi>Craigdarroch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the other point, though the commixtion of bodies seem necessar for the constitution of Affinity arising from Marriage; yet the opinion of the Canon Law is true, <hi>consensus, non coitus, facit Matrimonium;</hi> but this consent must specially relate to that Conjunction of Bodies, as being then in the consenters capacity, otherwise it is void; so the consent of persons naturally impotent, or of dubious <hi>Hermophradits,</hi> where the one Sex doth not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> predomine, doth not make Marriage, and the common essentials of consent, must also here be observed, so that, who cannot consent, cannot Marry, as Idiots and furious Persons, neither they who have not the use of Reason, as Infants and those under age, who are not come to the use of diseretion, unless <hi>malitia suppleat aetatem,</hi> that is, when the person is within the years of Pupil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, commonly established in Law, to be fourteen in Males, and twelve in Females; yet seing Marriage is an Obligation natural, and not annullable by positive Law; as to it, regard must be rather had, whether the parties be truely come to discretion and capacity, whereof commixtion of bodies is sufficient evidence: And this also is the sentence of the Canon Law, <hi>de illic. cap.</hi> 9. <hi>ult. de spons.</hi> Errors also in the Substantials, make void the consent, unless future consent superveen, as it did in <hi>Jacob,</hi> who supposed that he had Married, and received <hi>Rachel,</hi> but by mistake got <hi>Leah;</hi> yet was content to retain her, and serve for the other also. But Errors in qualities, or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances vitiat not, as if one supposing he had Married a Maid, or a chast Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, had Married a Whore; So then, it is not the consent of Marriage,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:109710:27"/>
as it relateth to the procreation of Children that is requisite, for it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, though the Woman be far beyond that date; but it is the consent, whereby ariseth that Conjugal Society, which may have the conjunction of Bodies as well as of Minds, as the general end of the Institution of Marriage, is the solace and satisfaction of Man, <hi>For the Lord saw that it was not fit for him to be done, and therefore made him a help meet for him:</hi> Yet though this capacity should never be actuat, as it persons, both capable, should after Marriage live together, and it should be known or acknowledged, that all their lives they did abstain, yet were the Marriage <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

If it be asked, whether the consent of Parents be essential to Marriage? the common Sentence will resolve it, <hi>Multa impediunt matrimonium contrahendum, quae non dirimunt contractum,</hi> so that consent is necessary, <hi>necessitate praecepti, sed non necessitate medii;</hi> though by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Constitution, such Marriages may be disalowed, and the Issue repute as unlawful, but the Marriage cannot be annulled, <hi>l.</hi> 11. <hi>de stat. hom. l.</hi> 13 §. 6. <hi>de Adult,</hi> by which Laws, not only the Issue of such Marriages are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from Succession, but the Marriage it self insinuat to be null, which humane Constitutions cannot reach, though the Magistrate or Minister, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrator of the Marriage, may refuse to proceed without consent of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; as by the Law and Custom of <hi>Holland, Art.</hi> 3. <hi>Ord.

Marriage is also void and inconsistent, when contracted within the Degrees prescribed <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. whereby the next Degree Collateral is only prohibit, both in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinity and Affinity, which makes those joyned in Affinity, in the same Degree, as being by Marriage one Flesh; neither can Marriage consist where either Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is married before: But the Exclusion of further Degrees by the Canon Law, as of Cousin-Germans, or of certain degrees in Affinity Ecclsieastick; or the prohibiting Marriage to these <hi>in sacris,</hi> are there unlawful Devices, which cannot alter this divine Contract, but become a Cheat, putting Parties in the <hi>Pop's</hi> power, to approve or disapprove as His Avarice or Interest leads: neither do the Civil Constitutions of Princes, annul or dissolve Marriage, whatever they may work as to the Interest of the married Persons, or their Succession, as were the Prohibitions of Marriage, between those of consular Dignity, and Plebeian Persons, between Tuttors and their Children, and Pupils: Yea, between <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> for diversity of Religion cannot annul it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Dissolution of Marriage is only Natural by Death, Adultery, and Desertion, do not annul the Marriage, but are just occasions upon which the Persons injured may annul it, and be free; otherwayes if they please to continue, the Marriage remains valid. All do agree, that Adultery hath some Effect upon Marriage; the Canon Law doth not thereupon dissolve it, that the Party injured may be free to marry again, but only granteth Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. But our Saviour's Precept cleareth the contrary; who in Relation to the Custom that then was of Divorce for light Causes, resolves, that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away was not lawful, except in the Cases of Adultery, and so in that case approves the Divorce even as then used, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. v. 9. It may be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether the Adulterer, after the Dissolution of the Marriage upon

                     <p>The second ground of Dissolution of Marriage, is, wilful desertion, which is grounded upon the answer of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 15. concerning the Marriages of Christians with Infidels, which he declares valide, <hi>unless the unbeliever depart;</hi> in which case, he declares, <hi>the Christian not to be under bondage,</hi> which cannot have any speciality to the party deserted, as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian; and therefore, must infer a general Rule, <hi>that all Married persons, wilfully deserted, are free;</hi> but this seems inconsistent with Christs resolution, making Adultery the only exception, which is easily cleared, by adverting, that Christs determination is not general of the dissolution of Marriage, but of <hi>putting away by divorce;</hi> and so concludes no more, <hi>but that the putting away of the wife is unlawful, unless for Adultery,</hi> but the wilful deserter is not put away, but goeth wilfully away; yet whether the person deserted, or put away, be simply free by the dissolution of the Marriage, or only freed from the bondage of adherence, is not clear from that Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 15. For from <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 32. and 19. 9. <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 18. It would appear, that by desertion, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is not dissolved, and that the person deserted may not marry again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is said, <hi>That whosoever marries her that is put away (or deserted) commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Adultery.</hi>

                     <p>By the <hi>Law of Scotland,</hi> dissolution of Marriage for non-adherence, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful desertion, is expresly ordered, <hi>Parl.</hi> 1573. <hi>cap.</hi> 55. <hi>That the deserter, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter four years wilful desertion, without a reasonable cause, must be first pursued and decerned to adhere, and being thereupon denunced, and also, by the Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, the Commissaries are warranded to proceed to divorce;</hi> but the absence will not be accounted a wilful desertion, if he be following any lawful imployment abroad, and content to accept and intertain his Wife, for she is oblieged to follow him.</p>

The rights arising from Marriage, are the <hi>Jus Mariti,</hi> or conjugal power of the Husband over the Wife, her Person and Goods, and therewith by consequence, the obliegement for her debts. 2. His power, and the Wifes security, whereby, during the marriage she cannot obliege her self. 3. The Husbands obliegement to intertain the Wife, and provide for her after his death, and her interest in the Goods.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jus Mariti,</hi> as a Term in our Law, doth signifie the right that the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band hath in the Wifes Goods, yet it may well be extended to the power he hath over her person, which stands in that oeconomical power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, whereby the Husband is Lord, Head and Ruler over the Wife, by the express Ordinance of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 16. Where the Lord says to <hi>Eve, Thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire shall be towards thy Husband, and he shall rule over thee;</hi> which, though it may seem as a penalty imposed upon her, <hi>for being first in the transgression,</hi> and so not to be of the Natural or Moral Law, which is perpetual; yet it is no more than a consequence of the Moral Law, whereby Marriage being Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute before the Fall, <hi>The Woman was made for the Man, and not the Man for the Woman:</hi> And therefore, in that Conjugal Society, being but of two, the determination of things indifferent, of their Interest, behooved to be in the Man, and he to have in so far the Precedency and Government of the Wife; but when through the Fall, the greatest measure of infirmity besel her, as being first in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:109710:28"/>
the transgression, whereby <hi>she became the weaker Vessel:</hi> there was need, not only of a determination in things free, but an exaction of duties, wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to she became less knowing and willing: Therefore, from that Consequence, and not by any new Imposition, the Man became to have Dominion over her, and power to make her do these duties, which in her Innocency, she would have done of her own accord.</p>
                     <p>This power oeconomical, as hath been said before, did naturally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all authority, till most of it was devolved upon Magistracy, yet by this power the Husband may still contain the Wife within the compass of the conjugal Society, and her abode and domicile followeth his, and he hath right to recover her person from any that would withdraw, or withhold her from him, except in the case of an allowed Separation, for his Injuries and Attro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, whereby she might not be with him in security and safety.</p>
                     <p>From this power the Husband hath over the Wifes person, and Conjugal Society involved in the Nature of Marriage, arises the Husbands power and right to the Goods of the Wife, whereby, according to the nature of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, there is a community of Goods betwixt the Married persons; which Society, having no determinate proportion in it, doth resolve into an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but so, that through the Husbands oeconomical power of Government, the administration, during the Marriage, of the whole, is alone in the Husband, whereby he having the sole administration and unaccountable, his power may rather seem to be a power of Property, having indeed all the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Property, during the Conjugal Society, yet is no more than is exprest.</p>
                     <p>This right of the Husband in the Goods of the Wife, is so great, that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can it be avoided by the pactions of parties, whereby if any thing be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to the Wife, during the Marriage, to be peculiar and proper to her, excluding the <hi>Jus Mariti:</hi> Yet the very Right of Reservation becoming the Husbands, <hi>Jure Mariti,</hi> makes it elusory and ineffectual, as always running back upon the Husband himself, as Water thrown upon an higher ground, doth ever return; And therefore a Wife, before her Contract of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, having disponed a part of her Joynture, and taken a Back-bond for imploying of it for the use of her future Spouse and Family joyntly, though the Husband by his Contract of Marriage, renunced his right thereto; yet he was found to have the power to mannage it, to the use of the Family, <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the 9. 1667.

                     <p>Besides the Obligations of the married persons, which are naturally in the minds and affections of each to other, there is outwardly the Obligation of Co-habitation, or Adherence, of which formerly; and the Obligation of the Husband to Aliment, and provide for the Wife in all necessars, for her Life, Health and Ornament, according to their means and quality, to which he is naturally bound, though he had no means, but were to acquire the same, <hi>For he that provides not for his own Family, is worse than an Infidel;</hi> yet the Civil effect thereof, is only to give Aliment and Intertainment, according to the mans means and quality, and so he is civilly bound, <hi>quoad potest;</hi> hence it is, that the Aliment, or Furnishing of the Wife, is a Debt of her Husbands, not

By the Dissolution of Marriage, there ariseth to Married Persons, not only these Rights, which by voluntar Contract are Constitute to either, and which are not proper here: but also these, which by Law and Custome, are Competent without any special Convention, or Covenant; and these are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the part of the Husband, or more frequently upon the part of the Wife: To the Husband is Competent, the Life-rent of the Wifes Heretage; which, because it is peculiar unto these Nations, it is said to <hi>be the Courtesie of</hi> Scotland <hi>or</hi> England. To the Wife ariseth, her share of the Moveables, which is the half, where the Man hath no Children, <hi>in familia;</hi> and the third, where there are such, and her Terce, which is the third part of his Lands, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her Life. But of Reversions, Heretable Bonds, Dispositions, or Rights of Lands without Infeftment, and of Teinds, or Tacks, or Tenements within Burgh, the Relict hath no Terce. These Rights of Terce and Courtesie, fall in to be considered amongst the Feudal Rights; and the Relicts third, or half of Moveables, in the Succession of Moveables, wherein it is a Concomitant, and regulat according to that which is proper Succession, either of Children, or others; though as to the Wife, it be rather a Division of that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Goods Moveable, that was Competent to the Married Persons, during the Marriage, and therefore shall be insisted on no further here, but left to these places.

                     <p>THAT there be Natural Obligations betwixt Parents and Children, not proceeding from the consent of either Party, or from the Constitution of any humane Law, but from the obedience Man oweth to his Maker, who hath Written this Law in the Hearts of Parents and Children, as to their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests and Duties, with Capital Letters; Is evident by the common consent of all the Nations of the World, how Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous soever; though evil custome hath put out the Eyes of Natural Light in other things; yet in this, the Rays of the Sun of Righteousness are so direct, that their illumination cannot be extinguished. These Obligations are so firm, that in most things they cannot be taken off, nor discharged by Men; though Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren would discharge their Parents of Natural Affection, Education, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109710:34"/>
&amp;c. Or Parents would free their Children of Reverence, Obsequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and of Intertainment of Parents, not able to Intertain themselves: yet would these Obligations still be binding upon either. These Obligations are placed in the Common Nature that Man hath with other Animals, and so is given as an evident Instance of the Law of Nature, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>ff. de justitia &amp; jure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We shall then consider what these are; And <hi>first,</hi> What Interest the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have in the Persons of their Children. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In what they are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally bound-to to their Children. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What interest the Children have in the Goods of Parents. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What they Naturally do owe to their Parents. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> what they are bound in to each other.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For the <hi>first,</hi> ere we can distinctly know the power Parents have over their Children, we must distinguish the Capacity and Ages of the Children, whereof there are three, Infancy, or Pupilarity; Minority, or less Age; and Majority, or full Age; So doth <hi>Aristotle</hi> distinguish, <hi>Polit.</hi> 1. <hi>cap. ult. Ethic. l.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. And after him. <hi>Grotius, de jure belli &amp; pacis, l.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Infancy is, when the Children are without Discretion, and then are wholly in the power of their Parents, who not only may, but must carry them whither, and keep them where they will; and must also breed and order them according to their capacities, means and qualities: And this is rather an Act of Dominion in the Parents, the Children being then capable of no Obligation; and therefore it cannot be received by them from the Parents as an Obligation, as it may thereafter be done, during the Childrens Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, wherein there is a Natural Levity, for want of fixedness and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, while the Light of Reason is but drawing towards its Meridian clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It will not much be debated, but the direction of Children in their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, is naturally stated in their Parents; But the greatest Question will remain, of their full Age, when the Children become able to govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and their own Affairs: And as to that, it is the opinion of some, that it standeth alone, <hi>inpietate &amp; reverentia, Steph.oeco.juris civilis, cap.</hi> 7. and <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius partitionum, l.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>in principio,</hi> sheweth, that the Custome of <hi>Holland</hi> dissolveth the power of Fathers, by the Childrens age of 25.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Whatsoever may arise from the Custome of Nations, whereby the power of Parents over their Children, in their full Age is much diminished; yet by the Original and pure Law of Nature, not only the Tutory and Protection of Childrens Infancy with the Cure, and direction of their Minority, is in their Parents. But there is also an oeconomick Authority in the Father of the Family, over all his Children and Descendants remaining in his Family, whom he hath not Elocat by Marriage (which is also a Natural Bond) unto other Families, whereby the Females do naturally change their Families, and become under the power of another Family.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. This is the only Natural Authority and Government, which had in it self all Authority, Publick, Private, Civil and Criminal, till by Humane Constitution, and Divine Approbation, most of that power is now devolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Magistracy. This Power was not only before Magistracy, but even thereafter remained, with subordination thereto in most Nations, as <hi>Caesar de bello Gallico, lib.</hi> 2. Writes that among the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Belgae,</hi> Parents had the power of Life and Death. The like power had the <hi>Romans</hi> anciently, <hi>l. in suis haredibus,</hi> 11. <hi>ff. de liberis &amp; posthumis, l. libertati,</hi> 10. <hi>Cod. de patria potestate. Aristotle</hi>
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:109710:34"/>
testifieth the like of the <hi>Persians, lib.</hi> 8. <hi>Ethic. cap.</hi> 12. And by the Judicial Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. <hi>vers.</hi> 18. <hi>The rebellious son, who obejed not the voice of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, was to be brought forth before the Elders of that place, and ston<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to death, without other proof than the parents testimony;</hi> So that the sentence was the Parents, though the execution was to be publick. Such Authority was that of the Patriarchs, <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> who with Divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, made War, Peace and Confederacys, which are the publick and proper Rights of Magistracy, and Governed their own Families without any Authority derived from any other. And though <hi>Jacobs</hi> Family arose to that greatness, that in it were many Families, yet he remained the Father and Prince of them all; so that the several subordinat Families, had their subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinat Authority over their Wives and Children, and so their Children were bound in Obedience to them, but with the exception of their Superior Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to whom the first Obedience was due.</p>
                     <p>This Native Authority reacheth all Children, whether procreat of lawful Marriage or not, so that they be truely known to be Children, because the same Foundation, and common Principles and Duties, are in both, though they have not the same Interest in the Fathers Goods, in respect of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of Goods betwixt Man and Wife, and the Conjugal Society, even naturally, whence the Goods are derived into the Issue of the Lawful Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
                     <p>This Paternal Authority doth not necessarily carry the property and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal of the Goods of the Children; but that they are capable of such by the Gift of their Parents, or any other ways, even in Infancy, and that they have the full Dominion and Administration thereof, in their full Age: And therefore, Bonds of Provision, by Fathers to Children, if delivered, are not Revockable, directly nor indirectly, by contracting Debts thereafter; And the delivery of such Bonds of Provision, makes them irrevockable, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the delivery be to the Children, or to any other for their behoove (which behoove will be presumed, unless the Father express his mind at the delivery, that the Write is to be returned to himself, or depositate upon terms) and therefore, a Bond taken By a Father, in the name of his Brother, the Father obtaining an Assignation from him to his Daughter; the Bond was not found Revockable by the Father, being Registrate in the Brothers Name, <hi>November</hi> 20. 1667. Executours of <hi>Trotter contra Trotter.</hi> Childrens provisions by Bond, granted after a Testament, nominating them Executours, found not to import that they should have the Executry, if the Heir be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieged to pay the Bonds of provision; but that the Bond being Moveables should first affect the Executry, <hi>February</hi> 22. 1677. <hi>Belfhes of Tofts contra Belshes.</hi> And a Father granting Bond to a Bairn, in satisfaction of her Portion natural, was not found thereby to apply that Bairns Portion natural to the Heir, Executour, or unlversal Legator, though they would be lyable for payment of the Bond; but to apply that Bairns share to the rest of the Bairns, who thereby will have the whole Bairns part, <hi>February</hi> 17. 1671. Mistris <hi>Katharine Mcgill</hi> against the Viscount of <hi>Oxford,</hi> for Bonds of provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, delivered in <hi>liege pousty,</hi> do, as other Debts, affect the whole Executry, and where all the Bairns had Bonds of provision, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>in satisfaction,</hi> they had also their Bairns part of the Executry, <hi>July</hi> 16. 1678. <hi>Murrays contra Murrays.</hi> But Bairns provisions, payable at such a day, and not bearing the proportion of the deceasing to accress to the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving the share of these Bairns, who dyed before that age, without Issue, was not found due, <hi>February</hi> 22. 1677. <hi>Belshes</hi> of <hi>Tosts contra Belshes.</hi> The delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Writes in other cases, is presumed from the date, if they be in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

                     <p>But from this paternal power, it follows, that the Parents may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue and keep their Children in their Families, and that they are oblieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to imploy their Service and Work, for the common interest of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and what thence arises, is the Parents, not their own, which doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways indure, till by consent of the Parents, they become <hi>

                     <p>Thus the interest of Parents in the Persons and Goods of their Children, by the Law of Nature, being cleared. As to the Obligations Natural of Parents toward their Children (beside their Obligations that stand, and are acted in the Mind and Affections, which the Law respecteth not, but these only, <hi>qua non mente, sed manu tenentur</hi>) the main Obligations are Education and Provision. The Education of Children consisteth not only in the Care and Intertainment of them, during Infancy; but especially in Breeding of them for some Calling and Imployment, according to their capacity and condition.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The duty of provision of Children, comprehends, not only their Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Intertainment in Meat, Cloaths, Medicine and Burial, which may be competent, during the Parents Life; but also competent provision after the Parents Death; for the Apostle saith, <hi>That he that careth not for his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is worse then an Infidel,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. <hi>vers.</hi> 8. And in both, the ability of the Parent, and necessity of the Children is to be considered; for if the Children be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The Obligation of Children toward their Parents, consists mainly in their Obedience to them; and their duty to Aliment and Supply them in all their necessities, according to the Childrens ability: their Obedience to their Parents is much cleared from that Power and Authority their Parents have over them, of which we have spoken. For unto Authority, or power to Command, Subjection, or Obedience answers, as the Correlate; so that as the Parental Power was most in the Infancy of the Children, and least af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their <hi>forisfamiliation;</hi> so are the duties of Obedience proportional: but after Emancipation, these duties are so far diminished, that little remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, except the Natural Reverence, Tenderness and Obsequiousness, that Children do still owe to their Parents, in due order; which, though it hath no civil remeeds, yet it remains a Natural Obligation, to observe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents commands, throughout their Posterity, as in that Nottour Example of the <hi>Rehabites, Jer.</hi> 35. is clear, where they observed their Fathers Commands, in a free thing, though inconvenient, <hi>viz. To drink no Wine, to build no houses, &amp;c.</hi> and for their Obedience, the Lord promises, <hi>There should not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man of them to stand before the Lord for ever.</hi> But while they are in the Family, they are not only under the oeconomick Government of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, in so far as is not devolved to the Magistrat; but specially they are bound to abide with their Parents, and to imploy their Service for their Parents, and the use of the Family, whereunto their Parents may compel them by their own proper Authority; and Parents have Action against all others, who shall hinder them to keep their Children with them, or lead them whether, and imploy them as they please.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The Obligation of Aliment, and Relief to Parents in necessity, is due, both by the Law of Nature, and hath in it also, that Remuneratory Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, whereby Children ought to retribute to, and recompence their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents for their Education and Intertainment; and though it be said, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 14. <hi>That Children ought not to lay up for the Parents, but the Parents for the Children;</hi> yet it is to be understood, of that care, foresight and Providence that Parents ought to have, not only to provide things necessar for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but for their Children also after them, which being an ordinary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ought to be in their thought and consideration; and is not incumbent to the Children, it being but rare and unexpected, that Parents necessities put them to expect relief from their Children; or else it is to be taken compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, that parents are rather <hi>to lay up for the Children, then Children for the Parents. Solons</hi> Law made the Children infamous, who did not Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their Parents.

                     <p>TUTORS and Curators, succeded in the place of Parents, and their Obligations have a near resemblance; and therefore, shall be here fitly subjoyned, though in the constitution, and duties of Tutors and Curators, the Positive Law predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; yet, that without any Positive Law, or Contract, there is a duty of Tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Protection of Orphans, and specially upon these, who by relation of Blood, are their nearest Kinsmen, and in place of their Parents, it will appear by what ensueth; and what is superadded, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the consent of parties, in Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or by the Law, in Tutors, with the condition and interest of Pupils and Minors, cannot conveniently be separated. If there were no Positive Law, the natural infirmity of Pupilage, would not want its natural remedies provided by Him, who is the Father of the fatherless, and layeth his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential Obligations upon these, whom, by the Law Written in their hearts, he hath bound to the performance of these Duties, as is before shown. There is a Common Obediential, or Natural Obligation upon all Men, of Love, Mercy, and relief of the distressed, among whom Infants and Pupils, who have no discretion, and cannot at all Preserve, or Govern themselves, are the first. It hath been also shown, that there is a more special Obligation put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those of one Blood, one Family, from one common Parent, to help and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port each other, and that in order.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The first and nearest degree, is first, and most oblieged; hence ariseth that orderly and comely natural substitution of Tutors, for the preservation of Pupils: first, the Fathers Tutory and lawful Administration, whereof we have spoken already; and these failing by death, or incapacity, the nearest degree of Agnats are in the place of Parents, and are all joyntly bound to this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Duty, unless the Parents, by their Parental power, have appointed, and ordained others whom they trust, to undertake that work.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:109710:38"/>
And lastly, the common Obligation that lyeth upon people, hath devolved upon the Magistrate, as representing them, the duty of being, or appointing Tutors for Pupils; hence doth arise the distinction of Tutors, <hi>in Testamentar,</hi> constitute by the Parent in his Testament, <hi>legittime</hi> appointed by the Law, which is of the nearest Agnats, and <hi>dative,</hi> which are ordained by the King.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Natural Obligations of these Tutors to their Pupils, are first, to preserve their persons, and defend them against injuries and prejudices; and therefore, are they named Tutors, <hi>quasi tuitores, l.</hi> 1. § 1. <hi>ff. de tutelis.</hi> 2. To Aliment them out of the Pupils own Means, according to the condition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and to Educate them for a station in the Common-wealth, according to their quality and capacity. 3. To mannage their Affairs with such diligence, as provident men use in their own Affairs, that nothing may be lost, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing improven to the best advantage; in all which, they are not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erce voluntary Acts of Dominion, at their choise, as disposing of what is secure; but only necessar Acts, for the preservation and recovery of what will, or may perish, and for improving the profits of it. 4. They are bound to give an accompt, and restore to the Pupil what is his own, so soon as he attains to the Age of discretion.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And on the other part, the Pupil is oblieged to the Tutor, by the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diential Bond of Remuneration, or recompense of one good deed for an other, to make up to the Tutors whatsoever is wanting to them, through their faithful Administration: This is all the substance of the Interests and Obligations of Tutors and Pupils, which the positive Law doth no more but declare, apply, and ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, by the form of entring that Office, the security for performance of it, the fixed time of indurance thereof, which naturally is the Age of Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in some sooner, in some later, in some never: But for certainties cause, positive Law determines a particular year, in which, for the most part, Discretion cometh.</p>
                     <p>That there are such Interests and Obligations, even naturally, the Light of Nature will so easily go along, that it will rather need Consideration, than Confirmation, the grounds thereof being commonly acknowledged, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed by all Men, who are led by Reason, and it is so insinuate by the ordinar Term of Law, whereby these Obligations are called, <hi>quasi ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractu,</hi> as arising from no Contract betwixt the Tutor, and the Infant, or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil, as not capable of Contracting, and yet are not simply by the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Law; and therefore, these Obligations, not being by the will of Man, must needs be Obediential Obligations, by the will of God.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> have in this matter keeped clearly and clossely by the Law of Nature; and therefore, our Customes have keeped as near by them, and so have the Customes of other Nations; So sayes <hi>Gudelinus, de jure noviss. l.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. §. <hi>ff.</hi> that the Custome of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Netherlands,</hi> hath very little altered in this from the <hi>Roman</hi> Law; we shall therefore interweave the Civil Law and our Customes, that it may appear how far they do agree, and differ, and how they do quadrat to the Law of Nature, following this order; 1. What kind of Tutors they be, and what order of the same. 2. What the Tutors Duties are in their Entry, Administration, and Accompts. 3. How Tutories end. 4. The Pupils Obligation to them therefore. And last, of that Resemblance that Curatours and Minors have Tutors and Pupils.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. As to the first, there be three kinds of Tutors, by the Civil Law, and our Custome (befide that of the Father, who is called for distinctions sake,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:109710:39"/>
                        <hi>lawful Administratour,</hi> of which formerly) The first is, Tutor Testamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, or nominate. The second, is the Tutor of Law. And the third is, the Tutor Dative, all which follow in course, in the same order.</p>

                     <p n="7">7. A Tutor Testamentar requires no preparatory solemnity to capacitate him to Act, but the very nomination it self is sufficient, and if it be in a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, it is valide, though the Testament be never confirmed, or be rejected by the Executors; and so there needs no making of Faith, or finding Caution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is presumed, the Father that did name him, did sufficiently know his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and fitness: and the Confirmation of a Testament, bearing, that a Tutor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, accepted, and made faith, was not found to instruct his acceptance, with out the principal Act subscribed by him were produced, or Acts of Administration proven, though it was thirty seven years since the confirmation, <hi>January</hi> 31. 1665. <hi>Rutherfords contra</hi> Laird of <hi>Hunthil.</hi> Neither was a Tutory found instructed by a Discharge, as Tutor Testamentar, it being evident by the Testament, that he was only overseer, <hi>June</hi> 10. 1665. <hi>Swintoun contra Notman.</hi> But a Write under the Tutors hand, designing him Tutor, found to instruct, unless the contrair were proven by production of the Tutory, <hi>December</hi> 2. 1668.

seing they must be countable, they must not suffer the Minor to have his own Goods, and his own Money in his own hand, lest he lose and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend them; these Procuratories may be given to some of themselves, and in many things, their very Office includes a Procuratory, being less then Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory; but though they may intromet with the Pupils Means themselves, yet they are not oblieged to be Servants or Factors, but may authorize such, being lyable always, that they acted therein profitably; but if the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor will not authorize such, nor do these deeds needful and profitable for his Affairs, the Curatours may crave to be exonered; so they may also do, if he meddle with his own Means, and will not be Restrained, or if any of the other Curatours act unprofitably, or without consent of the rest, the Curatours must do diligence to remove them, as suspect and malver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant: Curatours are to recover that which was unwarrantably meddled with; otherways, they are lyable, not only for their own omissions, or intromissions, but for the other Curatours, and so are all lyable, <hi>in soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> as hath been said of Tutors, <hi>February</hi> 11. 1630. <hi>Guthrie contra Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrie;</hi> and they are lyable for Annualrent of Minors Means, as Tutors are, <hi>February</hi> 24. 1627. <hi>Francis Guthrie contra Guthrie;</hi> Yea, their Heirs, though Minors for the time, after expiring of the Tutory, <hi>Ibid.</hi> Where the Curatours Heir are found liable for the Annualrent of a Sum consign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Minor: But Curatours expresly chosen with a <hi>quorum,</hi> and with this condition, that they should be only oblieged for deeds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they consented, and be free of omissions, were so approven by the Lords, during their Office; and though the Minor acted deeds very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial with any other <hi>quorum,</hi> yet the rest were not freed, nor acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their Office, as not being in hazard by these deeds, <hi>Nic. de tut.

THE Obligations whereby men are holden to restore the proper Goods of others, are placed here among Natural or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediential Obligations; because they are not by Contract or consent, neither have they their Original from Positive Law; for though there were no Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law, these Obligations would be binding, and they are Obligatory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong persons, who are not subject to one Positive Law; and therefore, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are not Obligatory, by the Will or Law of man, of necessity they must have their Original from the Authority and Command of God, and that obedience we owe thereto, by the Law written in our hearts.</p>

                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:109710:48"/>
We are not here to speak of the Obligations of Restitution, which are by any voluntar ingagement, or which are by Delinquence; but of these only, whereby that which is anothers coming in our power, without his purpose to gift it to us, and yet, without our fault, ought to be Restored, as things stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or found, or recovered from Pirats, Thieves, &amp;c. or bought, <hi>bona fide,</hi> or the like.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Restitution of things belonging to others; may seem to be an effect of Property, whence cometh the right of vindication or repitition of any thing; but beside the real Action, the Proprietar hath to take or recover what is his own, which doth not directly concern any other person, and so being no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal right, hath no correspondent Obligation upon the have of that which is an others, to restore it. There is a personal Right, which is a power in the Owner to demand it, not only when it is in the possession of the haver, but if he bath fraudfully put it away; and yet it is his once, having it that oblieges him, and his fraudulent away-putting, though it be a Delinquence, yet it gave not the rise to the Obligation, but only continues it in the same condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if he yet had it; so in that case, his obligation is more palpable, for vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the thing, where it is not, cannot take place properly. The lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Grotius, de jure belli, l.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. maketh such obligations as arise from Dominion and Property, to be by tacit consent, or Contract, whereby the Nations, who have agreed to appropriat things common to men, have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by also tacitly agreed, that each man should restore what is the property of an other; yet this will not hold, if we consider, that though for the most part, property be by consent; yet in many things it is without consent of the simple Law of Nature, as things which have their specification from their owner, his skill and industry, and others, as will appear in its own place; and therefore, it is most just and sure, to attribute such obligations to the <hi>Law of God written in our hearts,</hi> rather than unto any other conjecture of supposed consent. To this agreeth the <hi>Roman Law,</hi> which holdeth these obligations not to be <hi>ex contractu, sed quasi ex contractu;</hi> neither doth account them obligations, <hi>ex lege,</hi> and if they were of tacit consent, these obligations were <hi>ex contractu.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is many ways by which the things of others may come to our hands, without our fault or Delinquence; As first, things straying, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, the Lord hath ordained, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 2, 3. <hi>To bring again unto their brethren that which went astray, and if he were not near, to keep it till he sought after it, and then restore it;</hi> and to do so with all things lost by him, wherein there seemeth something to be admixed of Positive Law, as the taking of it home to him, or keeping of it for his Brother; whereas the simple Natural Obligation of Restitution, oblieges to no duty of Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or pains, but only not to conceal that which is an others, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store it, when demanded; and such is the Custome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that waith or straying Goods must be proclaimed, and intimate to be waith; and if the owner make them appear to be his, he may have them, satisfying for what was wared upon them, for their preservation, as Orass, &amp;c. And if none appear within such a time, Custome hath added, that waith or strayed Goods become publick, and escheat to the King, or others to whom he hath disponed, or committed that power; and this intimation is so far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, that if the Goods be medled with, or disposed of otherways, it is Theft; but though the publication maketh the Goods publick, and the medling therewith to be without fault, so that if there do never any own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:109710:49"/>
appear; the things do become really and absolutely publick, and they do not become the Possessours by that ancient Law, <hi>quod nullius est sit occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pantis,</hi> which takes place amongst us, in things which were never known to have an owner, as Pearles or Stones, found on the Shore, and many others; but therefrom are excepted waith Goods, and Goods by Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, which become escheat as publick. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Things lost, of which we see the rule for <hi>Israel, Deut.</hi> 22. How far they may be possessed without Delinquence; in these, our Custome agrees with the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, and other Nations, except in the Matter of waith and wrack Goods, of which before; that such things being not concealed, may remain with the possessours, and if none claim, they become their own, and they may dispose of them, if they cannot be conveniently preserved without hazard.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Things belonging to others, coming to our hands without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquence, when we acquire, <hi>bona fide,</hi> either the property, use, or security thereof, by pledge or depositation; in which cases, we are bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store to the owner, though thereby we lose what we gave, except in some cases, wherein Positive Law secures the buyer, and leaves the owner to seek the seller.</p>
                     <p>This Restitution takes place, notwithstanding any obliegement in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair; and we have an excellent species in Law, <hi>l. bona fide,</hi> 31. <hi>ff.</hi> § 1. <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positi,</hi> a Robber, <hi>depositat</hi> with <hi>Seius,</hi> that which he spoiled or robbed from <hi>Mevius,</hi> to which is <hi>Seius</hi> oblieged to restore, if he look only upon his ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, truely to the Robber, but if upon the whole matter, certainly to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius;</hi> for the Precept of Law is, to render every thing to the owner; and therefore, no promise or ingagement can here prevail against the natural ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of Restitution, because that being natural and indispensible, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, whether ignorantly or willingly made, to Restore that which the Ingager knows to be anothers, is a Delinquence, inferring punishment for ingadging, but no obliegement to perform; so also, he who ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly takes in custody, or pledge, that which is his own, though thereby he promise to Restore it, yet his obligation being by errour in the substance of the Contract, makes it void, and he may retain or recover it as his own.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> things recovered from Thieves, Robbers, or Pirats, are ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this obligation of Restitution, wherein these things may be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly detained for the expenses and labour in recovery, especially if the labour was undertaken of purpose, to recover such things, and if it was but by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, the recoverer projecting some other thing, the satisfaction is due, as a remuneration of the trouble and pains which it might have cost the owner in the recovery, which, with the expenses following thereon, being saved to him; he ought to recompense the profit accressing to him, to the Authour thereof.</p>
                     <p>The doubt remaineth greater, whether what Enemies having Possest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recovered by a Nation or Party, ought not to be Restored to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per owners of that Nation who bore the equal expense of the War, and who being any way ingaged in that Quarrel, cannot but acknowledge the War of their Enemies to be unjust; and therefore, as to these things, I think, that Equity would require Restitution upon satisfaction, and gratification of the favour received, which ought to take place, unless by the peculiar Customs of Nations, it hath been otherways agreed, which may alter, or derogat
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:109710:49"/>
from this Common Law; and therefore, <hi>David</hi> recovering back his Wife and his Spoill from his Enemies, <hi>delivered every man his own, vid. Tit.</hi> 12. Rights real, §. 43.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The duty of Restitution extendeth to these things, <hi>quae ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt in non causam,</hi> which coming warrantably to our hands, and without any paction of Restitution, yet if the cause cease, by which they become ours, there superveeneth the Obligation of Restitution of them, whence are the condictions in Law, <hi>ob non causam,</hi> and, <hi>causa data, causa non secuta,</hi> which have this natural ground; and of which, there are innumerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, as all things that become in the possession of either party, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Marriage; the Marriage, which is the cause, failing to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, the interest of either party ceaseth, and either must Restore.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. But there is not the same ground for things given for an unjust cause, <hi>ob turpem causam;</hi> in which, the will of the owner, and his purpose to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the property is effectual, though his motive was not good; but Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law doth sometimes obviat the inconveniency, by such Donations, and makes them void, and either to Return, or become Caduciary and Escheat. As for these things which are attained by force or fear, they have their original from Delinquence, and comes not under this Consideration.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Restitution extendeth to <hi>indebite soluta,</hi> when any party through errour, delivereth or payeth that which he supposeth due, or belongeth to an other, if thereafter it appear, that it was not due to that other, he who received it, is oblieged to restore, and yet not by Paction or Contract; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law calleth this <hi>promutuum, vel quasi mutuum,</hi> having in it the same Natural Obligation, which <hi>mutuum</hi> or Loan, hath by voluntar ingagement; but here, Positive Law, for utility and quietness sake, excepteth transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are properly such, and which are of two sorts, the one Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial, when in any matter doubtful and debateable, either party to shun their hazard, and trouble of a Legal Decision, is willing to transact and agree, so as thereby they may quite, or abate part of what they claim as their Right, and so they renounce all future question, upon any appearing of Right, either Judicially or Extra-judicially; and therefore, what either quitteth to other of their Rights, is due, for the same cause, and hath in it, either expresly or implicitely, that that Transaction shall not be Ransact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon any thing that shall accidentally appear thereafter, (Fraud only as the common exception in all Humane Actions, being excepted) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, such things, though they appear not to be the havers, are not to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored. The other Transaction is Judicial by <hi>Litiscontestation,</hi> when any cause in difference is put upon the Oath of the party, or other Probation, and particular diets for that effect assigned, wherein, if either party fail, he los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what is put thereupon by his implicit consent, and when the right of any thing is referred to the havers Oath, and he sweareth it to be his own, though thereafter it may be made palpably appear, not to be so, yet it will not be Restored, because of the owners reference, implying that condition, that he shall stand to the Oath, without questioning right or wrong, because an Oath is an end of all Controversie, though the swearer may be punished as a wilful perjurer: And thus, most of things that become ours, by Sentences and Decreets of Judges, are not lyable to Restitution, upon any subsequent Question. There is this exception against <hi>indebite solutum,</hi> that it cannot be repeated, when the Creditor gets that which is due to him, though not due

by that party who payed the same, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>C. de condictione indebiti, l.</hi> 44. <hi>ff. eodem,</hi> which was not found when the payment was made to an Executor Creditor, pursuing upon his Confirmation, and before Sentence obtaining payment from the Debitors Heir, who was decerned to refound upon a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the Debt, granted to the Defunct Debitor, whereby it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Debt was not truely due, but twice payed, <hi>January</hi> 10. 1673. Sir <hi>James Ramsay contra Robertsons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. Under Restitution do fall, not only the things of others, but their Natural Birth, and Fruits extant, not consumed, <hi>bona fide,</hi> which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as parts of the things, being accessory thereto, and belonging to the same owner, but industrial and artificial profits in so far as such as arise from the havers industry, and not from the thing, fall not under Restitution, if separate.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. In all these, the Obligation of Restitution is formally founded upon the having of things of others in our power; and therefore, that ceasing, the Obligation also ceaseth, as he who did, <hi>bona fide,</hi> buy that which did belong to an other, if while he hath it, it appeareth to be that others, he must Restore it without expectation of the price he gave for it; but as to that, he must take himself to his warrandice (expresse or implyed) to the seller, but if <hi>bona fide,</hi> he have sold it before he be questioned, he is free, and not oblieged to Restore it, though in so far as he is profited in receiving more for it, than he gave, he be lyable by the Obligation of Remunerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Recompence, of which anone. And as to the Fruits of that which is an others, the Obligation of Restitution, takes only place against the haver, where they are extant; and therefore, where they are neglected, or being reaped, have perished; yea, where they are consumed by the havers making use of them, the Obligation of Restitution takes no place, though the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Recompense hath place, in so far only, as by such Fruits, the haver conceiving them to be his own, is gainer, and in better condition, than if he had not had them; but if he have increased his spending, <hi>bona fide,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his having he is free, under his profiting comes his paying of his Debts, or even his Benificence, where it appears he would have gifted, whether such a thing had come to his hand or not; for in either case he is <hi>Locupseti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi> and must recompence; so that if he hath sold or delivered that which was an others, and which came to him without price, he is not oblieged to Restore the thing, but to recompence what he hath inriched himself by the price, and that without any question of the proportionable value of it to the thing.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. In the Enjoyments of Fruits, the Positive Law of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and of this, and most other Nations hath not only owned what is before said of Restoring, no more then that by which the haver hath profited; but have extended this much further, for utility and common quietness sake, that <hi>bonae fidei, possessor facit fructus perceptos, &amp; consumptos suos,</hi> whereby what Fruits he who hath possessed, <hi>bona fide,</hi> hath consumed, though he have profited, and been inriched thereby, he is not oblieged to restore the same, which doth much secure and quiet mens Enjoyments, that they may freely use and enjoy that, which, <hi>bona fide,</hi> they have; and to shun the hazard of their ruine, by answering for the bygone Fruits, or their great vexation in clearing, whether they be inriched thereby or not.</p>
                     <p>Amongst these Obligations, neither by Contract nor Delinquence, are commonly accompted the Obligations, which are incident to these who enter Heirs, or are Successours to others, whereby they are oblieged to perform all their Predecessours Obligations, and satisfie their Debts, in such manner as in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:109710:50"/>
Law is prescribed, and yet it is not by their own ingagement, nor by their fault, but by their fact of entering Heirs. Such also are the Obligations upon Executors, to satisfie the Children, and Relict, Legatars, or Debitors of Defuncts, by, or for whom they are intrusted, and indeed the Restitution of the Relicts part, is properly such; as also, the Legatars to whom the Right by the Legacy is transmitted ofttimes of peculiar things; the giving also to Children, or nearest of Kin, is a Restitution, because the property of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functs Goods, by his Will, expressed or presumed, is transmitted to them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death; but for payment of the Defuncts Debts, they are not properly by Restitution, because the Debitor had no property in the Goods, but an Obligation upon the Person, and they arise either from that Natural Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that lyes upon Children from their Parents ingagement, of which before: Or by the Naturall Obligation of Remuneration or Recompence, by which these Successours, in so far as they are profited by the Succession of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct, they must satisfie or recompence, and the Positive Law in some cases makes them lyable simply; yet in Equity they are lyable, in so far as they are gainers, <hi>secundum vires haereditatis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. In the Restitution of the Goods of others, though the ground thereof be the having of that which is to be Restored; yet if the haver cease to have through his own Fraud, his Delinquence therein oblieges him to Reparation, as if he still had it, according to the Maxime of Law, <hi>pro possessore habetur qui dolo desiit possidere,</hi> and this extendeth not only to the thing it self, which he must Restore, though he hath fraudently put it away, or at least the value of it; but also it extends to the Fruits which he hath injoyed, <hi>mala fide;</hi> and after he knew and had intimat to him the Right of another, so that such Fruits must be Restored, though the enjoyer become not the richer thereby.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. From the right of Restitution, ariseth the Action of Exhibition and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery; The Exhibition is but preparatory to the Delivery, that thereby the thing in question may be known to the Parties, Judge and Witnesses; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>majori inest minus,</hi> he that hath right to crave Delivery, hath much more right to crave the Production, or the Inspection. This Action may be Institute concerning any moveable things that can be conveyed before a Judge, or his Delegats, as if the question were of a Horse, if he be extant, he may be fitly craved to be Exhibit, that the Witnesses may be in the clearer capacity to Depone, to whom he doth belong; but the ordinary subject of this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is Exhibition and Delivery of Writes, wherein the Tenor and Stile of the Action is, that the Defender hath, or had, or fraudfully put away the thing in question, his having is probable by Witnesses, and relates not unto the time of Probation, but unto the time of the Citation; for, if after it the Defender had the thing in question, he ought to have acknowledged it; and if he have justly or necessarily put it away, or wanted it, he ought to have pleaded that as a defence, which therefore would exeem the Pursuer from Probation of the Libel, as being acknowledged by the defence, and so being omitted, and the Pursuer proving his Libel, the exception is not competent, but the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is accompted as a fraudful away-putter after Citation; so that this Defence, that the Writes in question were given to be Registrate, and were burnt in the Tolbooth, was found relevant and probable by the Members of Court, <hi>January</hi> 12. 1610. <hi>Patrick Home contra Wilson.</hi>

                     <p>There is a second Member in this Action, to wit, that the Defender at any time before the Citation, had the Writes in question, and fraudulently put them
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:109710:51"/>
away, and is therefore repute as haver of them, both these Members must be proven; for it will not be sufficient to prove that the Defender had the Writes before the Citation; but it also must be proven, that he fraudfully put them away; which therefore being a matter of Fraud, concerning the mind and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, is not probable by Witnesses, but by Write, or Oath of Party, <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 17. 1627. <hi>John Inglis contra Gilbert Kirkwood.</hi> 30 of <hi>January</hi> 1629.

Exhibition and Delivery is competent to any party in whose favours a Write is conceived, without necessity to prove that it was delivered, for that is presumed, if the Write be out of the granters hand, so that the granter is necessitat to prove, that the Writ was <hi>depositat</hi> upon terms not performed; or that it was lent, lost, Stollen, or passed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways from him, then by delivery: for prevention of which, the <hi>English</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome is good, that the Write bears, <hi>not only Signed and Sealed, but delivered before the Witnesses.</hi> But seing with us, delivery is presumed, it is ordinarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that the granter of the Write be called in the Exhibition, that he may be heard to propone any thing, that may take off the presumption; yet this will not be necessary in recovering Securities of Land, or other real Rights, especially if the Pursuer be in Possession. But in several cases, Writes are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual without Delivery; As <hi>First,</hi> Writes granted by Parents in favours of their Children, <hi>November</hi> 11. 1624.

Under the Obligation of Restitution, is comprehended the Obligation of Division, whereby what we possess in common with others, or indistinct from that which they possess, we are naturally oblieged to divide it with them, whensoever they desire to quite that Communion, for thereby we Restore what is their own, and we are not oblieged thereto by any Contract or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquence; It is true, the Contract for Society includeth the obliegement to divide, after the Society is ended; but Communion falleth many times, where there is no Society or Contract, as by Succession, Legacy, Gift, &amp;c. Hence arise these three Actions, frequent in the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, mainly, because Heretage did then befall to the nearest degree of Agnats, as now it doth not, <hi>viz. Actio familiae Hersiscundae, Actio de communi dividendo, &amp; Actio de finibus regundis.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> is the division of that which falls by Succession. The <hi>second,</hi> for division of that which is otherwise common. The <hi>third,</hi> for distinction, or clearing the marches of Contiguous Grounds. In these, either Party might be Pursuer, and he is held to be pursuer, who did first provoke to Judgement; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do chiefly concern Immoveable or Ground Rights, we shall say no more here of them.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THE Obligation of Remuneration, or Recompence, is that Bond of the Law of Nature, oblieging to do one good deed for another, and it comprehends, <hi>First,</hi> all Obligations of Gratitude, which are generally acknowledged by all Nations, and the breach thereof is abhorred, <hi>si ingratum dixeris, omnia dixeris;</hi> yet because the complaints of Ingratitude, are so frequent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clear, every one esteeming highly of the demerit of his own Actions; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore most of them are laid aside, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any legal remedy; for that which is done, <hi>animo donandi,</hi> though it doth induce an Obligation upon the mind and affection of the receiver to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; yet doth not bind to the like liberality, in case of necessity, but in few cases; as a Master, gifting Liberty upon this ground, did put an Obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Servant, who thereby became free: Whence also arose that Right of Patronage, of which before. But that is rather by a Positive Law, and tacit consent, as a Condition implyed in the Gift: So also in every Gift, there is a correspondent Duty of Gratitude; and therefore, by ingratitude the Donation becomes void and returns: But the matter is more clear when the Good Deed is done, not <hi>animo donandi,</hi> but of purpose, to obliege the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:109710:52"/>
of the Benefite to Recompence. Such are Obligations, <hi>Negotiorum Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storum:</hi> And generally the Obligations of Recompence, of what we are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by the damnage of others, without their purpose to Gift; or as the Law expresseth, <hi>in quantum locupletiores facti sumus ex damno alterius;</hi> It is a Rule in Law, <hi>Donatio non presumitur;</hi> and therefore, whatsoever is done, if it can receive any other construction then <hi>Donation,</hi> it is constructed accordingly. Whence ariseth that other Rule of Law, <hi>Debitor non praesumitur donare;</hi> So that any deed done by the Debitor, is either presumed to be in Security, or in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his Debt; as if he assign his Creditor to any thing due to him, or Dispone any thing to him, it is understood to be in Security or Payment, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Deed express to be a Donation, or done for love and favour; yea, Trust is rather presumed than Donation, as if a man take a Bond, Assigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Disposition, or other Right in another Mans name; it is held to be a trust, he may force that other to denude himself, if he was not Creditor to the Acquirer; yet these Rules have their Limitations; As <hi>first,</hi> Bonds, Assignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or other Rights, in the names of Children, <hi>unforisfamiliat,</hi> unprovided, are presumed to be Donations, because of the Parents Natural Affection, and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Obligation to provide Children, which was extended to some Goods and Money of a small value, delivered by a rich Brother who wanted Children, to his Brother who was no Merchant, which was presumed to be <hi>animo donan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> and was not imputed in part of an Annual Legacy, left thereafter by that rich Brother to the other, <hi>November</hi> 13. 1679. <hi>Anderson contra Anderson;</hi> yea, an Assignation to ones nearest of Kin, <hi>Mortis causa,</hi> was found a Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not in satisfaction of a Debt due to that Party, <hi>June</hi> 16. 1665. <hi>Crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shank contra Crookshank.</hi> And Bonds of Provision to Children, are not Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret in satisfaction of prior Bonds, but to be a further Addition; and so are any other Rights taken in name of Children, especially if <hi>unforisfamiliat:</hi> yet a Tocher in a Contract of Marriage, was found to be in satisfaction of all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Provision, though it did not so express, <hi>June</hi> 29. 1680. <hi>Francis Young contra Pape</hi> and <hi>Vauns.</hi> And Aliment to Children, is ordinarily interpret to be, <hi>ex pietate,</hi> and not to obliege, as was found in the case of a Mother, where the Children had no considerable Estate, <hi>February</hi> 2. 1672. Captain <hi>Guthry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi> the Laird of <hi>Mckerstoun</hi> and his Brother. The like, though the Mother was Married, Alimenting her Daughter, who was appearand Heir to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though she renounced to be Heir, <hi>July</hi> 16. 1667. <hi>Hamiltoun contra Simon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun.</hi> The like was found in the Mothers Father, Alimenting his Oye, <hi>July</hi> 21. 1665. Laird of <hi>Ludquharn contra</hi> Laird of <hi>Giht.</hi> And in the case of a Grand-mother, Alimenting her Oye in the Fathers Life, till she require the Father to take her home, <hi>January</hi> 11. 1681. <hi>Janet Gordoun contra Janet Lesly.</hi> Yet Aliment by a Sisters Husband, who was also Debitor, was not found to be a Donation, seing it began in Minority, and was continued after, though without paction, <hi>February</hi> 11. 1681. <hi>Margaret Spence contra Foulis</hi> of <hi>Ratho.</hi> And in all cases, Aliment or Intertainment given to any person with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paction, is presumed a Donation, if the person was Major, and capable to make agreement. But Intertainment to Minors or weak persons, doth ever infer Recompence, according to the true value of the Benefit received. And in the case of these who are in use to furnish Provisions for Money, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption ceaseth, and Recompence is due. In like manner, where more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are bound for the same Debt, when any one payeth the whole Debt, or more than his share, Recompence by way of relief, is due, although there be no Clause of relief; and generally, the delivery of any thing is not presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a Donation, but for Recompence, or Loan. And so though the delivery of Victual to an ordinary Buyer, or seller of Victual, was found to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:109710:53"/>
infer the ordinary price, though no agreement or price was proven, unless the receiver instruct another cause of the delivery, <hi>June</hi> 15. 1677. <hi>David Home contra Jamison.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Likeways the Obligation betwixt <hi>Negotiators,</hi> and these to whose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove they <hi>Negotiat,</hi> tying to Recompence, what others without our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Knowledge, or Presence, have necessarily, or profitably done for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on of our Affairs, these Deeds must be done without Command, or Commission; otherways they come in the nature of the Contract, <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat</hi> or <hi>Commission;</hi> yea, what is done in our presence, with our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in our Affairs, is repute, as with our tacit Consent and Commission, <hi>Nam qui tacet, consentire videtur;</hi> These must also be done for the carrying on of our Affairs; For <hi>Negotiators</hi> cannot begin any new Business, but only carry on that which is begun, and they must be necessarily or profitably done; otherwise he hath his Labour for his Pains, and he that set him on Work must pay him his Expenses. And last, though these Deeds may be done without our Knowledge or Consent; yet may they not be contrary to our Will and Command; for such obtruders can expect no Recompence, <hi>L: Final. C. de negotiis gestis;</hi> though no Positive Law hinder, we may be liable even to such, <hi>in quantum facti sumus locupletivres.</hi> But the obliegement to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiators</hi> is greater; for, if they do that which is necessary or profitable, for carrying on our Affairs, though by some accident, that Affair may perish, or miscarry, and we no richer, but it may be poorer, yet are we oblieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The ground of these Obligations, is, because it is frequent for men to go abroad upon their Affairs, supposing quickly to return, and leave no <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat</hi> for managing of them; and yet being detained from them beyond expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, they may be easily lost; For instance, some Redemptions must be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptor, and the failer therein hath a great inconvenience; or the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of some great Bargain, a great part whereof is already done; and the not perfecting the rest, loseth the whole; or the management of any work of great profit, that for want of some pains or expenses might be lost. These who interpose themselves in such cases, do necessarily and profitably for the good of the absent, and so are under no Delinquence, neither are they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to gift their pains and expenses, nor have they any Conventional Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon their part: And yet though there were no Positive Law for it, the very Light of Nature would teach, it ought to be Recompenced; and therefore, can be no other then an Obediential, or Natural Obligation, by the Authority of God, and our obedience to him, <hi>Grotius, l.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. <hi>de Jure Belli</hi> §. 8. doth not own this Obligation as Natural, but as arising, <hi>Ex lege civili nullum enim</hi> (saith he) <hi>habet eorum fundamentorum, ex quibus natura Obligationem inducit;</hi> but the contrary appeareth, not only from what is said, but by the Testimony of the Law it self, which reckons the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, <hi>Negotiorum Gestorum;</hi> not amongst Contracts, or Obligations, or Actions, <hi>ex lege;</hi> but amongst these which are, <hi>ex quasi contractu.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That this Obligation is effectual, if it be profitably carryed on, though the success answer not, is acknowledged in Law, and set forth by an excellent Species, by <hi>Ulpian, l.</hi> 10. §. 1. <hi>F. de negotiis gestis;</hi> It justifieth (saith he) if the <hi>Negotiator</hi> did profitably act, although the Affair had not the effect; as if he had Cured a sick Servant, if not with standing the Cure, the Servant died, he hath this Action.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From this Obligation there arise Mutual Actions, the one direct, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:109710:53"/>
he whose Affair is managed, craveth Accompt, and Restitution of the <hi>Negotiator,</hi> and Reparation of what he hath done amiss; and the contrair Action to the <hi>Negotiator,</hi> whereby he craveth Recompence, and Satisfaction of what he hath profitably expended, and for his labour and pains, but the Action is valid on either part, whether intended, <hi>directe,</hi> or <hi>utiliter, l. Actio ff.</hi> 47. <hi>de negotiis gestis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. The <hi>Negotiator</hi> is holden, not only to answer for Fraud, but, <hi>pro cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae levi,</hi> for his fault, though light; yea, if any other <hi>Negotiator</hi> offered, whom he excluded for the lightest, he may be made also to follow forth his Negotiation, according to that Precept, <hi>Susceptum perfice munus;</hi> but this, and the exactness of diligence, is induced by Positive Law; Equity leaving the <hi>Negotiator</hi> free, if he hath acted profitably, though he might have acted more profitably, in making his Party lyable to him according to his acting.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The other Obligation of Recompence, is, for that whereby we are inriched by anothers Means, without purpose of Donation, which is only presumed in few Cases, even he who <hi>mala fide,</hi> buildeth upon another Mans Ground, or repaireth unnecessarly his House, is not presumed to do it, <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo donandi,</hi> but hath Recompence by the owner, <hi>in quantum lucratus, l.</hi> 38. <hi>ff. de haereditatis petitione.</hi> This Remuneration is a most Natural Obligation, as <hi>Cicero, l.</hi> 3. <hi>de officiis,</hi> Sayeth, that it is against Nature, for a man, of anothers damnage, to increase his profite: And again, Justice suffers not that with the spoil of others, we should augment our riches; and therefore, this is a common exception in all Positive Laws, that every one should be holden, <hi>in quantum locupletior factus sit.</hi> So Pupils, though they cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liege themselves by Contract, yet if they receive that which is anothers, they are lyable to Recompence, <hi>in quantum locupletiores facti, l. sed mihi ff. commodati.</hi> Minors also, though by Positive Law, they are not lyable for what they borrow, and receive, and mispend, yet they are lyable, <hi>in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum locupletiores facti sunt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Hence arises the Action in Law, <hi>de in rem verso;</hi> whereby whatsoever turneth to the profite of any, makes him thereby lyable, though without any ingagement of his own. We are inriched, either by Accession, of Gain, or Prevention of loss: Whence is the Obligation of Contribution, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up Goods, thrown out to lighten Ships, whereby Shipwrack, and the loss of all is prevented, <hi>Lege Rodia de jactu, ff. l.</hi> 2. by which, whatsoever is thrown out to lighten a Ship, for preventing Shipwrack, is to be satisfied by the Contribution, of all who enjoy that common benefite of Safety from Shipwrack, proportionally according to the value of what is thereby saved. wherein the owners of the Ship, bear their share, <hi>l.</hi> 2. §. 2. <hi>eodem,</hi> wherein not only Jewels, though of small weight, but even the Clothes and Rings of Passengers, bear a share, <hi>Ibidem,</hi> and the Master of the Ship may detain their Goods till their share be payed, <hi>l.</hi> 2. §. 1. <hi>codem;</hi> which holds also, when there is hazard of Naufrage, by entering a shallow River, or Port, if a part of the Goods be put in a Boat, and perish, the value thereof is to be satisfied by Contribution. Contribution is also made, for what is pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Redemption of Ships from Pirats, which is not extended to things taken away by Pirats, or Robbers out of Ships, <hi>l.</hi> 2. §. 3. <hi>eodem.</hi> This, <hi>Lex Rodia,</hi> is now become a Law of Nations, as commonly received by all, for its expediency to prevent Shipwrack, and to incourage Merchants to throw out their Goods, seing thereby they will but bear their share of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:109710:54"/>
loss. But this Law is not Declaratory of pure Equity, and doth hold by Custome; otherways, what any Party doth for his own profite, though it have a consequential advantage to others, it will not obliege them to bear a share of the Expenses, nor will it be interpret as, <hi>Negotium <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

It was found, that to evite Captor by a Privateer, a Skipper having by consent of some Merchants aboard, and of the Company, made a hole in the Bottom of the Ship, that he might run near the Shoar at a Creik, and opening the hole, make the Ship so far sink, that she could not be carryed off by the Privateer; yet that Privateer having reached her near the Shoar, but before the hole was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and having agreed for a Ransome, for which the Merchants Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, the Ship having been Wracked five days after by a Storm, which she might have prevented, by going off before the Storm arose, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Passengers, were not found lyable for Contribution of their shares for the loss of the Ship, <hi>July</hi> 15. 1680. <hi>Lesly</hi> and <hi>Millars contra Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, Weir,</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. From the natural Obligation of Recompence, doth arise the Obligation of Relief, whereby when many persons are oblieged, <hi>in solidum,</hi> and thereby ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, conjunctly and severally, payment or satisfaction made by one, for more then his own share, doth obliege all the rest, <hi>pro rata,</hi> although there be no conventional Clause of relief, nor any Law nor Statute, but the natural Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Recompence; for he who payed, not only for himself, but for others, is not presumed to do it, <hi>animo donandi,</hi> as was found in the Case of <hi>Co-princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals, June</hi> 19. 1662.

AMONGST Obligations Obediential, we have placed these, which are by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquence, because they arise without any Convention, Consent, or Contract, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particularly, or by vertue of any Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Law; and therefore, they must needs have their Original from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Will of God, and of our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence due thereto; for, though they do proceed from our Fact, and from our Will, whence that Fact is voluntarly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet it is not from our Contracting Will; and therefore, these Obligations do not receive their measure, or extent by our will.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That Obligations of Delinquence, are introduced by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Suffrage of all Men, and all Nations will evince, who do every where acknowledge the Reparation of Damnages, and Punishment of Crimes, and Injuries, as having by Nature, a clear Evidence, and sharp Sense there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and thereupon, can without Reluctancy, concur with the Magistrate in the Punishment of Citizens, and of Enemies by the sword.</p>
                     <p>But it may be doubted, how the Law of Nature, which is perpetual, and had place chiefly in Innocency, can prescribe any thing in relation to Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency, or Malifice, which was not to be found in that condition. This will be easily cleared, if it be considered, that though Man was made in the state of Innocency; yet had he a natural Instability, for which God did warn and arm him; and though the Principal, and direct Law of Nature, did teach Man, <hi>to love his Neighbour as himself;</hi> yet he could not but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence know (though he had stood in Innocency, as do the Angels) that any who acted against that Royal Law of Love, by doing evil to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and taking away from him that which is his, ought to Repair him, and to be lyable to Divine Justice, which is that Certification, which God put upon his Natural Law, as he did more expresly upon the forbidden Fruit, <hi>morte morieris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. An Obligation of Delinquence, is then, that whereunto Injury, or Malifice doth obliege, as the meritorious cause thereof, as the Will of God thereupon is the efficient cause; and it is twofold, either that which relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to God, or that which relateth to Man; the former is the Obligation of Punishment, Pain, or Penalty; for unto God, there can properly no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration be made by the Creature, whose duty and service is due to him: so that to him the Creature is oblieged to underly the Punishment. In refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Man is, the Obligation of Reparing his Damnage, putting him in as good condition as he was in before the Injury, and this only is Mans part for himself; for the inflicting of Punishment is for God, in so far as it is Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized, or allowed by him: but it is not for, or from Man of himself, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge is mine, and I will repay, saith the Lord:</hi> For, as hath been said before, an Obligation in the Debitor, hath a correspondent power of exaction in the Creditor, which is the personal Right. So in Delinquence, the power of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:109710:55"/>
exaction of Reparation of his Damnage, is Mans for himself: but the power of exacting Punishment, is in God; and, as for him, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But how far Mans Natural Duties, or the Magistrats, in the Punishment of Crimes reacheth, the Lines of the Law of Nature, are become dark in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Points. It is manifest, and agreed by all, that though in all Damnages done to man, there are also Punishments which may be inflicted by God: yet, where the matter is chiefly Mans Interest, and so Repairable to him; none will think, that it is a duty in all of these cases, to inflict vengeance on such; neither doth any own a Power, and necessity to inflict Punishments for Mans Spiritual Delinquence, standing in his Mind and Affection, as for want of Love, and Confidence, Hope, &amp;c. In somethings also, the power of Punishment is no less evident, even when there can be no Reparation to man, as in that general Precept, of equal Crimes and Punishments, <hi>Life for Life, Eye for Eye, Tooth for Tooth,</hi> &amp;c. But there are many middle Crimes, that are much more unclear, wherein the Word of God, even in the Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Law, is an excellent Light; for we may safely conclude, that it would be no Injustice or Intrusion, for man to vindicate these Crimes for the Lord, which-himself gave order to Revenge. But our purpose being here, only to insist in private Rights, we shall not follow these, nor the many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Questions that rise on that matter; but shall return to the private Rights of Men, arising to them by Delinquence, by exacting Reparation of their Damnages inferred thereby.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Damnage is called, <hi>damnum a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        </gap> by which Man hath less then he had. It is not every Damnage that raiseth this Obligation; for, some Damnages may be just, as these which are inflicted by way of Punishment; and others may have their Reparation arising from Contracts, whereby, though a Delinquence may arise, in non-performance of the Contract; yet the Original Cause of the Obligation is the Contract. Some also arise from deeds or things, the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance whereof is also a Delinquence, as in the Obligations of Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and Recompence: but here are only understood, Obligations which Originally arise from Delinquences, as the first Cause thereof.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:109710:56"/>
4. Delinquence in the <hi>Romon</hi> Law, is reduced into these four, <hi>furtum, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina, damnum, injuria;</hi> all which are separate from the publick Crimes, wherein we shall not insist, but follow Delinquences privat, and Obligations and Actions thence arising, as they are known by the Terms in our Law, in so far as they use to be civilly prosecute; for though in publick Crimes, which are Criminally pursued, there is competent Reparation, either from the Nature of the Crime, or from Law or Custome; yet that is incident unto a publick Right, and not ordinar, it shall in general suffice here to consider, that according to several Rights and Injoyments, our Damnages and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquencies, may be esteemed.</p>
                     <p>As first, our Life, and Members, and Health; which, though they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteemable, and can have no Price, yet there are therewith incident Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, and that either <hi>lucrum cessans,</hi> ceasing gain; or <hi>damnum emergens,</hi> loss. So the Life of any being taken away, the Damnage of these who were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and maintained by his Life, as his Wife and Children, may be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. So likewise, the loss any man hath by the expenses of his Cure, or the loss of his Labour, and Industry in his Affairs, is also Reparable.</p>
                     <p>Next to our Life, is our Liberty, and the Delinquences against it, are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint and Constraint; though Liberty it self be inesteemable, yet the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages sustained through these Delinquences, are Reparable.</p>
                     <p>The third is Fame, Reputation and Honour, which is also in some way Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable; <hi>First,</hi> by making up the Damnage that is inferred in Mens Goods, by the hurt of then Fame, whereby their Gain ceaseth, in that being repute such Persons, they are disinabled for their Affairs; as if a Merchant be called a Bankrupt, it may not only hinder his Traffique, but make all his Creditors fall upon him suddenly to his ruine: so if a Man be called a Cheater, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, or the like, it disables him to mannage his Affairs, Men being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to medle with such. And if a Man being about to Marry, be called Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, or to be infected with any noisom Disease, he may be Demnified in his Match and Tocher: such Actions upon Injurious Words, as they may relate to Damnage and Means, are frequent and curious among the <hi>English;</hi> but with us, there is little of it accustomed to be pursued, though we own the same Grounds, and would proceed to the same effects with them, if que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Damnage in Fame or Honour, is Repaired by Homage, acknowledgement, or Ignominy put upon the Delinquent. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent Honour, and Vindication of the Injured. Slander is competent to be Judged by Commissars; and therefore, a Decreet of the Commissars of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> upon a pursuit for Slander and Defamation, decerning the Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer to make acknowledgement of the Injury before the Congregation, and to pay an hundred Pounds <hi>Scots</hi> to the Party, and as much to the Poor, was sustained by the Lords, <hi>February</hi> 5. 1669. <hi>James Deans contra Alexander Bothwel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> Interest that may be Damnified, is our Content, Delight, or Satisfaction; and especially by the singular Affection to, or our opinion of, the value or worth of any thing that owners have: in which conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration it is said, that every thing is to every Man as he esteemeth it, and though this be not the Intrinsick Value of the thing, nor the common Rate of it in the accompt of Men, but <hi>praetium affectionis,</hi> the Rate that the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the owner puts upon it; yet, that being free to him, and his Right, his Damnage therein ought to be Repaired, according to the value himself,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:109710:56"/>
esteemed the thing taken from him worth: on this Ground, in most Actions in the Civil Law, wherein there is force, or Attrocious Injury, Reparation is to be made, according to the reasonable estimation of the injured; and therefore, he hath, <hi>juramentum in litem,</hi> his Oath to declare how much he accounted himself damnified; the exorbitancy whereof, might have been taxed by the Judge: but otherways, though his estimation be much above the common value, it were receivable. This hath also place with us, as in Actions of Spuilzie, &amp;c. and other Delinquences by violence.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>last</hi> Damnage is in Goods and Possession, the Redress whereof, is more clear, because the things themselves are more valuable and esteemable. In all Reparations, the Natural Fruits and Profits of the thing taken away, come in as part thereof: and in many cases, the Industrial Fruits and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, which the owner might have had, at least used to make thereof.</p>
                     <p>Reparation is either by Restitution of the same thing, in the same case, that it would have been in, if it had remained with the owner, and this is most exact: or, where that cannot be, by giving the like value, or that which is nearest to make up the Damnage, according to the desire of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified; and if none be found fitter, Reparation must be made in Money, which is the common token of exchange, and hath in it the value of every thing esteemable.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In the Reparation of Delinquences, it would be considered, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have a hand in it, who come in to be lyable, and how far; for in some cases, the Delinquence is committed by one principally, and others are but accessory: in other cases the Delinquence is equally and principally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by more, though unto these also, there may be accessories.</p>
                     <p>Accession to Delinquence, is either Anterior, Concomitant, or Posterior to the Delinquence it self: Anterior, is either by Counsel, Instigation, or Provocation, or by Connivance, in foreknowing, and not hindering these whom they might, or ought to have stopped; and that either special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in relation to one singular Delinquence, or generally, in knowing and not restraining, the common and known inclination of the actors towards Delinquences of that kind; as when a Master keeps outragious and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Servants, or Beasts; and therefore, in many cases, even by Natural Equity, the Master is lyable for the Damnage done by his Beast, as is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resolved in the Judicial Law, in the case of <hi>the pushing oxe, which if it was accustomed that he pushed before-times, the owner is lyable for the damnage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as being oblieged to restrain: but if not, he is free.</hi> So the like may be said of Mastives, and other Dogs, if they be accustomed to assault Men, their Goods, or Cattel, and be not destroyed, or restrained, their owner is lyable.</p>
                     <p>Hence also is that Famous Edict of the Pretor, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, <hi>Nuntae caupones stabularii, quod salvum fore receperunt nisi restituant in eos judicium dabo,</hi> by which the Masters of Taverns, Stables, or Ships, are lyable for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution (of what is brought in upon the account of their Imployments) of the Damnages that may be sustained by their Servants, or any other that shall happen to be there for the time.</p>
                     <p>Concomitant Accession is, when the Accessories are not equally concurrent in the Act, but countenance, or otherways assist, abett, cherish, praise, or connive at the Delinquence. Posterior Accession, is by Ratihabition, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,

As to the Obligation of Punishment, of many concurring Delinquents, if an Army, or a part of it in a Mutiny, all shoot at on Person, if he be killed, it would not be thought just, for that ones life, to take the lives of all; and therefore, because it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known whose Ball killed the man, it is accustomed, and not without good ground, by lot, to single out who are to suffer, and the rest are free; from whence it may be gathered, as in the Punishment, so in Reparation, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Delinquents, <hi>socii criminis,</hi> are to concur in the Reparation, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in the Action; though, as hath been said, Positive Law doth well to make all lyable, <hi>in solidum;</hi> yet so, that the satisfaction of one or more, libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats the rest. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the Accessory Delinquents, though Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents by Command, be numbered among them, yet (as we say) he doeth, that causeth do; therefore such are propper Efficients, though mediat; and therefore, no less lyable then Concurrents.</p>

By this Act of Sederunt, the Lords declare, that according to the Power given to them to set down Orders for Administration of Justice, meaning to follow and practise the good and commendable Laws, Civil and Canon, made against Fraudful Alienations, in prejudice of Creditors, against the Authors and Partakers of such Fraud, that they wil Decern all Alienations, Dispositions, Assignations and Translations, made by the debitor of any of his Lands, Teinds, Reversions, Actions, Debts, or Goods whatsomever, to any conjunct and confident Person, without true, just and necessary Causes, and without a just price, really payed, the same being done after contracting of lawful Debts, to have been from the beginning null, by way of Action or Exception, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further Declarator, but prejudice to purchasers of the Bankrupts Lands and Goods, for just and competent Prices, or in satisfaction of their lawful Debts, from the Interposed Persons: But the Receiver of the Price from the Buyer, shall be holden to make it forthcoming to the Creditors: and it shall be sufficient to prove by Write, or Oath of the Receiver of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position from the Bankrupt, that the same was made without a true and just Cause, or that the Lands and Goods being sold by him that bought them from the Dyver, that the most part of the Price was converted, or to be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Bankrupts profit and use: And in case the Bankrupt, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed Person, shall make any voluntar Payment, or Right to any Person, he shall be holden to make the same forthcoming to the Creditor, having used the first lawful Diligence, and he shall be preferred to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creditor, who being posterior to him in diligence, hath obtained payment by the partial favour of the Debitor, or his interposed Confident; and shall recover from the said Creditor, what he hath so obtained: But what the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed Person hath payed, or assigned to the Bankrupts lawful Creditor, before preferable diligence done by others, shall be allowed to him, and he shall be lyable to make forthcoming the rest of the price: Yea, the saids Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts, and interposed Persons, and all others who shall give Counsel and Assistance, in devising and practizing the Fraud, shall be holden infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, incapable of Honour, Dignity, or Office, or to be Witnesses, or As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syzers.</p>

                        <hi>First</hi> then, though the Statute be only in favours of anterior Creditors, for anulling posterior Deeds; yet it is not exclusive of other Remeids, for anulling Deeds done in defraud of Creditors, though contracting after these Deeds, where Fraud in the design doth evidently appear, whereof we have now instanced several Decisions. So a Bond granted by a Father to a Son, <hi>forisfamiliat,</hi> payable after the Fathers Death, was Reduced at the Instance of the Fathers posterior Creditors, continuing Traffick with him; <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 1669. <hi>Pott contra Pollock.</hi> And a Bond payable only by the granters Heir, if he had no Heir of his own Body, was Reduced as Fraudulent, <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> 24. 1677. <hi>Blair</hi> of <hi>Ardblair contra Wilson.</hi> And a Disposition of Lands, purchased by a Merchant to his Son, was found Affectable for the Debts of Merchants Strangers, who began to Trade with the Father before the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and continued after, even as to the posterior Debts, seing the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continued still to act as Proprietar, though by his Compt Book, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared he knew himself to be Insolvent: And though the Sons Infeftment was publick and Registrat, which stranger Merchants were not oblieged to know, <hi>July</hi> 2. 1673. <hi>Street</hi> and <hi>Jackson contra Masson.</hi> Yea, an Infeftment by a Father to his eldest Son, an Infant was reduced at the Instance of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterior Creditors his neighbours; where the Seasing was Registrat, seing the Register was carried out of the Countrey, and the Father continued to act, not as Liferenter, but as Proprietar, <hi>December</hi> 4. 1673. <hi>Reid</hi> of <hi>Bullochmyle contra Reid</hi> of <hi>Daldillin.</hi> And generally, Latent Rights amongst confident persons, are reduceable by posterior Creditors: But the Liferent of the whole Conquest of a Merchant, provided in a Contract of Marriage to his Wife, being an ordinary Clause, was not found fraudulent, <hi>February</hi> 10. 1674. <hi>Marion Gray contra</hi> the Son and Creditors of her Husband.</p>

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> though this Statute bears all Alienations, without Cause onerous, in prejudice of prior Creditors to be null, <hi>ab initio,</hi> and without declarator by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, or reply: Yet Custome hath found this inconsistent with the nature of Infeftments, which cannot be reduced, till they be first produced, and all the Authors called, which cannot be by way of exception, but by action.

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though the Title of this Statute, and much of the Body of it be against the Alienations of Bankrupts, in prejudice of their Creditors: yet the Statutory part declares against all Alienations to any conjunct or confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent person, without a just price, being in prejudice of anterior Creditors to be anulled, which hath always been extended, not only to Dispositions of Bankrupts, made to confident persons, but to any person without a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent price, or equivalent cause onerous; and therefore, such gratuitous Deeds are reduceable by anterior Creditors, though the granter was not then Bankrupt, as a broken Merchant flying: But if he were before, or did by these fraudulent Deeds become insolvent, <hi>Hope,</hi> Usury, <hi>Pringle contra Ker.

the Reversions may be equivalent to all his Debt: Yet anterior Creditors may reduce gratuitous deeds done by such persons, being more fit that ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Creditors should be preferred, and the obtainers of these gratuitous Rights should be put to recur upon the Reversions, by their warrandice, <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> 10. 1665.

                     <p>But there is nothing in this Statute, or by Custome, to anull any gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous deed in favours of Wives, Children or Strangers, if at the time of the granting and delivery thereof, the granter had an Estate sufficient for these, and all his Debts unaffected by Appryzing, Adjudication, or Arrestment.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Though this Statute requires a just price, it did not anull a Disposition, though a prior Creditor offered a greater price, if the price re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived was the ordinary Rate of the Countrey; and though there was a personal Reversion to the Disponers eldest Son only, <hi>January</hi> 16. 1677.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Though the Statute mentions only the anulling of Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. yet it is ordinarly extended to Bonds, or obliegements, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Appryzing, Adjudication, or Arrestment follow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Though Dispositions or other Rights be, fore equivalent Causes Onerous: yet by the posterior part of the Statute, they are accompted frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent and reducible, if the Bankrupt, or the interposed person in Trust, do by voluntar gratification, prefer one Creditor to another, who hath done more timeous and lawful diligence: where by, Bankrupt, is not only to be understood a notour Bankrupt, but any person insolvent, or by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference becoming insolvent, or who hath not a sufficient visible inaffected Estate, for his other Creditors. But where a Debitor of an intear Estate, pays his lawful Creditor, or satisfies him by Dispositions, or Assignations, neither the Tenor nor Extention of the Statute reacheth these Cases; albeit there be inchoat and incompleat Diligence, at the Instance of other Creditors.</p>

                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Where that Clause of the Statute bears the annulling of Deeds done in gratification, or preference of one Creditor to another, who hath done more timeous Diligence by Inhibition, Horning, Arrestment, Compryzing, or other lawful mean, duly to affect the Dyvers Lands, or Goods, or Price thereof; the meaning is, that when these Diligences are not compleat, but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choat, and the Creditor is, <hi>in cursu diligentiae;</hi> the Debitor or his Trustee, cannot prevent the course of that Diligence, by preferring another Creditor, doing less Diligence: For, if the meaning were, of Appryzing, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by Infeftment, or Arrestment, by Decreet, to make forthcoming, there needed not this remeid; for these Diligences being compleat, would exclude any other posterior Disposition or Diligence: Yea, Inhibition, if the Executions were compleat and Registrat, would of it self be effectual to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, <hi>ex capite inhibitionis:</hi> But if these Diligences be only Inchoat, as if the Inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor had begun his Execution; but had not compleated it at all the Mercat Crosses requisite, any Disposition, Infeftment, or other real Right made to another Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, <hi>medio tempore,</hi> less vigilent, is anullable thereby, <hi>December</hi> 15. 1665. and <hi>February</hi> 27. 1667. Mr. <hi>John Eleis contra Keith</hi> and <hi>Wishart.</hi> Or if Lands be Denunced to be Appryzed, or Summonds of Adjudication be execute, Rights thereafter made to other Creditors doing less Diligence, <hi>in cursu dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentiae,</hi> with the first, are thereby reducible, although done before the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet of Apprysing or Infeftment: But Inhibition, Apprysing, or Adjudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Inchoat,</hi> have no effect as to Moveable Rights, not being as the Statute requires, Diligences duely to affect that subject. Neither doth the laying on of Arrestment affect Heretable Rights, and so cannot hinder the Debitor to Dispone these to lawful Creditors, doing less Diligence: But Horning is a Diligence, relating both to the Moveable Estate, by single Escheat, and the Heretable Estate, by Liferent Escheat; and therefore, after the Charge of Horning it is effectual, <hi>February</hi> 12. 1675. <hi>Veach contra</hi> the Executors of <hi>Ker</hi> and <hi>Pallat. July</hi> 18. 1677. <hi>Murray</hi> of <hi>Kilor contra Drummond</hi> of <hi>Machany.

                     <p>But this Statute will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Neither will Dispositions, or other Rights for equivalent Causes One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, made to Creditors, be anulled, if not done, <hi>in cursu diligentiae;</hi> but if the Con-creditor insist not in his <hi>Inchoat</hi> Dillgence, till it be compleat, he hath not the benefit of the Statute, <hi>vigilantibus, non dormientibus jura subveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt;</hi> and therefore, a Disposition was not Reduced at the Instance of a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, who had Appryzed before the Disposition, but for several years had neither obtained Infeftment, nor charged the Superior, <hi>February</hi> 8. 1681. <hi>John Neilson contra Ross</hi> of <hi>Pittendreich.</hi> But how long this negligence must be to exclude it, must necessarily be, <hi>in arbitrio judicis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this Clause of the Statute will not anull Dispositions made to buyers, for a just price payed, where the price was not an anterior Debt due to the buyer; for there, there is not preference of one Creditor to another, but a lawful Bargain in Commerce, where the buyer neither doth, nor can know <hi>Inchoat</hi> Diligences, but only such as are compleat and Registrat, except in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:109710:62"/>
the case where the Subject becomes Litigious, which is not to be extended to every diligence, in prejudice of Puchasers of Lands, whereby Rights would become very uncertain, especially when Irredeemable Rights are purchased; but against the purchasing of Bonds, Annualrents, or Wodsets, it may be more extended as in the former case, <hi>February</hi> 8. 1681. <hi>Neilson con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Ross</hi> of <hi>Pittendreich.</hi> This Defence was also sustained, that the Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was for a price payed, and for no anterior Debt. And in the former case, <hi>Bathgate contra Bogil,</hi> the Disposition after Horning, though it was in the terms of sale, was only anulled, because it was granted for anterior Debts, due to the buyer.</p>
                     <p>Fraud is no <hi>vitium reale,</hi> affecting the Subject, but only the committer of the Fraud, and these who are partakers of the Fraud, as is clear by this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, bearing an exception of lawful Purchasers, not partakers of the Fraud. But where the Right purchased, hath evidence of Fraud in it self, the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser, though for a just price payed, is thereby partaker of the Fraud, and so may be excluded, as if the Right acquired bore, <hi>for love and favour:</hi> or if it be betwixt conjunct persons, the Purchaser must instruct the Cause One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; as when the Right purchased was from one Brother to another, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 28. 1679. <hi>Gordoun</hi> of <hi>

As to Dispositions by Parents to Children, but by Brothers and Sisters to Brothers, or to Good-Brothers and Good-Sisters: yet not to two persons Marrying two Sisters, or two Brothers, where there is but <hi>affinitas affinitatis:</hi> It hath also been extended to Uncle and Nephew, where other Circumstances concurred, <hi>January</hi> 18. 1678. <hi>Kinloch</hi> of <hi>Gourdy contra</hi> Mr. <hi>George Blair.

                     <p>The like effect is in Rights, acquired in name of Children in the Family, who have no visible Estate, for these are held fraudulent, and may be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Fathers Debt, as hath been frequently decided.</p>
                     <p>This Case only remains, whither a notour Bankrupt may prefer one Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor to another, though neither have done Diligence. The Tenor of the Statute favours the Negative, annulling Alienations by Bankrupts, not being for an equivalent and necessar Cause; and therefore, it is not safe to purchase from such, even by buying.</p>

                     <p>FROM Obligations Obediential, flowing from the Will of God; Order leads us over to Obligations Conventional, arising from the Will of Man, whereby our own Will tyeth us in that, wherein God hath left us free; for as Obligations Obedienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al descend from the Principle of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, and have their Rise and Reason from his Soveraign Power to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and our absolute obliegement to Obey; so in his gracious goodness, in the greatest part, he hath left us free, and hath given power to none to exact, or compel us: Yet so as he hath given that liberty in our power, that we may give it up to others, or restrain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage it, whereby God oblieges us to performance, by mediation of our own will; yet such Obligations, as to their Original, are Conventional, not Obediential.</p>
                     <p>Conventional Obligations do arise from our Will and Consent; for as in the beginning hath been shown, the Will is the only Faculty constituting Rights, whether real or personal; for it is the will of the owner, that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally transferreth Right from him to the acquirer: So in personal Rights, that freedom we have of disposal of our selves, our actions, and things which naturally is in us, is by our ingagement, placed in another, and so ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:109710:68"/>
is a diminution of freedom, and constituting of power in another, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may restrain, or constrain to the doing or performing of that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have given him power of exaction, as in the Debitor, it is the Debitors duty or necessity to perform; but it is not every act of the will that raiseth an Obligation, or power of exaction; and therefore, that it may appear, what act of it is Obligatory,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We must distinguish three acts in the will, <hi>Desire, Resolution</hi> and <hi>Ingagement;</hi> desire is a tendency or inclination of the will towards its object, and it is the first motion thereof, which is not sufficient to constitute a Right; neither is resolution (which is a determinate purpose to do that which is desired) efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; because, whatsoever is resolved or purposed, may be without fault al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, unless by accident the matter be necessar, or that the resolution be holden forth to assure others: the alteration whereof, without evident ground, importeth levity and inconstancy, and sometimes deceit and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness: but still resolution is but an act of the will with it self, as deliberation is of the understanding, acting with it self; and it is unquestionable, nothing can be oblieged to it self, though it be oblieged to God, or an other in relation to it self; and therefore, if a party should express a resolution, to give unto, or bestow upon an other any thing, though that resolution related to the good of an other; yet it is not Obligatory, nor can that other compel the resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to perform, though it were never so fully cleared, or confirmed by word or write. It was found, that a resolution exprest both by word and write, in favours of near relations, did infer no Obligation, <hi>February</hi> 27. 1673. Mr. <hi>John Kincaid contra</hi> Mr. <hi>Alexander Dickson.</hi> It remaineth then, that the only act of the will, which is efficacious, is that, whereby the will conferreth or stateth a power of exaction in an other, and thereby becomes ingaged to that other to perform.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Again, we must distinguish betwixt Promise, Pollicitation, or Offer, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Contract; the difference amongst which, is this, that the Obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act of the will, is sometime absolute and pure, and sometime conditional, wherein the condition relates either unto the obligation it self, or to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, such are the ordinar conditional Obligations; which, though they be presently (upon the granting thereof) binding, and cannot be recalled; yet they are only to be performed, and have effect when the condition shall be existent, but when the condition is relating to the constituting of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, then the very Obligation it self is pendent, till the condition be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and till then it is no Obligation; as when any offer or tender is made, there is implyed a Condition, that before it become Obligatory, the party to whom it is offered, mustaccept; and therefore, an offer by a Son, to pay a Debt due by his Mother, if it were made known to be accepted at such a time, and in such a place, found not Obligator after the Mothers death, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it had been so accepted, <hi>June</hi> 24. 1664. <hi>Alexander Allan contra</hi> Mr. <hi>John Collier.</hi> So then, an offer accepted is a Contract, because it is the deed of two, the offerer and accepter.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But a Promise is that which is simple and pure, and hath not implyed as a Condition, in its being the acceptance of another, in this <hi>Grotius</hi> differeth, <hi>de jure belli l.</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 11. §, 14. holding, <hi>that acceptance is necessar to every Conventional Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in equity, without consideration of positive Law;</hi> and to prevent that obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous objection, that Promises are made to Absents, Infants, Idiots, or persons not yet born, who cannot accept; and therefore, such Obligations should
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:109710:68"/>
ever be Revockable, till their acceptation, which in some of them can never be: he answereth, that the Civil Law withholdeth, that such offers cannot be revocked, until these be in such capacity, as to accept or refuse; though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises now be commonly held Obligatory, the Canon Law having taken off the exception of the Civil Law, <hi>de nudo pacto;</hi> It is true, if he in whose fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours they are made, accept not, they become void, not by the Negative none acceptance, but by the contrair rejection: for as the will of the Promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er constitutes a Right in the other; so the others will by renouncing, and, rejecting that Right, avoids it, and makes it <hi>return.</hi> This also quadrats with the nature of a Right, which consisteth in a faculty or power, which may be in these, who exerce no act of will about it, nor know not of it, so Infants truely have right as well as men, though they do not know, nor cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erce it themselves: Promises with us are not probable by Witness, though within an hundred Pounds, <hi>July</hi> 3. 1668. <hi>James Donaldson contra Harrower.

                           </gap> contra Thomas Robertson.</hi> The like was found of a Promise ingaging for a Party, who bought Goods, not being a partner in the bargain; for promises, when parts of bargains about Moveables, are probable by Witnesses, <hi>June</hi> 19. 1672. <hi>John Deuar contra Thomas Brown.</hi>

It is likewise the opinion of <hi>Molina, cap.</hi> 263. and it quadrats to our Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes; that when parties Contract, if there be any Article in favour of a third party, at any time, &amp; <hi>jus quaesitum tertio,</hi> it cannot be recalled by both the Contracters, but he may compel either of them to exhibite the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and thereupon the oblieged may be compelled to perform. So a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, though gratuitous, made in favours of a third party, that party, albeit not present, nor accepting, was found to have Right thereby, <hi>November</hi> 25. 1609. <hi>Achinmoutie contra Hay.</hi> Promises dependent upon acceptance, may either be made by way of offer, or when the promise requires some things to to be done on the part of him to whom it is made, not as a condition annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to the performance, for then the promise is presently Obligatory, though the Effect be suspended, till the condition exist; but if the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be so meant, or exprest, that it must preceed the Obligation it self, as in mutual Contracts, the one party subscribing, is not oblieged untill the other also subscribe, or that the other partie accept or consent. And so a Contract being Registrat, was found orderly proceeded, though he who Registrated it had not subscribed, seing at the discussing he did summarly consent to the Registration thereof against himself, <hi>February</hi> 9. 1627. <hi>Mcduff contra Mccul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loch.</hi> Hence is our vulgar distinction betwixt Obligations and Contracts, the former being only where the Obligation is <gap reason="foreign">

Or otherways, it is the lending the use of a particular thing, to be delivered again, the same in substance, the former is called <hi>mutuum,</hi> the latter <hi>commodatum,</hi> in both, if the thing lent be not delivered, this will be effectual to cause it be delivered, though it be gratuitous, if it be in the lenders power; but on the part of the borrower, it is onerous, for he is oblieged, either to restore the same body, or the same quantity. Such also is Commission or Mandat, whereby the Mandatar doth freely undertake, and is oblieged, <hi>susceptum perficere munus,</hi> and that freely; but he is onerously oblieged to restore, what by the Mandat he hath from the Mandator, as the Mandator is oblieged to refound him his Interest and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences. Such also is the Contract of Custody. Or <hi>Depositum,</hi> which is a kind of Commission, whereby the Depositar undertakes the Custody of the thing depositate. Pledge is also a kind of Commission, whereby the thing impledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is given to a Creditor for his security, that he may detain; and in case of not payment, he may sell it and pay himself.</p>
                     <p>The other Contracts are such as are Onerous on both parts, and Obligator on both parts, and in them there is also always, <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> according to the nature and intent of these Contracts, observing in them an equality of the deeds or things to be done or given on either part, as not being of their nature, or of the direct purpose of the parties gratuitous, or <hi>donative;</hi> for uptaking of these, we must consider, that all that can come in these Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, is either something to be given, or the use or fruit of something, or the labour, work, or deeds of Persons: and among things, special considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is had of Money, which is the common token of Exchange; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there are special Contracts in relation to it, different from the Exchange of other things: So then, all these Permutative Contracts, are either of things for things, as are Permutation, Excambion, Barter, &amp;c.

proper name, but is called <hi>facio ut facias:</hi> But if the use and profite of things, deeds or industry of persons, be exchanged for Money, or other Fugibles, it is called Location, and Conduction.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Lastly,</hi> If the Contract be not to Exchange totally things, use, or work for the like, but to communicate them together, where there is an Exchange in part, there arises the Contract of Society; in which, sometimes Money or things, by the Society are communicate, and the property constitute in the Society without division; or sometime the use of things, or Money, are by the Society communicat on the one part, and the substance of Money on the other, so that the property of the ones Money remains his own, and the profite becomes common; or there may be communication of work with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or work with work, though these be the most ordinar Contracts among men, yet there be as many varieties as the conjunction or variety of these things, in the various use or humours of men can make up, as the contract of Assurance: where Money or things are given, for the hazard of any thing that is in danger, whether it be Goods or Persons. We shall only then touch the common requisites, <hi>First</hi> of all Contracts, and next the specialities of the prime, unto which Law or Custome hath given a special Nature, that by the very naming of the Contract and Agreement, therein all the Obligations interests and consequences thence arising, are known commonly and presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and as effectual as if they were all exprest, without necessity, to dispute precisely, what Reason and Equity will conclude, from the nature of what is done or said. This seems to be the only profitable distinction betwixt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts nominate and innominate; for in all Contracts, not only that which is exprest must be performed, but that which is necessarly consequent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, but in nominate Contracts, Law hath determined these implications; we shall therefore speak specially of the Contracts of Loan, Commission, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody, Pledge, Excambion, Sale, Location and Contracts, Usurary and Society. Transaction may well be numbered amongst mutual onerous Contracts, for thereby either party quiteth a part of what he claims, for shunning the hazard and expences of Law, which being an useful mean to terminat Pleas, the Law of this and most Nations observe the same unviolably, and will not admit the recalling thereof, upon any thing can be pretended from new discovery of the parties Rights, as finding of Writes or Witnesse; but if nothing be abated, there is no Transaction; and therefore, a Bond for a sum, for which the party was under Caption, being without any abatement, was found no Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, <hi>July</hi> 13. 1668. <hi>Thomas Rew contra Houstoun.</hi> Neither was payment made, <hi>pendente processu,</hi> without abatement found a Transaction, <hi>January</hi> 8. 1673. Sir <hi>James Ramsay contra Robison.</hi> Neither was Transaction inferred by granting a Bond for Accompts, for which the granter of the Bond was Arrested, unless a lesser sum had been accepted, then what was claimed by the Accompts; here the instructinos of the Accompts were not given up, nor a Discharge thereof, but an obliegement to give a general Discharge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on payment of the Sum contained in the Bond, <hi>February</hi> 18. 1680.

For the common requisites and properties of Contracts, <hi>First,</hi> They must be deeds of the rational appetitte or will, which, as we have said, can only constitute Rights; therefore the consent of Infants can work nothing, because they have not the use of Reason; and though equity keepeth not one time for the attainment of Reason, but takes it as soon as truely it is, which in some is much sooner, and in some much later; yet Positive Law,

following that which is most ordinary for stabilities sake, fixes it at the end of Pupilarity, which in men is fourteen, and in women twelve years of age; so neither Infants, Idiots, nor Furious Persons, except in their lucide Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, can contract: This is to be cognosced by an Inquest, upon a Brief of the Chancellary, called the Brief of Idiotry, which is mainly for appointing the nearest Agnat to be Tutor to such: And the deeds of Idiots are not only void after this Inquest, but after their Idiotry, or Furiosity, when ever it began, which therefore must be cognosced, yet it was sustained by Reduction without a Brief, at the furious persons instance, Convalescing, <hi>February</hi> 21. 1531. <hi>Elizabeth Alexander contra Kinneir.</hi> And at the Instance of the Furious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Heir, for anulling an Assignation, <hi>July</hi> 28. 1638. <hi>James Loch contra William Dyke.</hi> But it was not found competent by exception, <hi>Spots</hi> Idiots, <hi>Crawford contra Kinneir.</hi> Furiosity taketh away the Escheat of these, as self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murtherers, being then Furious, <hi>Hope,</hi> horning, <hi>Robert Ripeth contra William Wauchop.</hi>

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> These who erre in the Substantials of what is done, contract not; we shall not here debate of the effect of Extortion, Error or Circumvention, what influence they have upon Contracts, but refer that to the former Title.

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the Act of Contracting, it must be of purpose to obliege, either really or presumptively, and so must be serious, so that what is exprest in jest or scorn, makes no Contract.</p>

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the matter of Contracts it is requisite, that it be of things in our power in their kind; and so Contracts of impossibilities are void; and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts in things unlawful are also void; but though the particular thing be not in our power, and be not manifestly impossible, the Contract is obligator; and albeit it cannot obtain its effect, upon that thing it is effectual for the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, as damnage and interest, Contracts may interveen where there inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds a Natural and Obediential Obligation, where it hath this use to declare and express the Natural Obligation to avoid debate thereupon: But the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per matter of Contracts, are things free, and the declaration or acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of necessar duties may be free, though the duty it self be necessar, yet where Obediential and Conventional Obligations are concurring, they are both Obligator.</p>

It is the property of permutative Contracts, that the purpose of the Contracters is to keep an equality in the worth and value of the things, fruit or works interchanged, the value is regulate according to the common esteem and custome of men in every place, and its liquidat or known by Money, or some fungible like unto Money, as Suggar and Tobacco in the <hi>American</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, for Money being the common token of Exchange; and therefore, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing virtually in it all things, they are accounted better or worse, or equal, according to the common rate of the place, as they are worth in Money for

the time, the prime grounds of this common estimate are necessity, utility, and delectation, whether it be real or imaginary, as <hi>Plin. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 55. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garitis pretium luxuria fecit,</hi> such is the value of Portraits, Tulips, or other Flowers, upon which, in some places, a far greater rate hath been put, then any usefulness thereof would allow; hence it is that the rate of things does frequently change, as the necessity or esteem of them changeth, and the more they abound, the easier is their rate.</p>
                     <p>But the question is here, whether in these Contracts there be a moral necessity to keep an exact equality, that whosoever, <hi>ex post facto,</hi> shall be found to have made an unequal Bargain, the advantager ought to repair the loser: in this the <hi>Romans</hi> did not notice every inequality, but that which was enorm, above the half of the just value, which our Custome alloweth not, <hi>June</hi> 23. 1669. <hi>Robert Farie contra James Inglis.</hi> And the opinion of <hi>Grotius, de jure belli, l.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. Is for the affirmative upon this ground, chiefly that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the Contracters is to give one thing for an other of equal value, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out purpose to gift on either hand; yet the contrair opinion is more probable in some cases, wherein, though it be the purpose of the parties, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change things of equal value, without Donation; yet that equality hath no determinate or certain rule, but their own opinions: for as is said before, the special affection and opinion of the owner, is a peice of his interest and injoyment; and if the thing be taken from him unwarrantably, and cannot be restored, the Reparation is not according to the common rate, but <hi>secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum pretium affectionis,</hi> according to the value the owner had of it; and if that owner sell it for the rate he thought it worth, it would be thought no less then cousenage, for the buyer to offer but what others thought it worth, if then the particular value or esteem be the first rule in such Contracts, when both parties being free, do agree upon such a rate, there is here no Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but a particular Estimation, wherewith either ought to rest satisfied: It is true, where there is no rate agreed upon, the common rate must be the rule, but it cannot always be a rule, seing the publick rate doth but arise from the private rate, otherways rates should never change, except where by publick Authority they are determinate, which is but seldome: But ordinarly the change of rates begins at particular persons, and the second Contracters use for a patern the first; and the fuller the example be, the stronger it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it become common; and therefore, it is safest to conclude with the Law, <hi>l. si voluntate, C. de resin. vend.</hi> which saith, this is the substance of buying and selling, that the buyer having a purpose to buy cheap, and the seller to sell dear, they come to this Contract, and after many debates, the seller by little and little diminishing what he sought, and the buyer adding to what he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at last they agree to a certain price, or as <hi>Seneca</hi> says, <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>de beneficiis, cap.</hi> 15. It is no matter what the rate be, seing it is agreed between the buyer and the seller, for he that buyes well, owes nothing to the seller; therefore, the equality required in these Contracts cannot be in any other rate then the parties agree on; but in other things, this equality ought to be observed, as in any Penalty adjected, or Clauses irritant, which therefore ought to be, and are reduced to the just interest, what ever the parties agreement be: So then, seing Promises and Contracts are morally binding, permutative Contracts must also be such, else they should not bind by vertue of the consent, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the matter; but in them as in all others, if any party hath disadvantage by Fraud or Guile, it ought to be repared, but not by vertue of the Contract, but from the Obligation arising from that Delinquence, and so <hi>unjust ballances are an abomination to the Lord,</hi> because of the deceit thence arising: as also,

false Money, and insufficient Ware, by any latent insufficiency or defect, which was not obvious and easily perceivable by the acquirer, in which case, there can be no presumption of Fraud, <hi>his eye is his merchant;</hi> but in others, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Sentence of <hi>Ambrose, in Contracts,</hi> saith he, <hi>even the defects of the things which are sold, ought to be laid open, and unless the seller intimate the same, there is competent to the buyer an action of Fraud;</hi> so also, if the buyer take advantage of the ignorance and simplicity of the seller, and where there is no alteration of the common rate, nor ground thereof asketh or craveth more if it be not deceit, at least it is against Charity: so is it when ware is keeped up till pinching necessity, which raiseth extream dearth, or when some special necessity of an acquirer, puts him so upon the mercy of the Disponer, that he may take a price, even above that which himself accounts the thing worth, in such cases, there is the violation of the Natural Obligation of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereby men are bound in some cases, to Gift freely to the necessity of others; but frequently we are oblieged to exchange what our necessity may spare, to supply others necessity for the like which they may spare, and so without injury, in case of necessity, men may be compelled to sell that which is their own.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. This agreeth with our Custome, by which only a latent insufficiency of the Goods and Ware, at the time of the sale and delivery, is sufficient to abate or take down of the price, but not unless when the unsufficiency ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, the thing bought be offered to be restored (if it be not carryed abroad before the insufficiency appear) after which, retention is accompted an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiescence in, and Homologation of the Contract: So no other then the latent insufficiency of Wines, as being mixed with Peary, &amp;c. is relevant to libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from a Bond granted for the price thereof.

Before we come to the special Contracts, this question which is of much importance in practice, would be resolved, whether in mutual or recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Contracts, a party Contracter, or his Assignay, can obtain implement of the Articles of the Contract in his favour, till he fulfill or cause to be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the other part: Our Decisions have been exceeding various in this matter; for clearing whereof, several cases must be distinguished; <hi>First,</hi> In the case of the Contracters themselves, and in that, either the mutual obliegements are conceived conditionally, that the one part being performed, or upon the performance thereof, the other part shall be performed, or where the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liegements are not conceived conditionally, yet they are properly mutual Causes, each of other. The obliegement to deliver the Ware, and to pay the price in permutation, the things exchanged, and mutual obliegements for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery thereof, are the mutual causes each of other, in Location, the use of that which is set for hire, and the hire are the mutual Causes, and so are the Obligations, <hi>hinc inde,</hi> otherways, the Obliegements are not the proper Causes each of other, but either wholly different matters, which are frequently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulate in the same Contracts; or the one, but the occasion and motive, and not the proper cause of the other: The case of Assignays must be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in all these.</p>

For the <hi>first,</hi> The Civil Law is for the Negative, that in reciprocal Contracts, neither party can have effectual Action, except he perform the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract on his part. As to the first member of the first case, there is no question, but when the mutual obliegements are conceived conditionally, he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the one part, must perform the other. As to the other member when the Obliegments are mutual causes each of other expresly, when the Contract bears, <hi>for the which causes;</hi> or when by the nature of the thing; appeareth so to be: It is most consonant to reason, to the Civil Law an our Practice, that neither party should obtain implement of the obliegement to him, till he fulfil the obliegements by him, it was so found, <hi>July</hi> 27. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

A Fungible is that which is estimate according to the quantity, and is not easily decernable, nor noticed in the individual or particular body, but only in the like quantity of the same kind, the chief of which is Money, where or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarly the extrinsick value and common rate is regarded, without respect to the matter, and so what is borrowed in Gold may be payed in Silver, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common rate of the place, unless it be otherways contracted: such also are Wine, Oil and Grain, wherein the quantity is ever respected in the same kind, as in the loan of Wines, payment must be had, not only by the Wine of the same Countrey, but if there be any difference by the Wine of the same place of the Countrey, and so of all the rest; for it is never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted a quantity, where there can be other differences remarked: these Fungibles have no fruit or use, if they be retained; and therefore, the end of the Contract and purpose of the Contracters is, that the property there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of shall pass to the borrower from the lender, and may be by him alienate; and thence is its name, for <hi>mutuum est quasi de meo tuum, l.</hi> 2. <hi>ff. de rebus cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditis: Salmasius</hi> alone denyes this, holding that the intent of this Contract, <hi>non est transferredominium,</hi> but to give the use, and that the alienation falls of accident, because Law makes no difference of quantities of the same kind; so that if Money be found, Restitution may be made without any Contract, though not in the same Money, but in the like, wherein there is no consent, and so can be no alienation.</p>

So he who hath the custody of Money, if he medle with it he commits Theft by the Law; hence it follows, that the whole peril of the thing lent, after delivery, is the borrowers, <hi>ejus est periculum eujus est dominium,</hi> so that Money or any other Fungible thing lent, though it were immediatly taken away by force, or destroyed by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the borrower is oblieged to pay.</p>

                     <p n="21">21. As to the specialities of <hi>mutuum, First,</hi> It is not Contracted without delivery of the thing lent, and it hath very little, either by the Civil Law or our Customes, as a nominat Contract, but what is competent by the Obligation of Restitution, or Recompence; and therefore, <hi>promutuum per inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitum,</hi> where there is no Contract, is equiparat to <hi>mutuum,</hi> for the like, not only in kind, but in value, must be repayed, though nothing be exprest therefore. As he who lent so much Wine, is not oblieged to accept the same kind of Wine, but also of the same value, as if he lent old Wine, he is not oblieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take new, which is accompted worse. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>ff. de rebus creditis,</hi> and this
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:109710:75"/>
is rather by that equivalence, due in Recompence, then by any tacite Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, understood to be implied in this Contract. And it were more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for Commerce, that there should be understood a contrary Paction, that being repayed in the same kind, there should be no debate of the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent value, which leaves a perpetual incertitude in all such Contracts, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing ever a quarrel, that the repayment is not as good as the thing lent, as there is difference of the goodness of Wines in the same Countrey, yea, the same field; likewise there is a difference in kinds of Money, Silver or Gold, and in the Intrinsick and the Extrinsick Value, wherein the common opinion is, that not only the Extrinsick, but Intrinsick Value is to be respected, that the same weight and species of Money must be repayed. But none make dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Gold or Silver, not allayed; and all reject Copper or Layed-Money, our Custome was to have repayment in the same Intrinsick Value, as appears, <hi>Par.</hi> 1451. <hi>cap.</hi> 36. <hi>Par.</hi> 1457. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. <hi>Par.</hi> 1555. <hi>cap.</hi> 37. But that was well altered by a posterior Custome, allowing the current Coin for the time, by the Extrinsick Value to be sufficient, in all Redemptions, much more in personal Contracts, which is most convenient, seing Money is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as the Token of Exchange, and as a Fungible, not as a body; and it is not to be supposed, that if the lender had keeped his Money from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent borrower, that he would have lost the profite of it, to keep it up till the Extrinsick Value might change to his advantage; or that the borrower was to keep it by him, but to make present use of it; for which cause we notice not the Intrinsick Value, even as it was at the Term of payment.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. The Civil Law gives so little to <hi>mutuum,</hi> by the Nature of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, that it is amongst the Contracts <hi>stricti juris,</hi> where nothing is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood but what is expressed, or necessarly consequent therefrom. And therefore, there is no Annual or Profite, due in <hi>mutuo;</hi> yea, though it be expressed by Paction, it will not suffice by the Civil Law, unless it be by Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation; we allow not profite, <hi>in mutuo,</hi> unless it be so agreed upon, which may be by paction, even <hi>ex intervallo;</hi> in which case it retains the name of <hi>mutuum,</hi> though it be rather <hi>Locatione</hi> of the use of the Fungible, for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual, as a competent hire, and so we shall speak to Annualrents, not here, but in Location; yet the Law did allow to <hi>mutuum,</hi> that any thing might be transchanged in a Fungible, as the price thereof, and that Fungible constitute, <hi>in mutuum,</hi> which is equivalent, as if the Fungible had been really delivered, <hi>l.</hi> 11. <hi>ff. de rebus creditis.</hi> And any Contract is easily changed, <hi>in mutuum per fictionem braevis manus,</hi> as if all these alterations had been actually made. But if it were but acknowledged, <hi>per Chyrographum,</hi> that Money was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the exception, <hi>de non numerata pecunia,</hi> was competent.

                     <p>The ordinary way of <hi>mutuum</hi> amongst Merchants, is by Bills of Exchange, or Letters of Credite, which have several specialities, which arise from the Nature of these Acts, and from Custome, especially these common Customes of Merchants, observed in Cities of greatest Trade, in the Neighbouring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Nature and ordinary Tenor of these Bills of Exchange is, that the drawer of the Bill orders such a Merchant, or his correspondent, to pay the sum contained in the Bill upon sight, or at such certain time, or at use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and that for value received, wherein there is implied a Mandat to the Correspondent, and an obliegement upon the Drawer of the Bill, to make
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:109710:76"/>
that Mandat effectual, wherein <hi>mutuum</hi> is implied, if the value received by him be numerate Money, or of any other Cause, such as delivery of Ware; there is in it, <hi>fictio braevis manus,</hi> as if the Ware were sold to the drawer of the Bill, and the sum in the Bill were the price received, and delivered again in Loan; there useth two or three Bills to be drawn for the same sum, which do bear, to be the <hi>first, second, and third Bill,</hi> and the payment of any one satisfies all: the fixed form by Custome, of making use of these Bills, is by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting them to him upon whom they are drawn, and if he accept the Bill, he Writes thereupon, <hi>accepts,</hi> which if it be simplie, he becomes liable in the Terms, and at the time mentioned in the Bill: But sometimes the accepter doth qualifie his Acceptance, which the Creditor by the Bill may refuse; and require either simple acceptance, or may Protest for Non-acceptance; but if he suffer the Acceptance to be qualified, it imports his consent, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Protest for Non-acceptance, as if the Acceptance be to a longer day, then what is contained in the Bill: Or if it bear Acceptance, if provisions come betwixt and the day; or if Ware or Bills in hand do raise the sum. At or after the day, the Bill is again presented, and if payment be not then made, the Creditor in the Bill Protests for not payment, and both these Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions must be by Instrument of a Nottar, either for Non-acceptance, or not Payment: Which Instruments with the Bill, make sufficient Probation, both against the Drawer of the Bill, and against him upon whom it was Drawn; and neither Witnesses, nor the Oath of Party will be sufficient to supplie the Protest: So that the Instrument or Protest, is not only a Proof, but a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity requisite. These Protests may be taken against him upon whom they were drawn, either personally, or at his Dwelling-house, which was sustained, though before presenting of the Bill, the party upon whom it was drawn was dead, <hi>July</hi> 3. 1664. <hi>Hugh Kennedy contra George Hutcheson.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon Bills so Protested, the Creditor in the Bill hath Action, both against him upon whom the Bill was drawn, if through his fault, he hath either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to accept, or to pay, and so if he had Provisions in his hand, he will be decerned to pay; and if without Provisions, he accept and pay, the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Bill becomes his Debitor, <hi>ex mutuo,</hi> or <hi>ex mandato.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Creditor in the Bill may also return upon the drawer of the Bill, who will be Decerned to pay the sum, with the damnage the Creditor hath su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained through its being Protested, wherein will be comprehended the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses of the Pursuit against the Correspondent, and the profite the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the Bill might have made, if according to it, he had received his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which will differ in several persons and cases; as if the Creditor in the Bill be not a Merchant; the ordinary damnage will be the Exchange, that is the rate ordinarly given at that time, for answering Money from the place, at which the Bill was drawn, to the place to which it was direct; but if the Creditor in the Bill was a Merchant, and was to Trade with the sum in the place, to which the Bill was direct, he hath also no more but Exchange; but if he was to Trade in any other place, before he returned to the place where the Bill was drawn, he will not only get Exchange, but Re-exchange, as being damnified in the profite of his Ware that he was to buy, at the place to which he was bound, from that place to which the Bill was direct, for the Ware he was to buy there, and for the loss of his profite of the Ware he was to buy at the second prot: but though there might be further progress in his Traffick, his damnage is no further extended, then to Exchange and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exchange; and in all, the Oath of the Creditor in the Bill, concerning his
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:109710:76"/>
design with the Bill, must be sufficient Probation, and is Taxable. As all Oaths <hi>in litem</hi> are, when they appear Exorbitant, if the Bill of Exchange be unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied by an interveening accident, which the drawer could not prevent, the damnage will be modified or taken off; as in the former case, the Corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent upon whom the Bill was drawn, dying before the day of payment, the Creditor in the Bill having Protested at his Dwelling-house, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting against his Successors, but returning against the drawer, he got no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change or Re-exchange; yet certainly, the drawer of the Bill being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by oblieged to deliver the Money, at the place to which the Bill was directed, it had been no stretch to give him Exchange.</p>
                     <p>But if the Correspondent upon whom the Bill is drawn, Break, or become Insolvent, full damange will be due by the drawer, whose part it was to have his Money in secure hands, unless the Correspondents Insolvency, be by the delay, or fault of the Creditor in the Bill; for though there be no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate time at which he is oblieged to present it, yet conveniency and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diligence is implyed; but if the delay sall by an accident, though the Correspondent break before the Bill be presented, or payed, the drawer of the Bill will be lyable for the value received, but for no damnage, <hi>July</hi> 1. 1676. Doctor <hi>Wallace contra Simson.</hi>

                     <p>These Bills of Exchange are Probative, though they neither have Witnesses, nor be Holograph, by the Custome of Merchants, because of the exuberant trust among them, and because they do not ly over as other Securities, but come quickly to be questioned, if they be not satisfied. Yea, a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change by a Drover, neither having subscription of his Name, nor initial Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thereof, but a mark, at which the Writer of the Bill Wrote, this is the mark of the drawer of the Bill, the Writer and several Witnesses being Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, <hi>ex officio,</hi> and deponing, that it was the Drovers Custome to mark Bills thus, which he readily payed, though of greater sums then this, which was an hundred Pound Sterling, and one Witness deponing that he saw him set to the mark to this Bill, the Bill was sustained.</p>
                     <p>Bills of Exchange are also transmitted without any formal Assignation, or Intimation, by a Note upon the Bill it self, ordering it to be payed to such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>Bills or Precepts, not being amongst Merchants, or <hi>in re mercatoria,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port only warrandice upon the drawer, and give action against the person upon whom they are drawn, but neither require the Solemnities, nor have the Priviledge or Effects of Bills of Exchange, but have only the Effect of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signations from the drawer upon him upon whom they are drawn.</p>
                     <p>Letters of Credit among Merchants, are equiparate to Bills of Exchange in some cases, but in others they are but Cautionary for other Merchants, in whose favours they are granted; and therefore, a Merchants Letters of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, to honour another Merchants Bills, was only found effectual, as to such Bills as were accepted and payed; and whereof repayment was not made, and advertisement given to the Writer of the Letters, of the particular Bills not payed in due time, before the other Merchant became Insolvent, <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 17. 1581. <hi>John Ewing</hi> Merchant in <hi>London, contra</hi> Mr. <hi>Andrew Burnet.</hi>

The other kind of Loan is called <hi>Commodatum quasi commodo datum,</hi> and it is a Contract whereby the use of any thing is freely given to be restored, the same without <hi>Deterioration,</hi> if it be not freely lent, but for a hire, it is <hi>Location;</hi> if the like be restored, it is <hi>mutuum;</hi> but if it be lost thorow the commodatars fault, or otherways <hi>deteriorat,</hi> the value must be restored, either as it was estimate by the parties before hand, which changeth not its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, because the price, though estimate, cannot be offered but in case of loss, or <hi>Deterioration, sine dole,</hi> if there be no <hi>estimation,</hi> then the estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be according to the rate of the thing lent, at the time and place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the Contract, or as it was worth the time of the Sentence: But Restitution must be made without <hi>Deterioration,</hi> except such as necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the use for which it was lent: as Cloathes lent may be worn, and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel lent become older; or if a Horse be lent for a long Journey, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore become leaner, without the borrowers fault, he is not oblieged to make up the same, <hi>l. fin. ff.

                     <p n="27">27. From <hi>Commodatum</hi> arise two Actions, the direct, whereby the Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may call for the thing lent; and the contrary, whereby the borrower may call for his expenses, wared out necessarly, or profitably on the thing lent, more then is necessary to preserve it in the case it was lent, which he may use by way of exception, to have retention till these be satisfied.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. <hi>Commission</hi> is called in Law, <hi>Mandatum,</hi> either because it useth to be exprest by way of Command, or Precept, though this be special in a Precept, that most Mandats are free, and may be refused; but Precepts may not, when the party upon whom they are drawn, hath provision from the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Or otherwise, it is called <hi>mandatum quasi de manu datum,</hi> because it is given out of the hand, or the management of the Mandant, into the trust of the Mandatar. The requisites of this Contract, must be, <hi>first,</hi> a Desire, Warrand, or Order, upon the part of the Mandant to the Mandatar, to do some Affair, to the behove of the Mandant only, or of the Mandant and Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, as to mannage that which they have in common, or to the behove of a third party only, or of a third party and the Mandatar, or of the three joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for if to the behove of the Mandatar only, it inferreth no obligation, but either is a meer Counsel, in whatsoever terms it be exprest; as if <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> desire or command <hi>Titius,</hi> not to imploy his Money upon Annualrent, but to buy Land therewith, or particularly to buy such Land, there ariseth thence no Obligation: It is true in Crimes, such desires may infer punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but no Obligation in favours of the party desired: Or when a Commission is granted only to the behove of the Receiver, it transmitteth a Right to him, and no Obligation upon him. So personal Rights are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Assignations, which are Procuratories, but to the Procurators own behove; such are also Precepts for taking Seasiue or Possession.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. As to the Terms in which Mandats or Commissions are expressed, if it be any way to the behove of the Mandant, there is no difference what the Expression be, unless the words be, <hi>Mendicatorie,</hi> importing the desire of a Donation; but if it be only to the behove of the Mandatar, or of a third Party, or both, without any behove of the Mandant, then it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, whether the words import only a Counsel, that the Mandatar do
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:109710:78"/>
such a thing upon his own accompt; in which case there is no Contract, nor Obligation, unless it appear that it was upon the Mandants accompt, or a third parties.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. The <hi>second</hi> requisite is the Consent or Acceptance of the Mandatar, which compleateth this Contract, which is perfected by sole Consent, and may be either by word or deed, from whence the warrand of the Mandant, and acceptance of the Mandatar may be inferred, or by any other sign, as by pointing with the hand, or beckning with the head: And albeit it was free to accept or consent, yet it is obligatory and necessary to perform, unless <hi>re integra,</hi> the Mandatar renounce, so that the Mandator be not hindered in obtaining thereafter another Mandatar.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. The <hi>third</hi> requisite in a Mandat is, that it be in relation to a thing lawful to be done, for it cannot reach to what is already done; and being in a matter unlawful, albeit it be accepted, it oblieges not the accepter to perform; and if it be performed, it oblieges not the Mandant to make up the Mandatars damnage: But in this as in other things unlawful, albeit both parties be in the fault, <hi>Potior est conditio possidentis,</hi> he who is actually free of the loss, hath the advantage.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. The last requisite in Mandats, is that the acceptance must be free, not only in so far as the Mandatar may freely accept or refuse, whereby a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and voluntary Mandat differs from a necessary Command or Precept, which is no proper Mandat, because it is not inferred by consent, but also in so far as acceptance must be gratuitous; otherwise the Contract thence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, is not Mandat, but Location: Yet Honoraries, or Sallaries, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of things, having no proper Price nor Estimation, alter not the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Contract, as the Sallaries or Honoraries of Physicians for procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Health, which hath no Price; or of Judges or Advocates, for giving or procuring of Justice.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. It is implyed in the Nature of Mandats, that it is personal, depending upon the singular choice of the Mandant, which he hath made of the Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars Person; and therefore it is neither continued in the Heir of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, or of the Mandatar; but <hi>morte mandatoris perimitur mandatum,</hi> which holdeth also upon the death of the Mandatar; for this Contract arising from a singular affection or friendship betwixt both, the removal of either resolves that Tye: So that in Delegation, which is a Mandat by the Creditor to his Debitor, to pay the Debt to the Creditor of his Creditor, it was found to cease by the Death of the Creditor Mandant; and that a Letter written by him to his Debitor to pay his Creditor, was no Warrand to pay, after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitor knew that his Creditor the Mandator was dead, <hi>February</hi> 2. 1628. Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of the Laird of <hi>Duffus contra Forrester:</hi> But here there is an excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>fi res non sit integra,</hi> if the matter of the Mandat be not intire, but that the Mandatar hath entered upon, and performed a part of his Commission; for in that case it continueth after the death of either party; It hath also the exception, <hi>bonae fidei,</hi> if the Mandatar perform the Mandat, though after the Mandators death, if he knew not that he was dead, albeit the matter was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire at the time of his death.</p>
                     <p>In General or Complex Mandats, the performance of a part doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:109710:78"/>
all the several members of different natures of the Mandat, but only that particular whereof a part is done.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. Here there ariseth a question, whether a Mandatar may intrust ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther person, or sub-commit his Mandat, wherein the Civil law, and most of the Doctors are in the Affirmative: But the Nature of the Contract infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Contrary, which ought to take place, unless Law or Custome were opposite, which is not with us. The Reasons for the Negative are pregnant; <hi>First,</hi> Because the singular and personal fitness of the Mandatar is chosen by the Mandator, and so cannot without his consent be altered. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is a common Ground, that which belongeth not to Heirs, much less to Assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nays or Substitutes. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is a common Brockard, <hi>delegatus non potest delegare,</hi> especially in the matters of Jurisdiction, which the Doctors acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but say that it is introduced by the Law, against the Nature of this Contract: But they should rather say, that the power of sub-committing in extrajudicials, is so introduced.</p>
                     <p>It is true, the Reasons foresaid fail in some cases, as if the Mandat be of a Nature so Common, that there is no distinction of the fitness of persons; as Precepts of Seasine, which are therefore directed blank, that any persons Name indifferently may be filled up: Or if the Mandat be so general, that it cannot be all performed by one.</p>
                     <p n="35">35. It is also consequent from the Nature of this Contract, that it is Ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory, and Revockable at the pleasure of the Mandator, even though it bear a definit Term; because that being introduced in favours of the Mandator, it cannot hinder him, <hi>cuique licet juri pro se introducto renunciare,</hi> which hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, when the Mandat is partly to the Mandators own behove; for then the interest not being wholly the Mandatars, he cannot alter the time agreed upon without consent of the Mandatar: Yea, if the Mandat be wholly to the behove of the Mandatar, it may, and frequently is Irrevockable, and containeth a Clause, <hi>de rato,</hi> as is ordinary in Assignations, and Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of Resignation, and Precepts of Seasine, bearing them to be <hi>an Irrevock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Power and Warrand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="36">36. The Obligation arising from Mandat, is chiefly upon the part of the Mandatar, to perform his undertaking, wherein he is oblieged to follow the Tenor of his Commission, <hi>in forma specifica,</hi> in so far as it is special and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, wherein if he transgresse, some of the ancient Lawers denyed him repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of his expences, not only as to the excrescence above his Commission, but for all, as having received Commission to buy such a Field, for one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns, he had bought it for one thousand two hundred, he should have Repetition of nothing: But <hi>Proculus</hi> thought that he should have Action for the part in the Commission; which, as the more benign opinion, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian</hi> followeth, <hi>l. sed proculus,</hi> 4. <hi>ff. mandati,</hi> where the Mandat is not spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, it must be performed, <hi>secundum arbitrium boni viri.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="37">37. As to the Diligence whereunto Mandatars are oblieged, the Doctors are of divers opinions; the Law inclineth most, that Mandatars are oblieged for the exactest Diligence, and for the lightest Fault: But by the Nature of the Contract, Mandatars, seing their undertakings are gratuitous, they ought to be but lyable for such Diligence as they use in their own Affairs; and the Mandatar ought to impute it to himself, that he made not choice of a

Sir <hi>Alexander Frazer contra Alexander Keith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Obligation upon the part of the Mandator, is to Refound to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datar his damnage and expense, and to keep him harmles; but this extends not unto casual damnages, as if the Mandatar were spoiled in the way, or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Shipwrack in going about the Execution of the Mandat, <hi>l.</hi> 26. <hi>inter cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sas,</hi> §. 6. <hi>non omnia, ff. Mandati,</hi> but this is to be limited, unless the Mandat do specially require Concomitant hazard, as if a Mandatar be sent through a place where there are Forces of Enemies, Robbers, or Pyrats, commonly known to haunt the place, by which he must pass.</p>
                     <p n="38">38. To come unto the special kinds of Mandats, they are either express, or tacit, to one Mandatar, or more, generall, or special, to be performed in the name of the Mandatar, for the Mandators behove, or in the name of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dator: As also, amongst Mandats are comprehended the Commissions of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitors, and Exercitors, and all Precepts, Procuratories, Assignations, and Delegations.</p>
                     <p n="39">39. A tacit Mandat, is that which is inferred by signs, and is not exprest by words, as he who is present and suffereth another to mannage his Affairs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction, gives thereby a tacit Mandat, <hi>l. qui patitur,</hi> 18. <hi>l. qui fide alterius,</hi> 53. <hi>ff. mandati;</hi> for in this, <hi>qui tacet consentire videtur.</hi> So he who whispereth his Servant in the Ear, if he immediatly Kill or Wound any Person present, is presumed to give Command to the Servant so to do; if there was capital Enimity betwixt him and that person before. In like manner, the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Evidents or Writes; yea, which is more, the having of these, though the giving appear not, it is presumed to Constitute Procurators, as is evident in the having a Precept of Seasine, which is sufficient without any other power given to the Bailzie, or Acturnay. And Advocats are presumed to have Warrands from Parties for whom they compear, without producing any Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat; not only upon production of the Parties Evidents, or alledgeances, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial in Points of Fact; which if wanting, the compearance of Procurators in inferiour Courts, is held as without Warrand, and the Decreet as in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; But even without these, if Advocats do no more but appear, and take a day to produce Parties to give their Oathes. A Wife having her Husbands Band in her hand, Impignorating it for an hundred Pounds, the Impignorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was found valide against the Husband, the Wifes Warrand being presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her having the Bond, <hi>February</hi> 4. 1665. <hi>Paterson contra Pringle.</hi> And the Warrand of a Servants taking off Furniture for his Master, and giving Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt in Name of his Master, and for his use, found not to obliege the Servant to pay, or instruct his Warrand, which was presumed to be known to the Merchant, unless the Servant had otherways imployed the Furnishing, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 17. 1665. <hi>Howison contra Cockburn.</hi> And a Warrand was inferred, by the presence of him who had Commission to do, and hindred not, <hi>February</hi> 23. 1667.

40. Mandats given to more Persons, may be either to each, or some of them severally, by divers Warrands, or to more by the same Warrand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon these Questions arise; <hi>First,</hi> When there are many Mandatars joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Whether they must all necessarly joyn before they can Act, so that if one should die, the Commission is void? Or whether it be understood to the Survivers, Or to the plurality of them? <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether Mandatars be all lyable, <hi>in solidum,</hi> or but <hi>prorata.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>First</hi> Question, If many Mandatars be Constitute severally, or with a <hi>quorum,</hi> or Plurality exprest, there is no debate; but if otherwise, the case is very doubtful, and there be pregnant Reasons and Testimonies upon both parts, but this seemeth to prevail as the general Rule, that Mandats joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given, can only be joyntly execute;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Because by the Nature of this Contract, the personal and singular fitness and industry of Mandatars is chosen; and therefore, this being a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial trust, when it is given to many, it is presumed, that the Constituent trusts them all joyntly, and not a part of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Mandat given to ten, cannot be regularly understood, given to any lesser number, or given to <hi>Titius, Seius,</hi> and <hi>Maevius,</hi> that it is given to any two of them: It may be objected, that where there are many Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or Tutors, without mentioning a <hi>quorum,</hi> the death of one makes it not to cease, <hi>Hope,</hi> Executors, <hi>Stuart contra Kirkwood</hi> and <hi>Moor:</hi> Or the death or non-acceptance of some of them, <hi>Ibid. Ruthven <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                           </gap> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra George Fauside contra Edmonstuon;</hi> and therefore, this being the most important Trust, the like must hold in all other cases. It is answered, that the parity holds not; for the deeds of Defuncts in their latter will are always extended, that the Act may stand: But in Contracts it is contrary, that words are interpret more strictly; and in this case the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is clear, that a Mandator, <hi>inter vivos,</hi> giving power, it is strictly to be Interpret; because the Power failing, returns from the Mandatars to the Mandator himself: But a Power given by a Defunct in Contemplation of death, cannot return; and therefore the Defunct is presumed to prefer all the persons nominate, to any other that may fall by course of Law.</p>
                     <p>But this Rule, as it is founded upon the singularity of the Choice, it faileth, and must be limited, where that ground ceaseth, and is preponderat: As <hi>First,</hi> If the deed to be done, be common and ordinary; there, not only the plurality, but any of the Mandatars will suffice; so any of more Curators may authorize a Minor.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the thing to be done, be to the advantage of the Constituent, and hath not a considerable hazard or power to infer his disadvantage; as if a Commission being begun to many, of things which admit no delay, it may be done by any part of the Mandatars, and they will have <hi>actionem mandati,</hi> and not only <hi>negotiorum gestorum.</hi> So Ambastadours sent to Solemnize a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, or receive a Crown, though some of them should die, or disassent, unquestionably the plurality might proceed. But it wold not be so in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for Marriage or Peace; much less for surrendering a Kingdom, City, or Fort; and therefore, it cannot always be thought that a plurality is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, though not exprest.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="138" facs="tcp:109710:80"/>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In cases necessary, where matters may not be delayed, plurality is always understood, as in Commissions for Jurisdictions ordinary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Where the consuetude of the place, or of the Mandator himself, useth to allow a plurality, there it is understood, though not exprest.</p>
                     <p n="41">41. As to the other Question, where more Mandatars are Constitute seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, they are no doubt lyable, <hi>in solidum,</hi> because they are Constitute, <hi>in solidum:</hi> But when they are Constitute jointly, or added, the doubt remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; for the Affirmative, There is <hi>First,</hi> The Authority of the Civil Law, <hi>l. creditor mandatorem, §. duobus, ff. mandati.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="42">42. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Albeit the Obligation of Many, for payment of a quantity, make them lyable but <hi>prorata;</hi> Yet where it is a Fact, they are lyable, <hi>in solidum.</hi> And so Tutors and Curators are lyable severally, <hi>in solidum:</hi> But Executors are not, because their duty is to pay, <hi>secundum vires lnventarij;</hi> and therefore, <hi>in rigore juris,</hi> Mandatars being malversant, or grosly negligent, are liable, <hi>in solidum,</hi> if they may act severally, especially in Acts indivisible.</p>
                     <p n="43">43. General Mandats do occasion the most debates in this Contract; for there is much more clearness where the Mandat is special, which useth to be distinguished in determinate, when both matter and manner are special, and indeterminat, when the matter is special, but the manner is not specified; in the former the precise Tenor of the Commission must be followed; and yet if any part thereof be, or become unprofitable, and evidently and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably hurtful, the Mandatar in the latter case may safely, and in the former case, must necessarly do what is best, <hi>secundum arbitrium boni viri,</hi> and must do the like in all indeterminat Mandats: But the great Question is, how far general Mandats may be extended, and in what cases they are not effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: But there is necessarly required special Mandats, which refer to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, choice, or opinion of the Mandatar, as if it have a Clause, <hi>cum libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra aut plena administratione,</hi> or the like: Or where that is wanting, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors enumerate multitudes of cases, whereunto general Mandats are not to be extended;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> In the Contracting of Marriage no general Mandat, albeit, <hi>cum li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bera &amp;.</hi> is sufficient, because the affection and choice of the person is singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and incommunicable. And albeit <hi>Abrahams</hi> Commission for <hi>Eleazar, to take a Wife for his Son of his Kindred,</hi> was valide, though not special, as to the person; yet the case was singular, there being so few Families <hi>that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped the true God,</hi> to choice upon. But recenter Customes require it to be special, even as to the person, as well as to the Family.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> No general Mandat, though <hi>cum libera,</hi> can be extended to any thing that may import a Fault or Crime.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> No general Mandat can reach to Donations, or meer Liberality, and yet doth not hinder gratifications for Services done, or upon the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the receiver may probably be induced thereby, to do matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as the Gifts of Ambassadours, or Generals, are not only valide as to the receivers, but as to the Mandators, if there was probable reason.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> General Mandats extend not to Alienation of Immoveables, but that must be specially exprest.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:109710:80"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> General Mandats extend not to Submissions or Transactions, nor to insist in any Action Criminal or Famous, or to anull that which is specially done by the Constituent, or to dispose of that which was specially reserved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, either by Law or deed, as <hi>regalia,</hi> or things peculiarly reserved to Princes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> A special Mandat is required, to enter any party Heir to any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessour. The Civil Law numbered, <hi>additionem haereditatis inter actus legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,</hi> and so excluded even a special Mandat therein: But our Customes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the same. But because Heirs are lyable, <hi>in solidum,</hi> to all the Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors Debts; therefore a special Mandat is necessary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Wherein the general Mandats, some things are specially exprest, the generality is not extended to cases of greater importance, then these exprest.</p>
                     <p n="44">44. Amongst Mandats are all Offices, which do ever imply a condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutive upon committing Faults; but not such as are light Faults, or of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence; but they must be Atrocious, at least of knowledge and importance; upon this ground it was, that the Town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> having deposed their Town Clerk from his Office which he had, <hi>ad vitam,</hi> The Sentence was su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained, if the Fault were found of the Clerks knowledge, and of importance, and that it was not enough that no hurt followed, and that he was willing to make it up, <hi>February</hi> 14. 1665. Town of <hi>Edinburgh contra</hi> Sir <hi>William Thomson.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But an Office of a Sheriff Clerk, was not found extinct by his being at the Horn for a Debt, or being sometimes out of the Countrey, having power of Deputation, <hi>February</hi> 6. 1666. Arch-Bishop of <hi>Glasgow contra</hi> Commissar Clerk of <hi>Dumsreis.</hi> The Office of a Commissar doth also import, as a necessary condition, that the Commissar be qualified to discharge the Office in his own person, though he have Deputs, seing he must answer for, and over-rule his Deputs, <hi>February</hi> 14. 1666.

                     <p n="45">45. Trust is also amongst Mandats or Commissions, though it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Depositation, seing the Right is in custody of the person intrusted. Mandatars in the Law could not obliege the Mandator, or directly acquire to him; but they could only obliege themselves, and acquire to themselves, and thereafter transmit to the Mandators; and that because in most Contracts, thereby the person Contracter behoved immediatly to Act, and no person in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed, which our Customes regardeth not; and therefore Mandatars may act in their own names: In which case, the Right, whether real or personal, standeth in their person, as he who by Commission acquireth Lands, or Goods, in his own name, the real Right thereof is in his Person, and there lies an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon him, if he was Commissionat to transmit them to his Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; but he may also Acquire, Transact, or Contract in name of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituent: In which case, the real Rights stands immediatly in the Person of the Mandator, and the Obligation constitutes him Creditor: and there is no Obligation betwixt the Mandatar and the third Party. Nor is the Mandatar oblieged to instruct that he had Commission, but that is upon his hazard who acted with him, unless the contrary be proven by his Oath or Write; and

The Law for utility of Commerce, did against the common Rules foresaid, constitute an Obligation upon Exercitors, by the Deed or Contract of the Masters of the Ships. An Exercitor is he to whom the profite of Vessels or Ships, whether upon the Sea, Rivers or Lakes belongeth, whether he be owner of the Ship, or have only hired the same; the Master of the Ship is he that hath the command thereof, who therefore may Contract and borrow Money for Reparation of the Ship, or out-rigging thereof; or for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the Mariners, or any other thing for the use of the Voyage. And thereby not only the Master Contracter, but the Exercitor who constitute him is lyable: Yea, if the Master substitute another Master, his ingagement also obliegeth the Exercitor; so that whosoever he be that Contracts with him, who for the time officiats as Master, obliegeth the Exercitor, in what was borrowed for the use of the Ship, Company, or Voyage. And there seems no necessity of showing a Commission, but the exercing of the Office is sufficient; and thereby the Ship and out-rigging may be hypothecat and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: Yea, if there be many Exercitors, they are all lyable, <hi>in solidum;</hi> and if there be many Masters, the Contract of one of them obliegeth the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitors, unless it be expresly provided, they cannot Contract but jointly, which must appear by their Commission: Neither needs he who Contracts with the Master, instruct that the Money borrowed, was actually imployed for the use of the Ship, Company, or Voyage, but this much he must make appear, that when he lent the Money there was such need of it, albeit he be not oblieged to take notice whether the Master misimployed it or not, because the Exercitor should have looked whom he trusted. If the Master be consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute with power to buy Ware, and load the Ship, the prepositor is lyable to these who Contract with him, upon that accompt; but this is not presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon acting as Master, unless his Commission appear, and the Masters other Contracts obleige not the Exercitors, albeit their fault do, by the Edict, <hi>nautae

Consigner, and where the Law condescends on consignatars, the Consigner is liberate, and not lyable for the Consignatars sufficiency, or faithfulness, as where Consignations are to be legally in the hands of the Clerk of the Bills; yet if the Consignation hath not been orderly, but by the fault of the Consign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if the publick Consignatar prove Insolvent, the peril is the Consigner.</p>
                     <p>In Conventional Obligations, where the choyce of the Consignatar is in the Consigner, the Consignation is upon the peril of the Consigner, if the Consig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natar was Insolvent, which uses ordinarly to be exprest, but if it were not, it is implyed.</p>
                     <p>Trust is also a kind of Depositation, whereby the thing intrusted is in the custody of the person intrusted, to the behove of the intruster, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the thing intrusted, be it Land or Moveables, is in the person of the Intrusted, else it is not proper Trust; so if it be transmitted to singular Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, acquiring <hi>bona fide,</hi> they are secure, and the Trusty is only lyable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally upon the Trust; but such Trusts being of Importance, albeit Write useth not to be adhibite in them, they are not ordinarly proven but by Write, or Oath of Party; yet Witnesses were used, <hi>ex officio,</hi> and trust of an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation found proven thereby, <hi>February</hi> 22. 1665.

But in Depositati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Dominion &amp; Possession of the thing remaineth in the Deponent, though it be numerate Money Consigned, and to medle with it is unwarrantable, and accounted in Law theft, as being <hi>contrect atio rei alienae;</hi> and therefore, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing cannot be compensed with <hi>mutuum,</hi> where the property and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is in the borrower, and but a personal Obligation to repay, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be compensed with a body or quantity, the property whereof is not alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. The like therefore holdeth in Money found, or any other way in the detainers hands, without right to the property of it; yet if two Depositars were in question of that same kind of thing, as both of money, the Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows compensation in that case.</p>
                     <p n="55">55. The question is also moved here, whether the thing Depositat may be detained for the necessary and profitable expenses wared upon it, though Law and most Interpreters fovour the Negative, upon the same ground that compensation is excluded; but the Affirmative is preferred, because, as the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:109710:84"/>
contrary action is competent for the Melioration, so much more the excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being a part of the same Contract; and therefore, the Lord <hi>Balmerino</hi> having, by his own Missive and Back bond, acknowledged that the Estate of <hi>Jedburgh</hi> was Disponed to him in trust, to the behove of the Earl of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seat,</hi> all the expense on the Land, or for <hi>Somerseat</hi> in contemplation of the trust, was found competent against <hi>Bedford,</hi> who had adjudged <hi>Somerseat's</hi> Right.</p>
                     <p>And in all cases in the Law where Action is competent, Exception is also competent, and so with us, if instantly verified. Amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> there was an Edict of the Pretors, <hi>in deposito,</hi> to this effect, that Depositars should be oblieged to restore or make up the single value: But in things Depositat through the present occasion of Tumult, Fire, falling of Houses, or Ship-wrack (in the case of not due Restitution) for the double, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>ff. depositi,</hi> wherein there is much utility to secure persons, Depositating of necessity in these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable cases, but it hath not been allowed by our Customs as yet.</p>

It may be questioned, if any thing be Depositate to more Depositars, whether they are lyable <hi>in solidum?</hi> So that the Deponent may crave Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or Reparation from every one for the whole value, or for his share only: The Civil Law is clear for the Affirmative, that all are lyable <hi>in soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, l.</hi> 1. §. 43. <hi>eodem,</hi> and upon good reason, because it is fidelity in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving one Individual thing that is undertaken, which therefore, <hi>de natura rei,</hi> must obliege every person to the whole, seing he is not oblieged to restore a part of the thing Depositat, but the thing it self; yet if the Depositars be all solvendo, they are free paying their part, the thing depositat being Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <hi>l.</hi> 22. <hi>si duo haeredes, ff. depositi;</hi> but in this case, there were not more depositars, but more Heirs of a Depositar.</p>
                     <p>And in this Depositars and Con-tutors differ, that the diligence of these, even as to their Con-tutors, being greater then of the other; this being consequent to the nature of Depositation, will no doubt be followed by us. <hi>In deposito,</hi> in the Law, the Deponent hath <hi>beneficium juramenti in litem,</hi> or to prove the particulars or quantities wanting and their value, <hi>secundum praetium affectionis,</hi> because of the exuberance of Trust in this Contract, <hi>l.</hi> 1, §. 26. <hi>ff. depos.</hi> but not the Depositar in the contrary action, <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>eodem.</hi> where the reason is added, because there is no breach of Faith nor Trust, but Damnage and Reparation in question: The Depositar also detaining, being condemned becomes infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>ff. de his qui infamia notantur.</hi> Hence it is from this Trust, that if a Chest or other continent sealed be Depositat, action is competent for all that was therein shown or not, <hi>l.</hi> 1. §. 41. <hi>eodem;</hi> and therefore in such cases, the Deponents Oath <hi>in litem,</hi> must be taken, or else this Interest perisheth, which is suitable to our Custome, before mentoned in the case of Inn-keepers, and there is good reason and equity, <hi>pro pretio affectionis,</hi> but I have not observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it questioned or decided.

                     <p>There is a frequent case of Depositation of Writes before delivery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which therefore suspende their effect, until the Terms of the Deposita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appear, which is unquestionable by the Oath of the Party receiver of the Write, both that the Write was not delivered, but depositat, and also upon what terms.</p>

                     <p>These Contracts agree in this, that both are perfected according to Law and our Custome, by sole consent: Naked pactions being now efficatious, and though neither of the things exchanged be delivered, the agreement is valid, but if there be any latent vitiosity, if it impede the use of the thing bought, the <hi>Romans</hi> gave <hi>action em redhibitoriam,</hi> to restore and annual the bargain, or <hi>quanti minoris,</hi> for making up the buyers Interest; but if the seller was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the vitiosity, or insufficiency, he is not lyable to make it good, unless he affirm it to be free of that, or in general, of any other faults, but if he knew, he is lyable, if it were not showen to the buyer, or of it self evident or known; in which case, the seller is only oblieged, if he expresly paction, our Custome alloweth making up of latent insufficiency, of which before.</p>

The price must be also certain, or which may be assertained, as such a person gave, or as shall be had from others by the seller for the like Goods, or as such a person shall appoint, which if exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant, may be redacted, <hi>ad arbitrium boni viri,</hi> which seems to consist, though the arbitriment be made the buyers.</p>

                     <p>In fale there may be Earnest interposed, or Reversion granted, or the Commissory Paction or Clause irritant, adjected, that if the price be not payed, the sale shall be void, or the same may be conditionally, if the price be payed by such a day, or if any other offer not a better Price in such a time, or with condition not to sell, without consent, of which in order.</p>
                     <p n="65">65. As to the <hi>First,</hi> Though giving of Earnest be very ordinary in Bargains of sale and others, yet it is no less dubious, what the Nature and Effect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, some holding it to be, to the effect the Bargain may be evident and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; for though sale be perfected by sole consent, yet it is not always evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the parties and the witnesses, whether it be a Communing or a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract; and therefore, to make it sure to both, Merchants who may not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard upon dubious Interpretations, do give Earnest as an evidence of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain closed and perfected: But others think, that the effect and intent of Earnest, is that the giver of the Earnest may resile from the Bargain if he please to lose his Earnest, and the taker may resile, if he return the Earnest with as much more.

Yet many Texts in Law adduced by <hi>Wezenbecius, Faber</hi> and others, are for the former opinion, and they do Interpret the contrary places, not to be of sale perfected, but of an antecedent promise or paction, to buy or sell: It hath not oft occurred (so far as I have observed) to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided with us, which of these opinions is to be followed with us, but the former seems to be preferable, because ordinarly with us, Earnest is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable that it cannot be thought to be the meaning of the parties to leave the Bargain Arbitrary, upon the losing or doubling thereof, so was it found, <hi>February</hi> 24. 1628. <hi>contra James Riddel.</hi> To this also suits the sense, that Earnest is taken in the Scripture, <hi>for Evidence and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,</hi> making the matter Fixed and not Arbitrary, which at least evinceth that the <hi>Word</hi> hath been anciently taken so, whatever hath been the Custome and Constitution of the <hi>Romans.</hi>

Reversion or the Paction of Redemption, though ordinarly it is used in Wodsets, which albeit they be under the form of sale, yet in reality they are not such, there being no equivalent price, yet may it be where there is a true sale, and this paction is no real quality or condition of the sale, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be conceived, but only a personal obliegement on the buyer, which therefore doth not affect the thing bought, nor a singular Successor, though Reversion of Lands and Heretable Rights, be made as real and effectual against singular Successors, when it is ingrosled in the Bargain, or duely Registrate, yet that is not by the nature of the thing, but by the Statute, and takes no place in other cases, as in Reversion of Moveables, which are sold under Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version; but if impignorat, the Reversion is a part of the Contract, and is effectual against singular Successors.</p>
                     <p>As to the other Pactions adjected to sale, sometimes they are so conceived and meaned, that thereby the bargain is truely conditional and pendent, and so is not a perfect Bargain, till the condition be existent: Neither doth the property of the thing sold pass thereby, though Possession follow, till it be performed, as if the Bargain be conditional, only upon payment of the price at such a time, till payment the property passeth not unto the buyer; but there are many other adjections which are exprest under the name of Conditions and Provisions, which are not inherent as essential in the Bargain: But extrinsick personal Obliegements, the existence where of doth not annual the sale, or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend or annual the property in the buyer, at least in his singular Successors, as hath now been said in Reversions, and is frequent in many other cases.</p>

In Sale there uses to be adhibit a Clause irritant, or resolutive Clause, that if such a thing or Condition were, or were not, in that case the Bargain should be null and void, as if it had never been made and granted: whence ariseth a very subtile Debate, whether such Clauses, whatsoever their Tenor be, are effectual, and follow the thing to singular Successors, and do render the Bargain and Property acquired, null in it self? Or whether such be but person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Obligations only? Which though they may annul the Property or Bargain, if it remain in the hands of the Contracter, cannot reach it, if it be in the hands of a third party, is the Question: for clearing whereof, it appeareth,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> That if such Conditions, or resolutive Clauses do stop the transmis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Property, and be so meaned and exprest, then as is said before, the Bargain is pendent, and the Property not transmitted, even as to singular Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, and the seller remains the Proprietar: But if by the Contract and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:109710:88"/>
Clause, the buyer become once the Proprietar, and the condition is adject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he shall cease to be Proprietar, in such a case, this is but personal, for Property or Dominion passes not by conditions or provisions, but by Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and otherways prescribed in Law; so that these conditions, however exprest, are only the foundation, upon which the Property might pass from the buyer, if the thing bought remain his, unless by Law or Statute it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ordered, as in Reversions of Lands, Alienation of Fewdal Rights, which become void, and return if alienat, and not payment of the Few Duty, whereby the Few Right becomes void, but all by Law and Custome, and not by privat Paction.</p>
                     <p n="68">68. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The doubt remains, if such personal Conditions with such Clauses resolutive be in the body of the Bargain, whether it be effectual against singular Successors, who cannot but know their Authors Rights, and therefore are in <hi>dolo &amp; mala fide,</hi> if they acquire such Rights in prejudice of the conditions thereof, and so <hi>ex dolo,</hi> at least such Clauses will be effectual against the singular Successors; But <hi>first,</hi> this hath no force where the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is not voluntar, but necessar for satisfaction of Debt by Appryzing, and other Legal Diligence, in which ordinarly the acquirer doth not, neither is supposed to know his Authors Right.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the Bargain be so necessar, that the Purchaser be a Creditor, and hath no other probable way of payment, in which, though he see his Authors Right bearing such Clauses, yet he acteth upon necessity, for his own satisfaction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> These who acquire such Rights without necessity, and see there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in such conditions in themselves personal, though having resolutive Clauses, do not thereby know that the third party hath the Right, <hi>jus in re,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>jus ad rem;</hi> and therefore, if they acquire such Rights, the property is thereby transmitted: and though there may be Fraud in the acquirer, which raiseth an Obligation of Reparation to the party damnified by that Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; yet that is but personal, and another party acquiring, <hi>bona fide,</hi> or necessarly, and not partaking of that Fraud, is <hi>in tuto:</hi> but certain knowledge, by intimation, citation, or the like, and inducing <hi>malam fidem,</hi> whereby any prior Disposition, or Assignation made to another party, is certainly known, or at least interruption made in acquiring, <hi>bona fide,</hi> by Arrestment or Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the acquirer: Such Rights acquired, not being of necessity to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy prior Ingagements, are Reduceable, <hi>ex capite fraudis,</hi> and the acquirer is partaker of the Fraud of his Author, who thereby becomes a granter of double Rights, but this will not hinder Legal Diligences to proceed and be compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and become effectual, though the user thereof did certainly know any <hi>Inhoat,</hi> or incompleat Right of another; but it is more doubtful, and not yet clear by Custome, whether a voluntar Right taken for satisfaction of a prior Debt by him, who certainly knew of a prior Disposition or Assignation, though not perfected, would be reduced as Fraudulent.</p>
                     <p>The relating of a Right unto another Right, without any invalidity thereof exprest, was found to infer an acknowledgement of it, <hi>February</hi> 15. 1637. <hi>Lawder contra Goodwise</hi> of <hi>Whitekirk.</hi> Of late the like conditions have become very ordinary, that thereby property may become inalienable, and as a perpetual Usufruct; yet it seems such are neither expedient for Commerce, or for the necessity of the Proprietar, nor consistent with the nature of Property, whose main effect is Alienation, or disposal of the Substance of the thing, as Usufruct

is of the Fruits; and therefore, it were safest upon such Clauses to use Inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, yet they may be effectual against Lucrative Alienations or Donations, in respect that by these Clauses, at least the parties are personal Creditors, and so A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienations gratuitous in their prejudice, may be anulled by the Statute, 1621. <hi>c.</hi> 28.</p>

I have not observed it debated or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided with us, if the thing sold should thereafter perish, that yet the price is due; and if by common custome, the seller had not forborn in that case, doubtless the buyer would not have payed willingly, which therefore seems to be our Custome, seing none have obtained the price, who did not deliver, or offer the thing sold, which is also the opinion of <hi>Cujac. ad l.</hi> 33. <hi>ff.

Location and Conduction is a Contract whereby hyre is given for the fruits, use, or work of persons or things; this Contract keepeth a great proportion with sale, for as no Sale can be without a Price, so no Location without a Hire, and as the price must be certain, either being expresly named, or indirectly, being the price that such another gave for the like, or that such a person should think reasonable, both which become certain, if the price given by that other party appear, or if that third person modifie the price otherways, the sale is void and pendent, and unperfect, till that be performed: So in Location the hire must be the same way assertained; for if the pryce be but made, <hi>ex post facto,</hi> it is no proper Location, as he who gives his Cloath to be dyed, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:109710:89"/>
promiseth to agree for the Cloath, as the dye shall be in fineness, this is no Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but an innominat Contract.</p>
                     <p>But it is contraverted, whether Sale and Location do also agree in this, that as the price must be in current Money, so also the hire. It was of much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, because Location was a nominat Contract, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by sole consent, but other Contracts innominate were but naked pactions, till the thing agreed upon was interposed; and therefore it is there accuratly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, some holding that Money only can make the hire in a proper Locati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and some that any other Liquid quantity or fungible is sufficient, as Oyl, Grain, &amp;c. But with us, all agreements being effectual by sole consent, we need not much debate; and therefore, seeing all the effects and conditions competent, where the hire is Money, are also competent where it is any other Fungible, we agree with that opinion, that such are proper Locations.</p>
                     <p>Sale and Location differ mainly in this, that the intent and effect of Sale, is to alienate the Substance of the thing bought, and state the property thereof in the buyer; but in Location, the ordinar intent thereof is, that the Substance and property of the thing is not alienat, but remains in the setter, and the taker hath only the fruits and work thereof, which must not be already done, and extant, but that which is to be done, &amp; <hi>in spe:</hi> as for instance, a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for the Fruits of a Field, which are already growing, is no Location, but Sale, and so of use or work, already performed; and therefore, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Contract, there is a hazard and uncertainty in the conductor of the quantity, or value of the Fruits, use or Work, the peril and profites where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the Conductors.</p>
                     <p n="71">71. But here ariseth the Question, that in the case of the sterility of the Ground set, or the absolute ceasing of the Use, Fruit or Work, whether the hire be due in that case? The determination thereof will clear the exception of the former Rule, concerning the peril and quantity of the Use, Fruit and Work locat; and therefore, <hi>First,</hi> Where the Use, Fruit and Work doth altogether cease, without the fault of the Conductor, there the hire must also cease, because the one is given as the cause of the other, and the peril un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, is not of the being, but of the quantity and value thereof; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, if Land taken be inundat or sanded, and so have no Fruit, it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of all, that the hire or cane ceaseth to be due for that time: Or if a Horse sett, or a Servant hired die, the hire or see is but due according to the time of their life; but if they be sick or unprofitable for a time, yet with hope of recovery and profite, in that case there is no abatement.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though the opinion of the Learned be very diverse, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the barrenness of the Ground, some accompting it, if the half of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar Increase fail, some if the third, and some leaving it to the common esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the place, what is called barrenness or the arbitriment of the Judge; yet I think it more rational to determine that case with the rest, upon the former ground, that if there be any profite of the Fruit above the expenses, or work, the rent or hire should be due.</p>
                     <p n="72">72. The like is in vastation by publick Calamity, which hath been frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decided upon occasion of the late Vastations, but this will not extend to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate accidents besalling the Cropt after the growing or reaping, even though by accident it should be destroyed or burnt without the Takers fault, the

Seing the intent and effect of the Location, is not to alienate the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the thing <hi>Locat,</hi> it followeth, that this Contract is meerly personal, and thereby there is no real Right in the thing, whose Use, Fruits, or Work are <hi>Locat;</hi> so that if the property of these things be alienate from the <hi>Locator,</hi> the interest of the Conductor ceaseth, and a singular Successor may recover it from the Conductor, notwithstanding the Location, which reacheth it only by the personal Contract, as it did belong to the Setter, and so it would be in our Tacks or Rentals, by their own nature, but it is otherways provided by a special Statute, of which hereafter. We shall speak nothing here of Feu-Farms, which though they are Locations, yet by the Law they become real, leaving these to their own place.</p>
                     <p n="74">74. What shal be said of that Contract, whereby Money or any Fungible is lent for the like in kind again, with such a hire for the use thereof? These are called Usurary contracts, and they cannot be comprehended under Loan, because they are not Gratuitous, or under Location, because the property and substance is alienat, Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Contracts come nearest to Location; but to repress the exorbitance of Usurers, the Civil Law rejected Usurary Contracts, and admitteth only of the profite of fungibles. In some cases, the Judicial Law also rejecteth them, and prohibiteth Usury to be used among the Jews, though they might use it with other Nations. So doth the Canon Law disapprove it, and most Nations, where that Law is in vigor; yet we, and generally other Protestant Nations do allow of the profite and hire of Money, or other Fungibles, being within the proportion allowed in Law, which sometimes was ten for each hundred in the year, thereafter eighth, and now six; and therefore Usurary-contracts are only, wherein there is unlawful or exorbitant profites beyond the Law. So did the Civil Law allow, <hi>usuras centesimas, viz.</hi> one of an hundred Monethly; and their <hi>Usuras besses, semisses</hi> and <hi>Dodrantes.</hi> In the several cases allowed in Law, we have only one measure for all; the <hi>nauticum foenus,</hi> is where so much is given, not only for the profite of the Money, but for the hazard and peril of the Ware bought thereby, or of other Fungibles, by Sea, and so it is a mixed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract; and in both cases Profite and Annualrent is lawful, as having no moral countermand, and so being free, is not only subject to our pactions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, which we are morally oblieged to observe; but hath also in it permu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Justice, in that Money, Wine, Oyl, Grain or the like, have a real use profitable to men by the exchange thereof, and increase that may accrew thereby, and for which proportionable hire may be lawfully and profitably constitute: These Usurary-contracts therefore are to be reduced, not to Loan, but to Location, though by accident they have that difference from the rest, that the property is alienate, because there can be no use of Money or Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibles otherways.</p>
                     <p>The penalty of exorbitant Usury with us was, that the Debitor for such Usury, revealing the same, should be freed of the Contract, and if he did not, any other revealing it should have right to the sum given out upon Usury and Profit thereof, <hi>Par.</hi> 1594. <hi>cap.</hi> 221.

But whether pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Wodsetts without back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, though the Rent be much more then the ordinary Annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, be an usurary Contract, and falls under the general Clause of the said Act, though it hath sometimes been essayed, yet hath not been decided. The main reason that the parties found on is, on the one part, that there is indirectly more then the ordinary Annualrent, and so falls under the Act, 1597. and on the other, that improper Wodsetts are there exprest, and proper Wodsetts seem <hi>ex proposito</hi> omitted, and in proper Wodsetts all hazard lyes upon the Wodsetter. Of setting the Land of dead, poor and waste, we shall leave this to every mans private judgement, till publick judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cast the ballance; but all proper Wodsetts before 1661. are restricted to the Annualrent by the Act of Parliament, 1661. <hi>cap.</hi> 62.

                     <p>There uses also, in Wodsetts and Reversions, to be included, a condition to set the Wodsett Lands for such time, to begin after redemption, which if it be far within the true worth, is Usurary, and is declared so, <hi>Parl.</hi> 1449. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. <hi>That Lands provided to be set for Tacks not near the true worth, the same shall not be keeped:</hi> yet such a Tack was sustained, seing the Wodsetter had not his full Annualrent, by reason of a Liferent reserved in the Wodsett, and the Wodsetter was the Constituents Brother, and so like to be for his Portion natural, whereof the Tack was a part, <hi>June</hi> 21. 1662.

                     <p>To return to Location, all things may fall under the same, that can have any use, fruit or work, but real servitudes cannot be set severally, but only as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessories to the thing which they serve. Works which can be locat, 1. must be lawful. 2. They must be performable in that which belongeth to the conductor, or in reference to his person; for work employed upon the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers own matter, it is no Location; as if a Goldsmith be employed to work such a piece of work in his own Mettal, and the same to be bought as it is so wrought, it is Sale and no Location, unless there be two distinct Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains, one for the Mettal, which is Sale; and the other for the Workmanship, which is Location; So he that bargains for the benefit of what fish he shall take for such a time in his own water, contracteth Sale, and not Location; and if the work be to be employed on that which concerns a third party, it is not Location, but a Mandar.</p>
                     <p n="76">76. From this Contract, the Conductors Obligation is to pay the hire, and after the end of Location, to restore the thing locat, making up all damages, in which the Conductor is lyable even for light faults, and must use such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence as prudent men use in their Affairs, but is not lyable for casual or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental perishing of the thing locat. Some hold him lyable for the most exact diligence and lightest fault; but others, with better reason, are for the contrary, it being the common rule in diligence, that which is only to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove of the keeper, he should use most exact diligence, and is lyable for the lightest fault, as it is in Loan, and these who have the custody only for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are lyable but for the grossest fault, which is equivalent to fraud, and for such diligence as is commonly accustomed by every man; but these who have the custody for themselves, and partly for others, are in the middle way oblieged for such diligence as themselves or prudent men use in their Affairs.</p>
                     <p n="77">77. The Obligation on the part of the Locator, is to deliver the thing lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, and to continue it during the time of the location, and to refound to the Conductor his necessary expense employed upon the thing hired, unless the custom of the place be otherwayes; and so the reparation and upholding of houses set in <hi>prediis Urbanis</hi> lyeth upon the setter, if it be not otherwayes agreed; but in Lands, or <hi>prediis Rusticis,</hi> the Tennent is oblieged to keep the Land and Houses in as good condition as he got them, and may not destroy Mosses, nor rive out Meadows, and is lyable for the damage, though there be no such provision in his Tack, <hi>February</hi> 6. 1633. Laird of <hi>Haddo</hi> contra <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoun;</hi> but he hath no reparation for any building or policy which he maketh, which is accounted as being frely due without expectation of recompence, if it be not otherwayes agreed, or that the Rent be raised thereby.</p>
                     <p n="78">78. Society is not so much a permutative, as a commutative Contract, whereby the Contracters communicat each to other some Stock, Work, or Profit. The effect of Society is, that thereby something which before was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, becometh, or is continued to be common to the co-partners, and it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Stock, or the profit of a Stock, or Work, Labour or Industry: Yet, this communication is not effectual to transfer the Property in part, or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat it without delivery or possession, by which, Property by positive Law
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:109710:91"/>
is conveyed. There is ofttimes a communion without Society, because it is of accident, as Legators, Heirs or Acquirers of the same thing, <hi>pro indiviso,</hi> but if there be interposed a Contract thereupon, to continue that Communion for the common profite of the Contracters, it becometh a proper Society.</p>
                     <p n="79">79. The matter of Society are things, fruits, work or industry, and that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously; for sometimes the thing or stock is only put by one, and the work and industry about it by another, as where a stock is given in partnership to a Merchant to Trade with, here it may be that the Merchants skill and pains is ballanced with the profite of the stock of the other, who doth not, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make that use of it. Or Land is set to Husband-men to be Laboured, and the Increase to be common. Sometimes each partner bringeth a stock to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and their work or pains withal, and sometime only work, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite thereby is made common; and sometimes the one communicateth the stock it self, whereby the property thereof becometh common to himself and other partners, and the profite accrewing thereby, and the other bringeth in a stock, but doth not communicate it self, but the profite thereof; in all the interest and shares, may either be equal or unequal, but without work and industry by the partners or others, there can be no Society, because there can be no profite or hazard, of profite or loss.</p>
                     <p n="80">80. The nature of this Contract is, to have in it equality of profite and loss, proportionable to the value and worth of the stock and work, which is unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable and undispensible by the nature of this Contract; and scarcely can any paction or indirect course, be effectual in the contrair, because thereby the Contract would become Usurary and void; which equality, as to the work and industry is illiquid, and the value thereof is esteemed according to the common estimate; but where there is a special value set upon it, by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate consent of parties, which (as was said before of the private rate of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) without Fraud it is sufficient; so sometimes the value of the work is estimate equal to the stock or industry of the other partner, and sometime the half, third, or other proportion of it: But where the matter is clear, or where the Society consists of a Stock in Money, the profite must necessarly be proportionable thereto, and the hazard or loss accordingly; but if it be agreed, that where the Stocks are equal, the one should have one third, and the other two thirds of the profite or loss, or that one should bear the hazard of the Stock of both, and the profite should be equal, or any other inequality, it is clearly Usurary, unequal and unjust, neither doth it subsist as a Donation, unless so specially exprest and really meaned; for oftimes to make incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent Contracts subsist, it is agreed, that the inequality, if any be, shall be a Donation; but that is a meer colour, and doth work no effect, seing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Contract is truely to communicate like for like, and not to gift, and that addition is but simulate or fraudulent: Hence Society may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed a Contract, for communicating the profite or loss of that which is brought unto the Society, proportionably according to the share and interest of each partner. It is true that if there appear no inequality in the Stock and industry of the partners, when no proportion is exprest, equal share of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and loss is understood; or if the skill or industry of some of the partners be of great importance, the Society may consist in these terms, that these persons shall have no share of the loss, and shall have such a share of the profite accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Sentence of <hi>Sulpitius,</hi> but if such inequality appear not, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Mucius,</hi> rejecting such inequality is just, and there is no contrariety between the opinions of both, §. 2 <hi>instit. de societate.</hi>

                        <pb n="162" facs="tcp:109710:92"/>81. It remains to consider, what are the effects of Society while it is, and how it ceaseth: As to the <hi>first,</hi> the disposal and management of all the affairs of Societies is in the whole partners, and each of them (though having an unequal share) hath an equal vote, unless it be otherways agreed, and the common rule is, <hi>potior est conditio prohibentis,</hi> so that every one hath a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Vote, in Acts that are not necessary for the design of the Society, unless by the custom, or paction, or deed of the parties, it be otherways ordered; as where its the custom of the place, that in such Societies, there should be a plurality, or when it is agreed that the minor part should give place to, and is comprehended in the Acts of the major part, or when the Society hath been accustomed to act in such a way, not only the greater part, but even one or more of the partners may continue that way, which is still held to be the mind of the whole, unless the contrary be exprest; and therefore it was found, where one of more partners in a Ship had fraughted her to a dangerous Voyage, without the others consent, yet was not found lyable for her value, being lost by accident, where no just objection could be made against the Skippers skill, <hi>July</hi> 22. 1673. <hi>John Sim contra William Abernethy.</hi> So letting out of Lands, or setting out of Houses, employing of Moneys in a Society, may be continued by one or more of the partners, and their actings with extraneous persons, in name of the Society, do constitute the whole Society Debitor or Creditor, or doth acquire to them, or dispone from them. It is also consistent with the nature of this Contract, to give a Negative Vote to one or more of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whose interest in the Stock, or whose skill and industry is esteemed the greatest; but the simple nature of Society it self is, the most tender ingadge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and so if it be not otherways provided, it is always dissolveable at the option, and the choise of any of the Society, and it implys that the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in the whole partners equally, and that every one hath a Negative Vote; and therefore, when it is Contracted to a time, that it may not be parted from, in that case, the interest and end of the Society is changed, and if the minor part will not cede to the Major part, or to Arbitriment, it must be decided by the Judge ordinar, which of the parts is most conduceable to the Society, but this being so great a retardment upon the management of the affairs of the Society, it looseth the fraternity among the partners, and is sure to lose the pleasure and readily the profite of all: Therefore the <hi>Romans</hi> did upon good grounds annul and disown all pactions, whereby Society did continue beyond the life and pleasure of any of the partners, except in few cases.</p>
                     <p n="82">82. Society is finished; <hi>First,</hi> When the matter whereupon it is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted is extinct.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> By the death or incapacity to act in the Society of any of the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; for it being one individual Contract of the whole, and not as many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts as partners, it is like a sheaf of Arrows bound together with one tye, out of which, if one be pulled, the rest will fall out, and the personal humor of the partners is so chosen, that it is not supposed to be communicate to their Heirs or Assigneys, unless by custom or paction the contrair be provided, which, no doubt is consistent with, though not consequent from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of Society.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is most consonant to the nature of Society to be dissolved at the option and pleasure of any of the partners, it being very contrair thereto, and much impeding of the ends of it, that any should be continued a partner
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:109710:92"/>
against his own will; and therefore ordinarly, not only the express renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Society, but any Contracting or Acting separatly in the matter of the Society dissolveth it, yet <hi>propter bonam fidem,</hi> whatsoever is done with, or by the Society, before the dissolution thereof be known, is valide; but this dissolution at pleasure may be altered by custom, or consent of parties: And to sum up all, in Society proportionable equality is essential and inseparable, and all the other specialities are congruous and convenient, and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, if by custom or consent it be not otherways ordered.</p>
                     <p n="83">83. The same question is incident here, that before hath been touched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Mandats, when one or more of the parties act in the matter of the Society, whether thereby the whole Society be oblieged by the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of these? Whether obligations made to these, constitute the Society Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor? Or whether real Rights acquired by these, are <hi>ipso facto,</hi> common to the Society? Or if there be but an obligation upon the actors, to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, the property always remaining in the actors, till they effectually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, the resolution of this being the same with that in Mandats, we refer it thither, and say only this in general, that when these parties only act in name of the Society, and by its warrand express, or what they have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to do, in so far they are not only partners, but Mandatars, and it hath the same effect, as if the Society had acted it self; but when they act not so, there doth only arise an obliegement upon the partners actors to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, in the mean time the property remaineth in them: And if trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to others before this communication, the Society will be thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, but the actors will remain oblieged for Reparation of the Damnage and Interest of the Society; and this will hold, though things be bought or acquired by the common Money of the Society: But all the natural interest, birth, fruit and profite of the Society, is of it self and instantly common to the Society.</p>
                     <p n="84">84. Partners are lyable each to other, for such diligence as men do ordinar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly use, or the Partners themselves use in their own affairs; for this Contract being undergone for the mutual good of either party, the diligence keepeth the middle way betwixt exact diligence and supine negligence, but none of them are lyable for what is lost by force or accident, without their fault.</p>
                     <p>Society hath as many divisions, as hath the various and multiform matter in which it may be contracted; but that which is most noticed in Law is, that some Societies are common and general, whereby parties communicate all their goods, rights and interests, communicable; others are particular of one or more of them; upon the first there are many questions arising, as how far the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may gift, or educat and provide their Children, so that the rest are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieged, or understood to concur: But such Societies being altogether unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed here, it shall be vain to debate the properties of them.</p>
                     <p n="85">85. These be the several kinds of Pactions and Contracts; there be other distinctions of them, not from their nature, but from their adjuncts or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancee, of which this is the chief, that Contracts may be celebrate, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly or mediatly by the interposition of other persons, as Mandatars, or Commissioners; concerning which it hath been showen before, that as there is a Contract betwixt the Mandant and Mandatar, so ofttimes there is a Contract ingaged betwixt the Mandant and a third party, who hath acted with the Mandatar according to his warrand; in which case ordinarly there is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:109710:93"/>
or Obliegement betwixt the Mandatar and the third party; as he who buyes Land in name, and to the use of another by his warrand, the Lands are acquired to him who gave the warrand, and he is oblieged to pay the price to the seller, but not his Mandatar, so the seller is oblieged to deliver and warrand to him, and not to the Mandatar.</p>
                     <p>To all manner of Promises and Contracts, Caution and Oaths may be acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory; with which therefore, it shall not be improper to sum up this Title. Caution or Surety is the Promise or Contracts of any, not for himself, but for another; and therefore, this being a gratuitous ingagement, having no equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent cause onerous, as to the Cautioner, it required a stipulation among the <hi>Romans</hi> to make it effectual, though it was sometime by Mandats or Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but now every promise and paction, according to the Law of Nature, being effectual, it is valid without Stipulation.</p>
                     <p n="86">86. Caution is interposed any way, by which the consent is truely given, and it may be either by Mandat or Commission, when the Mandator giveth order or warrand to Contract with any other party, to that parties behove; for then that party is the principal Debitor, and the Mandator is Cautioner, or it may be by taking on the Debt of another freely. This Cautioner in the Law is called <hi>Expromissor,</hi> but is more improperly a Cautioner, seing himself is principal, having but an obligation of relief as Mandatar, or Negotiator: But the most proper and ordinary Cautioner, is he who is oblieged with, and for the Principal Debitor, and is called, <hi>ad promissor,</hi> or <hi>fide jussor,</hi> because upon his Faith or Trust the Creditor contracteth. These Cautionary Promises or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts are of the same kind or nature with these, of which we have now spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, yet have they something peculiar, which we shall shortly touch, which resolve in these Questions; <hi>First,</hi> Whether Cautioners are lyable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veenable simply, or in so far as the principal Debitor is not <hi>solvendo,</hi> or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter discussing of him. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether Cautioners are lyable, <hi>in solidum,</hi> or <hi>pro rata.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="87">87. As to the first, the nature and intent of Surety is, that the Creditor may be secure of his Debt; and therefore Cautioners are not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarly decerned till the Creditor assign the Debt, and all security they have for it from the Principal, if they have not a distinct interest to retain the security, <hi>January</hi> 10. 1665. <hi>Lesly contra Gilbert Hay.

                     <p n="88">88. Cautioners cannot be pursued till the principal Debitor be discust, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be otherways Contracted or provided by the Custom or Law of the place: It was cotrary by the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Law, l. <hi>jure nov.

With us Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners are frequently bound for, and with the Principal, as full Debitors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly and severally, and thereby, <hi>ex pacto,</hi> the Question ceaseth: But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the Cautioner is understood to be oblieged for the Principal Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors performance, and so is lyable only subsidiarie after the Principal is discust, and specially where the performance is a Trust or Deed, proper to the Principal Creditor; thus Cautioners for Executors are only lyable after the Executors are discust, at least by Horning execute, <hi>June</hi> 27. 1610. <hi>John Sorogy contra</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable of <hi>Dundee.</hi>

can be effectual, a promissory oath is valid, and hath this much of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that the Creditor is the more secure, because he may justly expect, the Debitor will be more observant of his oath then of his ordinary paction, seing the penalty of the violation of an oath deserves a more attrocious judgement than any other, God being called as a Witness and Judge: which effect it hath, though adhibit to that which by the matter hath an anterior obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as obligations betwixt Husband and Wife, Parents and Children, in these things in which they are mutually oblieged, or where there hath preceded or is conjoined an obligator Contract, which of it self is binding without an oath. 2.

All do agree, that in matters free, and in our own power as Contracts are obligator, so also are Oaths.</p>
                     <p>The question then remains, Whether in acts civiliter inefficacious, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition of an Oath can give efficacy; or whether that which is done <hi>in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bito modo,</hi> becomes valid by an Oath to perform it, or not to impunge it, and if that efficacy will not only extend to the swearer, but to his heirs or successors. Of this there are multitudes of cases and examples debated among Civilians; by the Civil Law, naked Pactions are not efficacious to ground any Action upon; <hi>quaeritur,</hi> whether if the Paction be with an Oath, the Creditor may not effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pursue thereupon? By Law likewayes, the deeds of Minors, having Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors not consenting, are null; but if the Minor swear not to quarrel them <hi>quid juris,</hi> Minors laesed have by Law the benefit of restitution, but if they do the deed upon oath to perform it, or not to quarrel it, whether if they pursue to reduce it, will they be excluded by their Oath; or if a Wife be oblieged perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally for debt, and swear to perform it, or never to come in the contrair, Whether yet she may defend her self with her priviledge; or if a womans Land given her for security of her Tocher <hi>donatione propter nuptias,</hi> be sold by her Husband with her consent, which the Law declareth null, Whether her oath interposed will validate it, or if <hi>pactum Legis Commissoriae in pignoribus,</hi> confirmed with an oath will be valid, or if an oath for performance will exclude the common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of fear, force or fraud: And innumerable such cases, whereby posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law prohibiteth any act to be done, or declareth it void simply, or void if it be not done in such a manner, and with such solemnities.</p>
                     <p>For clearing of these and the like cases, we are chiefly to consider, <hi>quae sunt partes Judicis,</hi> or what is the Judge his duty in deciding cases wherein oaths are interposed, rather than what concerns the parties, and the obligations upon their conscience by these oaths in <hi>foro poli;</hi> and therefore, we shall take up the matter distinctly in these ensuing points.</p>
                     <p>First, if an Action be pursued upon a ground ineffectual in Law, albeit the Defender hath interposed an oath never to come in the contrair, yet that which would not be sustained by the Judge, though the Defender should not appear or object, which is ineffectual of it self, in that case the interposition of an oath hath no effect: as if by the Civil Law, an Action were intented upon a promise or a naked paction, with an oath interposed, the Action would not be sustained, albeit the Defender should not appear, or appearing should not object, that it were a naked paction. Or, if a Declarator should be intented, to declare <hi>pactum legis commissoriae in pignoribus</hi> to be valid and effectual, though it were lybelled, that the other party did swear never to come in the contrair, yet the Judge could
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:109710:95"/>
not sustain such an Action, nor generally can sustain any Action which is unjust or irrelevant, albeit it should not be opposed, but consented to simply, or with an oath never to quarrel it, because in such cases, <hi>pactis privatorum non derogatur juri communi.</hi> The consent or oath of no party can make that just which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, nor can make that sufficient or effectual, that is deficient in its essentials; as if any party should grant a Disposition of Lands or Annual-rents, and declare, that it should be effectual for poinding the ground without Infeftment, and should swear never to come in the contrair thereof, if thereupon the obtainer should pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue poinding of the ground, the same could not be sustained, because these Rights are defective in their essentials, wanting Infeftment; and yet in these cases, if the party should object, or any way hinder the effect of their oath, they contraveen the same: But the Judge not sustaining the same, doth no wrong, because his not sustaining proceeds upon a defect of an essential requisite, and not because of any exception or objection of the party: from this ground it is, that if a Wife be pursued or charged upon a Bond for Debt subscribed by her, bearing expresly her to be designed a Wife, though it were condescended on that she made faith never to come in the contrair; the Lords would not sustain the pursute or Charge, because by the very Action it self it appeareth, that the Summonds or Charges are irrelevant, and contrair to Law, which declareth a Wifes Bond for Debt <hi>ipso jure</hi> null; and therefore, though she may be faulty in suspending, or hindering the performance of the ingagement of her oath, the Lords do justly reject such an irrelevant Libel or Charge, as they did in the case betwixt and <hi>Catharine Douglas, Feb.</hi> 18. 1663. where her Band was suspended <hi>simpliciter,</hi> as being expresly granted by a wife, though she judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially made faith never to come in the contrair: or if the husband should su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spend and alledge, that such an Obligation or Oath could not be effectual against his Goods, or the person of his Wife in his prejudice, there could be neither wrong on his part, nor on the Judges part. 2. If either Action or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception be founded upon that which is not defective in essentials, but in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantials, ordained and commanded by Law, the defect thereof may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the other parties consent, much more by their oath; and in that case, <hi>quae fieri non debent facta valent:</hi> for every prohibition of Law doth not anull the deed done contrair thereto, but infers the penalty of Law upon the doer, as Tacks of Teinds are prohibit to be set by Prelates for longer then nineteen years, <hi>Parl.</hi> 1617. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:109710:96"/>
from proposing or making use of such exceptions and allegiances; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, neither may the party justly propone the same, nor the Judge justly su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain the same, for there be many things of themselves relevant and competent in Law, which yet may be excluded by a personal objection, against the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poner; for in many cases, allegeances competent to parties may be renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, so that though they be relevant, that personal objection will exclude the proponer, but his Oath is much stronger then his Renunciation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, seing such points are not <hi>partes judicis,</hi> nor consistent in any intrinsick nullity or defect, though the Law allow or prescribe them, yet it doth not mention or express, that though the party in whose favours they are introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced renunce them simply, or with an Oath, that these shall be admitted; and therefore, they are justly to be repelled, being <hi>in detrimentum animae,</hi> of the proponer.

                     <p>On this ground likeways, the exception or reason of Reduction upon force or fear is excluded, if the party have sworn to perform, or not quarrel the deed, which is the sentence of the Canon Law, not only as to Wifes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, to the alienation of Lands given to them, <hi>donatione propter nuptias,</hi> which is both null, and presumed to be granted upon her fear or reverence of her Husband, <hi>C. licet mulieris, l.</hi> 6. <hi>de jure jurando C. cum continget de jure juran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> whereby such consents and oaths, being interposed, are declared to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide; but generally, that no deed having an oath interposed, can be recalled upon an alledgeance of force and fear, <hi>C.</hi> 3, &amp; 4. <hi>de iis quae vim metumve;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the <hi>Pope</hi> assumes to himself liberty <hi>to absolve from such oaths as are done upon fear,</hi> yet they are declared of themselves to be valide, which our Custome fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, and was so decided, <hi>Parl.</hi> 1481. <hi>cap.</hi> 83. and was so decided by the Lords, <hi>July</hi> 4. 1642. <hi>Agnes Grant contra Balvaird,</hi> where a Wife was excluded from the Reduction of the alienation of her Liferent Lands, <hi>super vi &amp; metu,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she had judicially ratified the same, and sworn never to come in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair; neither was it respected, that the Oath as well as the Disposition was by force and fear, this is the great foundation of all publick Transactions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt different parties and Nations, where ofttimes the one party is induced through fear, to that which otherways they would not yeeld to; and yet both parties acquiesce in the Religion of an Oath interposed: So the Oath of <hi>Israel</hi> to the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> was binding upon them, though thereby the people
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:109710:96"/>
of God subjected themselves to a Heathen King; and therefore they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused by <hi>Jeremiah</hi> for breach thereof, and likewise for breaking the Oath to their Servants, whom they manumitted upon meer necessity, for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
                     <p>From this reason it is, that the exception or reason of Reduction upon decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Fraud or Circumvention is excluded, if an Oath be interposed, whereof we have the most eminent example, of the Oath of the People of <hi>Israel</hi> to the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> who purposely deceived and circumveened them, feigning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be a people far off, though they were of the <hi>Hivites,</hi> whom <hi>Israel</hi> was commanded utterly to destroy; against which judicial Precept, they being induced through error and deceit to swear, the Oath was binding on them and their posterity, and was punished upon <hi>Saul</hi> for breach thereof. From this instance we have occasion to return to the last case, whether Oaths be only personal oblieging the swearer, and so inherent to their persons that they bind not their Heirs, wherein some are for the affirmative, that even Heirs are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieged, as being <hi>fictione juris eadem persona cum defuncto,</hi> which is also fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the punishment in the Successors of <hi>Israel,</hi> in the days of <hi>Saul;</hi> but I rather incline to the Negative, that Heirs are not oblieged, but only the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who swear, which is the more common opinion of Lawers, Civilians, and Canonist's; nor doth the instance infer the contrary, because Oaths by So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties and Incorporations, continue not as to their Heirs, but because the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety dieth not, and is ever the same, especially in Contracts betwixt Nations, where the parties intend not to obliege particular persons, then living, but the Nation; neither doth the fiction of Law operate in this case; for no position or fiction of Law can either extend or abriege the obligation of an Oath, which is <hi>alterius &amp; superioris juris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There remains yet this Objection, that if Oaths be so effectual, great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies will follow, a door being opened to Force and Fraud, for the same facility that parties are induced to act, they will be induced to confirm it by an Oath. It is answered, <hi>in commodum non solvit argumentum;</hi> which therefore was not regarded in the case of <hi>Agnes Grant contra Balvaird,</hi> but there may be a remeid by severe punishment upon parties, who shall induce others to swear to their own hurt, which the Prince may inflict, and repair the damnage of the laesed; it is true, if the fear be such as stupifieth, and takes away the act of reason, there is nothing done, because there can no Contract in its substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials consist without the knowledge and reason of the party; or if the deceit be <hi>in substantialibus,</hi> as if a man should by mistake Marry one woman for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there is nothing done, but when an act of reason is exercised: But upon motives by fear, error, or mistake, the deed is in it self valid, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nullable by the Fear or Fraud, which are excluded by the Oath, against which they cannot be alledged by the party who hath sworn, but may be proponed by his Heirs, Executors, or Cautioners, or any other having interest.</p>
                     <p>Having now spoken of the several kinds of Obligations, before we go over to real Rights, it is fit to touch the common considerations that fall into all or most Obligations, as to the implement or performance thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> delay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, profite, time, place, and manner of performance.</p>
                     <p n="98">98. Delay or <hi>mora,</hi> is not that time, which by the adjection of a day or condition, or by Law is allowed to perform, but that time which runs after lawful delay is past, and is the Debitors fault, in not performing his Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:109710:97"/>
so that it seldom makes any part of the Contract, whereupon the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariseth, except penalties be adjected in case of delay, or an estimation made of the interest.</p>
                     <p>Delay is incurred in pure Obligation by interpellation or requisition, for when no term is prefixed, the option of the Debitor is the time of performance, and though requisition be most clear and secure by Instrument of a Nottar; and therefore, verbal requisition by a Merchant to a Skipper, to loose after the Ship was loadened, was not found sufficient without an Instrument, where the Charter party had no definite term, but to do diligence to transport the Fraught, <hi>February</hi> 14. 1678. <hi>David Calderwood contra James Angus:</hi> Yet in some cases that is not necessar, but being only emission of words, it will only be probable by the Debitors Oath or Write. In Obligations to a day, delay is incurred by the passing of the term, <hi>nam dies interpellat pro homine.</hi> In Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations Conditional, delay connot be till the condition be purified, and even then, either requisition or a term is requisite, for it is frequent in Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Conditional to add a term also, so that the existence of the condition makes the Conditional Obligation to become pure, and so requisition is to be used before delay, if no term be exprest; but if there be no party who can require or be required, delay is incurred, if performance be not made so soon as it can be, as is in the case of the Restitution of things found, or come in the hands of others without Contract, which is seldom known to the owner. So also in Obligations due to Pupils, delay is incurred without requisition, <hi>l.</hi> 1. §. <hi>ult. de ujuris.</hi> And in Obligations by Delinquence, delay is without requisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and runneth from the first time performance can be made.</p>
                     <p>Till delay, legal execution is not competent ordinarly, because none should be pursued till he have failed: Yet in some cases the Debitor may be pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the term, to pay at the Term, as <hi>si vergat adinopiam:</hi> Yea, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving it seems very expedient, to pursue the party warned, even before the Term, to remove at the Term, otherways the Lands cannot be safely set, the Tennent not knowing if others will remove willingly, and may not be uncertain in that point, which is a publick Interest, for setting Land, and preventing wast; but upon all Obligations which are truely contracted, the legal diligences of Arrestment or Inhibition may be used even before requisition, or the term of performance.</p>
                     <p>The ordinar effect of delay is, that when the Obligation is to give or deliver any thing, if it perish, even without the Debitors fault, it perisheth to the Debitor, and must be made good to the Creditor, unless it appear that it would have so perished with the Creditor, which seldom can be made appear, because it is ordinarly presumed, that if the thing had been delivered, the Creditor would have disposed of it, and so been free of the hazard, especially if it be a thing for sale, not for keeping, and if an occasion was offered, to have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed thereof.</p>
                     <p n="99">99. The next effect of delay, is the interest or damnage of the Creditor; for if the Obligation be performed within the due time, and in due manner, there is no interest; if not, after the delay incurred by requisition or term, it is in the Creditors option to pursue for performance or for damnage and interest. But in some cases delay may be purged, which is much <hi>in arbitrio judicis,</hi> and is always granted in things penal, where the penalty is great and exceeds the true interest, as in non-payment of Few Duties, which infers loss of the Few. And
<pb facs="tcp:109710:97"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:109710:98"/>
                        <pb n="173" facs="tcp:109710:98"/>
in Clauses irritant, in Wodsets. When delay is purged, the hazard returns upon the Creditor, and the Debitor is free, if the thing to be delivered perish; but if the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor do again! equire, after the former delay is purged; delay is again incurred by that new requisition.</p>
                     <p>This is a general rule, <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <p>Interest may either be competent for the whole Obligation, as when it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prestable, or when any part or qualification is unperformed, or the value thereof.</p>
                     <p>Interest doth both comprehend <hi>damnum emergens &amp; lucrum cessans.</hi> The first is commonly competent, the last but in some cases, and that ordinarly for such gain as the Creditors used to make; and so the delay of Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, gives Exchange and Re-exchange, as the Creditors condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, but would give neither, when not drawn for the use of a Merchant, or him that behoved to obtain the sum for a Merchant, for present use. In Ejections, Spuilzies, and other attrocious Delinquences, the greatest profits that might have been made, are allowed as the Creditors interest. In Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations which are not <hi>in dando,</hi> but <hi>in faciendo,</hi> the common opinion of the Doctors is, that there can be no pursuit for performance, but only for inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest; for before the delay there is no pursuite, and after, the Debitor cannot pursue for performance but for interest, <hi>l.</hi> 13. <hi>in fine ff. de re judicata;</hi> but it seems more suitable to equity, that it should be in the Debitors option, even after the delay, either to sute for performance or interest, as he pleaseth, if both be prestable.</p>
                     <p>In Obligations <hi>in dando,</hi> where there is delay incurred, it will not be purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by offering performance, especially, if the thing have a certain definite season of its use, as Grain of such a year, if it be not delivered, <hi>debito tempore,</hi> the delay will not be purged by offering it after, but the price comes in place of it.</p>
                     <p>In Interests, the value thereof may either be that which is agreed by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which, if high and penal, may be modified, or ordinarly the common rate, and sometimes <hi>pretium affectionis,</hi> in these cases where the Creditor hath <hi>juramentum in litem,</hi> the value was estimate by the <hi>Romans,</hi> in <hi>bonae fidei <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Profits which comprehends Fruits, is a part of the Creditors interest in sale, for by the special nature of that Contract all Accessions and Fruits belong to the buyer, from the time of the sale, and so it it a part of that Contract; but in other Contracts it is only due, <hi>post moram,</hi> and is no part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. The Sentence of the <hi>Roman</hi> Law is in this, as in the estimation for <hi>in actionibus bonae fidei,</hi> and Arbitrary, Fruits and Profits become due from delay, which also take place in Legacies; but in these which are <hi>fructi juris,</hi> if the Obligation be to deliver that which was the Creditors before, the Fruits and Profit follow the property, and are due from delay; but where the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                     <p n="101">101. The time of performing Obligations, is at, or before the Term, in Obligation to a day so soon as requisition is made, which cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in that instant, if the thing require more time to perform it; but such time is allowed, that by ordinar diligence it may be performed so, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay is not understood till that be past, as when a party is oblieged to do a work, he must have so much time as the work requires; or if Money be required, if the Debitor offer within twenty four hours, it would not infer delay, for it is not his part to carry a sum of Money about him, nor to have it ready each instant, and pasiing an instant, the strickest time Law respecteth, is an artificial day or twenty four hours, if the Debitor offer before the day the Creditor cannot refuse it, seing the day is in favour of the Debitor, and so may be renounced by him, if a Term be exprest there needs no requisition, <hi>nam dies interpellat pro homine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="102">102. The place for performing Obligations, if it be exprest, is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and another place cannot be obtruded, though it may seem as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the Creditor, unless there be not safe access to that place, in which case, the Debitor may offer, and the Creditor may pursue as if no place were named; in which case he hath the choise to pursue either in the place of the Contract, if he find the Debitor there, or where ever the Debitor is conveen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and even where the place is exprest, the Creditor may else where pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue for performance, if he allow the Debitors damnage, in not paying at the place appointed; but if the thing to be performed be delivery of a certain species or body, which cannot follow a man as a Horse or a Dog, but an inanimat body, as a Coatch, Coffer, Cabin, or the like, if no place be exprest, the place where it is must be understood, but if it be a quantity, simply the place of Contract, or where the Debitor resides, is understood, for the Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is not presumed to follow the Creditors Residence, if Custom or Paction be not contrair.</p>

or if the Obligation be, <hi>in non faciendo,</hi> that such a thing shall not be done, but that they shall hinder, each is oblieged <hi>in solidum, June</hi> 14. 1672. <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therland</hi> and <hi>Grant contra Flut.</hi> This also concerns the manner of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, that in alternatives, <hi>electio est debitoris,</hi> whose part is more favourable, but the adjection of a penalty or estimation makes not the Obligation alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native: But if any of the Members of the alternative, become not intire the Debitor connot offer that Member, <hi>January</hi> 18. 1675.

                     <p>Compensation is described by <hi>Modestinus debiti &amp; crediti contributie, l.</hi> 1 <hi>ff. de compensationibus;</hi> which description is neither clear nor full: It is not clear whether the Contribution be by concourse of two Debts, or by propon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Compensation: Neither is it full by expressing what kind of Debts are compensible, for they must be commensurable, and liquid, being consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Fungibles, indecernable in the value, or in the Individuals, as Money, Wine, Oyl, Grain, &amp;c. Or if both Obligations be in general, as if either party be oblieged to deliver a House, a Sword, &amp;c. for then no speciality being exprest, the Obligations are commensurat, and so compensible. But Obligations of a particular body, are not compensible by Money; and therefore, Money depositate being demanded, cannot be compensed by a Debt due to the Depositar, because the Money depositat was not deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Fungible to be restored in the same kind, but in the same individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and likewise, acceptance of Depositation imports so much trust, for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy delivery, that Compensation is understood to be renounced, <hi>l. pen. C. depositi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon the same ground Compensation is not relevant upon sums secured by an Heritable Infeftment, whereby Lands or Annualrents are Disponed for these sums; for though Impignoration be intended, yet the Contract being in the form of vendition with a reversion, the sum lent becomes the Debitors, as the price of the Land or Annualrent, and is no more the Creditors, unless there be a clause of Requisition, that he may return to his Money, or pass from his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment, or a clause to repay upon a simple Charge; and therefore, till the Requisition or Charge, there can be no compensation, except upon the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon Annualrents, due by the Infeftment, which remains still moveable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensible, <hi>January</hi> 2. 1667. <hi>Oliphant contra Hamiltoun.</hi> But Compensation was sustained upon liquid sums, though Appryzing was led thereupon, unless it were cled with Possession and expyred, <hi>June</hi> 18. 1675. <hi>Leys Burnet contra For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes</hi> of <hi>Blacktoun.</hi> The like was found as to a sum Appryzed for, but not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Wodsett, requiring Requisition, unless Requisition were made, <hi>November</hi> 12. 1675. <hi>Home</hi> of <hi>Plandergast contra Home</hi> of <hi>Linthil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But by a liquid Debt, is not understood a Debt, for which there is a decreet, or <hi>quae habet paratam executionem,</hi> for Restitution; but it is sufficient that the Debt it self is liquid of the same kind with the Charge; And therefore, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation is competent against sums due by Registrat Bonds, upon sums due by Bonds, though not Registrat, yea, though not Registrable.</p>
                     <p>Compensation is also competent upon Debts which are not liquid so soon as they become liquid, either by a liquidation of consent, or by a Decreet, which was sustained, though the Decreet was after the Charge, <hi>December</hi> 23. 1635. <hi>Keith contra Glenkindie.</hi> Yea, a Decreet of liquidation against a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, was found sufficient to infer Compensation against the Cautioner, or his

                     </p>
                     <p>Compensation is relevant, not only upon a Debt of the Creditors own, but if he be Creditor by Assignation, the Debt is compensible by a liquid Debt, due by the Cedent, before he was denuded by Assignation, and Intimation, because the Compensation was effectual, <hi>ipso jure,</hi> from the concourse of the two liquid Debts, <hi>inter easdem partes, February</hi> 14. 1633. <hi>Keith contra Heriot.

                     </p>
                     <p>Compensation is also relevant upon a Debt Assigned to the Compenser, by our common Consuetude, albeit the Debitor pursued or charged, do seek out and acquire a Debt of the Chargers, even after the Charge, which is a further Benefit introduced by Custom, though it hath this inconveniency, that a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor can hardly recover any Debt, if he be due Debt to others himself; but if an Assigney Charge for a Debt, the Debitor will not have Compensation upon a Debt of the Cedents, Assigned to him after the Intimation of the Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Assignation, for these two Debts never concurred, <hi>inter easdem partes,</hi> for though the Debitor may always compense the Assigney upon the Cedents Debt before the Assignation, if it was originally due to the Debitor himself, but after the Cedent is denuded by Intimation, the Debitor cannot acquire a Debt of the Cedents due to another, therewith to exclude the Assigney, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Debitor Compenser was Creditor to the Cedent, <hi>ab initio,</hi> or became Creditor to him by an Assignation to the Creditors Debt, Intimat to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was denuded in favours of an other Assigney, otherwise the Debts do never concur betwixt the same Debitor and Creditor, <hi>January</hi> 22. 1663. <hi>James Wallace contra Edger.

                     <p>Compensation is competent against Factors, Procurators, or Commissioners, upon their Constituents liquid debt, but not upon their own debt, for they are not Creditors as to their Constituents sums: Yea, a Factor being charged by his Constituent for his Intromission with his Rents, was not admitted to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense the same with a debt due by his Constituent, whereunto the Factor took Assignation.

                     </p>
                     <p>It remains to consider in what case Compensation may be elided, by Recompensation which but seldom occurs, and I have observed no decision upon it; it can only occur when the charger or pursuer hath more liquid debts due to him by the defender, and insists not for them all; for in that case, if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:109710:105"/>
propone Compensation, the pursuer may propone Recompensation, upon the other liquid debts, whereupon he pursued not; and if both the pursuers debts be anterior to the defenders, there appears no recompensation, because the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may impute his debt to either of the pursuers debt he pleaseth, as he might in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definit payments; but if the defenders debt be anterior to both the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suers debts, or in the middle betwixt them, in that case, Recompensation seems not to take place; because Compensation being competent, <hi>ipso jure,</hi> so soon as ever two liquid debts concur, <hi>inter easdem personas,</hi> both debts are thereby in so far mutually extinct, and so there is no place for Recompensation by a debt posterior to that concourse, so that if the defenders debt be anterior to both the pursuers debts, The first of them by its concourse, did extinguish the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders debt; and therefore, if he pursue for the first debt, Compensation is proper to the defender upon his debt, anterior to both the pursuers debts, and cannot be excluded by the pursuers posterior debt, by way of Recompensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for then the debts from their first concourse, should not compence <hi>ipso jure,</hi> which holds also when the defenders debt is after the pursuers first debt, and before his second, for the pursuers prior debt, and the defenders debt first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring extinguisheth each other, and the pursuers posterior debt cannot hinder the same, and so cannot found Recompensation: But if the pursuit or charge be on the second debt, if compensation be proponed on the defenders midle debt, there is place for recompensation on the pursuers first debt.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Retention is not an absolute extinction of the Obligation of repayment, or restitution, but rather a Suspension thereof, till satisfaction be made to the retainer; and therefore, it is rather a dilatory then a peremptory exception, though sometimes, when that which is due to the retainer, is equivalent to the value of what is demanded, if either become liquidat it may turn into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, such is the right of Mandatars, Impledgers and the like, who have interest to tetain the things possest by them, until the necessary and profitable expenses wared out by them thereupon be satisfied.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Innovation is the turning of one Obligation unto another, if it be a third person becoming debitor for relief of the former debitor, it is called Delegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Innovation is not presumed by granting of a new Obligation, either by the debitor or another; But it is rather held to be as Caution, or Corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former Obligation, consistent therewith; and in the Civil Law it is never esteemed Innovation, unless it be so exprest, <hi>l. ult. de novationibus:</hi> But with us, though it be not named, yet if it appear to have been the meaning of the parties, not to Corroborat, but to take away the former Obligation, it is a valid Innovation: So it is ordinarly inferred, when a posterior Security bears, <hi>in satisfaction of the former Obligation,</hi> though it did not renounce or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it, nor expresly innovate it, <hi>December</hi> 6. 1632. <hi>Chisholm contra Gordoun.</hi> The like where the posterior Bond bears, <hi>in full satisfaction of the sum, for which the former was granted,</hi> though it made no mention of the former security, <hi>July</hi> 23. 1633.

Confusion of Obligations is, when the Creditor and Debitor become one person, as when the one succeedeth as Heir to the other, or becomes singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Successor in the debt, for therby the Obligation is ineffectual, seing none can be Creditor or Debitor to himself, which was extended so far, that an Heir Portioner being Debitor, by meddling with the Defuncts means, and thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her Husband taking Assignation to a debt, and pursuing another, represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:109710:105"/>

                     <p>But where an appear and Heir gave a Bond, and thereupon Adjudication was used of his Predecessors Estate, his taking Assignation to that Adjudication, was not found to extinguish the debt by Confusion, though Rights so taken will not free the Assigney of behaving as Heir, if he intromet; whereupon there was an Act of Sederunt made, as to all cases thereafter, in the case of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors of the Earl of <hi>Nithisdale, January</hi> 22. 1662. But if by different Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions, the Debitor and Creditor should become distinct, the Obligations would revive, as in many cases may occur, and so Confusion is not an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute extinction, but rather a Suspension.</p>
                     <p>Confusion doth not always take place, where the same person who is debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor succeeds to, or takes Assignation, as is evident in Cautioners taking Assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Bonds, wherein they are debitors as Cautioners; yet may pursue the principal, or Co-cautioners as Assigney, and will not be excluded upon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeance of Confusion, which is only relevant when that debitor who hath no relief, becomes also Creditor by Succession or Assignation. And so an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor taking Assignation to an Heretable debt, may thereupon pursue the Heir for relief: Or any Heir male, of Tailzie or provision, taking Assignation to his Predecessors debt, may as Assigney, have recourse against the Heir of line, of Conquest, or Executor. Yea, if any person take Assignation to a debt due by his Predecessor to whom he is Heir male, though during his life the Assigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can have no effect; yet after his death, his Heir male will succeed to him in that Assignation, and may thereupon pursue his Heir of line, or Executor for payment, for the taking of an Assignation and not a Discharge, did clear the mind of the Defunct, that the debt and Credit would divide after his death, and that his Heir male would succeed to him <hi>in credito,</hi> and his Heir of line <hi>in debito.</hi>

                     <p>HAVING gone thorow the first two Branches of privat Rights, Personal Freedom, and obligation, we come now to the third, which is Dominion: But because that Term is more appropriat to men over men, then over other creatures, it is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a real Right, or a right of things: For as Obligation is a right personal, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a power of exacting from persons that which is due, so a right real is a power of disposal of things, in their Substance, Fruits, or use: For unfolding this right, and the progress thereof, both according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of time, and nature, advert;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>First,</hi> That when God created man, he gave him the Dominion or Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship over all the Creatures of the Earth, in the Air, and in the Sea, <hi>Genefis</hi> 1. <hi>Verses</hi> 29, and 30. with power to Man to dispose of the Creatures, even to the consumption thereof; and it is like, that during mans innocency, there was upon the part of the creatures, a great subjection and subserviency to man, till afterwards, when he revolted from God, the Creatures revolted also from him: Yet Gods Dominion over Man, and Mans Dominion over the Creatures,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:109710:107"/>
remaineth still in right; so that he hath a legal power and warrand to dispose of them, though not so much Possession, or natural power, being less able to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster them then before.</p>
                     <p>It is a false and groundless opinion which some hold, that Man by his fall hath lost his right to the Creatures, until by Grace he be restored, and that the sole Dominion of them belongs to the Saints, who may take them by force from all others. For by the whole strain of the Law of God, he still owneth Dominion and Property of the Creatures in Man, without distinction, and prohibiteth all force, or fraud in the contrary, which sufficiently cleareth that subtilty of mans forefaulture; which, though it maketh man obnoxious by way of Obligation to punishment, by Gods exterminating him from the use and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Creatures, yet that Obligation doth not infer actualceassing of mans right, much less the stating of the rights of mankind in a small part of them.</p>
                     <p>This Dominion of the Creatures being given to man without distinct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, or bounds; it necessarily followeth, that by the Law of Nature, the birth and fruit of both Sea and Land were common to all Mankind, who had equal interest therein, and every one might take and make use thereof, for his necessity, utility, and delight: yet so, as the use and fruit thereof must in some cases, and might in all cases become proper, as what any had taken and possest for his use, became thereby proper, and could not without injury be taken from him. much more the things which had received specification from his Art or Industry became proper, and all others might be debarred from any profit or use thereof, but so, that some property or use might be communicate to others, which being the lesser, and not reaching the power of the substance of the thing, is therefore called a servitude, whereby that which is proper to one serveth another, in part: And when the proprietar giveth not the fruit, or use, but only the holding, or the detention of the thing to another, for his secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of some debt, or Obligation of the Proprietars to him, that right is called a Pawn or Pledge, so that in whole, all real rights are either that original com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of all men, or the Interest which Possession giveth, or Property, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude or Pledge, of which in order.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Generally as they were of old, common to both things moveable, and immoveable, and then specially in relation to things immoveable, and to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retable Ground-rights of the Earth, and things fixed thereto, which now by the Feudal Customes are much changed from what they were, and yet are in moveables.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The distinction of moveable and Heretable, is very necessary to be here known, as being the common materials of real Rights, and having a general use; any thing is called moveable, which by its nature and use is capable of motion, as things immoveable are the Earth, Sea, and things fixed to the Earth, not to be removed therefrom, as Trees, Houses, &amp;c. which though they may be possibly moved, yet it is not their use so to be, the superfice of the Earth is immoveable, though it may be moved from one place to another place of the Earth: The Sea also is immoveable, though it hath at the Shoar its agitation by ebbing and flowing, which is not the use man maketh of it. These things are called Heretable, because they descend not to Executors, to whom only Moveables befall, but to Heirs: And so the distinction cometh ordinarly of Moveables and Heretables, as that which is fixed to, or part of the Ground is compted immoveable, as Trees, and Grass, and all he natural Fruits of the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:109710:107"/>
Earth; yet industrial Fruits, as Corns, are counted Moveable, and belong not to the Heirs of Defuncts, but to their Executors, when they are sown, or growing upon the ground at their death, as well as when they are reaped, and so fall under single Escheat, <hi>February</hi> 2. 1627. <hi>Lewis Somervel contra</hi> Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Stirling.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The distinction of Heretable and Moveable is derived to Rights and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the matter thereof is Heretable or Moveable, and so all Dispositions or Obligations for constituting any right of the ground, in property, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Servitude, are Heretable, although they have not yet attained their effect, and become real rights compleat, as dispositions of Lands, Annualrents, Pastu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, Thirleage, &amp;c. which is so far extended, that all which is by Destination, to have its accomplishments by a real right of the ground, is Heretable, as Bonds bearing clause of Annualrent, which because Annualrents were usually by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment; therefore, the very provision of Annualrent, though but a personal obliegement to pay it yearly or termly, without mention of Infeftment, made the provision or Bond Heretable, and not to descend to Executors, Children, or Wives, but to Heirs only; yea, though the Bond bore but five <hi>per cent,</hi> which was alledged but an alimentary clause, <hi>June</hi> 28. 1665. <hi>Jean Pitcairn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Isobel Edgar,</hi> till the Act of Parliament, 1641. revived, <hi>Parl.</hi> 1661. <hi>cap.</hi> 32. whereby such Bonds as were, or should be made after that Act, 1641. bearing only a clause of Annualrent, and no obliegement to Infeft the Creditor in an Annualrent, were declared to be Moveable as to the Defuncts Children, or near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of Kin, but not as to the Wife or Fisk, to fall undersingle Escheat, and that because many have their Estates and Stocks in Money, and take obliegement for Annualrents, for the profit thereof, without purpose to exclude their younger Children therefrom: But Wives are excluded, because they are ordinarly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by their Contracts of Marriage; but before this Act, all such Bonds were to all effects Heretable, yet so, assums destinat for Annualrent, though <hi>de facto,</hi> they bore none, are Heretable, <hi>quoad,</hi> the party who destinat, as when a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher is oblieged by a Wifes Father or Brother to be payed to her Husband, who is oblieged to imploy it upon Annualrent: This sum as to the Husband is Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and excludes his Executors: But as to the Debitor who was neither ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieged to pay Annualrent, or imploy it, it is moveable, and so would affect the Debitors Executors, and exhaust his moveables, but would only belong to the Creditors Heirs, <hi>January</hi> 19. 1637. <hi>Robison contra Seatoun.

                     <p>Bonds also become Heretable by distinct superveening Rights, as by a several Disposition of the Debitors, of his whole Goods and Lands, with obliegement to Infeft, and also by a superveening Appryzing.</p>
                     <p>But even the compleat Heretable Rights themselves, containing also perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Clauses of Requisition, become moveable by the Requisition or Charge, which is, <hi>pro tempore,</hi> a passing from the infeftment, and taking the Creditor to the personal obliegement, yet so, as when ever he pleaseth to pass from the Requisition or Charge, it convalesceth, and is not excluded by interveening
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:109710:108"/>
Rights, and was found moveable by a Charge, though but against one of the Cautioners, not only as to him, but as to all the Debitors, seing thereby the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor had taken his option, <hi>January</hi> 24. 1666. Collonel <hi>James Montgomery contra Stuart.</hi> But the shewing the Defuncts mind to require, is not sufficient to make the sum moveable, unless it be done <hi>habili modo:</hi> So a Requisition being disconform to the clause of a Requisition, was found not to make the sum moveable, <hi>January</hi> 18. 1665. <hi>Stuart contra Stuart.</hi> Yea, a Charge upon a Bond of Corroboration, accumulating the Principal and Annual in a former security by Infeftment, and bearing but Derogation of the former security, was found to make the whole sum moveable, and to belong to the Executor, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out necessity to instruct a warrand to give the Charge, which was presumed; albeit the Defunct upon death-bed exprest, that the sum belonged to his Heir, <hi>June</hi> 25. 1672. Executors and Heir of Sir <hi>Robert Seatoun.</hi> But sums were not found Heretable, because a Disposition of Land did bear, as the condition of the Reversion, that the Land should not be redeemed, or the Acquirer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuded, till he were satisfied of all sums due to him, or which should de due to him by the Disponer; neither yet when the sums are in the dispositive clause, to be contracted thereafter but only sums which are the anterior causes of the Disposition, for thereby the Creditor doth not make such sums <hi>jura fixa;</hi> nor are they the causes of the Disposition, <hi>February</hi> 18. 1676. <hi>Thomas Wauch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi> Doctor <hi>Jamison.</hi> Sums are also Heretable, when Executors are expresly excluded; and a Charge or Decreet for such sums, will not make them move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, <hi>July</hi> 13. 1676. <hi>Christy contra Christy:</hi> The reason is, because the mind of the Creditor, by calling for his Money, is not to retain it in his hands as moveables, but to make it a fixed right for his Heir, seing he excludes his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors. And for the like reason, Wives charging for their Heritable sums, the Stocks whereof is not in their Husbands power, are not presumed thereby to make them moveable, and to fall in the power of their Husbands: And if any party in his Process or Charge, should so declare his intent, it would not make the sum moveable. But Requisition or a Charge will make sums which were Heretable by Infeftment or Destination, moveable. And so likewise will a Decreet for payment, <hi>Decem.</hi> 13. 1676. Mr. <hi>John Fairholm contra</hi> Mr. <hi>Francis Montgomery.</hi> Sums consigned by an order of Redemption, do not thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come moveable till declarator of Redemption, or till the Creditor accept of the Confignation, and insist for the consigned sums, which if he do not, his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor cannot recover the same, but his Heir, to whom the Wodsett right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs. For it is not in the power of the debitor to alter the condition of his Creditors sum, and to make it either Heretable or Moveable, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Creditor, or authority of a Judge; but the Consignet may take up his sum Consigned, and pass from his order, <hi>January</hi> 21. 1673. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Nicol contra Lowrie.

                     <p>The Requisition and Charge may not only be past from expresly, but tacitly, by taking Annualrent after the Charge, if it be for Terms thereafter, as in the last case, <hi>Spots.</hi> Assignation, <hi>Denaldson contra Donaldson.</hi> Requisition or a charge, makes Bonds Heretable, even after the Act, 1641. <hi>moveable as to the relict.</hi> The like is when they become otherways simply moveable.</p>

                        </gap>, where the distinction is betwixt Moveables, Liferent Rights, and Heretable Rights; The first being carried by single Escheat; the next by Liferent Escheat, the whole by forefaulture. All Rights relating to Infeftment by Destination, are Heretable, or moveable in the same manner as betwixt Heirs and Executors: But Rights having a tract of time, but not for a Liferent, are Moveable, and fall under single Escheat; yet the bygones of Annualrent by Infeftment, are still moveable: But as to both effects, Assignations to Literent Tacks, were found moveable, and to fall under single escheat, <hi>Hope,</hi> Horning, Sir <hi>Robert Ker contra</hi> Sir <hi>John Ker.</hi> Clauses also of relief in Heretable Bondsare move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and the <hi>jus Marti</hi> of Husbands, though they carry the profit of the Wises Heretable Rights, or Rights of Liferent, fall under the Husbands single escheat.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To return now to the several kinds of real Rights; The <hi>First</hi> whereof, is, that original Community which all men had at first, in the whole Creatures of this inferior World.</p>
                     <p>For as to that Community which is competent to a Nation, Incorporation. Society, or more single Persons, it is property indeed to these in respect of other Men, though amongst themselves it keepeth a proportion with the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Community; <hi>First,</hi> In that there is an equal right and interest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to be in all these that have Community, unless the contrair appear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this Equality is not exact in the use, but that which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in common, may freely be made use of for the ends of the Community, though some make use of more, and others of less, according to their need or satisfaction: As when two persons have an universal society of all their means, if the one be taler then the other, he is not to go naked, in so far as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds his fellow: Or if his appetit be greater, he is not to pinch it: and if he have more Children, he may entertain and provide them, and thereby consume more of the common Stock then the other; so that in these univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Societies, there is not an Arithmetical equality, but a Geometrical propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the need and use of the parties, to be observed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Such Communities may be past from, and division being made of that which is common, thereby it will become proper to either party, unless the nature of the thing, or paction hinder; in which case, division cannot be made without consent of the whole; for (as is showen before) under the <hi>Obediential Obligations of Restitution,</hi> to every man that which is his own, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of that which is common, is comprehended.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Even during the Community, that which any party taketh for his use is proper, and may not be taken from him by any other, if he exceed not the ends, or the interest of the Society, by seeking more then is proportional to his need and use, with the rest in the Society: All these agree to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Community of Mankind, and so they did continue in the first and gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Age of the World, when Gold was not known, nor regarded, but simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:109710:109"/>
and sincerity were the Gold of that Age, whereby every man contented himself with the natural Fruits and Birth of the Earth, Sea, and Rivers: And it is like, that the Fruits of the Ground and Trees, were satisfying to man at first, before they came to hunting, and killing of Beasts, fishing in the Seas, and Rivers, and Haulking and killing of Fowls.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Then also, men were contented with Caves of the Earth, or shades of Trees for Houses, and skins of Beasts for Cloathing; in this Community do many of the Savage Nations of <hi>America</hi> continue to this day, in these vast and unpeopled places of the World: But for the most part, man being multiplied upon the face of the Earth, there was necessity of division, and appropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which hath so far prevailed, that now there remains nothing common, which by its nature and mans necessity, can be appropriat, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by some things in whole, and some uses of others remain yet common to all men; as,</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>First,</hi> The Air is common to all men, because it can have no limits or bounds, and because all men every where must necessarily breath it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Running Waters are common to all men, because they can have no bounds; but Water standing, and capable of bounds, is proper.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The vast Ocean is common to all mankind, as to Navigation and Fishing, which are the only uses thereof, because it is not capable of bounds; but where the Sea is inclosed, in Bays, Creeks, or otherways is capable of any bounds or meeths, as within the points of such Lands, or within the view of such Shoars, there it may become proper, but with the reservation of passage for Commerce as in the Land.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> All the wild and free creatures, which are in the property of none, are in some sort common to all, as Fishes, Fowls, Bees, &amp;c. But in respect property hath taken hold of all that is appropriable, these are said rather to belong to none, as being by common consent declared void by all, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty thereof may be inferred by occupation, and possession, without respect to the persons necessity or use, as was in the ancient Community, but that sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply whosoever possesseth that which belongeth to none, doth thereby acquire the property thereof.</p>
                     <p>Such also are Gemms and precious Stones on the Shoar, or things relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished by the proper owners, except where there is a National Community, that people or their authority, do possess in common, not only some reserved rights of the Earth, but also the rights of precious things, or things relinquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or lost by Shipwrack, or otherways, whereby the imaginary possession of having such within their Territories, is sufficient by the custome of Nations to appropriat them, and to exclude other Nations, or single persons of that same Nation from them. So with us, Treasures hid in the Earth, whose proper owners cannot be known, are not his in whose Ground they are found, nor the finders, but belong to the King: And things stray or waith, whose owners cannot appear, are publick, And ship-wrack, which is only understood, when all living things in the Ship have perished; but where an Ox escaped out of the Ship to Land alive, the Goods were not found escheatable as Shipwrack, <hi>November</hi> 22. 1622. <hi>Hamiltoun contra Cochran.</hi> But shipwrack is not to be made use of by the King, in prejudice of the owners of such Countreys, as use

                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Of things appropriat, there remains still the common use of Ways and Passages, which is like a servitude on property, for this is necessarly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for the use of man; and therefore, understood as an use reserved, both in their tacit consent to appropriation, and in their custom. So all Nations have free passage by Navigation, through the Ocean, Bays and Navigable Rivers; and have also the benefite of Stations in the Sea or Rivers, and have the common use of the Shoars, for casting Anchors, disloading of Goods, taking in of Ballast, or Water rising in Fountains there, drying of Nets, erecting of Tents, and the like. Yet doth the Shoar remain proper, not only as to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, but as to Houses, or Works built thereupon; and as to Minerals, Coals or the like found there, and so is not in whole common, but some uses thereof only.</p>
                     <p>Nor doth it follow, that these uses are not common to all men, because they are denyed to enemies; for, as for these, we may take away that which is in their power, in some cases; so, much more may we detain from them that which is ours, and as we pursue their Persons and Goods in their own, much more in our bounds.</p>
                     <p>The Shoar in the civil Law is defined to be so far as the greatest Winter Tides do run, <hi>Inst. de rerum divisione.</hi> §. 11. which must be understood of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Tides, and not of extraordinary spring Tides. But the use of the Banks, of the Sea, or Rivers to cast Anchors, or lay Goods thereon, or to tye Cables to Trees growing thereon; or the use of Ports, which are industrial, or Stations made by Art, or fortified for security, are not common to all men, but publick to their own people, or allowed to others freely for commerce, or in some cases are granted for a reasonable satisfaction of Anchorage, Portage, or other Shoar dues, which oftimes belong to private persons, by their proper right or custom, or by publick grant.</p>
                     <p>So also, Ways or Passages in the Land are common to all, and may not be justly refused by one Nation to another; and being refused, have always been accompted lawful to be forced, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates of <hi>Simon,</hi> who going to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> forced his passage through <hi>Corinth.</hi> And <hi>Agesilaus</hi> returning from <hi>Asia,</hi> craved passage through <hi>Macedon,</hi> and while they craved time to consult of an answer, he conceiving delay to be a denyal, said, <hi>consult you, but I will pass;</hi> but to take away all questions, whether these were by might or right, we have a divine Example of <hi>Moses, Numbers</hi> 20. <hi>Verses</hi> 17, and 19. where <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> in their way to <hi>Canaan,</hi> craved passage of <hi>Edom,</hi> by the high ways, and offered payment even for their Water, which was to be understood of their standing Water, as Wells, which were rare and precious there; and did the like with the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and upon refusal, forced it by War.</p>
                     <p>There is also in Property implyed an Obligation of Commerce, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, in case of necessity; for without this, property could not consist, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the division inferred there through, every man cannot have actually all necessars without Exchange, which being denyed in cases of necessity, or where there is no common Authority, may be taken by force, as these who pass through the Territories of others, if by their opposition, or otherways they be short of provision, they may lawfully take the same for Money, as is implyed in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
                        <pb n="196" facs="tcp:109710:110"/>
offer to <hi>Edom,</hi> yea, there is implyed in property, an Obligation to give in cases of necessity, to these who have not wherewith to exchange, and cannot otherways preserve their life, but with the Obligation of Recompence when they are able, for humane necessity doth also infer this, but it must be a real, and not a pretended and feigned necessity. So <hi>David</hi> being hungry, eat the Shew-bread, though appropriat to God. And the Disciples being hungry, eat the Ears of Corn; and this is the ground of the Obligation, to aliment the poor, which though it also floweth from the Obligation of Charity; yet (as hath been spoken before) that Obligation hath no determinat bounds, but is left to the discretion of the giver, not of the demander, and so can be no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand for taking by force, and without consent.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Community that is of Grass and Fruits growing upon the high-ways, followeth the Community of the ways themselves: But the common use of natural Fruits brought forth without industry, even in proper Fields, as of Nutts, Berries or the like; Or the promiscuous use of Pasturage in the Winter time, accustomed in many places of <hi>Scotland,</hi> are no part of this Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but are for the most part permitted as of little moment, or disadvantage; and therefore, may be denyed without injury.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The second step of real Rights is Possession, which as it is the way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> cases doth fully accomplish it, so it hath in it a distinct les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Right then property, which hath no other name then Possession, though it be more <hi>facti</hi> then <hi>juris:</hi> And seing Possession is a common precognit to the most of real Rights, it fitly falleth in here to be considered, both as it is a Fact, and as it is a Right; for as it is a Fact, it is not only requisite to consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute real Rights, but is also an effect thereof, when constitute.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Possession hath its name from its special kind, for it is as much as <hi>positio se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> expressing the way of Possession of the Earth, (at first common) by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, Nations, or Persons, by fixing or settling their Seats or Habitations there, evidencing their affection and purpose to appropriat these Seats, which therefore was not understood by their passing through it, but by fixing in it; and therefore, Territories of old were called Possessions. That we may take up aright the nature of Possession, wherein it doth consist, and how it is begun, continued, interrupted, and lost, we must first distinguish the several kinds of Possession: And secondly, collect the common nature wherein they agree: And thirdly, the point of Right thence arising.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>First,</hi> The reason why the kinds and distinction of Possession are so much multiplied, is because by positive Law, and the custom of Nations, Property and Servitude cannot be constitute but by Possession, though it be not natural or necessary to these Rights, but by the will and constitution of men; therefore it receives diversification at their pleasure.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. So what men think fit to call or esteem Possession, is enough to consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Property, seing without any thing such, it may be constitute, as afterward appears. Hence ariseth the distinction of Possession, in Natural, and Civil; the former being that which is, and the latter that which is holden or repute such, under which there are degrees, as it cometh nearer to the natural Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; we shall proceed in order from the more plenary and plain Possession, to these which are less clear.</p>
                     <p n="11">
                        <pb n="197" facs="tcp:109710:110"/>11. <hi>First</hi> then, the clearest Possession is of Moveables, and it is the first pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session that was amongst men, for so did the Fruits of things become proper; and thereafter, Ornaments, Cloathes, Instruments, and Cattel become proper, the possession whereof is simple and plain, holding and detaining them for our proper use, and debarring others from them, either by detaining them in our hands, or upon our bodies, or keeping them under our view or power, and making use of them, or having them in fast places, to which others had no easie access. This possession of Moveables was so begun and continued, and by contrary Acts interrupted and lost, when others exercised the same Acts, either without the possessors consent, or by their tollerance, or tradition and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or by forsaking or relinquishing them, so that in the matter of posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Moveables, there is little controversie.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Possession of the Ground is also clear in many cases; As <hi>First,</hi> In Habitations, whether in Caves, Tents, or proper Houses. Next in Gardens, Inclosures and all Plantations. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In Fields by Pasturage or Tillage, in so far as the Acts extend, so far these all are most natural posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: But after that most ancient simplicity, Rights and the ways of acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof were multiplied; and therefore, possession could not be intire, but behoved to be divided amongst the several interests, then did the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties arise, as when one had the property, a second the fruits, a third the use, a fourth the servitudes in some, part a fifth the detention for security, a sixth, the custody or location, and all these exercised, either by the parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, their servants or Children in their power, and their Procurators in their name: Yea, and by opposite and interrupting Acts, many at once pretending to the same kinds and parts of possession.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. So then the third kind of Possession was, when the Earth began to be divided by limits and bounds, and to have common denominations, then the possession of the whole was attained by exercising possessory Acts upon a part, as he who possesseth a Field, needs not go about it, or touch every Turff of it, by himself or his Cattel, but by possessing a part, unless there were contrary possessory Acts. So possession of the greater part of Lands, contained in one Tenement, was found sufficient to validat a base Infeftment, as to the whole, and to exclude a posterior publick Infeftment, for removing the Tennents from a part of the Tenement, though the base Infeftment had possession several years, and had attained or pursued for no possession of these Tenements, <hi>Spots.</hi> removing, <hi>Hunter contra Hardie,</hi> observed by <hi>Dury, January</hi> 14. 1630. The like of possession of a Tack, of a part of Teinds in a Tack, found suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to validat the Tack as to the whole, <hi>Spots.</hi> 1. <hi>possessione,</hi> Lady <hi>Merchistoun contra Wrights-houses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. Possession Civil is extended to uplifting of Mails and Duties, which is sufficient to introduce and preserve property, though the pasturage and tillage, and all other natural deeds of possession be in others, who are properly called possessors, who hold and possess for themselves, in so far as concern the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cresce of the profits, above the rent, as to which they possess in name of their Masters; and therefore, this possession is partly naturral to the Master of the Ground, and partly civil by their Tennants.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Possession is attained Symbolically, where there is not use of the whole or a part, but only of a Symbol or Token, and this is when the thing to be possest, is present, as the civil possession by Infeftment, by delivery
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:109710:111"/>
of Earth and Stone upon the Ground of the Lands, or by delivery of a parcel of Corns for a Stack or Field of Corn, or some of a herd or Flock for the whole Flock being present, in which the Symbols being also parts of the thing to be possest, have some affinity to natural possessions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Civil Possession is by a Token or Symbole, which is no part of the thing to be possest, but is a Token to represent it, as either having some resemblance with it, as the delivery of a Copy or Scroll for an office, or a penny for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nualrent, or otherways hath no resemblance, but is a Token meerly suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to represent it, as delivery of a Batton in Resignation; or Delivery of a thing bought or sold, by a wisp of Straw, which ordinarly is in absence of the thing to be possessed.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Possession is attained or retained without Symbol, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Interposition of any person in our power or procurator, but only by conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Interest: So when the property of Lands is granted to one, and the Usufruct or Liferent to another, or when the Liferent is reserved, the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion of the Liferenter is held to be the possession of the Fiar, as to all other third parties, and Rights. And a Husbands possession of Lands by himself, or any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving right from him, is held to be the Wifes possession, by her Liferent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment.</p>
                     <p>The several kinds and degrees of possession being thus laid open, it will be more easie to takeup the common notion and nature of it, and it may be thus described.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Possession is the holding or detaining of any thing by our selves, or others for our use, it is not every holding or detaining which makes posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; for so Depositars detain, but because it is not for their use, they do not possess. To Possession there must be an act of the body, which is detention and holding; and an act of the mind, which is the inclination or affection to make use of the thing detained, which being of the mind, is not so easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable, as that of the body, but it is presumed whensoever the profite of the detainer may be to make use of the thing, but where it may be wrong, or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, it is not presumed: As he who taketh another mans Horse by the Head, or keepeth that which is waith; or taketh in his hands the Money or Goods of another, which if it were to make use of, it would infer theft; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, such detention is not presumed to be possession. He also who detaineth or holdeth a thing, not at all for his own use, but for anothers, who doth detain by him, as by his Servant, or Procurator, doth not possess: But otherways, if he have no warrand from another, but only intended, or is oblieged that it shall be to the behove of another, in that case he is possessor, because the real Right is in him, and there is upon him only an obligation to make it forthcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to another: And they who possess partly for themselves, and partly for others, as Tennants have possession in part.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. To come now to the Requisites for entering and beginning Possession, there must be both the detention of the body, and the detention of the mind, for use, for neither of the two alone can begin possession; corporal possession alone can neither begin it, nor continue it; and if any act of the mind were enough, possession would be very large, and but imaginary, but the manner of this seasure of possession, to begin it is very diverse, by all the several ways which are before set forth.</p>
                     <p n="19">
                        <pb n="199" facs="tcp:109710:111"/>19. Possession being once begun, is continued, not only by reiteration of possessory acts, but even by the mind only, though there be no outward acts exerced, and the mind and affection to continue possession is always presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unless the contrary appear, so that if the thing once possessed be void, as to outward acts, yet it is held possest by the mind; and any contrary act of others, entering to that possession, is unwarrantable, and intrusion. For as hath been before showen, intrusion is where the entry is made in possession without violenc, but without warrand or consent, as ejection is by violence. But these contrary acts, though unwarrantable, yet they take away the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session that is detained by the mind.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. Possession then is lost by a contrary Possession, and it is interrupted by contrary acts, and attempts of possession, which if they do not attain the effect to expulse it, it is called also a troubled or disquieted possession, for nothing can be possessed <hi>in solidum,</hi> by more then one, either simply, or in relation to the same right, as there cannot be more Proprietars then one, of the same kind, though one be superior, and another Vassal, so more Liferenters cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess <hi>in solidum;</hi> and therefore, the entry to possess that which is already pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, must expulse the prior, or else introduce a partial and common pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session; yet it is not the contrary attempts, or every act that expelleth a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or possession; but if the same be violent, the prior possessor hath the benefit of possessory Judgements, and may lawfully use violence to continue possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which afterwards he may not, for recovery thereof, when it is lost, though unwarrantably, or violently: Thus Possession is transferred from one to another: But Possession is simply lost, when it is forsaken and relinquished; it is not easie to be known when Possession is detained by the mind, and when relinquished, wherein there is a general Rule, that dereliction is not presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, except it appear by evident declaratory Acts or Circumstances, as when it is thrown away in any publick place, where it cannot but be taken up, or when another is suffered to possess without contradiction, or when posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory Acts have been long abstained from; all which conjectures, are <hi>in arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trio judicis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="21">21. From what hath been said, the ordinary distinctions of Possession may be easily understood, as being either natural or civil, continued quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or interrupted and disturbed, lawful or unlawful. Under which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, are comprehended, <hi>possessio bonae fidei,</hi> which may be called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Possession; and <hi>malae fidei,</hi> or fraudulent, and Possession publick and clandestine, and long possession, momentany or precarious.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. To come to the Right implyed in Possession, it is mainly in two points; <hi>First,</hi> in the right to continue it against all illegal contrary acts. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The right of Appropriation of the Fruits consumed, <hi>bona fide,</hi> both these are introduced by positive Law, for utilities sake: For, by equity any man might at any time recover the possession of that which is his own by force, and all the Fruits thereof, whether extant or consumed: But civil Society and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy being erected, it is the main foundation of the peace, and preservation thereof, that possession may not be recovered by violence, but by order of Law; and therefore, there is no more allowed to private force, then to continue possession, against contrary, violent and clandestine Acts, immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after acting of the former, or notice of the latter: But a violent clandestine and unlawful possession, may not be troubled, though there be an evident right; much less may Possession be entered, where there is a Right in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:109710:112"/>
himself, or his predecessor, to whom he is Heir in that thing; for as they are accounted as one person in Law, so their Possession is accounted as one Possession. Like unto this, is the Right of appearand Heirs, to possess their predecessors Rents, though they be not Infeft, which will not only exoner the possessors, but if the appearand Heir die uninfeft, his nearest of kin will have right to the Rents resting, from his predecessors death to his own death, and these will be subject to hi own proper Debts, albeit they will not affect the Land it self, but the next appearand Heir must enter to the Defunct last Infeft, and his Person and Estate will only be lyable for the Debts of the Defunct to whom he entered.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. The other Possessory Right is, that which was allowed in the Civil Law, <hi>bonae fidei possessor facit fructus consumptos suos, l. certum</hi> 22. <hi>Cod. de rei vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione;</hi> the reason whereof, is because they who enjoy that which they think their own, do consume the Fruits thereof, without expectation of repetition or account, else they are presumed to reserve them, or imploy them profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably for Restitution, and if it were otherways, there could be no quiet nor security to mens minds, who could call nothing securely their own, if the event of a dubious Right might make them restore what they had consumed, <hi>bona fide,</hi> and as it is in the favours of the innocent possessor; so it is in hatred of the negligence of the other party not pursuing his Right.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. This Right is only competent to possessors, <hi>bonae fidei,</hi> who do truely think that which they possess to be their own, and know not the right of any other; but private knowledge upon information, without legal diligence, or other solemnity allowed in Law, at least the private knowledge be certain, is not regarded, nor doth constitute the knower, <hi>in mala fide, March</hi> 14. 1626. <hi>Nisbit contra Williamson.</hi> But a Mother was not found to enjoy this benefit in prejudice of her Children, there being several presumptions of her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their right, <hi>November</hi> 20. 1662.

In some cases a Citation and Production of any other evidently preferable Right is sufficient, when the possessor hath no probable Title; but where he hath a doubtful Title, <hi>mala fides,</hi> is only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Litiscontestation, or Sentence, as in Reductions, whether the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender is lyable for the bygone profites, from Citation, Litiscontestation, or Decreet is in the arbitriment of the Judge, <hi>July</hi> 11. 1627. <hi>Pitmedden</hi> and the Lord <hi>Elphingstoun contra Smith.</hi> The like in a Tack reduced upon a failzie, <hi>Hope,</hi> Reduction, <hi>Seatoun contra Seatoun.</hi> The like, <hi>June</hi> 2. 1610.

                     <p>But no unlawful Possession is valid in this case, if it be vitious, violent, clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destine, or momentany. But it is not so evident when a possession is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed momentany; sure little time will suffice in Moveables, but in Lands more time is required; a year or term, or less time may suffice.</p>
                     <p>This Right is different from the possessory Judgement competent upon Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which require longer time; and because it is an effect of Infeftments, Tacks or the like, we shall speak thereof in that place. If the Possession <hi>bona fide,</hi> be by vertue of a colourable Title, though perhaps null in it self upon informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in the Law requisite, or upon Inhibition, interdiction, or want of power in the granter, it is effectual. Yet when by a common or known Law, the Title is void materially; in this case the possessor is not esteemed to possess, <hi>bona fide,</hi> it being so evident, <hi>ignorantia juris non excusat:</hi> As if a Relict should possess Lands or others, the Marriage being dissolved by her Husbands death within year and day, <hi>November</hi> 16. 1633. <hi>Grant contra Grant.</hi> Hereby

it is evident, that possession hath much in it dictinct and several from Fact, and therefore it stands in place of a Title in Ejections and Spuilzies.</p>

By the Canon Law allowed by our Custom, <hi>possessor decennalis &amp; trienna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis non tenetur docere de titulo etiam in causa salsi,</hi> whereupon Prebendars were assoilzied from production in an improbation of their provisions, <hi>Hope, Improb.</hi> Bishop of <hi>Galloway contra</hi> the Prebendars of the <hi>Chappel-royal.</hi> But this holds not in Reductions, where the Title is supposed, but craved to be reduced upon a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Right, as when the debate is, who hath the right of Patronage, Earl of <hi>Wigtoun contra Drummellier, July</hi> 24. 1622. Earl of <hi>Wigtoun contra</hi> Bishop of <hi>Glasgow;</hi> for in these cases an Ecclesiastical persons Title was to be reduced, <hi>in consequentiam</hi> with the Patrons Title, which hath not this priviledge. But this possession must be as being holden and repute a part of a Benefice, and must be proven by Witnesses; and therefore, the possession of Lands by tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerance, was found probable by Witnesses, to elide thirteen years possession thereof by a Minister, who pretended to it as a part of his Glibe Ministers of <hi>contra</hi> Duke of <hi>Bucleugh.</hi> And if the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Title can be found, their possession will be ascribed thereto, and regulate thereby. And therefore the Bishop of <hi>Dumblain,</hi> as Dean of the <hi>Chapel-Royal,</hi> having long possest ten Chalders of Victual, as a part of his Benefice, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found a Mortification of that Victual by the King, bearing the King to have had right by Disposition from another, and that others right being produced, did bear, <hi>Reversion in the body thereof for seven thousand Merks,</hi> which being payed to the King when the Bishops were supprest, and his grant of Redemption there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon voluntarly, without an Order or Sentence: The Church-mens possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more then thirteen years before the Redemption, and thirteen years after the Redemption, was elided by the reverse Right and Redemption: Neither did the Act of Sederunt, after the Reformation, declaring ten years possession of Kirk Lands before the Reformation, and thirty years after, to import a right sustain this Church-mans possession: That Act being only for Fews, granted by Church-men, not for rights granted to Church-men, <hi>July</hi> 7. 1676. Bishop of <hi>Dumblain contra Francis Kinloch.</hi> And it was found, that thirteen years possession of Viccarage by a Minister, did not prefer him to a Tacksman, where the Ministers Title was a Decreet of Locality produced, and not containing the Teinds in question, <hi>February</hi> 24. 1681 Doctor <hi>Lesly contra</hi> the Minister of <hi>Glenmuck.</hi> This right in favours of Church-men, is by a rule of Chancelary of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath been continued after Reformation, as being convenient, that less time and Title should give right to the Church Benefices, whose Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications may be easilier lost, or supprest, then other Rights. There is also another rule in the Chancelary, that <hi>triennalis pacificus possessor beneficii est inde se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus;</hi> this rule gives not right to the Church, but prefers one Church-man to another, if he continue to possess three years, without interruption, though he could not defend by his Right.</p>
                     <p>There is a third Benefite by Possession of Benefices and Stipends, by seven years peaceable possession, whereby they have the benefit of a possessory Judgement, and cannot be called in question but by Reduction, or Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; and therefore, a Ministers possession of his Stipend for seven years, was continued, though it partly affected the Stock, and no Title produced but a Horning upon a Decreet of Locality, which was lost and never Booked, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 6. 1672, Mr. <hi>John Veitch contra</hi> Laird of <hi>Wedderly.</hi> And a Minister ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving possessed his Stipend seven years after the restitution of Bishops, was preferred to a Dean, who had a Right before the year 1637. and that all

                     <p n="28">28. The Main real Right is Property, standing in the middle betwixt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity and Possession, which precide it, and Servitude and Pledge which follow it.</p>
                     <p>The nature of Property is best understood, when it is compared with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; for in this they both agree, that either hath a power to dispose of things, and in this differ, that Community is a promiscuous, and a conjunct power; but property is a disjunct and separat power of disposal, which, if it be with diminution of any part of the Fruits or use, it is a diminished proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that diminution is called a Servitude, or Pledge; but though the Proprietar, and these who have Servitudes, have both the power of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:109710:114"/>
of the same thing, yet in this they differ from Community, that it is not promiscuous, but a distinct power, relating to distinct Effects and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests.</p>
                     <p>The way to distinguish betwixt Property and Servitude is, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est interest retaineth the name of Property, which hath in it a power of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal of the Substance of the thing, or alienation thereof; whereas, Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is the lesser Right, and reacheth but the Fruits or use in part, or for a time; it will be here proper to inquire the manner of Constitution of Property, where it was not; for the transmission of Property (being consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute) from one to another, comes in afterwards amongst Conveyances, or Transmissions of Rights.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. The <hi>first</hi> and most simple way of constitution of Property, is by Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of things common to all men, in so far as the Possessors use requireth; for as before is showen the original Community of the Creatures, did necessarly carry this with it, that every one might possess that which was possest by no other, in so far as his use required, and might not be lawfully dispossessed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of without his own consent, which made it to become proper to him, and that he might defend violence against his posession of it. This Property be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan first in Moveables, Cloathes, and Ornaments of the Body, Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for making use of the Creatures, as Darts, which are the most anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Instruments of force, while man was satisfied with the natural Fruits of the Earth, and such other Creatures as for his use and delectation, he seized on for the time.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Appropriation was by mans Industry and Possession, by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing and taming of the Creatures, and his Affection to make use of them, not for a time, but constantly, for thereby not only his common Right and Possession, but his industry and labour did properly Entitle him to these things he possest: Thus when man made use of the other Creatures, not by his own strenth alone, nor by Darts, Stones or the like, but made use of one Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to master others, as Hounds, Halks, &amp;c. these Instruments of pleasure ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by him, became unquestionably proper to him; then man proceeded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to subdue and make proper Cattel, as Cows, Oxen, Sheep, Horse, Mules, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, &amp;c. by constant use making of their work and fruits.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Property having extended it self to the ground, appropriated Seats for Habitation, and Fields for Pasturage, and Tillage, and that for a constant abode; whereas at first, though mans use-making of the Earth did introduce some kind of Property in it for the time, yet was it without a purpose or evidence of a constant or perpetual appropriation, but men moved with their Cattel, from place to place, without fixation in any one place.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. This fixation of the Ground began first in Houses, and Wells, which in the places of the World first Inhabited by man, were rare, and of great necessity and use, and therefore, Digged with Industry, and preserved with Earnestness.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When man increased upon the Earth, and Societies became to be Erected, they possessed whole Countreys, and divided them amongst them, by Meiths and Marches, and when any one of them swelled to that
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:109710:114"/>
greatness, that their Territories could not contain them, either the whole, or the Excreass of them removed to places of the Earth not then inhabited, and fixed Seats for themselves, though the unjust ambition of some of them, made them expell others: Yet that, as contrary to the Law of Nature, was also ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred, and gave occasion to the rest, from that same Law to concur with, and maintain the oppressed. So that almost the whole Face of the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came changed from its Original Community, and there was a tacite consent of Division, and Property established throughout the World, except some Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Nations, and nothing was left common that could be proper, but the few ways of Community (of which before) do only remain. In which Division and Appropriation, this also is implyed, by the common consent of Nations, that what is possessed or appropriated by none, or relinquished, is not now common to all, but held as belonging to none, that by posessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it might be appropriat.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. And therefore, <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Property is introduced, by Possession of things which are simply void and belong to none, and that without limitation. This is by the Law of Nations, and their common consent, whence is that principle, <hi>Quod nullius est fit occupantis.</hi> And this way of Appropriation, differeth from the first way, whereby things common or their Fruits, become proper by sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and possession; for, that being an effect of the Native Community, was with this limitation imployed in the Nature of Community, that one might sease upon no more then their use required, without hurt to the rest, who enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that same Community, as in a Theatre, which is common to a City, every Citizen as he cometh, may possess a place for himself, by standing, or sitting there, but he may notly along, if thereby others of the Society might be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, to be present and behold. So if Property now were but the effect of that Original Community, when the Earth is so straitned with the increase of man, it would be the ground of perpetual Contention and War, that the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions of some were unequal and exceeded, and others had not enough; therefore, for preservation of the common Peace of mankind, the custom and consent of Nations, hath allowed Property of things void by Occupation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further debate. All these ways of Appropriation are by Possession or Occupation, and thus are all free Creatures Appropriat, as Fowls of the Air, wild Beasts of the Earth, Fish of the Sea, without distinction, upon whose ground they be taken; and though men may be hindered to come within the ground of others, there being now no ground for passage only upon account of Hunting, Halking, or Fishing: Yea, though in some Nations, the use of some of these free Creatures be prohibite to any but to the Soveraign power, yet the personal restraint hindereth not, but he who seaseth upon any wild Creature in another mans bounds, it becometh his own, though he be punishable for that trespass; and Positive Law may make a part of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be the loss of what he hath taken. So likewise, it is the first seasure that introduceth Property, and not the first attempt, and prosecution; as he who pursueth or woundeth a wild Beast, a Fowl, or Fish, is not thereby Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietar, unless he had brought it within his power, as if he had killed it, or wounded it to death; or otherways, given the effectual Cause whereby it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not use its native freedom as at the Whale Fishing at <hi>Greenland,</hi> he that woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a Whale, so that she cannot keep the Sea for the smart of her Wound, and so must needs come to Land, is Proprietar, and not he that lays first hand on her at Land, though the falling in upon anothers Game, when he alone is in prosecution, may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> civility, or injury, yet it hindereth not the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Property, though it be a just ground to annull the Right of the first
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:109710:115"/>
Possessor, and make him restore to the first prosecuter, if he continue his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit, with a probability to reach his prey. And therefore, in the last <hi>Dutch</hi> War, a Frigot of the Kings, called, <hi>the Nightingall,</hi> and a <hi>French</hi> Frigot, being then auxiliary to the King in that War, having Rencountered a <hi>Dutch</hi> Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer, who had possessed and manned three Pryzes, and having debelled him, in the mean time the Prizes made sail to escape; while the two Frigots were taking two of these Pryzes, a <hi>Scotish</hi> Privateer atacked the third, called, <hi>the Tortoice,</hi> and made her strick Sail, but not knowing whether the other Frigots were friends or foes at such a distance, did not board her, till they came near. The <hi>French</hi> Frigot being nearer then the <hi>English</hi> Frigot, both the <hi>French</hi> Frigot and the <hi>Scotish</hi> Privateer claimed the <hi>Tortoice</hi> as their Prize: The <hi>English</hi> Captain sent the Prize to <hi>Leith,</hi> and declared the case under his hand, whereupon the Admiral adjudged the <hi>Tortoice</hi> Prize to <hi>Rankine</hi> the <hi>Scotish</hi> Privateer, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being brought before the Lords by Reduction, the <hi>French</hi> Privateer pursued not, but the Kings Advocat; the Lords found, that the Frigots under the Kings pay having defeat the <hi>Dutch</hi> Privateer, who was Possessed of the <hi>Tortoice,</hi> and being in view and prosecution of her, that <hi>Rankins</hi> Capture and Possession was injurious, otherways then to assist the first attacker, unless it were proven that the Prize would have escaped, if it had not been stopped, and forced to strick Sail to Captain <hi>Rankine, February</hi> 15. 1667. Kings Advocat <hi>contra</hi> Captain <hi>Rankine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Creatures are understood to be free while they are not within the power of any. But Fishes within Ponds are proper, and Fowls though never so wild, while the are in custody. Amongst these free Creatures, these which are tame are not comprehended, but only these which are wild, which if they be tamed, contrary their Nature, are so long proper, as their tameness remains; but if they return to their ancient wildness, the property thereof is lost; so soon as the owner ceaseth to pursue for Possession, It is so long continued, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to be continued by the mind, having once begun by bodily Acts; and therefore, prosecution of wild Creatures will not begin, though it may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the property of them. Bees are numbered amongst these wild Creatures, which therefore are not proper, though they hyve on Trees, more then Fowls who set their Nests thereupon, but if they be within a Skep, or work in the hollow of a Tree, Wall, or in a House, they are proper, or while they Hyve, or flying away are pursued by the Proprietar: but thereafter they belong to him who next getteth them in his power: As also, these who were tamed and become wild, become theirs who regain and tame them again, and return not to their first owner. Thus are also Gemms, Pearls and precious Stones, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priat by the finders. And likewise Lands not possest, or which do arise of new, as do some <hi>Islands</hi> in the Sea, or more frequently in publick Rivers, which by the Civil Law are accounted to accress to these whose Ground lyes near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est proportionably, according to that part of the Ground that fronts them; but where such civil constitution is not, such <hi>Islands</hi> are publick as the Rivers are, in which they are bred.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. The <hi>Second</hi> way of Appropriation, is by Accession, whereby the accessories of things proper are also proper, as the birth of all Cattel, and their Fruits. It is likewise a natural acquisition of property, which ariseth by accretion of part, accretion of Birth and of Fruits, and even the Dung, or any other profite fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the property of that whereunto it is accessory, not only because by common utility, that is understood to be comprehended in the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Mankind, to depart from the Original Community of the Earth, and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:109710:115"/>
all the parts, Fruits and Profits thereof, and all other things thereupon, that the samine might be appropriat. But also from that general consent of Mankind, <hi>Quae nullius sunt, fiunt occupantis.</hi> And so the Birth and Fruits being a new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, are carryed as accessory by the first possession.</p>
                     <p>So Trees and all Plants, as the Birth of the Earth are carried therewith, while they are growing thereupon, even to singular Successors; but if separat, or contained in moveable Boxes, they are not so carryed with the Ground, as accessories, but are separat Moveables. So likewise, the Natural Fruits of the Ground, as Grass, and Herbs, are carryed as the Fruit thereof accessory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. But by our Custom, Corns and Industrial Fruits, are esteemed as distinct Moveables, even before they be separat or ripe, and belong not to purchas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Land or Heirs. These are the ways of constituting Property by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral equity, without consideration of the positive Law of any particular Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but there is no doubt that the sole Dispositive Will of the owner, may state the property of what is his, and fully at his dispose in another: So may the publick content of any people introduce ways of Appropriation, as they find most convenient, for publick good, and that either expresly by Statute, or Declaration of the Legislative Authority, or tacitly by Consuetude; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it be a good and solide rule, <hi>Quod meum est, sine me alienum fieri nequit,</hi> yet it hath the exception of publick sanction, or common custom, and so though it be not by the sole and proper consent of the owner, yet it is by the consent of that Society of people, or their Authority, wherein the submission or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of every one in the Society is implyed, in so far as the design of Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion extends.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, <hi>first,</hi> In Fungibles and all such things as are not discernable from others of that kind, Possession is generally esteemed to constitute property, which is most evident in current Money, which, if it be not sealed, and during its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining so, is otherways undiscernable, and doth so far become the property of the Possessor, that it passeth to all singular Successors without any question, of the knowledge, fraud, or other fault of the Authors, without which, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce could not be secured; if Money, which is the common mean of it, did not pass currently without all question, whose it had been, or how it ceassed to be his, <hi>l. si alien.</hi> 78. <hi>ff. de solutionibus,</hi> and though that Law is in the case of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion of Money with his Money, who was not owner of it, whereby it is esteemed as consumption of the Money commixed, that ground doth necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reach all Money, so soon as it passeth to any singular successor by commerce, for thereby in the same way it is consumed.</p>
                     <p n="35">35. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Upon the like ground it is, that Appropriation by Alluvion, is admitted in all Nations, for thereby the adjection of others ground insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly, and unperceivably by the running of a River, becomes a part of the ground to which it is adjected, because it is uncertain from whose Ground such small and unperceivable particles are carryed by the Water, and thereby also the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent questions that would arise betwixt the Proprietars, upon the opposit Banks of Rivers are prevented; and though the adjection may be perceivable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable in a tract of time, it maketh no difference, if at no particular instant the adjection be considerable, as the motion of the Palm of a Horologe is insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible at any instant, though it be very perceivable when put together, in less then the quarter of an hour.</p>
                     <p n="36">36. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Upon the same ground, confusion of Liquids, which are not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:109710:116"/>
altereth the property, in so far that what before belonged to several owners severally, becometh now to belong to the same owners, <hi>pro indiviso,</hi> according to the proportion of the value of their shares, neither is there any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, whether the confusion be made by the consent of parties, by accident, or by mistake, or fault, the effect being the same in all: that because the parts are undiscernable and inseparable, so as to give every owner the individual body he had before, therefore, he can only receive by equivolence, the like value by division.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> upon the same ground, commixture of Grain or other arid bodies, belonging to divers owners, which cannot be easily separate, or of any mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials in one Mass, Work, or Artifice, if they be not separable, they induce a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion proportionable to the value of the several ingredients: And though all the ingredients remain without alteration of their substance, so that in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, the property of each part might be considered as remaining with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer owner, not only in commixture, but in confusion, alluvion, and Money: Yet publick Authority for utilities sake, constituteth or declareth Property in manner foresaid, which is also consequent from necessity, and the nature of the thing, though there were no positive Law; and such commixtures are not like the commixtures of a Flock, where every individual is discernable and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as having the several marks of their distinct owners; and if a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture in that case should become undiscernable, it would of necessity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a community, as if different Flocks of unmarked Lambs should in any way fall to come together, so that the owners, or the servants could not distinguish their own, there were no remeed but to divide according to the number belonging to the several owners, and till that division were made, every owner had proportionable interest in every individual, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none of them could say or instruct this or that to be properly his own.</p>
                     <p n="38">38. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Positive Law for the common benefit, constituteth Property by necessar conjunction in constructure; such is the Roman Law, <hi>de tigno injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto,</hi> whereby a Beam, or any other material builded in a House, becomes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the owner of the House or Building, that pollicy be not prejudged by demolishing of Buildings, which therefore taketh effect, whether the materials be made use of <hi>bona,</hi> or <hi>mala fide;</hi> yea, though the materials were affected with theft, which in other cases, is <hi>labes realis,</hi> the publick interest would not suffer demolition, but give the prior owner the value, <hi>secundum pretium affectionis,</hi> and further punish the transgressor; as the <hi>Roman</hi> Law gave the double va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, but if before receiving of that satisfaction, the Building become to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished, there is no doubt but the owner of such materials will recover the same, <hi>rei vindicatione.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon the like ground of common utility, the <hi>Roman</hi> Law did constitute Property by contexture, whereby the materials wrought into Cloth, Garment, or other Artifact, did become the property of the owner of that Artifact, if without destruction thereof, or considerable detriment thereto; such materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als could not be separate therefrom, in which they made no difference, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these materials were made use of <hi>bona,</hi> or <hi>mala fide;</hi> nor did the inherent <hi>labes</hi> of materials stolen, hinder the accession and appropriation thereof by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture, §. 26. <hi>instit. de rerum divisione:</hi> But both in constructure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture, he who thereby acquireth the property of materials belonging to other owners, seing restitution thereof ceasseth, he is lyable, not only for recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, <hi>in quantum locupletior fastus est,</hi> but also for reparation of the damage
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:109710:116"/>
of the former owner, in which the manner of Acquisition is considered; for, if the materials of others be made use of, in constructure or contexture, <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na fide,</hi> the orninar value thereof is only due, but otherways the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est value, according to the estimation of the former owner, <hi>per pretium affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In Contexture it is considered, what is the design of the Artefact, that it may appear what it is principal and what it is accessory, as in Cloathes the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials though much more precious then the Cloath, are accessory thereto, and the property of the whole befalleth not to the owner of the Materials, but the owner of the Cloathes. And precious Stones set in Rings, are accessory thereto, though more precious then the Gold, or other Material of the Ring. But otherways, if a Gemm beset in Gold, the Gold becomes accessory thereto, and wherever the case is dubious, that which is of greatest value carrieth the property of the whole.</p>
                     <p>Albeit that contraversies have been seldom moved with us, as to constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, or contexture, it is not to be doubted, but we would proceed upon the like grounds of equity and utility.</p>
                     <p>Upon the like ground of accession, questions in relation to Pictures are to be resolved, for if the Ground, broad, or Table of a Picture belong to one and the same be painted by another, either for his own use, or for the use of a third party, there doth not continue two distinct properties, one of the Broad, and another of the Picture, nor a communion by proportion of Interest, but the property of the whole befalleth to one, as to which, there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety betwixt the two <hi>Roman Juris-consults, Paulus</hi> and <hi>Caius,</hi> for <hi>Paulus</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Picture to follow the Broad, as accessory thereto, and carried there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, <hi>l. in rem,</hi> 23. §. 3. <hi>ff. de rei vindicatione;</hi> but <hi>Caius</hi> on the contrair, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributeth the Broad as accessory to the Picture, <hi>l.</hi> 9. §. 2. <hi>ff. de acquirendo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum dominio,</hi> and both Sentences be confirmed by <hi>Justinian</hi> in the <hi>Digest.</hi> In the <hi>Institutes,</hi> he prefers the opinion of <hi>Caius,</hi> §. 34. <hi>Instit. de rerum divisione;</hi> upon that reason, that it were ridiculous, that a precious Picture of <hi>Appelles</hi> should follow a Broad, though of the lowest value: Albeit before, precious Stones, though of greater value then Cloth, were declared by him to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed therewith, Positive Law may determine the point either way, without injustice, according to equity and expediency; but there are diverse cases in the matter, which should be diversly resolved; as,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> If any Picture be Painted upon a Wall, or other immoveable, it doth necessarily cede to the ground thereof, and quality, wherever the Picture is, for ornament of its ground, as when a Scrine, or Cabine, or the like Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables are Painted, because the adorning of the ground is in that case designed; but a Face or any other Picture, where the Broad is only designed for it, the Broad is most conveniently esteemed as accessory thereto, and in all cases, the owner of the whole is lyable <hi>in quantum lucratus est,</hi> even though the Painting be done by him, who knew that the ground was not his own, for in that case, the presumption is not strong enough, that he did it <hi>animo donandi,</hi> for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imagined, that the making use of an inconsiderable Broad of an other, should infer the purpose of gifting a fine Picture thereupon, neither that they who Paint a Wall, Scrine, or Boxes of others, being Articens, who work for profit, did the same to gift. but to obliege the other party.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="210" facs="tcp:109710:117"/>Writing upon Parchment, Paper, or other Tables, was by the <hi>Rontan</hi> Law accounted as accessory thereto, <hi>Instit. de rerum divisione,</hi> §. 33. <hi>l.</hi> 3. §. <hi>pen. ff. ad exhibendum,</hi> which is very disionant from that which is there determined of Pictures; and therefore, is every where in desuetude, as is observed by <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Minsynger</hi> and others, both as to Writing and Printing in the same way as Painting; for if the Writing be upon the Wall or other Moveables of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or if it be upon the Books of others, it cedeth thereto; but if it be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Paper or Parchment, the design and use whereof is for Writing, and the use whereof is consumed and lost by Writing, it doth follow the Writing, and it were very unreasonable to think that the Evidents and Securities of Lands, or any Manuscript, should be accessory to the Paper, or Parchment whereon they were Written, and which were only designed to bear and preserve the Write.</p>
                     <p n="38">38. It is a Rule in the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, which we follow <hi>inedificatum solo cedit,</hi> for thereby all Buildings of Houses, Walls, Wells, Dyks, &amp;c. And generally, all things sixed to the Ground, are accounted as parts of the Ground, and pass therewith (though not exprest) to all singular Successors: And not to Executors, but to Heirs; and thence, not only the Materials of others become the owners of the Ground, on which they are builded, and for preserving of policy, cannot be demolished, as hath been said of Constructure: But like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, he that Builds with his own Materials upon another Mans Ground, the samin accresce to the Ground, and if the owner of these Materials knew the Ground to be anothers, the <hi>Roman</hi> Law gave him no Recompence therefore, but presumed it to be done, <hi>animo donandi,</hi> which is rather penal, in hatred of these who incroach upon the ground of others, then from any sufficient ground of presumption; and therefore, our Custom doth allow a Recompence to the Builder, in so far as the Heretor were profited thereby, in that he might get a greater Rent for that Building. But Building by Tennents of Houses for their own use, though at their removing, they leave the Land in better condition, then at their entry, they get no satisfaction thereof, without paction. And a Liferenter having Rebuilded a Jointure-house, which was burnt by accident in her Vidowity, and Rebuilt by her second Husband, was found to have no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction therefore, except the House had been accustomed to be set for Rent; and that the Liferenter, or her Husband had no power to demolish any thing, that was fixed to the Ground, <hi>February</hi> 2. 1672.

                     <p>There remains to be cleared, that Appropriation which is by Specification, whereby of materials belonging to other owners, a new species is produced, whether the product belongs to the owners of the materials, or to him for whom the Work was made, as to which, the two great Sects of the ancient Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, were divided, <hi>Proculus</hi> and his followers attributing the property of all materials to him that made the Work. And <hi>Sabinus</hi> and his, attributing the whole to the owners of the materials: But <hi>Tribonian</hi> midseth the matter thus, that if the product can easily be reduced to the first matter, the owners of the matter remain proprietars of the whole, as when a Cup or other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>In Immoveables, the constitution or transmisson of property, is exprest in Write, and is parted in many interests; but in Moveables, property is simple and full without servitude, and there is no other interest in them, unless they be impledged, neither need the Title Constitution or Transmission of property in Moveables be instructed by Write, but is presumed from possession; and therefore, for the Restitution or recovery of Moveables from the possessor thereof, it is not sufficient to instruct that the pursuer had a sufficient right thereto, as by the birth or fruit of his Ground or Cattel; or as being bought by him and in his Possession: But he must instruct the manner how his Possession ceassed, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either taken from him by violence, or by stealth, or having strayed, and being lost or the like; and the reason thereof is, because moveables pass with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Write, and oftimes without witness; and therefore, whatever right par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties once had to Moveables, it is presumed to be transmitted by Donation, sale, or otherways, unless it be proven that he lost Possession, as aforesaid; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, that it be proven by the Defenders Oath, that he knew the thing in question to be the pursuers proper Goods; for in that case, even his privat knowledge will prejudge him, though he had bought it at a competent rate, though it be not so in Heretable Rights, to whose constitution and transmissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Write and Solemnities are necessar, neither will it avail, though it were a Horse bought in publick Mercat and Booked there; for we have not the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Fairs which the <hi>English</hi> have, that Horse bought in publick Mercat should be secured to the buyer, without further question, but he buys the same with the peril of the sellers rigt, <hi>March</hi> 19. 1639. <hi>Ferguson contra Forrest.</hi> Hence it is, that in all Actions for recovery of moveables, there is no more lybelled, then that the moveables were the proper Goods of the pursuer, and in his Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, for such time, by using the same as his own proper goods, and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending how he ceassed to possess, as being lent by him, which was found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levant to be proven by witnesses, though the question was of a Book of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable value, <hi>January</hi> 27. 1665. <hi>Walter Scot</hi> Oy to <hi>Scotishtarbet contra</hi> Sir <hi>John Fletcher;</hi> or that the goods did stray, <hi>February</hi> 3. 1672. <hi>Scot</hi> of <hi>Gorren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berrie contra Elliot;</hi> or if the goods were in possession of a Defunct at his death, the presumption of sale ceasseth; or if there be a stronger contrary presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as was found in the case of Jewels, which the Defender neither could use as proper to his quality, and he was not a Merchant or Jewler; (these Jewels were once in pignorat by Write,) in that case possession was not found sufficient to infer property, <hi>December</hi> 12. 1665. <hi>John Ramsay contra James Wilson.</hi> And even in the case of Ships of War, which are the most considerable moveables, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty was presumed by possession without write, <hi>July</hi> 26. 1673.

                     <p>These are the ways of Appropriation by private Right; Appropriation by publick Right is by War, and force, where there is no common Judge or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, for in that case, equity and that common justice, which is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all Nations, as the rule of right and wrong, especially in so far as it is owned by the Law of Nations, is a sufficient warrand for obtaining satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by force, where it is denyed by justice; but our design here being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to consider privat Rights, we shall but noice that which by publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is allowed in these cases, to be the peculiar Right of privat persons, which doth only reach moveables, seazed upon by reprysals, or the Goods of enemies, or their partakers taken in publick War.</p>
                     <p n="42">42. Reprysals or Letters of Mark, are granted by Princes or States, by their Warrand or Commission, to seaze upon the Goods of all persons under the Dominion of such Princes or people, who have refused to make just reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the wrongs and damages done by any of their Subjects, which the Law of Nations doth justly and necessarly allow, for the common good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; for if private persons be injured, by these who are not under one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon authority with them, by Piracy, Pillage or otherways, oftimes they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know the injurer, and all force being stated in publick Authority, they cannot make use thereof to redress or revenge themselves; and therefore, they can only make application to the Soveraign Authority of that society of people, whereof they are members, and represent and instruct the injury and damage sustained by them, by the Subjects of other Princes or States, and thereupon desire that a redress may be demanded, which is ordinarly done by Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, or other Ministers of State; and if redress be not so obtained, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign authority of the persons injured, may and ought to give Commissions for seazing upon the goods of any of the people of that Society, whereof the injurers are members, till just satisfaction and reparation be obtained, and though there be that singularity in it, that the goods of these who did not the injury, are taken to satisfie the same; yet therin, there is not only necessity but moral justice, allowed and approven by the Custom of all Nations, by their common consent, for without this Societies could not be preserved; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the publick association of people implyeth this in it, that the Society is lyable for reparation of the injuries and damages of any of their Society, when reparation is refused.</p>
                     <p>Reprysals ought to be limited to a just satisfaction; and therefore, what is thereby seazed, ought to be adjndged in Courts of Admirality, wherein it ought to be proven, that the goods seazed belonged to persons of that Society, of which the injurer is a member, and to be valued according to the rate they are worth, where they are brought in and to be adjudged, in satisfaction to the injured of their damage and interest, in whole or in part: So that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cress should be forthco ming to the owner: thereof; and so soon as satisfaction is obtained, the reprysals ought to ceass: Neither doth the use-making of reprysals in this just order and measure, import the breach of Treaties,

But where the injury is publick and attrocious, the Law of Nations hath necessarly and justly allowed publick War, not only to reach the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables of publick enemies, but their Territories, Jurisdictions and Estates, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the proportion of satisfaction cannot be so measured, nor is it so consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as in reprysals. That which accreweth to privat persons in War, is only the giving of quarter, or getting of spoil, in so far as the same is allowed, or permitted by the Commanders in chief, warranted by publick Authority, as is ordinar to the Souldiers upon defates of their enemies, to seaze upon, and appropriat such moveables as are upon their enemies persons, or in their bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage: And sometimes for the encouraging of Souldiers besieging, and for the obstinacy of the besieged, the plunder of places gained by force, is for some time permitted, and ceasseth so soon as countermanded. In other cases, what belongs to enemies is confiscated for publick use, and Souldiers ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with their wages.</p>
                     <p n="44">44. The main privat interest in publick War, is that which accreweth by Commissions granted by the Admiral, for seazing and appropriating of the Ships and Goods of publick enemies, and of these who become partakers of the War, and who carry not themselves as friends, or newters, to the Princes, or States ingaged in the War: For by our Custom, albeit such Ships and Goods be confiscat as publick, belonging to the King or States; yet private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who undertake these Commissions, have the expenses and profit of these seazures, paying a fifteenth part thereof to the King, and a tenth part to the Admiral.</p>
                     <p>There have been many questions as to the Rights and Interests of Allies, and Newters, very fully and accuratly debated, and decided in the Session, upon occasion of the late Wars, betwixt the King and the States of the United <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi> which, because they are of great use, for clearing the important points that occur in these controversies, and for vindicating of the publick justice of the Kingdom, we shall in the clearest and shortest method we can, give account of what hath been determined in all the Pryzes which came before the Lords of Session in these Wars.</p>
                     <p>The Lord Admiral of <hi>Scotland</hi> is the Judge ordinar, and the sole Judge in the first instance of all Prizes taken at Sea, but in the second instance, the Lords of Session, who are the supream Judges in all civil Causes in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which are not determined by, or depending before the Parliament, or their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, do upon complaint of iniquity committed by the Admiral, before final sentence Advocat such Causes, wherein they find probable ground of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity alledged and instructed; or in the second instance after sentence, do grant Letters of suspension, or reduction of the Admirals Decreets, whereupon all intricat and difficile questions in matters of Pryzes come to be debat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and determined by the Lords; there is no question, when the Goods and Ships seazed on belong to enemies, but only when they do belong, or are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to belong to Allies or Newters.</p>
                     <p>The Lords, upon complaint of iniquity committed by the Admiral, it being alledged, that the Lords were not Judges in the matters of Pryzes in the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, yet they found, both by the amplitude of the power of their Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:109710:120"/>
and by the custom in former times, that it was competent to the Lords to Advocat Causes from the Admiral upon iniquity, albeit the process cannot begin before them in the first instance; for as they are the Kings ordinar Council, all matters, not belonging to the Jurisdiction of another Court, belongeth to them; and therefore, they may, and oft have Advocat Causes from the Justice General, and other Judges in Criminal Causes; albeit the Lords cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide these Causes, as being only Judges in Causes Civil, yet they may Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat the same, that in case, the reasons of Advocation be relevant and proven, they may remit the Cause to the proper and competent Judge, if the reason of Advocation be upon incompetency, or to other unsuspect Judges, if the reason be upon the suspicion of the Judge, as being concerned in the Cause, or near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly related to the parties, or having enmity against any of them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Lords in the Advocation, raised by the owners of the Ship, called, <hi>the Bounder,</hi> against Captain <hi>Gilleis,</hi> it being, alledged that the Admiral had committed iniquity, in granting a conjunct probation for proving the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Ship and loadning; the Lords found this no relevant ground of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the Cause, it being in <hi>arbitrio judicis,</hi> whether to grant a conjunct probation before answer to the relevancy of the reasons of Adjudication, or to discuss the relevancy first, and then to admit the points found relevant to probation; but in the other way witnesses, are adduced for either party, yet this being only, <hi>ex nobili officio,</hi> the Lords remitted the Cause to the Admiral, and ordained him to proceed to discuss the relevancy, there being pregnant grounds of Adjudication instantly verified, <hi>June</hi> 12. 1673. and upon his refusal, they did Advocat the Cause to themselves; they did also ordain the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to proceed upon the evidences adduced to adjudge or assoilzie, without allowing a conjunct probation before answer, and declared, that if he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not accordingly, they would Advocat the Cause, albeit the <hi>Danish</hi> Treaty bear, <hi>that their Ships shall not be medled with, or their Goods disloaded, till they be adjudged in a Court of Admirality;</hi> for the Lords are the Kings great Court of Admirality, in the same way as his Commissioners in <hi>England</hi> are Judges in the second instance, of Pryzes brought before the Admiral of <hi>England, Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 17. 1673. Captain <hi>Stuart contra</hi> the owners of the <hi>Danish</hi> Ship, called, <hi>the Seal Fish.</hi>

                     <p>When Questions concerning Prizes come before the Lords, they do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Defences of strangers, as being competent, and omitted in the first instance, though that be a Rule by our custom, but do proceed according to the common Law of Nations, and so they decided, <hi>July</hi> 23. 1667. <hi>Hans Jur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan contra</hi> Captain <hi>Logan,</hi> which was the first case occurring in that question, and was always followed after.</p>
                     <p>The rule by which the Lords have always proceeded in the matter of Pryzes, hath been the Law and Custom of Nations; and therefore, the Tenor of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals Commission was not found to be the rule, <hi>February</hi> 21. 1668. <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew Parkman contra</hi> Captain <hi>Allan.</hi>

                     <p>The treaties betwixt the King and his Allies, in so far as they differ from the common Law of Nations, have always been allowed by the Lords, as excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from that general Rule, and good Defences to the people, comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in these Treaties.</p>
                     <p>In dubious cases, the Lords have proceeded by the Kings Instructions, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narly adhibit to the Admiralities of all his Kingdoms, that they might keep one

                     </p>
                     <p>The ground of Justice for confiscating the Ships of those who are not ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies is, that they have assisted the enemy in carrying on the War, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by became accessories to the War, and by that Delinquence, do confiscat the Ships, and the loading, by which they have had accession; for the Law and Custom of Nations hath very fitly restricted the reparation of this Delinquence, so as not to state the parties offenders, as enemies, and thereby to make all their goods confiscable, as enemies goods, but doth limit the same to these Ships, in which the concurse is acted, ifthey be seazed in that Voyage, in which they give assistance, or in the immediat return.</p>
                     <p>Ingagement in War by Princes and States, cannot justly hinder the free Trade of other people, upon whom, neither party hath either Obligation or Jurisdiction; but the common consent and Custom of Nations requireth an equality and newtrality in all other parties, that they concur not in the War with either party, forbearing assistance in the War, which is by furnishing them men, instruments of War, materials specially requisit for the present War, Money furnished for publick use, and in some cases Victual, as when carried to places besieged, and other things which have promiscuous use in Peace and War, when there is a special application there of to the necessar use of the War; as Iron, Brass, Leid, Pitch, Tar, and the like, which are therefore called coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terband-goods, or prohibit-goods; and by the Denunciations of War, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is ordinarly made to Newters, from what things to abstain, as from carrying of counterband-goods towards enemies Ports, or carrying the goods and ware of enemies, whereby their Trade is promoted, and they enabled to maintain the War; or by carrying on their. Trade under the colour of the Trade of Neuters; and therefore, in time of War, Neuters do instruct their Vessels with Passes, and other Documents, instructing, that the bottom and goods belong to their subjects free-men, and that the parties ingaged in the War, or any of their subjects have no interest therein; which Passes are upon the oaths of the owners of the Ship, or Masters thereof, and those who embarque the loading; and where there is any Treaty, the <hi>formula</hi> of such Passes useth to be exprest, always including an oath, and being given by such Magistrates as are agreed upon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Then seing the accession of Neuters is a Delinquence, it can have no place where there is not a publick denunced War, which were presumed to be known to the Delinquent; and therefore, the Ship and Goods belonging to Neuters, were not found Prize, because carrying counterband-goods towards the enemies Ports, unless the War had been nottourly known, at the place where they loosed, at the time when they loosed, and acts of hostility, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring of Prizes, in neighbouring places was not found sufficient, <hi>July</hi> 22. 1667. <hi>Hans Jurgan contra</hi> Captain <hi>Logan.</hi> The like was found of a Ship of <hi>Hamburg,</hi> carrying counterband-goods to <hi>Danish</hi> Ports, after acts of hostility betwixt the King and the <hi>Danes,</hi> because the Ship was taken before the Proclamation of the War against the <hi>Danes, February</hi> 25. 1668.

                     <p>There is a particular Article in the first Treaty betwixt the King and the <hi>Swedes,</hi> by which it is declared, that in regard the most of the materials of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Trade, are Pitch, Tar, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>
                        <hi>A</hi> Ship was not found Prize for carrying of Victual or Money to the enemies Countrey, <hi>July</hi> 16. 1673. Captain <hi>Lyel contra</hi> the Master of the <hi>Leopard.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is no doubt but carrying of Souldiers to the enemies Countrey of what Nation soever they be is counterband, and useth to be exprest in the Treaties of Allies generally, under the name of men, which can only be understood of strangers when they are actual Souldiers in the enemies service, for thereby there is a greater participation of the War, then either by carrying of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies goods, or by carrying the instruments of War towards the enemies Ports; but otherways, passengers who are Neuters, may freely go to the Ports of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies for Trading, travelling, or any other end not being found or presumed to become Citizens or Souldiers there, but residing only as Factors for strangers, and not contributing with the enemy to the War, they do not exceed the bounds of Neutrality.</p>
                     <p>The difficulty is greater in case persons belonging to the enemies Countrey, be carryed in the Ships of Allies or Neuters, and there is little doubt but the persons of enemies, residing in the enemies Countrey, and contributing to the War, have the same or more effect, then the carrying of their goods, though
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:109710:121"/>
that hath not occurred to be determined with us, and there is less doubt, that being born in the enemies Countrey, or having resided there as Citizens, but having left the same before the War, doth no further state them as enemies, then that by their Language, or other evidence they are presumed to be ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, unless they make it appear that they had left the enemies Countrey, and fixed their residence else-where: Neither will any burdens imposed upon their Lands or Houses, import their concurse in the War as enemies.</p>
                     <p>There was a special Concession by the King in favours of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that because the Language of his Subjects in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> is the same with these of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> that there should be no seazure of the Ships belonging to his Subjects, upon accompt of being served, or Navigat by <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is also an Article in the <hi>Swedish</hi> Treaty, that it should be free for them to make use of <hi>Dutch</hi> Masters for Navigating their Ships, provided that these Masters fix their Domiciles in <hi>Sweden,</hi> and become Citizens and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants there.</p>
                     <p>These Concessions gave great occasion of doubt, whether these or other Allies or Newters might make use of <hi>Hollanders</hi> as Mariners, or Servants in their Ships, because, if without that Concession they were free to hire <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> for Servants, they might hire them for Masters of Ships, as well as other Mariners, and so needed no such priviledge, and therefore run no hazard by being Navigat by <hi>Hollanders;</hi> but if they might not lawfully make use of a <hi>Hollands</hi> Master, till they had it by special priviledge, <hi>a pari,</hi> they could not make use of <hi>Hollands</hi> Mariners. It is clear, that the being by Nation <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> inferreth no hazard, either as to the Masters or Sea-men, for the War is only with the Citizens and Inhabitants of the enemies Countrey, so that the true Domicile or Residence is the main point in question. There is also great difference betwixt the Master or Stearsman and the common Mariners; for the Master is in possession of, and intrusted with the Ship, which is affected both with his Delinquence, and by his Contracts of Bottomarie; and therefore, his oath alone is always accounted sufficient probation, as to the property of the Ship, and frequently the Stearsman is intrusted with the Loading, in which case also his oath will be sufficient probation as to the property thereof, but the oaths of the Mariners have only been made use of as ordinar witnesses, proving by the concurse of two or more, and the confessions of the Master, Stearsman or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at Sea when they were taken, have not been allowed as sufficient proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to Confiscat the Ship or Loading, yea, though renewed after they came to Land, but only when taken judicially, and very little use hath been made of the oaths of the Privateer, or his Company, for proving against Strangers, but only their own oaths, and other evidences, the oath of the Skipper alone was found to prove against the owners, <hi>July</hi> 13. 1669. Captain <hi>Wood contra Booz Neilson.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The taking priviledge for a <hi>Hollands</hi> Master upon the considerations afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, doth not import that Mariners may not be made use of, who are by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Holanders,</hi> if they reside not in the Jurisdiction of the enemy; neither will the being of some of them aboard, infer such evidence, that the whole Ship and Loading belong not to Newters and Free men; but if the most part of the Company be <hi>Hollanders,</hi> or if the Master be a <hi>Hollander,</hi> the presumption is strong, and gives sufficien ground for seazure; and therefore, is fitly declared
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:109710:122"/>
by Treaties, that if the Master by Nation be a <hi>Hollander,</hi> the Pass shall bear expretly, <hi>that it is sworn upon oath that he is Citizen and Inhabitant in</hi> Sweden.</p>
                     <p>The King by his Proclamation of the first War against the <hi>Dutch,</hi> did command to seaze and make Prizes of all Ships, where there were found any number of men belonging to the enemy; and therefore, a <hi>Swedish</hi> Ship was found Prize, because Navigat with <hi>Hollanders,</hi> being all or the most part of her company, albeit she had a Pass from <hi>Sweden</hi> in the Terms of the <hi>formula,</hi> contained in the <hi>Swedish</hi> Treaty; and albeit the Treaty bear, that where such a Pass is, <hi>in bona aut homines nullo modo inquiratur,</hi> because in that same Article it is subjoyned, <hi>nisi gravis suspicio subsit,</hi> and it was a most weighty ground of suspition, that the Ship or Goods belonged to <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that the Company acknowledged that they resided in <hi>Holland,</hi> and were taken on there im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly before this Voyage in this Process, it being alledged, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Company, taken by an Admiral Depute at <hi>Cromarty,</hi> was extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by holding Swords and Pistols to their Breasts, or that the samin was so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted at Sea, when they were taken, it was found sufficient to enervat their Testimonies, if they were made to swear at Sea, the Privateer and Company having Swords and Pistols in their hands, because to evite the insamy of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, they might adhere in their judicial Re-examination to their Testimonies taken at Sea, upon oath, albeit not true, or if by force or just fear, they did so depone before the Admiral Deput, <hi>February</hi> 25. 1668. the owners of the Ship, called, <hi>the Castle of Riga contra</hi> Captain Seatoun. The like was found, where a great part of the Company were <hi>Hollanders, June</hi> 30. 1668. <hi>Peterson contra</hi> Captain <hi>Anderson.</hi> And in the case betwixt Captain <hi>Allan</hi> and <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew Parkman,</hi> decided, <hi>July</hi> 9. 1668. the Ship was found Prize for having a number of <hi>Hollanders</hi> Sailers, <hi>viz.</hi> three, the Company being nine, and for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a small parcel of Tar, as counterband aboard, and having aboard the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of counterband, taken in the immediat return of that Voyage; upon all which grounds joyntly, the Ship was declared Prize.</p>
                     <p>But in this War there hath no Ship been declared Prize upon account of the Companies being <hi>Hollanders,</hi> neither because the Master was a <hi>Hollander,</hi> if he were not also a part owner, albeit two of the Company were <hi>Hollanders, July</hi> 24. 1673. Captain <hi>Bennet contra</hi> the owners of <hi>the Pearl.</hi> But the Master being a <hi>Hollander</hi> was found a sufficient ground of suspition and seazure, but not of Confiscation, the property being proven to pertain to free men; and therefore, probation was allowed to either party, <hi>July</hi> 16. 1673.

                     <p>The hyring of the enemies people is no assistance to them in the War, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a weakening of them, so that if these of the enemies Country be only aboard as Servants to Newters, and not upon their own account, either as Traders or Passengers, there hath been no inquiry in the last War, as to their Residence, neither hath any thing as to that point been mentioned in the last Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of War, or in His <hi>Majesties</hi> Instructions to the Admiralities of His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; and though the Law might have reached Ships Navigat by <hi>Holland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> residing in <hi>Holland,</hi> and not changing the Domicile, yet in favour and prudence, that ground hath not been sustained, it being more the Kings Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to allow his enemies to withdraw from their Countrey, then to force them to serve only there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="219" facs="tcp:109710:122"/>Counterband is not only a cause of Confiscation, when taken going towards enemies Ports, but also when the Ship is taken in her return from the enemies Port in that same Voyage, for then the Delinquence is compleat, whereas it had not taken effect before the Ship attained the Port, and yet might be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seazed before the full effect, because the seazure of the Ship in her Voyage is the impediment that the effect is not attained; and therefore, the common custom of Nations hath allowed such seazures, for otherways it were impossible to hinder Newters to carry Counterband-goods to enemies, for carrying on the War; neither will the pretence of altering their resolution, to sail to, or disload in a free Port, be a sufficient Defence, unless the Ship were actually stearing another course; but if a Ship should be pursued to be searched for counterband in her passage to an enemies Port, and should be waited for till her return, and taken as she came from that Port, there could be far less pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to excuse that Delinquence; and therefore, it was one of the grounds of Confiscation of <hi>Parkmans</hi> Ship, taken by Captain <hi>Allan,</hi> that she was taken in the return of the same Voyage, in which she carryed counterband to the enemies Ports, <hi>July</hi> 9. 1668. And though in that case the reason was lybelled, that the Ship was taken, having in her the product of counterband, having the same effect with counterband it self, <hi>quia surrogatum sapit naturam surrogati,</hi> yet without that, in the foresaid case of Captain <hi>Lyle,</hi> it was found sufficient that the Ship was taken in the return of that same Voyage, in which she carryed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terband, without mention of the product thereof, <hi>July</hi> 16. 1673. in which case it was found necessar that the Ship belonged to the same owners, that had carryed in the counterband, so that though the Ship had been light without any Loading, she would have been Prize, unless she had been a <hi>Swedish</hi> Ship, and so secured by the <hi>Swedish</hi> Treaty, Confiscating only counterband when it is actually taken.</p>
                     <p>It is a most convenient moderation of the Law of Nations, that the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of carrying counterband, is followed no further then the immediat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of that Voyage, otherways it would be the foundation of marring Trade, by perpetual quarrels, upon pretence of counterband carryed in to enemies in former Voyages.</p>
                     <p>In these Wars there has been no occasion to determine, whether it be a cause of Confiscation, if a Ship be taken in return of that Voyage, wherein she was Loaded with enemies goods.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> by their Declaration did prohibit all Friends and Allies, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to carry counterband-goods to any Port in the Kings Dominions, but to be found therewith upon his Coasts, or diverting from the Voyage they might make with counterband towards the Kings Ports, holding that for a sufficient probation of their intending these Ports, which is like they would not take off by Documents aboard, expressing their own Ports, or the Ports of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it being so easie to procure false and colourable Documents, yet that was never sustained as a relevant ground of Adjudication with us.</p>
                     <p>By what hath been said, the confiscation of the Ships and Goods of Allies and Newters upon account of counterband, and the assistance given to enemies thereby, hath been cleared; the other chief ground of confiscation of the Ships and goods of Newters, is by their concurse with enemies, in carrying on their Trade; and therefore, in all the Treaties, the <hi>formula</hi> of Passes doth require, that it be attested upon oath, that the ship and Loading belongs to the Subjects of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:109710:123"/>

                     <p>Some are of opinion, that an unfree Ship Confiscats the Loading, as accessory thereto, but that unfree Loading or a part thereof doth not Confiscat the Ship, which is but a groundless subtilty; the reason of this Confiscation being the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking with enemies in carrying on of their Trade, it taketh place alike in the Ship and Loading, or any part thereof; but it being a Delinquence, it hath still the exception of the <hi>bona fides,</hi> and ignorance of these who partake in that Conjunction of Trade, but though the Society or partnership was entered into before the War, it was not found to liberat, seing there was time and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to dissolve it after, <hi>July</hi> 17. 1673.

                     <p>That a part of the Ship belonging to an enemy, doth confiscat the whole Ship, and Loading, hath been of times decided, even in the case where the Master was hired by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> or other Allies, and was a sworn Citizen in <hi>Sweden,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it were sufficiently instructed, that he were an Inhabitant and Residenter there, and had changed his Domicile from <hi>Holland,</hi> and carried his Wife and Family, if any he had, to a newtral place.

The like was found in the reduction at the instance of the owners of the Ship, called <hi>the Calmer,</hi> against Captain <hi>Smeatoun,</hi> which was first found Prize by the Admiral, and twice thereafter by the Lords, be cause the Skippers oath contradicted the Pass, bearing, <hi>the Ship to belong wholly to Swedes,</hi> and yet he deponed that he was an eighth part owner, and a <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and probation having been adduced by Commission, both from <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> the most pregnant probation was, that his true Domicile was at <hi>Amsterdam, December</hi> 13. 1673.</p>
                     <p>The Loading belonging to enemies, was also found to make the Ship Prize, seing it appeared, that they knew the same to belong to enemies, when inload<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and had no priviledge by Treaty, <hi>July</hi> 15. 1673.

Earl of <hi>Kincarden, contra</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the St. <hi>Andrew;</hi> but thereafter this Ship was also found Prize upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grounds. The greatest difficulty in the matter of Prizes, is, the discovery and probation of the Interest of Enemies, if probation be not had from the Oath of the Skipper and Company, or from the Documents found Aboard, there remains no more but presumptive Probation, which sometimes is so preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as it admits no contrary positive probation, and oftimes it doth admit the same, and then there is probation allowed to either Party, for clearing the Matter of Fact, either as to the property of Ship, or Goods, the true residence of the Master, or the Port truly intended, or any other Matter of Fact, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Confiscation or Liberation may be inferred.</p>
                     <p>In the second <hi>Dutch</hi> War, they had found out so cunning contrivances to cover their Trade, that the same could hardly be so far discovered as to make a lawful Probation; for they did not only procure Passes from the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> and other Allyes, and Newters, and upon the Priviledge gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them of <hi>Hollands</hi> Masters, did send persons intrusted by them, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters or Steersmen to mannage their Trade, under pretence of fixing their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miciles in <hi>Sweden,</hi> or in <hi>Denmark,</hi> conform to these Treaties: But also, they intrusted their Money to Merchants, or Factors, belonging to the Countries of Allyes, and Newters, who bought Ships and Goods in their own Names, but to the use and behove of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and upon their risk and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and profite, so that they had pretence to depone, that the propertie of Ship and Goods did belong to these free-men who bought them, because there lay only an obligation of trust upon them, to communicate the same to <hi>Hollanders;</hi> as did appear by a report returned from the Magistrats of <hi>Stock-holme,</hi> upon a Commission from the Lords for clearing the property of the Ship called, <hi>the Wine Grape,</hi> and her Loading, for the persons who by the Pass, made faith as owners, being interrogat, <hi>whether they had lent their names for the behove of the</hi> Dutch, <hi>or had bought the Ship and Goods for their use;</hi> so that the benefit or loss was to redound to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> they declined to give a direct answer upon Oath, denying the same, and only asserted, that they ought not to be interrogat upon such indirect dealing, or the like, or to that purpose: yea, use was made of the Name and Trust of his Majesties Subjects, to collour the <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade, and many Passes were procured from the Admirality of <hi>England</hi> for the same effect: all these were the more easily obtained, because the sufferings of innocent Merchants, upon accompt of their Governours was generally pitied, and the profite of Privateers was als generally hated and envied.</p>
                     <p>The ordinar grounds of a presumptive Probation of the Interest of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by the custom of Nations are these, <hi>first,</hi> if in the time of War, Ships were not instructed with Passes upon Oath, expressing the Owner of Ships and Loading; and therefore, the want of Passes, or the want of Documents for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing the properties of the Ship and Loading, or any part thereof, the samen is presumed to belong to enemies. <hi>Secondly,</hi> False or forged Documents. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Double Documents. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Destroying of Documents, as throwing the same over Board, or sending them away at the time of the Capture; infer that the Ship or Loading, or some part thereof, belong'd to Enemies, and

likewise the having Aboard double Flaggs, to be made use of at diverse occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
                     <p>As to the first ground of Confiscation upon want of Documents; <hi>First,</hi> There is no necessity to have Aboard a Vendition of the Ship in write, but in Ships, as other moveables, property is presumed from possession. <hi>July</hi> 26. 1673. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Hamiltoun contra</hi> the Master of the Ship, called the of <hi>Stattin;</hi> neither doth the want of a Pass, conform to the <hi>formula</hi> in Treaties, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defective and not expressing the Port to which the Ship was direct, infer Confiscation: in this case there was no Counterband Goods Aboard, so that though the true Port had been the Enemies Port, it would not have inferred Confiscation, <hi>January</hi> 21. 1673. <hi>Hendrick Anderson,</hi> Master of the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Dantzick, contra</hi> Captain <hi>Dowglas.</hi> The like was found the 19. of <hi>February,</hi> 1673. the Owners of the <hi>Palm-tree</hi> and <hi>Patience, contra</hi> Captain <hi>Atchison.</hi> and upon the 27. of <hi>February,</hi> 1673.

                     <p>The throwing of papers over-board, or destroying the same at the time of the <hi>captur,</hi> is a most pregnant ground of Confiscation; for thence it is presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that these papers would have instructed the property to belong to Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and therefore being proven but by one Witness, it put the burthen of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation upon the strangers, that the Ship and Loading belonged to free men, <hi>February</hi> 28. 1673.

                     <p>Ships have oftimes been found prize by the concurse of several evidences of a contrivance, under colourable Documents, and therefore a Ship was found prize, because the pass did not mention the Port, which a Toll-breif bore to be <hi>Breme,</hi> and the Master by his Oath acknowledged the Port to be <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and that the Owners were other persons then were exprest in the pass, and that the Master resided in <hi>Holland,</hi> though the pass bore him to to be a Burgess in <hi>Dantzick,</hi> against which a contrary probation was not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, <hi>January</hi> 23. 1673. the Owners of the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Dantzick, contra</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Lyon;</hi> a Ship was also Confiscat, because the Master and Steersman depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that they knew not to whom the Goods belonged, but that they had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from a Merchant in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> to consign them in the Pack-house of <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holme,</hi> to be delivered to such persons as should show such marks, <hi>July</hi> 10. 1673.

                        <pb n="225" facs="tcp:109710:125"/>This further is to be observed, that when the Ships of Newters have aboard counterband, the deffect of Documents for the counterband, or double, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable Documents to cover the same, will not infer confiscation, if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty be proven to belong to free men, and that the true Port intended, was not an enemies Port, because in such cases Newters have necessity of colourable Documents: but as to the property of Ship and Goods, they have no such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity; and therefore, contrary probation is not admitted against the ordinar presumptive probation, by wanting of Documents, concealing or destroying of Documents, or making use of double or false Documents.</p>

                        <pb n="228" facs="tcp:109710:127"/>THE <hi>Roman</hi> Empyre in <hi>Italy,</hi> being long opprest, and at length supprest by the Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the <hi>Longobards</hi> and other barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nations, who seated themselves there, and divided these beautiful Courtreys a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst their Captains, and they sub-divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the same to their Souldiers, for their Military service; and as they were the authors of this new Right, so they did term it by a new and barbarous name, <hi>Feudum,</hi> which the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>Fiff,</hi> and we with the <hi>English</hi> call a <hi>Fee;</hi> concerning which, there was no common written Law, but the several Provinces had their diverse Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, as they thought most suitable to the nature of this Right, and their own utility. These Books annexed to the Civil Law, called <hi>Libri Feudorum,</hi> though they have great respect amongst Lawers, yet they are but the observations of privat persons, and so not a written publick Law.</p>
                     <p>By the Irruption which happened in the sixth Century, the Civil Law was <hi>sopit</hi> for five hundred years, it was revived in the eleventh Century, and did take in with it the Feudal Customes, which have been propagat through the most civil Nations in the World, not only for strengthning them towards War, but because Soveraigns had thereby a new interest over their Subjects and Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, thereby becoming their Feudatars and Vassals, owing always to them fidelity, and oftest following as their Clients and Assecles, acknowledging them as their Lords, Superiours, and Paramount in their Lands and Heretages, which are all derived, mediatly or immediatly from the Soveraign authority, as the common and supream Superiour of all the Subjects, who have any more then the right of unfixed Moveables.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And thereby also ariseth the Feudal Jurisdiction, whereby not only the Soveraign power, but all Superiours do by the advice and assistance of their Vassals, who are called Peers of their Court, order and determine all things, not only relating to themselves and their Vassals, but to all others who are lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally within their Territories, both in Civils and Criminals, in so far as they derive Jurisdiction Civil or Criminal from the Soveraign power, immediatly or mediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; no Nation is more exact in this then <hi>Scotland,</hi> wherein the King as Supream Superiour, ruleth by His Vassals assembled in Parliament; in which, at first, all were personally present, who held Lands immediatly of Him, as Barons great and small, Free-holders and Prelats for Church-lands; the free Burghs were also represented in Parliament by their Commissioners, as holding their Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage Lands, and their Freedoms and Priviledges of Burghs, as Feudaters of the King; so that there was not one foot of ground in <hi>Scotland</hi> whose Lord was not present in Parliament.</p>
                     <p>But when Fees holden of the King became sub-divided, or multiplied, two or more Commissioners were admitted in Parliament, in name of the meaner Barons and Free-holders; all were accompted great Barons, who held an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:109710:127"/>
merk Land or above of the King, and the rest meaner Barons, <hi>Par.</hi> 1503. <hi>cap.</hi> 78. So also other Superiours have their Courts, consisting of their Vassals, who are oblieged to answer suit thereto, who as a Jury, gave Doom and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of old, when all matters proceeded by Jury or Inquest, as it was also in the Kings Court by Sheriffs, Bailzies, &amp;c. of which the shadow or formality yet remaineth, of having a Doomster as a member of Court to pronounce sentence, though Inquests be in most things laid aside through custom.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The very right of Superiority carryes this right of Jurisdiction over the Vassals, unless by their Infeftments, or Prescription, they be exempted.</p>
                     <p>Our Learned Countrey-man, Mr. <hi>Thomas Craig</hi> Advocat, hath largely and learnedly handled the Feudal Rights of this and other Nations, in his Book <hi>de Feudis;</hi> and therefore, we shall only follow closely, what since his time by Statute or Custom hath been cleared or altered in Feudal Rights, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much, for he having written in the year, 1600. there are since many Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and variety of cases, which did occur, and were determined by the Lords, and have been, <hi>de recenti,</hi> observed as they were done by the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of the Lords and Lawers, as by <hi>Haddingtoun</hi> who was President of the Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and by President <hi>Spotswood,</hi> and by <hi>Dury,</hi> who continued in the Session from the year, 1620. until his death in the year, 1642. And though these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions have been intermitted since that time, till the Kings return, the loss is not great, these times being troublesome, and great alterations of the Lords; but the Decisions of the Lords have been constantly observed since the Kings return, by which most of the Feudal Questions are determined; and these things which <hi>Craig</hi> could but conjecture from the Nature of the Feudal Rights, the Customs of neighbouring Nations, and the opinion of Feudists, are now commonly known, and come to a fixed Custom; neither doth he observe any Decisions particularly by the time, further then his own time in which our Feudal Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms could little be determined, seing the Lords of Session were mutable and ambulatory, till the year, 1540. in which, King <hi>James</hi> the fifth did perfect the establishment of the Session in a Colledge of Justice, who at first, could not be so knowing and fixed in their forms and customs; and therefore, it cannot be thought strange, if the Feudal Customes as they are now settled, do much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from what <hi>Craig</hi> did observe; he hath indeed very well observed the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine and nature of Feudal Rights, and the Customs of <hi>Italy</hi> where they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> whence they were derived to us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we say little as to these: And so much only of the Rights themselves as must necessarly be introductory to our fixed Customs; in which, we shall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that same Method (as most accommodat to the matter) which we observed in the former Title of <hi>real Rights:</hi> But there being in Feudal Rights, nothing of that original Community which is therein, being only a promiscuous proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Incorporations or persons; or otherways a servitude of common Pastu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, we shall first speak of the Right of property in Fees, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Superiour and to the Vassal. Next of the Servitudes competent in Fees, which comprehending all Rights, not reaching the alienation or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but the lesser interests, extending only to the profits or use of Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, must comprehend both the interest introduced by Law, as Teinds, and these that are by consent, by Infeftments or other grants, or long possession, whether they be personal as Liferents, Conjunct-fees, Terces, and the Right of Courtisie, Annualrents, Pensions, Rentals, Tacks, &amp;c. Or whether real Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitudes,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:109710:128"/>
as Thirlage, Pasturage, &amp;c. And last, Feudal Pledges, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Wodsetts. But in all, we are only here to speak of the constitution of Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal Rights, leaving the transmission thereof to Heirs, or singular Successors, to the next part, <hi>Vide Title</hi> 24. and 27.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The property of all Lands and Immoveables, or Hereditaments, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Allodial or Feudal; Allodial is that, whereby the right is without recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisance or acknowledgement of a Superiour, having a real Right in the thing, thus are Moveables enjoyed; and Lands and Immoveables were so till these Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal Customs; and now there remains little Allodial: For Lands holden Feu or Burgage, or Lands Mortified, are not Allodial, seing they acknowledge a Superiour, having the direct Right of property, and to whom, there must be some Rent or return, though they be not so proper Fees, as Land holden Ward. Yet the Superiours Right in the Soveraign power, is not Feudal, but Allodial here, though some Kingdoms be holden of Superiors as Feudal. So also the Gleibs of Ministers seem to come nearest to Allodials, having no Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holding Rent or acknowledgement, though they be more properly mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Fees, whereof the Liferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escheat befalls to the King only.</p>
                     <p>Kirks and Kirk-yards are only Allodial, without any acknowledgement of a Superiour, but they are destinat for pious Uses, and are ordained to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held and repaired, <hi>Par.</hi> 1563. <hi>cap.</hi> 76. And the Parochioners of every Paroch ar ordained to build and repair Kirk-yard-dykes with Stone and Morter, two els high, and to make Kirk-styles therein, <hi>Par.</hi> 1597. <hi>cap.</hi> 232. The manner of reparing Kirks was remitted to the Council by the said first Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thereupon an Act of Council was made, which is ratified, <hi>Par.</hi> 1572. <hi>cap.</hi> 54. but is not repeated in the Ratification, but only in general, that the Parochioners were warranted to name persons to stent the Neighbours.</p>
                     <p>A Fee signifieth either the right it self, or the thing affected with the Right, whether it be corporeal, as Lands Lochs, Woods, Fortalices, Milns; or incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, as Annualrents, Fishing, Jurisdiction, Pasturage or the like, and at the first, it was freely granted for Fidelity and Military service of the Vassal.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And therefore it implyed, first, That it was a free and gratuitous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as to Money or other anterior cause, and only for fidelity and service. <hi>Secondly,</hi> None could succeed therein, but such as could perform that service, whereby women were excluded. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It could descend to none but to the Male Issue of the first Vassals body, which ceassing, it became void, and could not be transmitted to the Collaterals, or to the Ascendents of the first Vassal. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Whensoever it was open or void by the death of the Vassal Infeft, it returned to the Superiour, until the Vassals Heir were capable of Military Service, which was esteemed to be so soon as he attained Majority. And while it was in non-entry, by the negligence of the Vassal, not demanding Infeftment, but in his Minority, when he was unable to serve, both the Lands and the Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal were in the hands of the Superiour, in Ward and Custody, or of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natar as his Legal Tutor, who was to educat him for his own service, and to intertain him, beside which he had then no other profit of his Fee. And if he married without the Superiours consent, he lost a sum equivalent to that To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, which were suitable to his Quality and Estate: And if contrary his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours will, he refused a suitable Match, he forefaults the double of the Tocher: The reason introductory of this was, because the Superiour might be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the affinity contracted by his Vassal in his marriage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="231" facs="tcp:109710:128"/>In all Fees, fidelity by the Vassal to his Superiour is necessarly implyed, and if any thing were acted contrary to fidelity and gratitude, against the life and fame of the Superiour, to the great prejudice of his Estate or nearest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, the Fee became void; wherein is also comprehended the Vassals dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming of his Superiour, or owning another in his place; or Infefting ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vassal without his Superiours consent.</p>
                     <p>Fees are not only unalienable without consent of the Superiour, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons now adduced; but they are <hi>stricti juris,</hi> and there is no obliegement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Superiour to receive any stranger or singular successor, his Vassal, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what the Law hath introduced by Statute or Custom, in favours of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, for obtaining satisfaction of their Debts, by Appryzings or Adjudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby the superiour may be compelled to receive singular successors: Yet the Disposition procuratory, or precept of seasing before Infeftment are asignable, and the superiour may be compelled to receive the Assigney, if the Disposition be in favours of Assigneys: But Infeftment being once taken, he is not oblieged to receive any Assigney or singular successors, otherways then in obedience of Horning upon Appryzing or Adjudication, getting a years Rent for accepting a new Vassal.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. These being the ancient requisits of Fees; that is a proper Fee which hath them, and the want of any of them makes it Improperin so far, but most of them might always, and now are changed by the Tenor of the Infeftment, as when the Fee is granted to the Vassal and the Heirs of his body; it is so far improper, that women may succeed. If it begranted to him and his Heirs sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, then his Collateral Heirs or Ascendents may succeed: Or if to his Heirs male whatsoever, much more if to the Heirs or Descendents of other persons in Tailzies. Fees are also granted, not for Military service, or service indefinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but for some definite particular service, as for carrying of a Sword or other Ensign of Honour, before the Superiour in solemn days; or not for service at all, but for some Rent, which is either inconsiderable, as a meer acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Superiour, as a penny Money, or a grain of Pepper, a Rose, &amp;c. Or, for a Feu-ferm-duty in Money, or any Fungible, or other performance: Or, when the avail of the Marriage, and profit of the Ward is taxed to such a sum.</p>
                     <p>Hence we may consider, what remains as to the essentials of Fees, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon interests thereof, which are these.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>First,</hi> there must remain a right in the Superiour, which is called, <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minium directum;</hi> and withal, a Right in the Vassal, called, <hi>dominium utile:</hi> The reason of the distinction and terms thereof is, because it can hardly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, that the Right of Property is in either the Superiour or Vassal alone, so that the other should only have a servitude upon it, though some have thought Superiority but a servitude, the property being in the Vassal; and others have thought the Fee it self to be but a servitude, to wit, the perpetual use and fruit, yet the reconciliation and satisfaction of both, hath been well found out in this distinction, whereby neithers interest is called a servitude; but by the resemblance of the distinction in Law, betwixt <hi>jura &amp; actiones di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectae,</hi> and these which for resemblance were reductive thereto, and therefore called, <hi>utiles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Superiors Right is called, <hi>dominium directum,</hi> and the Vassals <hi>utile,</hi> and without these, the Right cannot consist.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="232" facs="tcp:109710:129"/>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> As there must be a right in the Superiour, and another in the Vassal, so the Vassal in his right must necessarly hold of, and acknowledge the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as having the direct Right in the Fee, otherways the two distinct Rights without this subordination, will make but two partial Allodial Rights.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is necessarly implyed in Fees, some Rent or return to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour for the Fee, which may be either service, Money, or other Fungible, or prayers and supplications; as in Fees mortified to the Kirk, or other performance, or at least the Vassals fidelity to the Superiour, implying, not only negative, that he may not wrong the Superiour, but positive, that he must reveal to his Superiour any design against his Life or Fame.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Which fidelity, though it be not exprest, yet it is necessarly imported in all kinds of Fees, and cannot be taken away by any paction to the contrary, without destroying the very nature of this Right.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. To come now to the constitution of the Property of Lands, in Fee and Heretage, the Feudal Contract is of it self alienative as Loan, Sale, Exchange: and the Contracts in Law, ealled, <hi>do ut des,</hi> and <hi>do ut facias:</hi> Of which two last, the Feudal Contract is a kind, seing thereby Land or other immoveable is given, for giving or doing something; therefore, as in others, so in it, the will of the owner must constitute the Right in the Vassal; and seing by the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of Nations, some kind of Possession is necessary to constitute or transfer property, the Superiours delivery of Possession to the Vassal, or acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and approbation thereof in the Vassal, to be holden by him in Fee, were sufficient to constitute and perfect the Fee.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. And therefore, in the Udal Right of Lands in <hi>Orknay</hi> and <hi>Zetland,</hi> whereby without any Infeftment, Investiture or other Right or Write, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Lands and Hereditaments; it sufficeth them to instruct by Witnesses, that they have possest, as being holden and repute Heretable possessors of such Lands; but the Law and Custom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> having, as in all other places, necessarly required Write, not only for evidence of the Constitution of this Right, but as Solemnities for the perfecting and solemnizing thereof, without which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not a compleat real Right of the ground, except where such Writes have been destroyed, or lost in times of trouble, and then proving the Tenor of them, must be used: Or in some cases, the Heretor may be cognosced by an Inquest, as Heretable possessor. But ordinarly Write is requisite, which Writes are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an Infeftment, or an Investiture.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Infeftment or <hi>infeudatio,</hi> signifieth the Right constitutive of a Fee, as its Etymon indicateth: So also, Investiture is the same, more Metaphorically, as we are said to be invested or indued with any right, as men are covered with a Garment or Cloak, and denuded and divested thereof, when it is extinct or transmitted: So both Infeftment and Investiture signifie the Writes, which are evidents, signifying the Act constituting the Fee; and these are two, the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positive Will of the Superiour, and his delivery of Possession by himself or his Procurators in his Name.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Of a long time, Infeftment hath required write as a necessar solemnity, not only as a mean of probation, that the Superiour did truly dispone to the vassal, any immoveable in Fee and Heretage, and that accordingly the vassal attained Possession, Natural, Civil, or Symbolical; for if write were adhibite
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:109710:129"/>
only for probation, other probation might also be admitted, not only against the Superiour, or his Heirs by their Write or Oath, but even against their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular successors, or other Competitors, by whose oath of knowledge or write, the truth of the Infeftment, and of these two necessary Acts, to constitute a Fee, might be proven; and albeit the Superiours oath would not prove against a singular successor, yet his write anterior to that singular successors Right, acknowledging, that he had at such a time invested such a person as his vassal, and entered him in possession, which would prove against his Assigney; yet neither of these ways would constitute a Fee, and supply a written Infeftment, except where the peculiar custom of Fees without write hath been immemorial; and therefore sustained as sufficient: And albeit it be provided by ancient Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, that the Heretable Possessors of Lands may be cognosced by inquest, yet that was only upon consideration of Calamity and War, whereby Writes were destroyed, and where no competition was by any pretending a written Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Possession conform. But the question being only betwixt the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour and his Vassal, who with his Predecessors had been in Immemorial pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, as being holden and repute Heretable possessors, by performing the deeds proper to Vassals of such Lands, and so holden and repute as Heretable Possessors by the Neighbour-hood, which I have not heard to take effect; but as to the Kings immediat Vassals, who claims property in no Lands as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Superiour; but what is annexed to the Crown, or whereof the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is acquired to the King, by the Casualities of his Superiority: Or by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition from other Proprietars; and therefore, he doth never exclude the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Heretable Possessors, though they have losed their Rights by publick ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, wherein- not only Adminicles in Write, but the testimonies of Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses above exception are received, whereby if the Right be not proven to be blench, or Feu by the Exchequer Rolls, which bears all the Kings Property and the Reddendo's thereof; or by Eque's made in Exchequer, the Fee will be held Ward, and according to the probation and verdict of the Inquest, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters will be granted by the King in Exchequer, and there scarce can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendedany Fee, which hath not been already established by write.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The Write requisite to constitute a Fee, must contain the present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positive Act of the Superiour, by which he Dispons to the Vassal and his Heirs the Fee, in whatsoever terms he expresseth it, as if he gift, grant, alienat, sell, or dispone, though the several terms exprest may import a different Title and Warrandice; yea, albeit no Cause or Title be exprest or implyed, but only that the Superiour Dispons; or though the Cause or Title insinuat be not true, yet it was sufficient with Possession until the Solemnity of Instruments of Seasine was introduced, and is still sufficient when Seasine is rightly adhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit; for we follow not that subtility of annulling Deeds, because they are <hi>sine causa,</hi> but do esteem them as gratuitous Donations; and therefore, Narratives expressing the cause of the Disposition, are never inquired in, because, though there were no cause, the Disposition is good: And albeit neither <hi>tenendas, red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo,</hi> or the <hi>modus acquirendi,</hi> be exprest, yet if the property was the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poners, and he do but express the Disposition to be in Fee and Heretage, it is valid; for the <hi>reddendo</hi> is understood to be services, accustomed in Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdings; and there will be carryed (though not exprest) all the parts and pertinents of the Fee.</p>
                     <p>And therefore any Disposition, <hi>de presenti,</hi> in Fee, is valid as to that part of the Infeftment, although the Disposition contained an obliegement to grant Charters; yet the not granting there of doth not prejudge. And if Charters
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:109710:130"/>
be granted relative to prior obliegements, yet the Charter is good, without necessity to prove these. Nor will it be sustained, for the Superiour or any competitor, that if the prior Obligation, Disposition or Contract were produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it would be found conditional, or have Clauses in favours of the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, or that Competitor, whether generally or particularly alledged: But if these were lost, the Charter is sufficient, and no more is understood to be in the real Right, then what is contained in the Charter; yea, though the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bear, according to the provisions and conditions contained in such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, Disposition, or Bond, which may import that the Superiour by granting the Charter without these, hath not past from them; and therefore, he may insist upon them as personal obliegements, and the Vassal will be oblieged to produce the same, <hi>ad modum probationis,</hi> by Exhibition as an incident diligence, whereupon he must Depone, whether he has them or had them since the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or did at any time fraudfully put them away: But if without Fraud, they be lost, the Charter is sufficient, and in no case doth require the production of any former ground.</p>
                     <p>Precepts of <hi>clare constat,</hi> are also sufficient, seing they contain a Precept to Infeft such a person as Vassal, which implys, the Dispositive. Will of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour; and therefore, is valid in place of a Charter from its date, albeit it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Charters granted by the King of Fees by progress, are either upon Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or by Confirmation, or upon Apprizing or Adjudication, which differ from original Charters, in their several specialities, as Chartersupon Resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after the Dispositive Clause, bear the conveyance, <hi>that the Lands or others were resigned in the hands of His Majesty, or His Commissioners, by a Procurato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Resignation a-part, or in a Disposition or Contract expressing its date in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the Acquirer, his Heirs or Assigneys,</hi> whereupon Resignation being made in the Resigners Life, the Charter will be granted to him or to his Heirs, serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed generally, or to his assigneys, having right by Assignation to the Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Resignation.</p>
                     <p>Charters of Confirmation do deduce the Right to be confirmed, which, if it be a Charter <hi>a se,</hi> bearing, <hi>to be holden from the Disponer of the King,</hi> and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the <hi>Tenendas &amp; reddendo.</hi> The Kings Charter doth in the like style, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally relate the Charter to be confirmed, and then Ratifies, Confirms, and approves the same in all the Heads and Articles therein, and then subjoyns the Tenor and Words of the Charter.</p>
                     <p>These Charters of Confirmation whensoever granted, are drawn back to the date of the Charter Confirmed (which were absolutely null till Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) unless there be a <hi>medium impedimentum,</hi> as a prior Infeftment by Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or upon Resignation by the Superiour; yea, though the Infeftment by Confirmation be after the death of the granter of the Charter to be Confirmed, if the Superiour do Confirm, it is drawn back, and will import the Superiours passing from any Casuality, falling by the death of the Author, unless these be reserved, wherein the neglect of the Kings Officers may not be imputed in his prejudice; albeit <hi>Craig</hi> relates a case betwixt <hi>Kirkaldie</hi> of <hi>Grange,</hi> and <hi>Ker</hi> in the contrary, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>Dieges.</hi> 4. and adds this reason, <hi>that the former Vassal gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Charter to be Confirmed, dying before Confirmation, it might be truely said that he dyed last, Vest and Seased as of Fee;</hi> which, the subsequent Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation cannot make false, yet this being <hi>fictione juris;</hi> these fictions
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:109710:131"/>
may do much more then this change, and there is nothing more frequent, then to Confirm very old Charters or Dispositions.</p>
                     <p>There is another kind of Charter of Confirmation by the King, of Charters granted by his Vassals to their Sub-vassals, not to be holden <hi>a se</hi> of the King, but <hi>de se</hi> of the Disponer. The effect of which Confirmation is to secure the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer against the forefaulture, or Recognition of his Superiour.</p>
                     <p>Charters by the King upon Appryzing or Adjudication, do either Narrate the Appryzing or Adjudication, before the Dispositive Clause: Or otherways after the Dispositive Clause, by the Clause beginning, <hi>Quae quidem terrae perpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us haereditarie, pertinuerunt, ad</hi> A. B. &amp;c. Which Clause, is also next to the Dispositive in Charters upon Resignation, and doth express the Resignation made either personally by the Vassal, or more ordinarly by his Procuratory, and then bears, <hi>the procuratory of Resignation and the date thereof:</hi> But if it be upon Appryzing or Adjudication, it bears, <hi>that the Lands and others in the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were Appryzed or Adjudged from the former Vassal or his Apparent Heir, lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Charged to enter Heir in special;</hi> and expresses the date of the Appryzing or Adjudication, and the sums therein-contained, and bears, in the <hi>Reddendo,</hi> the duties and services, due and accustomed before the said Appryzing or Adjudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. The Kings Charters bears as witnesses, <hi>several Officers of State, and director of the Chanclery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Kings Charters must pass in Exchequer upon a signature signed by the King, or by his Thesaurer or Commissioners of the Thesaury, and a <hi>quorum</hi> of the Exchequer; which signature is recorded in the Books of Exchequer, and then passeth under the Signet, and then under the Privy Seal, whose Warrand is the Signature, and last under the Great Seal.</p>
                     <p>Charters by Subjects in most things agree with the Kings Charters, but differ in these points, that they begin not with their Titles, but thus, <hi>Omnibus hanc Cartam visuris vel audituris;</hi> and then follows the Superiours Title or Designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And in original Charters, the special Cause is Narrated, as for Imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a certain contract, Disposition or Obligation, in them also the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randice is more particularly expressed, because it is effectual according to its Tenor.</p>
                     <p>In the Charters granted by Subjects, the Precepts of Seasine were ordinarly ingrossed, and now by the late Act of Parliament, 1672. <hi>cap.</hi> 7th.

                     <p>In the Charters by the King or Subjects, there may and useth to be insert a Clause, <hi>de novo-damus,</hi> which doth Dispone the Fee, as by an original Right, in case the Disponers Right should be found defective, and to secure against any Title proper to the Superiour, either as to the property, or any servitude or casuality; which Clauses use to be very full, and to express <hi>all Nullities, Title, or Interest in the Superiour, with supply of all defects;</hi> and bearing all the particular Casualities, with which the Fee might be burdened, which are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, and extended to the full against Subjects. But as to such Clauses in the Kings Charters, they are fully extended as to all Interest in the King, relating to the Property, such as <hi>Nullities, Forefaulture Recognition, Purpresture, Discla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:</hi> But the general words, <hi>Pro omni jure titulo &amp; interesse,</hi> are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended against the King, to any Casuality of Superiority, not reaching, but burdening the Property, except such only as are particularly exprest; and therefore, a <hi>novo damus,</hi> in a Bishops Charter from the King, Disponing a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, <hi>pro omni jure,</hi> was found to give the Bishops Successor right to that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, though it was a Laik Patronage, without necessity to instruct that the Bishop had any pretence of a Title thereto before, but that the <hi>novo damus</hi> was as effectual as an original Right, <hi>February</hi> 19. 1680. Sir <hi>John Scot</hi> of <hi>Ancrum contra</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Glasgow.</hi> But a <hi>novo damus</hi> by the King, bearing, <hi>pro omni jure titulo &amp; interesse,</hi> and expressing <hi>Ward,</hi> found not to exclude the Kings Donator from the Marriage, as being a Casuality differing from the Ward, which useth to pass by a several Gift 17. day of <hi>July</hi> 1672. Lord <hi>Hatton contra</hi> the Earl of <hi>Northesk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reason of the different extention of the Clause, <hi>de novo damus,</hi> as to the King and Subjects is, because Subjects are presumed to take special notice of all Clauses, that they insert in their Charters, which <hi>in dubio,</hi> are interpret, <hi>contra proferentem.</hi> But these Clauses do more easily pass by inadvertence in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer; and therefore, their Gifts are more regulat by their Acts, then by the common Style thereof. For though Gifts of Ward comprehend Non-entry, ay and while the Entry of the righteous Heir: Yet by act of Exchequer, it is only extended to three Terms after the Ward, though the old Style be still continued.</p>
                     <p>Charters do also comprehend several conditions and provisions, of which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. And some Charters do express a bounding, which is ordinary in these within Burgh. And some do express a particular enumeration. And some have only the general name of Barony, or Tenendry, or some other common Designations, under which, there may be particular Designations comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And some Charters bear, <hi>Infang-thief, outfang-thief, Pit and Gallows.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These Charters, or other Writes in place of Charters, though they do never so fully comprehend the Dispositive Will of the Superiour, yet they never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a real Right, till they be compleated by seasine, which imports the taking of Possession for seasine and seasure are from the same original, signifying laying hold of, or taking possession: And disseasing is dispossession; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is a needless question, whether Seasine or Possession were distinct, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:109710:132"/>
which were most effectual; for till the solemnity of Instruments of Seasine was introduced to accomplish the real Right of Fees, Possession was necessary to be joyned to the Disposition: Which Possession might either be natural by actual Inhabitation, Manuring or Stocking the Ground, <hi>positione sediuni:</hi> Or might be Civil, by uplifting the Fruits and Duties: Or it might be Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, <hi>positione pedum,</hi> by entering upon the Lands as Vassal upon the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Warrand. But if this Symbolical Possession were <hi>retent a possessione naturali,</hi> the Superiour disponing to another who first attained the natural Possession, be would have been preferred to the Symbolical Possession, as being suspect and simulat, <hi>retenta possessione:</hi> Therefore, till the time of King <hi>James</hi> the first, any Charter, Disposition, or Precept from a Superiour to a Vassal, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Heirs, or an Heretable Right, with true and real Possession, without simulation, was sufficient to compleat the Fee. So a Charter with natural Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session was sustained, being in the Raign of King <hi>Robert</hi> the second, <hi>June</hi> 24. 1625. And also before the Raign of King <hi>James</hi> the second, <hi>Hope,</hi> seasine, Earl of Mar <hi>contra</hi> Bishop of <hi>Aberdeen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="16">16. But King <hi>James</hi> the first having been long detained in <hi>England,</hi> being taken in his Voyage coming home from <hi>France,</hi> did thence bring in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of Seasines by the Instrument of a Nottar, about the year, 1530. as <hi>Craig</hi> relateth, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>dieges.</hi> 7. near the beginning, and yet sayeth, that long thereafter, even near to his time, the Bailies Seal upon the Superiours Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, Charter, or Precept, was sufficient to instruct Delivery of Possession.</p>
                     <p>Neither was there necessity in any case to prove the delivery, or the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours Entering the Vassal in Possession, but that was presumed from the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session it self; and therefore, it needs not be debated how the Vassal entered in Possession, or what warrand the Bailzie had to give him Possession, or what warrand the Person who received the possession for the Vassal had, as his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator or Acturney; for if the Vassal were in the Natural and Civil Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; all these powers were presumed. Neither were Precepts of Seasine, or Acturneys then in use; for as this solemnity of an Instrument of Seasine was introduced from <hi>England,</hi> so was the name of Acturney, which is frequent there, but seldom usedhere, but in cases of Seasine.</p>
                     <p>After Instruments of Seasine became in use, they were not only sustained as the mean of probation, that Possession or Seasine was given or taken, but they were the necessary solemnities to accomplish the right which could not be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by any other mean or probation, though the Superiour with a thousand Witnesses, should subscribe all the Contents of a Seasine.</p>
                     <p>It would be of no effect to make a real Right without the attest of a Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, in which sense, the vulgar maxime is to be understood, <hi>nulla sasina nulla terra,</hi> which is not only necessary to the first Vassal, but must be renewed to all his Heirs and Successors; although by the custome of <hi>France,</hi> the Vassal being once Infeft, his Heirs need not be Infeft, but do continue to possess by his Right, as the Heirs of Tacks-men do with us: But every Heir must be Infeft in Fees, otherways, if they die uninfeft, they never attain the real Right, but only a possessory Title to the Fruits and Rents, which will belong to their Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, in so far as unuplifted from their Predicessors death, till their own death, or renunciation to be Heir, and will be affected for their proper Debts, which will not affect the Heritage, or the next Heir entering, who must enter to the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:109710:132"/>
Defunct, who died last Infeft, and will be lyable for his debts, but not for the debts of his appear and Heir, who was never Infeft.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Let us then consider the formal Tenor of an Instrument of Seasine and the meaning thereof, and then consider the essentials and necessary requisites thereto, and how far unformal seasines have been sustained.</p>
                     <p>A formal Seasine is the Instrument of a Nottar-publick, bearing the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Symbolical Possession, by the Superiour or his Bailzie, to the Vassal or his Acturney, by delivery of Earth and Stone, and other Symbols accustomed upon the Ground of the Fee, which should contain the Name of God, as its initial Words, <hi>In Dei nomine, Amen,</hi> that may keep the Nottar in remembrance of his faith and trust, deterring him to take the Name of God to a falshood or lie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It should bear the date by the day, moneth, and year of God, and was accustomed to have the indiction and Name of the Pope, which since the Reformation hath not been in use: But it should contain the Name of the King, and the year of His Raign.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It bears, the appearance of the Vassal, or his certain Aucturney, which is sufficiently instructed, by having of the Precept of Seasine in his hands, which is but <hi>presumptio juris,</hi> and doth not exclude a contrary probation, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as to the Heirs of the first Vassal, who, by taking Infeftment, becomes lyable for all his Predecessors debts; and therefore, if the Superiour should grant a Precept of <hi>clare constat,</hi> the bearer whereof, as Aucturney for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearant Heir, taking Seasine, would involve the appear and Heir in all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers debts; and therefore, it may be proven by the Superiour and Aucturneys oath, that the Precept of Seasine was without warrand from the appearant Heir, and so was fraudulent and collusive, to involve him in his Predecessors debts, in an overburdened and hurtful succession.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It must bear the delivery of the Precept of Seasine to the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, if he be present, or in his absence, to his Bailzie, whose warrand is secured, because there is a blank left in the Precept for his Name, in which blank, any persons name being filled up, he is sufficiently authorized as Bailzie in that part, specially constitute.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It bears, the Bailzies accepting of the Precept, and delivering of it to the Nottar in presence of the Witnesses.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It must bear the Nottars reading of the Precept, and exponing it if it be in Latine, and then the words of the Precept should be Ingrossed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> It bears the Superiour or the Bailzies delivering of Earth and Stone of the Land to the Vassal, or to his Aucturney, bearer of the Precept; Or delivery of any other accustomed Symbol, as a penny for an Annualrent, a Net for Fishing, a Clap for a Miln.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eighthly,</hi> It bears the Aucturneys requiring Instruments.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ninthly,</hi> It must bear, that these things were done upon the ground of the Land, or other Hereditament, and the hour of the day, before two Witnesses, at the least, required thereto,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="240" facs="tcp:109710:133"/>And <hi>last,</hi> The attest of the Nottar, bearing the auctority of his Creation, and that he was present with the Witnesses, &amp; <hi>vidi, scivi &amp; audivi,</hi> that the things contained in the Instrument, were so done as is exprest therein, and that he took a Note thereof, and thereupon drew a formal Instrument, and insert the same in his Protocol, whereunto are adjoyned his Sign, his Motto contained in his Commission, relating to his faithfulness and trust, and his name or the initial Letters thereof.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. If any of these be omitted, the Nottar may be exauctorat and punished by the Lords; but the essentials are much sewer: Yet the Seasine must contain the delivery of symbolical Posession, by the Superior or his Bailzie to the Vassal, or his Acturney upon the Ground of the Land, or other Tenement in presence of the Nottar and Witnesses, with the date and subscription of the Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. But the delivery of the symbol of an Office, having no particular place or ground, is sufficient any where, as a Batton for a Military Office, or a scrol, Book, or Cape for a Civil Office. But where the Fee hath a particular ground or place, there it must be taken upon the ground, and it will not be sufficient to be in view of the ground, yet Law or Custom may otherways order in case of necessity: As the Infeftments of Lands, <hi>in Nova Scotia,</hi> were appointed to be taken at the <hi>Castle-hill</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> And when Lands are rightly Unite or Erected in Barronries, Seasine taken upon any part thereof sufficeth for the whole; and without Union, Seasine taken upon any part of the Lands, will serve for all the Lands in the Infeftment lying <hi>contigue. Craig</hi> relates, that a Seasine was found null and false, where it bore, <hi>These things were done upon the ground of the Land, albeit the parties had put, of the ground of the Land on which they stood, within their Shooes, but were not upon the fixed ground thereof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Instrument of Seasine must be taken by a publick Nottar, lawfully au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized, at the least so holden and repute; for though the Nottar be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it will not vitiat his Instruments, taken <hi>bona fide,</hi> by persons who knew not his deprivation, till it be commonly known, or Letters of publication in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timat at the Mercat Cross. A Seasine was also found null, because it wanted these words, <hi>vidi, scivi &amp; audivi, Hope, Seasine, Primrose contra</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In ancient Rights, or where there is not a more Solemn Infeftment, Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines have been sustained, though with considerable defects, as where the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sine bore <hi>not delivery of Earth and Stone, but only actual and real Seasine, June</hi> 17. 1630.

But if the Seasinebear, to proceed upon a Precept contained in a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, Contract of Alienation or Bond, then these are parts of the Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and make up the real Right, and so must be produced, that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may except or defend upon any clause therein contained, in favours of himself, his predecessors or authors, unless the Infeftments be ancient, and clede with long possession; in which case, it is like the Lords would extend the foresaid Statute, and would sustain a Disposition, Contract or Bond, as a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Adminicle of the Seasine, though it related not thereto. And albeit this Statute mentions only, that Charter and Seasine shall be sufficient, under which a disposition or Contract of Alienation must be comprehended when the Seasine is immediatly taken thereupon, and not upon a formal Charter, for then they are the real Charter: yea, it is not like they would reject a Bond, obliedging to grant such Infeftment, albeit it do not <hi>de presenti</hi> dispone, as a sufficient adminicle to sustain a seasine, where they had been 40 years possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, although prescription was not compleated by immediat subsequent Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines, or uninterrupted possession, the Party making faith, that he did not keep up, or conceal any other part of the Investiture, which would sufficiently take off the presumption of Fraudful concealing or away-putting the immediat war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Seasine, which might afford defences to the other Party.

                     <p>Upon Consideration of this Case, the Lords by act of Sederunt ordained the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, to take sufficient Caution oftheir Town Clerks present, and to come to insert in their books, all Seasines given by them of the Tenements within Burgh and all reversions, or Bonds for granting reversions, assignations thereto, and discharges thereof, renunciations and grants of redemption, and that within 60. dayes after the giving of Seasine, or presenting to them of the reversions or others foresaids, and that under the pain of the damnage of any Party acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>bona fide</hi> for onerous Causes by such Latent rights, though prior, declaring that they will hold all such Seasines, reversions, &amp;c. to be given hereafter, and not insert in the Towns books in manner foresaid, to be Latent and Fraudulent, keeped up of design to insnare lawful purchasers. But there is now an Act of Parliament, requiring the inserting of Seasines within Burgh, in the Town-Clerks Books in the same manner, and under the same certifications as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Registration of Seasines without Burgh.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. And for the further security of Land-rights, because Apprysing, or Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, with a Charge of Horning thereupon against the Superior, maketh for some time, a real right; Therefore, an abbreviat of Apprysings contained in the allowance thereof, written on the back of the same, and signed by two of the Lords, was ordained to be Registrat in a particular Register for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, within 60. dayes after the date of the Apprysing; with certification, that any other Apprysing, though posterior in date, yet first allowed and registrat, shall be preferred, <hi>Parliament</hi> 1661. <hi>cap.</hi> 31. which is extended to Adjudications, <hi>Parliament</hi> 1672. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. But this relates only to the new form of Adjudications then introduced in place of Apprysing. But for the old Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judications, upon there nunciations of Heirs or implement of Dispositions, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Statute nor Custom have yet cleared, whether these will be effectual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst singular Successors from their Dates, or from the Charge against the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, or only from the Seasines thereupon; which, as all other Seasines, must be registrat. And if the Lords do sustain these from the Charge, it will make a defect in the security of Land-rights, till it be supplied by act of Parliament. And for further security of Land-rights, because they might be reduced upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, or Interdictions; Therefore these, if not registrat, are also null. And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect Horning, continuing unrelaxed year and day after the denunciation, the Superior hath the Fee, during the life of the Vassal denunced, therefore hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, if not registrat, is also null, and the act of Prescription excludes all prior rights, preceeding 40. years, unless they have obtained Possession, or done di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence therefore by interruptions, which must be repeated every five years, or else they are null, and must also be execute by a Messenger; so that where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Citation made interruption, which continued for forty years, which might much insecure Purchasers, they can now last but five years, in which short time the noise thereof may readily reach purchasers, so that if purchasers get a progress of Infeftment for fourty years, he may by the Registers know it
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:109710:135"/>
there be any real Right that can affect the Fee within that time, and hath no more to enquire, but as to interruptions within five years, which if the Lords appoint to pass only upon Bills, it may be found at the Signet: So that upon the whole matter, no Nation hath so much security of irredeemable Land-rights as we have. It is true, redeemable rights are not so secure, because they may be evacuat by order of redemption, which proceed by Instruments of premo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and Consignation, which require no registration; and therefore, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasers of Appryzings or Adjudications, during the legal reversion, are in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of any order of Redemption, or Summonds for Count and Reckoning; and likewise, these who purchase Wodsets or Infeftments of property, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nualrent for security of sums, run the hazard of satisfaction and payment of these sums by intromission, or otherways, wherein there is little inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; for no man should purchase a redeemable right, without consent of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verser, but upon his hazard; or if there be any reversion, reservation, or real burden in his authors right, <hi>sibi imputet,</hi> it is his fault and negligence, if he did not see it, and secure himself against it.</p>
                     <p>The Question may occur here, if the Keper of the Register of Seasines do according to the Custom, mark the Seasine Registrat, and attest the same by his subscription, and yet by negligence or fraud, shall not insert it in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister; whether in that case a purchaser, <hi>bona fide,</hi> for causes onerous, though Infeft thereafter, will be excluded by that prior Infeftment, marked by the Clerk, not recorded, though nothing hath been observed in this case: If Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines marked Registrat, though not found in the Register, were found suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient against singular Successors, purchasing thereafter, the designe and tenor of this Statute would be eluded; for the Statute bears, <hi>if they be not Registrat,</hi> (which must import, there being insert in the Register) they are null; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though the Keeper of the Register hath attested such Seasines to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, yet truly they are not Registrat. And no purchaser could be secure by inspection of Registers, if a false attest of a Clerk could exclude him, who oftimes is <hi>insolvent.</hi> But the not inserting of Seasines within Burgh, in the Towns Books, doth not annual them; Seasins within Burgh being a total ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from the whole Act; for Registration and the Statute being defective in that point, the Lords did very fitly supply it by these two remeids; that the Seasins within Burgh, not being in the Towns Books, should not be found null, yet they might be reduced as latent and fraudulent: And if the Town Clerks were put to find Caution for the damage, real Rights within Burgh would be fully as secure as these without Burgh.</p>

But the main question is here concerning Infeftments holden of Subjects, not being past upon the granters resignation, by the Superior, or the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors Confirmation, or by his obedience upon Decreets of Appryzing or Adjudications, which therefore are called base Infeftments, and private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftments, because they proceed in a more private and ignoble way, being done by the granter and receiver thereof, without the interposition of the Superiour.</p>
                     <p>The doubt is, whether such be compleat real rights, carrying the property of the ground by the Charter and Seasine only, or not until possession of the Hereditament be obtained: The ground of this distinction betwixt Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and of the doubt as to base Infeftments, is from the Act of Parliament, 1540. <hi>cap.</hi> 105. Whereby it is clear, <hi>First,</hi> Before that Act, Infeftments hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of the Disponer, without Resignation or Confirmation, were valid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out possession, and preferable to all posterior Infeftments, though proceeding upon Resignation, or by Confirmation, for it is for remeid of this, that this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute is enacted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> By the Letter of this Statute, posterior Infeftments upon Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by Confirmation, are only preferred to prior private Infeftments, when the obtainer of the posterior Infeftment, brooks the Lands peaceably, by La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring, Manuring, and uptaking of the Mails, Profits and Duties, and so are known Heretable Possessors thereof, year and day. And when such Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are for Causes onerous, or do contain or import warrandice; neither is there any thing mentioned in the Statute, as to the competition of Infeftments, upon Appryzing or Adjudication, with prior base Infeftments, nor of the competition of one base Infeftment with another: Yet Custome since that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, hath cleared and determined the competition of publick and base In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftments, and hath restricted this Statute in some points, and extended it in others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Custom hath preferred all publick Infeftments upon Resignation or Confirmation, or upon Appryzing or Adjudication to base Infeftments, though prior, if the base Infeftment hath lain out of all kind of possession; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, hath preferred posterior base Infeftments, first clede with Possession to prior base Infeftments without possession, especially in consideration, that such base Infeftments are fraudulent or simulat, <hi>retenta possessione;</hi> for the retaining of Possession is a pregnant ground of simulation, not only of Infeftments, but many other Rights, as when Moveables are disponed and delivered, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently taken back, and the natural Possession continued in the Disponer, though Instruments be taken upon the delivery; yet other Dispositions or legal Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, attaining and retaining Possession are preferable, because the other Dispositions are presumed fraudulent and simulat. And gifts of single Escheat or Liferent Escheat, are presumed to be simulat, if the rebel or his conjunct and confident persons, be long suffered to retain the Possession; and therefore, base Infeftments, <hi>retenta possessione,</hi> are also presumed fraudulent and simulat, and that not only <hi>presumptione juris,</hi> by this and other Statutes; but <hi>presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one juris &amp; de jure,</hi> admitting no contrary probation: For certainly, base In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftments, may be, and oftentimes have been without simulation, and for one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous causes; and yet these have never been sustained or admitted to probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:109710:137"/>
to validat such base Infeftments: And albeit long retention of Possession may raise <hi>presumptionem hominis,</hi> that publick Infeftments are simulat or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause onerous, yet that presumption hath not been owned by Law.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Custom hath preferred posterior base Infeftments, attaining possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or using diligence to attain it, to prior base Infeftments, not attaining Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesion, nor using diligence to attain it: And albeit the superveening Statute for Registration of Seasines be designed for publication thereof, that purchas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thereafter may not be insnared or disappointed, whereby it might seem that the difference betwixt privat or base Infeftments, and publick Infeftments, might have been laid aside, since the Act for Registration of Seasines, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the uncertainty of real Rights, by proving base Infeftments, cled with Possession by Witnesses (wherein our Law is so justly Jealous and Cautious, that they are not admitted in cases where Write uses to be adhibit) might be avoided: Yet the preserence of publick Infeftments, to prior base Infeftments, not cled with Possession, being fixed by Custom from this Statute, before the Act for Registration of Seasines, by the space of threescore seventeen years, hath been still continued. And such Infeftments as are without consent of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour or order of Law, have still retained the name and nature of base Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and albeit the alledgeance useth sometimes to be proponed against base Infeftments, that they are null, not being cled with Possession, yet it is no simple nullity, but only a preference of a more solemn right, for pursuits for Mails and Duties, Removings, yea, and Reductions are sustained thereupon, and will not be excluded upon pretence of want of Possession, as thereby being null, though they had lain long out of Possession. So a base Infeftment without Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, was found a sufficient Title in a Reduction to inforce production of all other Infeftments, base or publick, albeit the Superiour did not concur, <hi>Spots.</hi> Kirk-men, <hi>Dowglas contra</hi> the Earl of <hi>Home:</hi> And such Infeftments do always exclude posterior Arrestments: They do also exclude the Terce of the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Relict, <hi>January</hi> 27. 1669. <hi>Bell</hi> of <hi>Belford contra</hi> Lady <hi>Rutherford.</hi>

                     <p>Where there is no further ground of Simulation then the want of Possession, very little Possession or Diligence, for Possession will prefer base Infeftments to Posterior publick Infeftments, or to posterior base Infeftments, cled with Possession; as the lifting of one Terms Rent did prefer a base Infeftment to a posterior publick Infeftment cled with many years Possession, <hi>Hope,</hi> alienation, <hi>Hamiltoun contra Mcadam.</hi> And the payment of a small part of Annualrent, far within a Terms Annual, was sustained to prefer a base Infeftment of Annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and it was also preferred, because there was a Decreet of Poynding of the Ground, though not put to Execution, <hi>February</hi> 26. and 27. 1662.

Infeftments by Confirmation, do not only require a Charter from the Disponer, bearing the Lands to be holden of the Superiour, and Seasine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, but require also the Superiours Confirmation, till which it is no real Right, but null; but whensoever the Confirmation is added, the Right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes valid from the date of the Infeftment Confirmed, as to the right of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and as to the Superiours Casualities; and therefore, an Infeftment, <hi>ase,</hi> not confirmed, was found null by exception, though cled with some years pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, <hi>December</hi> 4. 1623. <hi>Patton contra Stuart,</hi> and found null, though the Confirmation was past the Privy Seal, <hi>Hope,</hi> Confirmation, <hi>Hunter contra Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleish.</hi> And also found null in an Annualrent, holden from the Disponer, not Confirmed, <hi>Hope,</hi> Confirmation, Lord <hi>Balmerino contra Coatfield.</hi> But if there were any mid impediment betwixt the Charter Confirmed, and the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; it excludeth the Confirmation and whole right, as an Appryzing and Infeftment.

Feus of Kirk lands by Prelats, or other beneficed persons being granted by consent of their Chapters, with all requisite Solemnities, were esteemed Legal Securities, without any particular Confirmation by the King or Pope, there being no Statute nor Constitution obliging the Subjects thereto: and in case any Confirmation had been requisite, the consent of the Prince, under his proper Seal, and Subscription was sufficient, <hi>Par.</hi> 1593. <hi>cap.</hi> 187.

There is another division of Infeftments, into these which are granted to one Person and his Heirs, and to more Persons and their Heirs, which are of diverse sorts; sometimes as Conjunct-infeftments, and sometimes conceived in favours of Fathers, and after their decease, to Children or relations therein nominat.</p>
                     <p>Conjunct-infeftments are called Conjunct-Fees, whereby the Fee is disponed joyntly to more persons and their Heirs, which may be to three or more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who by the Infeftment, become all Fiars joyntly and equally; whence there ariseth a Communion by which they do possess the Fee, <hi>pro indiviso,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til division thereof be made, which doth not comprehend an Infeftment to an Incorporation, as to a Town or Colledge, or to the use of the Poor, who do not thereby become joynt Fiars, but have only a share of the benefite, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the distribution appointed. These Infeftments are not conceived to Heirs, seing Incorporations are perpetual and die not, neither doth the publick use fail; therefore, such Infeftments require no renovation.</p>
                     <p>Superiours will not easily be induced to accept Resignations from their Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals in favours of Incorporations and publick uses, by which all the Casualities of their Superiority cease; or to grant Confirmations thereof, having the same effect: Nor can they be compelled to grant such Infeftments upon the Vassals Bonds, granted of purpose, that Adjudication may be used thereupon, that thereby the Superiour may be compelled to receive the Incorporation; yea, though without design, an Incorporation should become Creditor to a Vassal in a debt truly borrowed, either from the Incorporation or their Cedent; The question is, whether an Adjudication thereupon might force the Superiour to receive the Incorporation for a years Rent. <hi>Craigs</hi> opinion is in the Negative; and I have not heard such a case come to be debated. And though Custom hath oblieged Superiours to receive man and Wife in Conjunct-Fee, which abate their Casualities, during the life of two persons, the consequence would not be good, to reach to an Incorporation that never dies, though the Act of Parliament introducing Appryzings and Adjudications, be generally in favours of all Creditors: It were more just, that Incorporations should pitch upon a person, and assign their debt to him expresly, to the effect, that the Lands might be adjudged to him and his Heirs, for the use and behove of the Incorporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or such other uses as were designed, which would be effectual against all singular Successors, especially, if the Trust were exprest in the Seasine; but the Superiour would have all his Casualities by the death, neglect or delinquence

The third division of Infeftments, is in respect of the succession, and they are either simple or Tailzied: Simple Infeftments are these which are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to Heirs whatsomever; for by that expression we express the lineal Heirs, who according to Law, would succeed in any Heretable Right: But Tailzied Infeftments are, where the Lands are provided to any other then the Heirs of Line, as when it is provided to Heirs Male, or Heirs Male of the Fiars own Body, or to the Heirs of such a Marriage, or to the Heirs of <hi>Titius,</hi> whilks failzing, to the Heirs of <hi>Seius,</hi> &amp;c. Of these Tailzies, there are many several ways as the Fiar pleaseth to invent, and ordinarily in them all, the last Member or Termination is the Heirs whatsomever, of the last Branch or Person substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, or the Disponer, and when that takes effect by succession, the Fee which before was Tailzied, becomes simple.</p>
                     <p>A Tailzie must necessarly be a part of the Infeftment, for no write apart can constitute a Tailzie, though Bonds or Contracts of Tailzie as personal or incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Rights, may force the Contracter or his Heirs to perfect the same. They must also be constitute by the Superiour, being a part of the Infeftment grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, either originally in the first Constitution of the Fee, or thereafter by Resignation or Confirmation; and as a Superiour is not oblieged to alter the Tenor of the first Investiture, or to accept a Resignation, or grant a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in any case, except where it is provided by Law, whereby he is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitat to receive Appryzers and Adjudgers: So neither in that case is he oblieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to constitute a Tailzie, but only to receive the Appryzer or the Adjudger, their heirs whatsomever, unless the Debt and Decreet, whereupon the same proceeded, be conceived in favours of Heirs of Tailzie; in which case, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzing or Adjudication, and Infeftment thereupon, must be conform, unless it be otherways by consent of parties.</p>

The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof is evident, that such Erections are prejudicial, both to the King, who loseth his Casualities of the Feuars, and to the People, who must accept another Superiour in stead of the King; and though they had formerly but Subjects to their Superiours, yet Church-men were much more easy then se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular persons, as requiring little service, and being ashamed to demand rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Rates; but any man may obtain the Lands he hath in property, holden

mediatly of the King, which were Kirk-lands, Erected in any dignity the King pleaseth to grant.</p>
                     <p>There are many exceptions in the Acts of Annexation of the Temporality of Kirk-lands, and in the Acts against Erections, by which the Kirk-land except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are validly Erected; and all the Erections are so far allowed, as to give the Lords of Erection right to the feu-duties, or fruits of the property of Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, feued till they be redeemed by payment of ten <hi>per cent.</hi> and the Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments granted to the Vassals, <hi>medio tempore,</hi> are valid; but the Casualities ought still to belong to the King. It hath been sometimes questioned, whether the Union and Erection of Lands be dissolved, and lost by an Infeftment of a part thereof, from the Vassal holden of the Superiour by Resignation or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, <hi>Craig, l.</hi> 2. <hi>Dieges.</hi> 7. is for the affirmative, confirmed by the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a Sheaf of Arrows, bound with one Ligament, for if one Arrow be pulled out, all become louse, and so the Union of the whole is dissolved, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Superiour give the new Infeftment, but prejudice of the rest. But though such cases frequently occur, whereby Infeftments of <hi>discontiguous</hi> Lands would only be valid, as to the <hi>contiguous</hi> Lands upon which they were taken; yet in no competition or other Process, hath it been observed by any to be drawn in question or decided. so that we have ever rested in the Negative, and the consequence from that resemblance is not sufficient; But on the contrary, he who unites many Discontiguous Lands, unites every part of them to every part, so that the taking off of one part dissolves only it self, the rest remaining unite. But Union or Erection doth not change the Jurisdiction of the Lands unite, as to the Shires and Bailziries where they naturally ly, <hi>Vide Tit. Confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, §.

                     <p>Barronies and United Tenements, when they are originally granted, ought to express the several Tenements, according to their proper Designations, and so expresly Unite them: But when these are acknowledged to have been Baronies, or otherways Unite, or are named, or defigned as such by these who have power to Unite, then the common Name of the United Barony or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement, is sufficient to carry all that is holden and repute, as part and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents thereof; which was extended to Lands, as parts of a common Designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though some particulars were named, and the Lands in question had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so proper names, and were exprest in the ancient Infeftments, the right in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion being an Appryzing, <hi>March</hi> 23. 1622. <hi>Gallowsheils contra</hi> Lord <hi>Borthwick.</hi> Union and Erection are as qualities of the real Right, and pass unto singular Successors, as is before exprest.</p>
                     <p n="46">46. Warrandice is either real, when Infeftments is given of one Tenement in security of another, or personal, when the Superiour obliegeth himself to warrand the Infeftment; as to the warrandice by Disposition and Resignation, it is unquestionably personal, and cometh not within the Infeftment; but though it be granted by the Superiour in the Infeftment, yet it is but a personal obligation, no ways co-hering, nor carried with the real Right; and therefore, the singular Successor of the Superiour or Author, is not oblieged in the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randice, neither doth the Disposition or Infeftment from the Vassal, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his singular Successor, the right of the Warrandice, unless it be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed specially, or generally in the Assignation of the Rights and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
                     <p>Warrandice is a common obliegement, both in Infeftments and other Rights,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:109710:146"/>
and it is sometimes exprest, and then it is regulat according to the Tenor of it, whether it be absolute Warrandice, or from fact and deed, or from future or voluntary fact and deed. But oftimes when Warrandice is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest, it is implyed as Rights are to be warranted, which are granted for an Equivalent Cause onerous: But in that Case, where the Disposition was only of all right the Disponer had, the Clause inferred not absolute Warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, but only from the Disponers future voluntary Deed, <hi>Hope,</hi> Warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, Lord <hi>Sinclar contra Creighton.</hi> Absolute Warrandice is also implyed, where the Disposition or Infeftment bears (<hi>Vendidit</hi>) because that imports an equivalent Price, <hi>Spotss.</hi> Warrandice, <hi>John Stewart contra Fivie.</hi> But not so, if it were exprest under the terms of Alienation, which is common to both gratuitous and onerous Dispositions.</p>
                     <p>Warrandice from the future fact and deed of the Disponer and his Heirs, is implyed in pure Donations, <hi>Hope,</hi> Warrandice, <hi>Veatch contra Dauling,</hi> Mr. <hi>Partrick Schaw contra</hi> Sir <hi>James Durham,</hi> and was extended to a Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <hi>rei alienae scienter legatae, June</hi> 16. 1664. <hi>Murray contra</hi> the Executors of <hi>Rutherfoord:</hi> But ought not to be extended to future necessar deeds, preceeding the gratuitous Disposition, which the Disponer is, or may be, compelled to fulfil; neither upon any anterior deed, because, he who disponeth freely, is presumed but to dispone such right as he hath, but posterior deeds are fraudulent. It is <hi>Craig's</hi> opinion in the forecited place, that though Warrandice from fact and deed be exprest, that it doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to prior deeds: And that in any Case, if the Cause of the Disposition be for service done, for gratitude, or merit, that Warrandice is implyed; much more, if for future Service, or for a feu Duty, or Rent: Yet, if beside these, there be not an Anterior Cause in Money, or Value, such Dispositions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accounted onerous; for former merit or gratitude, infer no civil Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and so no burden which could receive Legal compulsion. And as to annual Prestation in Services, Feu-duties, or Tack-duties, if they bear no Money received, or equivalent Value, they are presumed to be gratuitous in favours of the receiver, who may reject or renounce them when he pleaseth, if they be not by mutual Contract: And when they are evicted, the Vassal is free of these Duties, and hath no loss; and therefore they ought to import no more Warrandice, but from future voluntary fact and deed; But whatever Warrandice be exprest, must be accordingly observed: But <hi>Craig's</hi> opinion being, that naked Pactions were not effectual with us, and that a Charter was but a naked Paction; so Warrandice in an Innominat Contract, such as a Fee, could be but a naked Paction, importing no further then what would arise from the nature of the Right. But our constant Custome allowing all Pactions and Promises to be effectual, doth both make Charters without Seasine effectual against the granter, and likewise Warrandice, and all other Clauses-therein; yea, the paction, that nothing should be demanded in case of Eviction, is for the same Cause effectual, that the Money payed for the Right evicted, cannot be recovered: Yet <hi>Craig</hi> doth there report a Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords, betwixt <hi>Samuel Cockburn</hi> and <hi>Sandielands</hi> of <hi>Calder,</hi> that a Charter without Seasine, and not delivered in the Granters Life, but reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of the Charter-chest of <hi>Torphichen,</hi> was found effectual to make the Granters Heir perfite the same with Seasine; but it did not remain in the hands of the Granter, and thereby it appears, that the Lords did not then look upon Charters as naked Pactions.</p>
                     <p>The Effect of Warrandice is, the upmaking of what is warranted, in so far
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:109710:147"/>
as it is evicted, and the ordinar procedure in it is, when any Sute is moved, whereon Eviction may follow, Intimation is made to the Warrand of the Plea that he may defend: And if Eviction follow, and distress thereby, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarator of distress, and action of Warrandice for relief is competent. Also it is effectual for decerning the Warrand to free the thing warranted of that which will undoubtedly infer a distress, though it hath not actually done it. In this case Execution was superceeded for a time, that therein the ground of the distress might be purged, <hi>July</hi> 1. 1624.

And if the Warrandice be not absolute, the Purchasers hazard was the greater: But in Warrandice of personal or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable Rights, the matter is ordinarly liquid, and there is no design of hazard but an absolute relief.

And it was lately found, that where a Creditor had given a blank Assignation to a Cautioner, who had payed him with absolute Warrandice, that as to the Cautioner, to whom it was gratuitous for the Creditor to give such a Warrandice, importeth not the sufficiency of the Debitor, <hi>July</hi> 16. 1663. <hi>William Hay contra Nicolson</hi> and <hi>Mitchel.</hi> It was also found, that abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Warrandice in an Asignation, bearing that the samine should be good, valid and effectual, was not found to extend to the Solvency of the Debitor; but only that the Debt could not be excluded by any legal Exception, either from the cedents deed or otherwise; as if the write Assigned had been false, the cedent not being accessory, null, or declared a publick Debt, <hi>November</hi> 24. 1671.

                     <p>The intent of Absolute Warrandice being only against legal eviction, it doth not extend to every burden that may affect the Land, as to a servitude of Pasturage, Fewel, Feal or Divet, Or to a Thirlage of the Land to the Miln of the Barrony, paying the ninteetnh Corn, <hi>June</hi> 21. 1672. <hi>Sandelands contra</hi> Earl of <hi>Haddingtoun.</hi>

                     <p>Absolute Warrandice is sometimes general, and sometimes special, against Ward, Relief and Non-entry, &amp;c. with a general Clause, and all other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, perils and inconveniences whatsoever, as well not named, as named, &amp;c. as to which, the general Clause is not to be extended above the greatest of the special. But the question ariseth, if such Clauses will reach subsequent Wards or Marriages of the Superiour, or to future Porefaultures, or Recognitions, Non-entries, Liferent-escheats, &amp;c., It is certain that whatever of these burdens besal by the fault of the Warrand, he must be lyable therefore.</p>
                     <p>Absolute Warrandice being much stronger then Warrandice from Fact and Deed, which reacheth not only to Facts of Commission, but even to ommission of Duties; and therefore, if the Warrandice be but by the Authour, and not by the Superiour, these subsequent distresses will not reach the Author, unless the Clause bear expresly, <hi>such distresses past, present or to come;</hi> and so though the fee were extinct by the Forefaulture or Recognition of the Superiour, or burdened by his Non-entry, or remaining at the Horn, these occurring after the Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition will be upon the hazard of the Acquirer, and not the Authour Dispon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: But if the Warrandice be in the Superiours Charter, burdening himself, it will be extended to all subsequent Distresses through his fault, and so to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition, Liferent-escheat or Non-entry, but it will not extend to the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulture, or Recognition, or other fault of the Superiours Superiour: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it extend to the Ward or the avail of the Marriage of the Superiour bound in Warrandice, failing thereafter, unless it be so exprest; for no provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man is presumed to guard against these, unless it be so exprest; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there is little advantage by special Clauses of Warrandice: For the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Clauses reaches all Evictions from anteriour Causes, yea, the effect is the same, though there were no Clause of Warrandice exprest, if the Right war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted be for Causes onerous, <hi>viz.</hi> sums of Money, or equivalent value, unless by the special Warrandice, future deeds inferring eviction, or which would not infer, it <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> be exprest.</p>
                     <p>Warrandice is never inferred from Infeftments from the King, as Supream Superiour, and though they were exprest, would have no effect; neither are the Warrandices of Infeftments by Church-men effectual against their Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors in Office; yea express Warrandices of Feus or Tacks of Kirk-lands there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after

                     <p n="53">53. Infeftments are also sometimes burdened with the Exception of other Infeftments, which Exceptions, if they be in the Dispositive Clause, as a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon the Infeftment, they are effectual against singular Successors.</p>
                     <p n="54">54. Infeftments are also frequently burdened with Faculties or Powers to affect or burden the Lands, or others Disponed, and that either absolutely at the Disponers pleasure, for such sums to Children or Creditors; which Clauses are frequent in the Dispositions by Fathers to their eldest Son, and are very amply Interpret against them and their Heirs, though the way of burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing might have been defective, as by a base Infeftment, not cled with Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or by Bonds of Provision, though no Infeftment follow, as was found in the case of the Relict of <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Carnwath contra Gavin</hi> Earl of <hi>Carn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wath.</hi> And a Disposition by a Father to his Son, witha power to burden with such a sum, a Bond granted thereafter to his Daughter, without mention of that power was found effectual against the Son, in so far as was not satisfied with the Fathers Moveables, <hi>June</hi> 24. 1677. <hi>Margaret Hopringle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra George Hopringle,</hi> though these might be more strictly Interpret in the case of singular Successors, acquiring for onerous Causes. And in the case of the Creditors of <hi>Mouswal contra</hi> the Children of <hi>Mouswal,</hi> who having Disponed his estate to his eldest Son by his Contract of Marriage, reserving a power to himself to burden it with such a sum to his Bairns, having given them Bonds of Provision with a base Infeftment, the same was preferred without Possession, by vertue of the reservation to the posterior publick Infeftments of the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors for prior Debts, seing he had then an Estate sufficient for all his Debts, and his Bairns Portions.</p>
                     <p>It is no less certain that all the Clauses contained in Infeftments are not real burdens, affecting singular Successors, such as Warrandice, which only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liegeth the Warrand and his Heirs, and is meerly personal; so then the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty remains, what Clauses insert in Infeftments are real burdens, effectual against singular Successors; First then, If the Infeftment bear a provision that the person Infeft shall pay such a sum or do such deeds to a third party, this will import but a personal obliegement, and will not affect singular Successors.</p>
                     <p n="55">55. But if the Dispositive Clause be expresly burdened with payment of such a sum to the Author, or bear, <hi>that upon that condition the Infeftment is granted, and no otherwaies,</hi> such a Clause was found effectual against a Singular Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, bearing only a Provision in the Dispositive Words, <hi>that the Lands should be affected with such a sum, and was sustained against an Apprizer, November</hi> 7. 1676. <hi>Caucham contra Adamson,</hi> here there was a Clause irritant in the Disposition, but was not in the Charter.</p>
                     <p n="56">56. Provisions or Conditions in Infeftments, impossible or unlawful, if they be conceived as suspensive Clauses annexed to the Disposition, they annul the same: But if there be Provisions otherways adjected, though they be in the Terms of a Clause irritant or resolutive, they are void as not adjected.</p>
                     <p n="57">
                        <pb n="271" facs="tcp:109710:149"/>57. Provisions also inconsistant with the Nature of the Right, are ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, as if it were provided that the Vassal should not owe fidelity to his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, or that the Right should be valid by the Charter without Seasine, these Provisions are inconsistent and null.</p>
                     <p n="58">58. It is much debated amongst the <hi>Feudists,</hi> whither Clauses, <hi>de non alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando,</hi> with an irritancy or resolutive Clause, or that the Fiars should contract no Debt, by which the Fee might be alienat, or the Tailzie changed; and they are generally for the Negative, that a Clause prohibiting contracting of Debt, or simply not to alienat, are inconsistent with Property, albeit they may be effectual if so qualified. That no alienation be made, or debt contracted to affect the Fee, or alter the succession without consent of the superiour, or such other persons; but that being absolute, they cannot be effectual against singular Successors, whereas these limited prohibitions resolve but in Interdictions, and being contained in the Seasines registrate, they are equivalent to Interdictions, published and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, though many such Clauses have been in Tailzied Infeftments, yet none of them have come to be debated, but that which was in the Tailzie of the Estate of <hi>Stormont,</hi> Tailzied to <hi>Annandails</hi> Heirs Male of his Body, whilks fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to <hi>Balvaird</hi> and his Heirs, with a Clause not to annalzie or to contract any debt, or do any deed whereby the Lands might be taken from the Heirs of Talzie, otherwise the Contraveener should <hi>ipso facto,</hi> loose his Right; and the next person who would be Heir, should have Right, which being at length contained in the original Seasine, and all the subsequent Seasines was found effectual to annual the Right of <hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>Annandail,</hi> who contraveened, and of all his Creditors who apprized for his debt, <hi>Febru.</hi> 26. 1662. Viscount of <hi>Stormont contra</hi> Creditors of <hi>Annandail.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Other Clauses irritant, consisting with the nature of the Right, are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al against singular Successors, as the taking the Name and Arms of a Family.</p>
                     <p>And generally, all real burdens of Lands contained in Infeftments, though they give no present Right to these in whose favours they are conceived, nor cannot give them any Fee of the Lands, yet they are real burdens, passing with the Lands to singular Successors, though they bind them not personally, but the Ground of the Land by Appryzing or Adjudication, as if Lands be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned with the burden of an Annualrent furth thereof, to such a person and his Heirs, this will not constitute the annualrent, but may be a ground of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging an Annualrent out of the Lands.</p>
                     <p>In all these cases, Purchasers by voluntary Disposition, are presumed and ought to see their Authors Rights, at least a progress of fourty years, whereby they may know such Clauses and consider them in the price, or otherways se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themselves against them.</p>
                     <p>But in the only Decision of this matter concerning the Tailzie of the Estate of <hi>Stormount</hi> which did pass with great difficulty, the Lords being near equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divided, special consideration was had, that the Clause irritant; <hi>de non alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando,</hi> was expresly set down in the first and subsequent Seasines of Heirs, whereby Creditors were certiorat of their hazard, if they should lend their money, that they could expect no security threfore by that Estate, seing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the borrowers Right became void; and therefore, such Clauses or any other
<pb facs="tcp:109710:150"/>
Clauses irritant, or conditions that might evacuat infeftments, or deeply bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the same, when they are not particularly exprest in the Seasine, may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be quarrelled by anterior Creditors, but also by posterior Creditors, as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and fraudulent Clauses to insnare Creditors, who having no mean to know such Clauses, do contract and lend sums of Money to persons whom they see standing Infeft in considerable Estates of Land.</p>
                     <p>Clauses <hi>de non alienando,</hi> or <hi>non contrahendo debitum,</hi> are most infavourable and inconvenient, specially when absolute; for first Commerce is thereby hindered, which is the common interest of Mankind. Secondly, the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Obligations of providing Wives and Children are thereby hindered, which cannot lawfully be omitted. Thirdly, It is unreasonable so to clog Estates, descending from Predecessors, and not to leave our Successors in the same free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that our Predicessors left us, whereby, though they have the shadow of an Estate, yet they may become miserable, as if they should happen to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Captivity, or in any Transgression that would infer a considerable fine, against which no such Clause can secure, then being disabled to borrow, they behoved to be denunced to the Horn, and thereby their Liferent Escheat fall to their Superiour, which no such Clause can prevent; and therefore, if any man have ground to suspect the frugality of his Successor, he may provide a part of his Estate by a Tailzie, disabling that Successor to contract debt without the consent of such persons in which he confides, leaving some part of his Estate to his diseretion.</p>
                     <p>For such a Clause irritant being in the Seasine published by Registration, may be sustained as equivalent to an Interdiction; such Clauses are also much more tollerable in Lands acquired by the Fiars own industry, wherein if there be insert a Tailzie with a Clause, <hi>de non alienando,</hi> to be insert in the Original, and all subsequent Seasines, and bearing <hi>Provisions for the Wives of Successours, not exceeding such proportion of the Fee, and for Children only to affect such a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Free Rent:</hi> Or if persons having no near relations of value, prefer others of their Name or Kin to their Estates: Or in case of mutual Tailzies, such Clauses limited as aforesaid, may be much more tolerate.</p>
                     <p>But Clauses of that nature have never been attempted, but in proper Tail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies where they are diverse nominat Branches, which are neither Heirs of Line, nor Heirs Male to one another; and where the main design is to preserve the Tail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie, for when all the Branches are of far relation, the preference of the first is not much above the rest; and therefore, the other Branches have by such Clauses, <hi>jus acquisitum,</hi> and are not simply Heirs, but partly Creditors to the first Branch; and therefore, though there were no Clause irritant, they might reduce alienations meerly gratuitous or fraudulent, especially when done not by the Heirs of Line or Heirs Male of him who constitute the Tailzie, for these are always in every Tailzie in the first place, and while the Fee continues in them, it is rather a simple Fee then Tailzied, as it becomes again, when all the Branches of the Tailzie fail.</p>

alienate or burdened, but remains alimentary for preservation of the Dignity of that Family.</p>
                     <p>But these perpetuities in <hi>England</hi> are now easily evacuat; First, by War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands to sell, purchased in Parliament, which pass without much difficulty; and if they become frequent with us, it is like we will find the same remeid: they are also evacuat by a simulat Action of fine and recovery, whereby the purchaser pretends that he is unwarrantably dispossest of such Lands by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Fiar, who coludes and is silent, having received a Price or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, so that these Sentences, though Collusive, must be irrevocable.</p>
                     <p>In Tailzies, the Heirs Male or Heirs of Line of every Branch, being the Issue of the Stipes of that Branch, do succeed; and therefore, there is a good Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> that after the possibility of Issue is extinct, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Fiar, can do no more as to the Fee, but what a Liferenter could do. The next Branch being ordinarly altogether strangers to that Fiar, little care will be taken to preserve the Fee.</p>
                     <p>In the Tailzie of <hi>Stormount,</hi> the whole Estate was not comprehended, and it was distinctly provided, that in case any of the Heirs of Tailzie for the time should contraveen, that the Right should be divolved on that person who would succeed, if the contraveener were dead: But in such Tailzies, formerly it was not so clearly ordered, being only provided, that the contraveener should lose his Right, and the next Heir of Tailzie should have place, whereby it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained dubious, whether the next Branch of the Tailzie were meaned, so that the contraveener losed his own Interest, and all descending of him: Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he losed the Interest of all descending of that Branch: Or whether he losed only his own personal Interest, wherein the design of the Constituter of the Tailzie might be dubious enough.</p>
                     <p n="59">59. To sum up this important Subject of Tailzies, let us consider the effects thereof, according to the several ordinary Tenors of the same, and how far the Fiar or his Heirs of tailzie is bound up thereby; we must then distinguish betwixt Tailzies having Clauses not to alter, burden or alienat: And these that are simple without any express restrictive Clause. Secondly, Betwixt Tailzies made freely, and these that are made for onerous Causes. Thirdly, Betwixt these that have Clauses resolutive or irritant, and these that have only such Clauses by way of Obligation, Provision or Condition.</p>
                     <p>As to the first Case, It is a general Rule, that <hi>quisque est rei suae moderator &amp; arbiter,</hi> every man may dispose of his own at his pleasure, either to take effect in his life, or after his death, and so may provide his Lands to what Heirs he pleaseth, and may change the Succession as oft as he will, which will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated by Resigning from himself and his Heirs in the Fee in favours of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and such other Heirs as he pleaseth to name in the Procuratory, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Resignation being accepted by a Superiour, and new Infeftment granted accordingly, the Succession is effectually altered; yea any obliegement to take his Lands so holden, will obliege the former heirs to enter, and to denude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for Implement of that obliegement, in favours of the heirs therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest; and if the Superiour refuse to accept the Resignation, altering the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, a Bond of borrowed Money, though granted only upon design to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Succession, will be the ground of Adjudication of the Land, and being assigned to the Fiar himself, and to such heirs as he pleaseth, the Superiour will
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:109710:152"/>
be forced to receive him accordingly; so that the first constituter of a Tailzie, or any heir succeeding to him may change it at their pleasure, unless the Tail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie be for an onerous Cause, as when Tailzies are mutual, then the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutors of the mutual Tailzies cannot alter the same, although their Debts may affect the same; yet no fraudulent or gratuitous deed can alter or evacuat such Tailzies; and therefore, a mutual Contract betwixt two brethren, oblieging them, that what Lands they should succeed to, or acquire, should be taken to the Heirs of their body, whilks failzing, to the Brother and the heirs of his Body, &amp;c. though thereafter either Brother took their Lands, otherways to their heirs whatsomever, whereby Sisters having succeeded to one of these bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they were decerned to denude themselves in favours of the other Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>January</hi> 14. 1631. Mr. <hi>John Sharp contra Helen Sharp.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the Cause onerous be of less import, then to grant and continue a Tailzie, it will import no more then once perfecting the Infeftment by such a Tailzie, whereby the hope of Succession ariseth to these parties in whose favours the fiar is oblieged to take the Tailzy, but he was not found oblieged to continue the same, but that he might alter it thereafter, without refounding the Money he got for granting it, being but of that value, as was equal only to the hope of Succession, which behoved to be understood of alteration, <hi>sine dolo, July</hi> 15. 1636.

                     </p>
                     <p>Heirs of Provision by Contracts of Marriage, are in part ouerous, being granted for a Tocher, and the interest of the Wife concerned; therefore, they cannot be alterred by the Husband at his pleasure, but do exclude all fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, or meerly gratuitous alterations, as hath been shown, Section fourty three.</p>
                     <p>But if there bean express Obliegement not to alter the Tailzie, albeit that will not give Title to the Heirs of Blood of the present Fiar, to quarrel his deed or alteration; yet it will give interest to any other Branch of the Tailzie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the person nominat or his heirs, to quarrel and reduce such alterations, though it will not exclude alterations by Appryzing or Adjudication, for debts truly borrowed by the Fiar; and therefore, a Tailzie of a sum of Money, lent in thir terms, to be payed to the Creditor and the heirs of his Body; whilks failing, to the Father and the heirs of hsi Body; whilks failing, to a person named and his heirs and assigneys whatsomever, with a provision, that the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor and his heirs should do no deed hurtful to the Tailzie, nor the Debitor should not pay without consent of the heir of Tailzie named, was found to give interest to that person as heir of Tailzie, to declare that the sum was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantably uplifted, or payed without his consent or order of Law, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing it to be imployed in the same terms, and that though he was heir of Tailzie to the uplifter, that he was not oblieged to fulfil his deed or warrand his Discharge, being contrair to the terms of the Tailzie; as to which terms he was Creditor, reserving always to lawful Creditors, how far they could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the sum for the Fiars Debt, <hi>February</hi> 3. 1674. <hi>Drummond contra Drummond.</hi> And a Clause in a Bond, whereby a Woman oblieged her self to resign Lands in favours of her self and the heirs of her Body, whilks failing, to the heirs of her Father, and oblieging her self to do nothing contrary to that successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereupon Inhibition was used before her Marriage, was found effectual against her and her Husband whom she Married thereafter, and Disponed the Lands to him and his heirs, asbeing a voluntary deed, without an equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

                     </p>
                     <p>Yet these restricting Clauses without irritancy, though conceived as Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions or Conditions, if they be not in the Investiture, albeit they be in prior Obligations, Dispositions or Contracts, there is no pretence thence to affect the Fee as a real burden, and even though they be contained in the Investiture, seing Clauses irritant uses to be added thereto, they are understood to be but personal Obliegements, whereupon no diligence having followed, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be effectual against singular Successors, whether by Legal or Voluntary Dispositions: And as to such restrictions with Clauses irritant, we shall add no more thereunto, then what hath been said.</p>
                     <p>Property being thus Constitute by Infeftment, it is to be considered what are the particulars it comprehends and implys, though not exprest, wherein this is a general Rule, that Lands being Disponed with part and pertinent, all is carried thereby that falls under the Denomination of the Lands Disponed, <hi>a caelo ad centrum,</hi> and all that in the time of the Disposition was accustomed to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, not only as servitudes, but even discontiguous parcels of Land which were not known, as <hi>distincta tenementa,</hi> or parts of any other Tenement, except what the Law reserves, or the express provision of the Superiour.</p>
                     <p n="60">60. The Law reserves all these things which are called <hi>regalia,</hi> or <hi>Jura pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica,</hi> which the Law appropriateth to Princes and States, and exempeth from privat use, unless the same be expresly granted and Disponed by the King; and if the Superiour be a Subject, if he have any of these <hi>Regalia</hi> from the King, they remain with his Superiority, unless he expresly Dispone them to his Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, the Superiour may have them from the King, either expresly in any Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement holden of the King, or tacitly, when Lands are erected by the King, to him in a Barrony, or any higher Dignity, whereby many of these <hi>regalia,</hi> are comprehended. <hi>Barronia</hi> being <hi>nomen Universitatis,</hi> yet that will not comprehend,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Mines and Minerals of Gold or Silver, or Lead of that fineness, that three half-pennies of Silver may be fined out of the pound of Lead, which Mines are declared to belong to the King, wherever they can be found, <hi>Par.</hi> 1424. <hi>cap.</hi> 12.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Neither do Treasures found in the Ground belong to the Kings Vassals, though their Lands be erected in Barronies, unless they were exprest. A Treasure is Money hid in the Ground, the owner whereof is not known.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though all Proprietars have the priviledge of Fowling within their own Ground, yet Swans are peculiarly reserved to the King; and therefore, the priviledge to kill Swans, is not carryed under the name of Barrony, unless they were particularly exprest.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Confiscat Goods are not carried, even under the name of Barrony, unless they be exprest.</p>
                     <p n="61">61. Yet there are other <hi>regalia,</hi> which are carried under the name of Barrony, though not exprest, as Jurisdictions and Courts, Fortalices, Salmond Fishing, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:109710:153"/>
and Hunting of Deer; and Ports with their pettie Customs, established by the Kings grant, or long Possession, for repairing and upholding these Ports; which therein differ from Creiks or Stations, which are natural; but Ports are builded artificially, and need reparation.</p>
                     <p n="62">62. Jurisdiction and Courts are comprehended in Barrony, in so far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Civil Jurisdiction and Blood-wits, or lesser Crimes, but will not reach to Capital Punishment, unless the same be exprest, as it uses to be when the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Pit and Gallows are exprest, or Out-sang and In-sang Thief, which seems to extend to the punishing of no more Crimes but Theft; and these who have only In-sang Theft, can only punish Thieves taken in the Fact.</p>
                     <p>Though Courts be exprest, they will extend to nothing Criminal, no not to Blood-wits, unless these be exprest; but only to Civil Debates requisite for the Propriatar, as to determine differences amongst his Tenents, Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, Multars and smaller Matters; or to constitute a Baily, who may judge betwixt the Propriatar and his Tenents, as to his Rents, Duties and Services; and also may determine differences amongst his Tenents.</p>
                     <p>But all Jurisdiction is Cumulative with, and not Exclusive of the Superiors Jurisdiction, so that there is place of Prevention. The first Atatcher, if he proceed is preferred: and if the Superior and Vassall atatch together, the Superior is preferred.</p>
                     <p n="63">63. The Courts of Vassals, though they be Barrons, and have the Priviledge of Capital Punishment, are not of the same Extent and Importance, as the Sentence of the Judges ordinary of the Kingdom; such as Sheriffs, Stewarts, Bailiffs of Royaltie, Regality and Burghs. For first, The extent of their Jurisdiction is not so ample. Secondly, The Jurisdiction of all Barrons and Free holders, was of old subordinat to the Sheriffs and other Judges ordinary, within whose Jurisdiction the Lands lay, <hi>Par.</hi> 1503. <hi>cap.</hi> 95. And then there was place for falsing of Doom, or appeal to the Sheriff-court, who was to warn the Parties upon fifteen days, and make the Suiters of the Sheriffdom Ward thereupon. Whereby it appears, that the Free-holders of the King, who owed Suit to the Sheriff-court; at least an Inquest of them were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with the Sheriff in discussing the appeal from the Baron or Free-holder: But now these Appeals or falsing of Dooms from any Court to another, have been antiquated, and wholly in desuetude since the Introduction of Advocati ons, which is a far more excellent remeed; for thereby Causes are not stopped at the choice or humor of parties: But the reasons of Advocation are specially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered by the Lords, whether they be relevant, and have such Instructions as can be expected before discussing; and the Subjects are further secured by the late Act of Parliament, that poinding cannot proceed without a charge be given and expired, which in all Decreets, proceeding upon Citation, requires fifteen days: In which, address may bemade to the Lords. Thirdly, Decreets of Barons have no Execution by Horning, which goeth of course upon the Decreets, Precepts and Executions of other Judges ordinary; so that all the Execution upon their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, is only poinding, or corporal Punishment. As to which, if there be any process for Capital Punishment, the Lords will very easily grant Advocation, as they do advocat Causes from Inferiour Judges, not only upon Incompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, but upon Intricacy and Importance: So there being nothing more Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant then the life of Man, they would easily advocat such Processe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:109710:153"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:109710:154"/>
                        <pb n="277" facs="tcp:109710:154"/>
Barons should not proceed summarily to Execution. But both they and other Inferiour Judges ordinary, should after Sentence at least abide Terms of Law by the space of fifteen days, that the Lords may give remeed by Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or Suspension of Execution: For though the Lords have not Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Jurisdiction, they do ordinarly advocat, and by the same reason may sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend Criminal Processe, to the effect the same may be remitted to competent and unsuspect Judges; so that if there were any doubtfulness in the case, the Lords would remit the Cause to the Justices. Fourthly, The Courts of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons or Free-holders are not Courts of record, in which writes use to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat.</p>
                     <p n="64">64. As the Courts of Barons and Free-holders have these Restrictions more then the Inferiour Judges, so they have this advantage ordinarly, that all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Issues of their Courts belong to themselves; whereas, Sheriffs, Stewarts and Baliffes of Royalty are countable to the King, seeing these are the Kings Courts: But Baliffes of Regality are not countable, because though they be the Kings Courts, yet the King hath gifted the Profites of the Court by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Regality. If then an Infeftment contain Courts, the Profites there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are carried therewith, though not exprest; but ordinarly they bear <hi>cum curiis earumque exitibus.</hi> And therefore the Amerciaments of Courts, or there other Issues, or there Priviledge on the breakers of Arreeistments, loosing their Tacks to their Masters within their Barronies are not comprehended within publick Confiscations reserved to the King.</p>
                     <p n="65">65. Fortalices are also <hi>inter regalia,</hi> and are not carried by the Fee, unless exprest, or at least the Lands be erected in Barrony. By Fortalices are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, all Strengths built for publick Defence; whether that appear by common Fame, or Reputation, such as all the Kings Castles, whereof many are now in privat hands, as Proprietars, or Heretable Keepers thereof, or Constables of the same; such are the Castles of <hi>Dunstafnage, Carrick, Skipnes,</hi> and others belonging to the Earl of <hi>Argyl;</hi> the Constabulary of <hi>Forfar,</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Earl of <hi>Strathmore;</hi> the Constabulary of <hi>Dundie,</hi> now belonging to the Lord <hi>Hattoun:</hi> And when these Castles are disponed, either in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty or custody, the Infeftments thereof carry therewith, not only the Bounds of the Castle, but the Dependencies thereof, as Gardens, Orchards, Parkes, Meadows, and other ground possest by the King or Keeper for the use of the Castle, and all Rents, Annuities, Jurisdictions and Priviledges thereunto belonging; which may be instructed by their Charters, their Court-books, or other Writes or Instruments, and even by Witnesses, proving long Possession; albeit the Infeftments of Constabulary, bear only in general, <hi>Officium constabularii cum feodis &amp; divoriis ejusdem,</hi> which was found to extend to the proclaiming and riding of Fairs, anterior to the Constitution of the Office, and exercing Criminal Jurisdiction in the Town where the Fairs were held, during these Fairs, but not to extend to other Fairs recently granted by the King, or to Jurisdiction at other times, <hi>July</hi> 18. 1676. Earl of <hi>Kinghorn contra</hi> Town of <hi>Forfar.</hi> The like was done in the Process, betwixt <hi>Hattoun</hi> and the Town of <hi>Dundie,</hi> in <hi>anno</hi> 1679. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in multitudes of Witnesses were examined upon either part.

was not found effectual against <hi>Hattoun,</hi> his singular Successor in the Office by Apprysing, <hi>December</hi> 9. 1679. <hi>inter eosdem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="66">66. The Case is more doubtful as to other Fortalices, which are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to have been the Kings Castles. <hi>Craig's</hi> opinion is, that all strong holds are presumed to have been builded for publick Defence, and not for privat Safetie: wherein <hi>turris pinnata</hi> is comprehended, having Turrets or Rounds upon the Angles; from whence, Shot may be directed alongst all the Walls. And therefore much more may Castles with Bartizens or Bands, that is strong and high Walls surrounding the Castle: Or if the Castle be built upon a place naturally strong, which may give suspition to the King to be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Rebellion, and not to be patent and accessible at his pleasure; and most of all, if there were regular Fortifications of Stone or Earth. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such Fortresses or Fortifications, whereby places are made of that strength, which is accustomed to secure against publick Enemies in War, may not be builded without the King's Warrand; and if otherwise built, may be demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, and the Builder punished: but long possession presumes a Warrand. And as such Fortalices may be presumed to have been at first the Kings, from the very Inspection of the Fortalice and its proper use, so long Possession may take off that Presumption: and that they have been built mainly for privat use in times of trouble, with the Kings consent. But we need not insist in these Questions, seeing Towrs and Fortalices do now pass in course in Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Yet, though these were exprest, if it appear the Fortress hath belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the King, and can be comprehended in the annexed Property, the Right of them will only resolve into an heretable keeping: so that the King in time of War or Insurrections, may make use of such strong holds, and put Garisons therein, seeing keeping doth not exclude the Kings own necessary use: neither will the expressing of Fortalices generally, impower the Vassal to build such Strengths as are proper for publick War; because the Clause can only import such Fortalices as then were built.</p>
                     <p>But I see no ground to extend Fortalices to all houses, with Batlements, or with Turrets, or Rounds, which can only infer private safety against Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Plunderers, or flying Parties; but nothing proper for a Seige, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Defence of a Kingdom: and therefore these may pass as Houses or Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents.</p>
                     <p>And as to that ground <hi>Craig</hi> adduces, That it is Treason to hold any For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talice against the King, or to deny Him, or these commissioned by Him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess by armed force: and yet delivery of any other privat Right may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to the King without hazard. Whence he inferreth, that the King must have greater Right and Interest in all such Fortalices than in other things. This consequence is not good; for that which infers Treason, is the holding out of the House, and denying access to the King by armed Force, which will be treasonable in any House, whether it have Battlements or Turrets or not; but cannot infer that all Houses with Battlements or Turrets, were built for publick defence, and did once belong to the King; which recent Cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom doth further clear, there being nothing more ordinary, then to build Houses with Turrets or Rounds upon the Angles, without Warrand, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, or Suspition; these being rather for Ornament then for Strength.</p>
                     <p n="67">67. Forrests are likewise <hi>inter Regalia,</hi> being places destinat for Deer for the Kings use and pleasure in Hunting, which cannot be extended generally
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:109710:155"/>
to Woods, but only to such where Deer have been keeped: for certainly, Woods are <hi>partes fundi privati,</hi> and are not <hi>inter Regalia,</hi> in any Nation, but Forrests for keeping of Deer, remain <hi>inteir Regalia,</hi> altho the Wood should fail: And wherever Deer are keeped as proper, and others debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from Hunting there, it is presumed to have been a Forrest proper to the King. And though the Lands being in <hi>Baronia,</hi> may carry the Priviledge and Office of Forrestry, which gives the Baron right to hunt, kill, and make use of the Deer: Yet he will be but held as Keeper, or Forrester, which will not exclude the King to hunt and kill the Deer for his own proper use; for the property of the Forrest will never be understood, if it be not very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly granted.</p>
                     <p>Forrests have great Priviledges, and peculiar Customs; for whereas no man is oblieged to herd his Cattel off other mens ground or Corns, or to be answerable for the Skaith they do, longer then in hayning time, while the Corns are upon the Ground: And if any man have a minde to keep his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours goods off his Ground, he may do it; But he must herd his Ground, and may turn off his neighbours Goods without wronging them, but cannot put them in Pondfold. Yet if any mans Goods be found in Forrests, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come escheat, and are confiscat; two thirds to the King, and one third to the Forrester: And if any Baron or Landed-man, have hained Woods, or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of their own, they may escheat all Goods that bees found therein to their own use, <hi>Par.</hi> 1535. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. Where privat Forrests of Subjects, are only understood such as are inclosed with a sufficient Dyke: The words of the Statute bears, <hi>Hained Woods or Forrests,</hi> which cannot be hained without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closure; but the Kings Forrests are large tracts of Ground, which neither have been, nor can be inclosed: and therefore all the neighbouring Heretors and Possessors, must either herd their Goods off these Forrests, or loss them. Upon this account it was, that the King having by a Signature under his hand, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a Forrestry to the Laird of <hi>Fascally;</hi> the Exchequer, before passing thereof, desired the Lords of Session to consider and report what by Law was the Priviledge, Conveniency, or Inconveniency of Forrests: and they having heard the Obtainer of the Forrest, and the neighbouring Heretors, did declare the Priviledge of a Forrest to be as aforesaid, <hi>June</hi> 21. 1680. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Exchequer did represent to the King, the Inconveniency to grant new Forrests.</p>
                     <p>The Comptroller had the Inspection of the Kings Parks and Forrests; and it was lawful to the Comptroller, or any having the Kings Warand, to intromet with all Goods in the Kings Forrest, not put in by the Comptroler, or these having power from him, and to apply the whole to the Kings use, <hi>Par.</hi> 1592. <hi>cap.</hi> 198. And by the former Statute, the Forrester or Keeper is prohibite to put any Cattel in the Forrest belonging to himself: So that if the Keeper first seize upon Goods in the Forrest, he hath the third; but if the Comptroller, or these having Warrand from the King, does <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> seize, the Keeper hath no share.</p>
                     <p>There are many more Customes and Priviledges of the Kings Forrests and Chaces in <hi>England,</hi> where the Forrester or Keeper hath only the Branches of Trees, and the Bark thereof, and such as are fallen or decayed: and as <hi>Skeen</hi> observes, that he may take a Tree as high as his head; but our heretable Keepers have much more Priviledge, and may make use of the Wood and Deer, so as not to destroy either, and with a reservation for the Kings proper use.</p>

And where Woods are divided in so many Haggs, that they yeeld a yearly profit, in that case the Heretor hath rather used them as Fruits, then as Parts; so that Liferenters, Tercers and Donatars, many claim the same; yea, if a Coal be a constant go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coal without apparent hazard of exhausting, it is like Conjunct-fiars, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, or Donatars, will not be excluded therefrom, not exceeding the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and method accustomed by the Fiar: But otherways, Coal is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered only as a part, and is carried as a part, though not exprest, nor in Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony, as <hi>Craig</hi> in the forecited place observeth, to have been decided betwixt the Sheriff of <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Chambers</hi> of <hi>Gadgirth.</hi> And a party first Infeft in Land with the pertinents, without mention of Coal, was preferred to an express In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment only of the Coal-heughs of that Land, <hi>January</hi> 30. 1662.

                     <p>The effect of Infeftments in the point of Right is, that by the first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Infeftment, with the several requisites aforesaid, granted by him who had power, the Property is established, and the Proprietar will be preferred, at least <hi>in petitorio</hi> to all posterior Rights; but if the granter have no power, as not being validly insest himself, or being impeded by Inhibition or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, or by anterior diligence making the matter litigious, he cannot valid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confer a Right.</p>

                     <p>HAVING now shown what is the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of the Vassal in the Fee, it will be the more easie to find out what the Superiours Right of the Superiority retaineth; for what is proper to the Fee, and is not Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned to the Vassal, is reserved to the Superiour, and it is either Constitute as belonging to the Superiour constantly, or casually.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The constant Right of the Superiour standeth mainly in these particulars; First, Superiority it self is <hi>dominium directum,</hi> as the Tenentry is but <hi>dominium utile</hi> (as before is shown) and therefore, the Superiour must be Infeft, as well as the Vassal, and that in the Lands and Tenement it self, without mention of the Superiority which followeth, but upon the Concession of the Fee in Tenentry, though sometimes through the ignorance of Writers, Infeftments bear expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>to be of the Superiority.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Only the Soveraign Authority, as the common Fountain of all Rights of the Ground, needs no Infeftment, but hath his Right founded <hi>in jure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni,</hi> and is not Feudal but Allodial; and when the Right of Lands fall to the King, by the Casuality of his Superiority, as Forefaulture, Recognition, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stardry or last heir, if the Lands be holden immediatly of the King, they are <hi>ipso facto,</hi> consolidat with the Superiority, and the Declarators required there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anent, do not Constitute, but declare the Kings Right, without prejudice of what is consumed, <hi>bona fide:</hi> But where they are not holden immediatly of the King, the Right thereof is perfected by Gift and Presentation, whereby the immediat Superiour is oblieged to receive the Donatar by Infeftment, like to that of his former Vassal; yet the Kings Right by the Casuality, though it be not perfected, is real and effectual against all singular Successours, whereby deeds of Treason and Recognition, being in Facts ordinarly proven by Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses: Purchasers cannot be secured by any Register; and therefore, must se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themselves by the Kings Confirmation, &amp; <hi>novo damus.</hi> But where the King succeeds in any Fee to a Subject, as to Property or Superiority, before he can alienat the same, he must be served Heir in special thereunto; so King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the first was served Heir to Queen <hi>Ann</hi> his Mother in the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:109710:165"/>
of <hi>Dumfermling,</hi> in which King <hi>James</hi> Infeft her in Fee, to her and her Heirs, by a Morning-gift, the first day after his Marriage with her; and King <hi>Charles</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was served Heir to <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi> in the Earldom of <hi>Lennox:</hi> In which Service, the Chancellour and fourteen of the Lords of Session, were the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, the youngest Lord being left out, because there could be no more but fifteen: But the King needs no Infeftment upon such Retours; but if he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any Lands holden immediatly of himself, the Instrument of Resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must be Registrat; and if holden of a Subject, there ariseth no real Right to a Donatar till he be Infeft upon the Kings Presentation, and his Seasine Registrat; by both which, the certainty of Land-rights is preserved.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Secondly, Superiority carrieth a Right to all Actions following the Land, against any other then the Vassal; for seing Superiours are Infeft in the Lands, they can only be repelled from such Actions, by the Rights granted to their Vassals, but by no others, and so may remove Possessors, who can show no Right; this was found, though the Superiours Infeftment, bore him only <hi>to be Infeft in the Superiority of the Lands, November</hi> 19. 1624. <hi>Lag contra</hi> his Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If a Superiour become Fiar by Succession, or Acquisition, for Establishing the Property in his Person, he may either be Infeft upon his own Precept or the Kings, <hi>November</hi> 26. 1668. Daughters of Mr. <hi>Robert Mortoun.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. But a Superiour cannot interpose betwixt himself and his Vassals, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fefting another in the Lands to be holden of himself, Such infeftment was found null by Exception, <hi>January</hi> 30. 1671. <hi>Dowglas</hi> of <hi>Kelhead contra</hi> Vassals.</p>
                     <p>Superiours must receive and Infeft their Sub-vassals upon the refusal, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity of the Vassal, and may at any time after, receive the immediat Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, or his Successour; or another, if the immediat Vassals Right be extinct, or acquired by the Superiour, which is no unwarrantable Interposition, which is repelled as contrary to the Nature of the Feudal Contract and Right, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inconsistent that the Superiour should both give his Superiority to another, and claim it himself, <hi>Dans &amp; retinens nihil dat;</hi> And if that were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, interposed Vassals might be infinitely multiplied, <hi>November</hi> 26. 1672. Earl of <hi>Argyle contra Mcleod;</hi> in which case, the late Marquess of <hi>Argyle</hi> being forefault, <hi>Mcleod</hi> who was <hi>Argyles</hi> Vassal, was retoured and Infeft in the Lands, as holden immediatly of the King, which did not hinder the King to Interpose this Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> as Donatar to his Fathers forefaulture, seing the King had done no deed to accept <hi>Mcleod</hi> as his immediat Vassal; but that he was Infeft by Precepts out of the Chanclery, passing of course.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Superiours nor their donatars need not instruct the Superiours Right; but the Vassal must acknowledge it, or disclaim him upon his peril, so it was found in the Casuality of Marriage, <hi>February</hi> 25. 1662. <hi>Arbuthnet contra Keiths,</hi> which will not hold, if the Right of Superiority be newly acquired, and no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment given to the Vassal, or his Predecessors by vertue thereof.</p>
                     <p>The Superiours Infeftment gives him interest to pursue Reductions and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probations, against all parties, even against his own Vassals, who will be forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to produce their rights, under the Certification, to be declared null; or false and feigned, though, when they are produced, they may defend them.</p>

                     <p n="9">9. Superiority carrieth the Right of Jurisdiction over the Vassals Lands and Inhabitants thereof, if the same be granted to the Superiour in his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment, either implicitely as being a Barrony, Lordship or Earldom, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, having the power of Courts and their Issues; and though the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our grant the same to the Vassal, yet that is not exclusive of his own right, but cumulative therewith; how far Superiority carrieth the right of Thirlage of the Vassals Lands to their Superiours Milns, when the Vassals have not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them the priviledge of Milns and Multars, will appear amongst Servitudes, of which hereafter.</p>

Crowns, the composition for the Entry would be 24. Crowns.</p>

which distinction is mentioned in the <hi>English Magna Charta,</hi> the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the releef by Heirs in <hi>England,</hi> is in Ward-holdings or Military Fies 100. Pounds Sterling for an Earldome, 100. Merks for a Baronry, and 100. Shillings for any other Military Fie, which is oblieged to maintain one Souldier. And if the Fie be less, and lyable only for a share of the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Souldier it is lyable Proportionally.</p>
                     <p>Relief, by the custom of <hi>France,</hi> is for a Barrony, 100. Franks, and for any other Military Fie, 15. But if it answer not to the entertainment of one Souldier, it payes for every Aiker, 12. Deniers; but if it be not a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Fie, but that which the <hi>English</hi> calls Sockage, the Reddendo whereof is not Military service, but some other payment or performance, which is doubled the first year after the death of the Vassal, the one half thereof is, the releef which is a real burden, for which the Superior may Poynd or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strenzie all goods upon the ground.</p>
                     <p>But as to singular Successors, the most ancient Feudal Customs, making them only to descend to the Issue of the first Vassal whose Collaterals had no right, but were like our kindly Tenents, by the propinquity of blood: yet by the favour of the Superior, they were oftimes admitted in the lie, and were only lyable for relief. If the Superior did receive a stranger upon the resignation of his Vassal, he was to pay a relief, which in some places was the fiftieth part of the Price. And by the Custom of <hi>France,</hi> it is the thirteenth part.</p>
                     <p>From the Original of Relief, the reason of its name may be conjectured; and these who appropriat it to Ward-holdings interpret it to be called relief, from redeeming or Relieving the Fie out of the hands of the Superior. But relief being a general Feudal name, and many Nations not allowing the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior the whole profites of the Fie, in the minority of the Heir, and giving a relief in the case of singular Successors; that derivation must be too narrow. And it seems most quadrant to the common Feudal Customs, that relief should import a subsidie or aid to the Superior.</p>
                     <p>We have the more largely considered the rise and Customs of Nations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning relief, because though it frequently occurs with us, yet it hath been alwise kindly transacted betwixt the Superior and Vassal. And there is scarce a contraversie or decision, observed about it by any since the Institution of the <hi>Colledge of Justice,</hi> so that we must rest in the common custom used betwixt Superior and Vassal, the Nature of this Casuality, and the opinions of some few of our Lawyers who have written upon it; <hi>Craig, lib.</hi> I. <hi>Dieges</hi> 20. handles the matter of relief, and sayeth, <hi>by our ancient custom, there was no relief due after Ward.</hi> And that it was the common opinion of Lawyers at that time, that relief had only place in Ward-holdings; And that it imported a years rent of the Fie, being the full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites thereof, when the Superior or his Donatar were in Possession by the Ward. But in other cases, only a years rent, by the favourable accompt, that is one years new retoured duty of the Fie, as it is retoured by it self, or the share of the retour of any Barrony or Tenement whereof it is a part. But <hi>Craig,</hi> with good reasoa holds relief to be due at the renovation of every Fie, to the Heirs of the Investiture, for the duplication of the Feu-dutie in Feus, is due at the entry of every Heir.

                     <p>Conform to this Statute it was found, that the relief might be recovered, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by real action of Poinding of the Ground, or personally against the vassal, who had taken his Precept of Seasme out of the Chanclery, though he had not taken infeftment there upon, <hi>March</hi> 12. 1678.

In place of the relief to the Superiour by the Vassals singular Successor, we have a Composition introduced by Statute, 1469. <hi>cap.</hi> 36. whereby Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours are oblieged to receive Appryzers for a years rent of the Lands Appryz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For before that Statute, no Superiour could be compelled to receive any other Vassal, then the Heir of the First Vassal, provided by the Investiture; for though in Dispositions, Lands are ordinarly disponed to the Purchaser, his Heirs and Assignays; yet Assignays use not to be repeated in the Charters, and the meaning of that Clause in Dispositions, hath been several times Interpret, that the Disposition may be Assigned or Transferred: But Infeftment being once taken, Assignays have no farther interest; and that Clause doth not save Recognition, when the Ward-vassal Infefts any other in the Fee then his Heir apparent, as was found in the case of the Lady <hi>Carnagie con.</hi> Lord <hi>Cranburn.</hi> And though a Disposition have no mention of Assignays; yet before Infeftment, while it remains personal, it is assignable, and a Superiour who granted a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position by a minute, was discerned to receive the Assignay to the Minute, though he was not in Freindship with him, <hi>Jan.</hi> 29. 1623. <hi>Ogilvie contra Kinloch</hi> of <hi>Bandoch.</hi> This Statute was by Custom extended to Adjudications, being the same in effect, but different in form from Appryzings; for the design of the Statute being to Satisfie Creditors by a Judicial alienation of the Debitors Lands, <hi>ex paritate rationis;</hi> it was extended against the Debitors appearand Heir, who being Charged to Enter Heir, did not Enter; and therefore, Lands were Adjudged from him, to which he might have Entered, either for his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors debt or his own; whereupon the Superiour is descerned to receive the Creditor Adjudger, whether for sums of Money, or for Implement of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, and Obliegements to Infeft: But the Custom allowed not a years Rent to Superiours for receiving Adjudgers, till the years Rent was also extended to Adjudications by Act of Parliament, <hi>Decem.</hi> 3. 1669.</p>
                     <p>The Lords of Session have always taken latitude in the modification of the years Rent, especially if the sum Appryzed or Adjudged for be small, and the Lands he great; and they have allowed the Appryzer or Adjudger, his opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on during the legal, to take Infeftment or not; and yet not to be excluded from the Rents of the Lands, till he be satisfied, <hi>Decem.</hi> 3. 1672.

But the Appryzer runs that hazard, that if the Debitor die before he be satisfied, if the Land be holden Ward, it will fall in Ward, and relief by the Debitors death, and in Non-entry; for there is no reason that the Casualities of the Superiority should neither fall by the Appryzer nor by the Debitor.</p>
                     <p>There is not the like reason, that the Liferent-escheat of the Debitor should exclude the Appryzer, if it fell after the Appryzing and Charge; for the Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent-escheat falls to the Superiour, with all the burdens which affected it by the Vassal, even with the burden of his Tacks; and therefore, Appryzing with a Charge way be as effectual as these, <hi>July</hi> 24. 1632. <hi>James Rule con.</hi> Laird of <hi>Billie.</hi>

                     <p>The Superiour can have only one years Rent from all the Appryzers or Adjudgers. But now since Appryzers and Adjudgers within year and day,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:109710:175"/>
come in <hi>pari passu,</hi> where one needs only to be Infeft or to Charge; there is less reason to give an easie modification of the years Rent to the first Appryzer or Adjudger, insisting for Infeftment then before; because one Infeftment serves for all, and he who advanceth the same, gets relief of the rest, before they have access to the Rents.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. The prime Casulity of Fees is Ward, which is not competent to all Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours; Ward is only competent in Fees holden in Military Service which have their Denomination from this Casuality, being therefore called Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdings, and that not by the Tenor of the Investiture, which seldom menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth Ward, but by the Nature of it; for when the Fee is holdeu for Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Service, or as the <hi>English</hi> better express by Knight Service, extending not only to following in War, but to Council and Assistance in Peace, then when the Vassal is unfit for such Service, the Fee is open and remaineth in the hands of the Superiour, or his Donatar; and though this capacity might be in some sooner; yet it is fixed in men to their majority, at twenty one years compleat; and in Women, till they become fourteen years compleat; for then they are capable of Husbands, who may do the Service required in the Fee, <hi>Decem.</hi> 20. 1609. and <hi>Jan.</hi> 27. 1610.

                     <p n="24">24. Ward reacheth the Custody of the Person, and of his Lands holden Ward, it hath its denomination rather from the former; for Ward is as much as Guard or Custody: The Superiour or his Donatar is by the Nature of this Right, as a Tutor to the Vassals Heir; <hi>Craig</hi> observeth, that he is preserable to all other Tutors, except only the Father of the Heir, whose Fee descends by the Mother, or some other person; and that he is oblieged as other Tutors, to pursue the rights of the heir; but the course of time having turned this Right from its ancient Institution, so that the Superiour hath less enjoyment of Service, but more of Profite of the Fee: there is the less regard to the Pupils Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, with or by the Superiour, to the effect he might be fitted for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and therefore, other Tutors, not only for the administration of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilsmeans, but even for the Custody and Education of his Person will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred; though of old, the Donatar of the Ward was preferred to the Tutor in Custody of the Pupils Person, <hi>Sinclar, June</hi> 15. 1543.

                     <p n="35">35. The main effect of Ward then is, that thereby the Superiour or his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natar have, during that time, the full fruits and profites of the Fee, and may remove Tennents, and do all other deeds that the Proprietar might have done, and was accustomed to do as to continue the profites of a Wood, if there be constant cutting, as being divided in so many Hags, that the first is ready by the last be cut: Or going Heughs, as they were accustomed by the Vassal; but he cannor cut more then the accustomed yearly Hags of Wood, or put in more Coalziers then the Vassal had at his death, and ordinarly before; and he may remove and in put Tennents, and that without any preceding decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator or favourable account, esteeming the retour Mail for the Rent, as in Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entry;

but he may immediatly pursue actions for Mails and Duties, remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. unless the Ward be Taxed; and then the Superiour can have no more then the Duties to which it is Taxed. But for it, he hath not only the Vassal, and all Intromettors with the Fruits, personally; But he may also Poynd the Ground for the Taxed Duty, as <hi>Craig</hi> affirmeth in this Title.</p>
                     <p n="36">36. Yet the reach of the Ward by the Nature of the Fee, cannot extend to alienation, or consumption of the Substance of the Fee, or any part or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent thereof, and this is cleared by the Statute, <hi>Parliament</hi> 1491. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. Whereby Donatars must find Caution not to destroy the Biggings, Woods, Stanks, Parks, Meadows, or Dovecoats, but to keep them in such kind as they get them.</p>
                     <p>Ward is also restrained by the Statutes confirming Feues, of which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and these stand valid against the Superiour, during the Ward; so do also all Infeftments holden of him, either by Resignation or Confirmation; but not Infeftments to be holden of his Vassal, unless Confirmed by him; for albeit, Confirmations by the King, which pass of course, do not take away the Casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities of Ward, &amp;c. of the Kings Vassals, which affect the Fee of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vassals; yet the Confirmation of other Superiours of Sub-vassals rights, doth take off from him the Ward, if the right be Feu only generally, without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ward, seing the Act 1606. doth only annul Feues set by Vassals, holding Ward of Subjects without their Superiours consent, which was so found, albeit the Feu was under reversion, that it was free of the Ward and Marriage of the Vassal as to the subvassal feuer, but did only affect the Vassals interest, <hi>viz.</hi> the Feu duty, reversion and back-tack, <hi>July</hi> 2. 1672.

                     <p>But Rentals and Tacks set by the Vassal, have only this effect against the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour or his Donatar, that the Tennents or Labourers shall not be removed till the next <hi>Whitsonday,</hi> after the beginning of the Ward, paying the old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed Duty, <hi>Par.</hi> 1491. <hi>cap.</hi> 26.

                     <p>The Casuality of Ward may be enjoyed immediatly by the Superiour, but is more ordinarly gifted to Donatars, not only by the King, but by other Superiours; which Donatars may do whatsoever the Superiour himself might, because they Act by his Right, and are in effect his Assigneys: So that if gifts be granted to more Donatars, the first Intimation or Diligence will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</p>

The fourth Casuality of Superiority, is the interest of Superiours in the Marriage of their Ward-vassals, which doth arise from the Nature of the Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal Contract in proper Fees, whereby the Vassal oweth the Superiour, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and Military Service, and is thereby in his Clientele, which could Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port no more then that he should not Contract affinity by Marriage, with any that were in enmity with his Superiour; for thereby his Fidelity might become suspect, which would take place, not only in the first Marriage of the Vassal, but as to any subsequent Marriage, though he had Succession by a former Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and might take place in the Marriage of the Vassals eldest Son, even in his life, and might be considered as an Act of Ingratitude, if the enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Superiour and the Family with whom the Vassal was to marry, were known to him, and might import a breach of his Fidelity, if the Superiour did prohibit him to match with that Family which was in open and known enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to him: The Superiour might also have Interest in his Vassals Marriage, when he had the custody of his Person, as a Tutorial Trust for the good of the Vassal.</p>
                     <p n="38">38. But Time and Custom hath given Superiours a far different interest in the Marriage of their Vassals, here and in <hi>England,</hi> of which there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the common Feudal Customs, nor is it in use in other Kingdoms; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, by the Custom of <hi>France,</hi> female Heirs in the Kings Custody, must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the consent of the King or his Procurator, yet the not doing so, infers not the value of their Marriage, as in <hi>England;</hi> and with us it is become a power in the Superiour, to exact out of his Vassals Fee, the value of a Tocher, suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the whole means and Estate of the Vassal, if he Marry without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and the double value being solemnly required, to Marry a suitable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son without disparagement, if he doth not obey, but Marry another; this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom was introduced in <hi>England,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third.</p>
                     <p>It is commonly held to have been introduced in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Malcolm</hi> the second, who gave out all his Lands in <hi>Scotland</hi> in Fee, and reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to himself, for the ordinar support of the Royal Dignity, the Ward and Marriage of his Vassals, whence the marriage was designed as a profit to the Crown, and by example was derived to the Subjects, who giving their Lands Ward, were understood to give the same with the like Priviledge of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of their Vassals Marriage, which doth never take effect till the Vassal be Major; for during his Minority, his Superiour or his Donatar, have the full profites of his Fee, over and above the expenses of his Education, and mentain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance according to the Vassals quality, if he have no other Estate which is not Ward, the profits whereof may be sufficient to Entertain and Educate him; or in so far as these profits come short; for no Minor is oblieged to spend his Stock upon his mentainance; nor may his Tutors or Curators securely do the same.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the true Interest of Superiours in their Vassals Marriage, should now be the Tocher suitable to the Vassals Estate, Marrying after his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:109710:177"/>
death, if he had not been Married before; for the value of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage being due but once, and not for every Marriage, if the first Marriage fall not after the Defunct Vassals death, it should not be demanded, nor any account called for of the profite of the Marriage, falling before he could be Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, though it hath been claimed, where the Vassal was Widow at his Predecessors death, having no Children of the former Marriage; but it came not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Session, though it was demanded by the Commissioners of the Thesaury, from Sir <hi>Robert Barcley</hi> of <hi>Pearstoun.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And albeit the Vassal never marry, yet if he be solemnly required by Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Marry a suitable Person without disparagement, if he live to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority, though he never Marry, his Fee will be lyable to the value of his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, albeit he willingly ly out uninfeft, not by the Superiours fault, but his own; for though Creditors have a remeid by a Charge, to enter Heir within fourty dayes, with certification, that all execution shall pass, as if the debitor were Entered; yet there is no Reason or Practice to extend the same to Superiours, albeit <hi>Craig</hi> think that it may be so extended, and that the Marriage is not due, unless by that means, the Heir required to Marry be Entered, or at least charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Enter; but by a solemn debate and Decision betwixt <hi>French</hi> of <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Thorniedykes,</hi> upon the 11. of <hi>July</hi> 1622. the Lords found that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was due, if the appearand Heir became Marriagable, though dying in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, when they were not Entered Heirs: But in that case, the Heirs were Female; and it does not appear whether they were past fourteen, at which time their Ward ceasseth, and they are in the same case as men, when they pass twenty one; neither doth it appear whether they were required to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or not; and therefore, we shall not thence conclude, that a marriage is due by the appearand Heirs being marriagable, though dying uninfeft and in minority, against which, <hi>Craigs</hi> opinion is very positive, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>Dieges.</hi> Yet from this Decision, and from that betwixt <hi>Dickson</hi> of <hi>Headrig</hi> and the Kings Donatar, decided, <hi>November</hi> 14. 1635. we may conclude, that there may be more marriages exacted by the death of one Ward-vassal, having several ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearand Heirs, of which none were Entered; and it being debated, whether the marriage would be due, though the Vassal died unmarried and unrequired to marry, in the case of <hi>Archibald Campbel contra</hi> Laird of <hi>Mcnaghtoun, Decem.</hi> 3. 1677. the Lords proceeded no further, but did only determine, that the single value is not penal but favourable.</p>
                     <p n="39">39. And therefore, the single value of the Vassals marriage needs not be pursued penally, because the Vassal married without the Superiours consent, or being required, and living till majority, though not Entered by his fault, did not marry; but may be pursued as a Casuality, and profite due to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, for the Vassals marriage, marrying after his Predecessors death: Or being required to marry, did live unmarried past his majority, or marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without his Superiours consent; by which, all the unhandsome formalities, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to reach a double value, might be abated; for the single value would be due, if the Vassal live to majority and never marry; and if he did marry without the Superiours consent, the double would be due; and for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Superiours consent, it would be necessarly consequent, that the Vassal should confer with the Superiour, and propose to him whom he inclined to marry, and if the Superiour consented not thereto, he should condescend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his reasons, and offer another fitter person.</p>
                     <p n="40">
                        <pb n="312" facs="tcp:109710:178"/>40. All which being exprest by Instrument, the Session would judge who were in the right, and would be very favourable in the single value, but would not sustain the double, if the Superiour did without reason refuse his consent, without necessity of the ordinary form of Requisition, offering a particular person, and opportunity of a visit and conference, and a day and place to marry, not being within thirty days; and a second Instrument, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that person to the place of conference; first to offer her consent, so that if the Vassal at the first fight did demand of her if she would marry him, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved immodestly enough to consent without acquaintance, without considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or affections; and then openly to appear at the Church, and offer her self again, which no fit and modest person would be induced to do; and therefore, these are meer formalities, without any design to offer a suitable person; so that there is no reason the Superiour should lose the single value, for any defect in these formalities; nor that he should have the double value for using the same without any just design, or desire of acceptance; and therefore, the double value hath been seldom found due, and so takes no place without the solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of an Instrument of Requisition by a Nottar, observing all the formalities of producing the Donatars Gift, if he do personally require, and both the Gift and Procuratory, if he require it by his Procurator, and the offering of a person by name, and an unsuspected place for view and conference, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day and Church for solemnizing the marriage, and at that day a new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument presenting the Woman, and waiting for the Vassal till one of the Clock, wherein there is the greatest exactness observed as to the double value; but there was no necessity found to make the requisition to Curators, whose consent is not required to the marriage of Minors; as was found in the case of the Heirs of <hi>Thorniedike.</hi> But the double value was not found due, where the Superiour or his Donatar appeared not at the day appointed, for interview, <hi>Hope,</hi> marriage, Earl of <hi>Angus contra Hugh Nisbit:</hi> Nor where the Instrument of requisition mentioned not the Gift produced, though it was offered to be proven by witnesses, that it was truly produced, albeit it was not called for, <hi>March</hi> 8. 1627.

                     <p>And even when the double value is sustained, it makes but a small addition ordinarly to the single value, which is two or three years free Rent, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nualrent, deducing Liferents; or Annualrents real or personal of the vassals hail Estate, and the double value adds ordinarly but a fourth.</p>
                     <p n="41">41.

First, no Infeftment, following upon a debt contracted by the Rebel after the Rebellion, though the Infeftment be accomplished within the year, will exclude the Life-rent escheat, or prejudge the Superior, if Relaxation be not used within year and day, whether the Infeftment proceed upon the Rebels own Disposition, or upon Apprising; for in both cases, it is the voluntar deed of the Rebel that prejudges the Superiour: For, albeit the Apprising be a deed of Law and necessary, yet it proceeds upon a Debt voluntarily contracted after Rebellion, such Debts will not exclude the single escheat, and therefore ought not to exclude the Life-rent escheat, which was so found, though the Infeftment was granted to a Son and his Wife for a competent Tocher, <hi>Spots.</hi> Escheat <hi>Panmure contra</hi> Laird and Lady <hi>Ghight.</hi> 2. The Debts or Obliege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the vassal, though they preceed the denunciation, no Infeftment grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, <hi>in cursu rebellionis,</hi> for satisfying these anterior Debts, will exclude the Life-rent Escheat, unless he had been specially oblieged to grant such an Infeftment before the Rebellion; for then the granting of it after, is not a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, but a necessary deed, which he might be compelled to grant, <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 23. 1627. <hi>James Vallance</hi> contra <hi>Thomas Porteous:</hi> In which case, an Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for an onerous debt before Rebellion, was not found sufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Life-rent, seing there was no anterior Obliegement to grant that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment; which is the more confirmed by the parity of the case of Inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which annull Infeftments after the the Inhibition, though granted for satisfying anterior debts: but if there was an anterior Obliegement, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment conform thereto, though after the Inhibition, is valid, as not being a voluntary, but a necessary deed, <hi>Vide Title Infeftments, § Inhibition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Dispositions and Obliegements to grant Infeftments anterior to the Rebellion, and Infeftment thereupon posterior, do not exclude the Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Escheat, unless the Infeftment be taken <hi>in cursu rebellionis;</hi> and so a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Wodset long before Rebellion, clad with thirty eight years possession before denunciation, was not found sufficient to exclude the Life-rent Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheat, <hi>December</hi> 3. 1634. Mr. <hi>James Lindsay</hi> contra <hi>Scot.</hi> Neither a Charter and Inhibition thereupon, seing there was not Seasine taken within year and day, <hi>December</hi> 3. 1623. <hi>Jonet Herris</hi> contra <hi>Glendinning.</hi> Neither a base In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment before denunciation, there being no possession thereon till year and day, <hi>March</hi> 19. 1633.

                     <p n="53">53. Fourthly, Apprisings or Adjudications, though for a debt anterior to the Rebellion, exclude not Life-rent Escheat, unless Infeftment or Charge against the Superiour be used thereupon within year and day after Rebellion; For without Infeftment or Charge, Apprising is no real Right: And therefore, though it were led before Rebellion against a vassal, if Infeftment or Charge follow not <hi>in cursu rebellionis,</hi> it excludes not the vassals Life-rent Escheat to fall to the Superior or Donatar, <hi>July</hi> 14. 1622. <hi>Rollo</hi> contra Laird of <hi>Kellie,</hi> albeit Infeftment follow upon the Apprising before the Life-rent was gifted, <hi>Hope</hi> Horning and Escheat, Sir <hi>Patrick Murray</hi> contra <hi>Adamson.</hi> Neither did an Apprising upon a denunciation, begun <hi>in cursu rebellionis,</hi> but not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, exclude the Life-rent Escheat, <hi>February</hi> 16. 1631. <hi>Cranstoun</hi> contra <hi>Scot.</hi> But if Apprising or Adjudication be led for sums prior to the rebellion, and be compleat by Infeftment or Charge <hi>in cursu rebellionis,</hi> albeit they be deduced after rebellion, they exclude the Liferent Escheat, as is insinuat in the Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations

in the former decisions, and was so decided, <hi>February</hi> 13. 1611. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of <hi>Lochauld</hi> contra <hi>Yonmig</hi> and Sir <hi>George Arskine.</hi>

                     <p>Liferent-escheat being one of the Casualities of Superiority, only intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by statute or custom, there is this difference of that which hath been said of Non-entry, Ward or Recognition, which are Casualities arising from the nature of the feudal Contract, that Liferent Escheat flowing not thence, but upon the Vassals rebellion and disobedience to Law, which is not against the Superior or any delinquence against the feudal Contract, the Vassals Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Escheat gives the Superior no more then the Vassal himself had the time of his denunciation, and so all real Rights compleat by possession, whether Infeftments or Tacks, are not prejudged by the subsequent Life-rent Escheat, as was found, <hi>January</hi> 19. 1672. Mr. <hi>William Beatoun</hi> contra <hi>Scot</hi> of <hi>Letham.</hi> In Feues, so far as is allowed by Law, the Vassals Life-rent will reach no more then the Feu-duties of Feues set by the Vassal before his denunciation: But any subaltern base Infeftment, not cled with possession before rebellion, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the Life-rent, <hi>March</hi> 19, 1633.

                     <p n="54">54. Liferent-escheat extends it self to all Fees, whether holden Ward, Blensh or Feu, but not to Burgage and Mortification, because the Fiar is a Society and Incorporation, which dieth not; and therefore, have no Liferent-escheat: And though Denunciation may be used against the persons administrating the same, even for that which is due by the Incorporation, and as they represent it; yet that being supposed their fault and negligence, doth not prejudge the Society, as Magistrates of Burghs, Masters of Colledges, Incumbents in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or collegiat Kirks, Chapters or Convents, <hi>sede vacante.</hi>

But where a Beneficed person having a distinct Benefice, or a Stipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary, is denunced for his own debt, his Liferent-escheat falleth, and therewith the profites, during his life or incumbency, because though the Fee be not in him, yet he hath a distinct Liferent thereof, which is not so in the former case, where both Fee and profites are in the Society.</p>
                     <p n="56">56. Liferent-escheat is made effectual by a general declarator, finding the Vassal to be denunced, and year and day past by production of the Horning, but there is no necessity to prove him Vassal, unless he be a singular Successor in the Superiority, not acknowledged by the Vassal; or in case the vassal dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, herein is no mention of profites; but this Declarator being obtained, the Fee is void from the Denunciation; and the Superiour or his Donatar have access to the Mails and Duties thereof, and to set and remove the same, and to do all deeds accustomed by the vassal himself, in the same manner as Ward: This useth to be done by a special Declarator, which is now accustomed to be in one Process with the general Declarator.

                     <p n="1">1. Annualrent is so called, because it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to be payed every year at one or two Terms; and therefore it is called Rent; and because it is yearly so payed, it is called annualrent.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>English</hi> extend these Rents to Rents due by Lease or Tack; but with us, annualrents are only Constitute by Infeftment; and though the Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or provision thereof, may be sufficient against the Constituent or his Heirs, it is not effectual against their singular Successors, and is no real Right of the Ground.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Rise of annualrents is from the Prohibition of Usury in the Canon Law, which they extend to the taking of any annual, or profite for Money or any other thing, in Lieu whereof those who were unfit for Trading, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the Property of Lands, bought annualrents, either irredeemably, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reversion, it had the same effect with the personal obliegement for annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and therefore, it is still retained, where annualrent according to the rates prescribed by Statute or Custom is allowed by personal obligation, and is not Usury; and the Infeftment of annualrent, is in security thereof.</p>
                     <p>Annualrents may be constitute, either of Money, Victual, or other Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, and that either in Fee and Heritage, or in Liferent; and either by a several Infeftment, or by Reservations in Infeftments of Property: In which cases, the Proprietars Seasine serveth both.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Infeftments of annualrents in most things do agree with the Infeftments of property, in the manner of Constituting thereof, by Charter or Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Seasine; in which the symbol and token of the Delivery of Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the annualrent, when Money is, a penny Money; and when Victual, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel thereof. Yet an old Infeftment of annualrent was sustained, though it bore, <hi>only Seasine to be given, according to the solemnities used in such cases;</hi> albeit it was given thirty six years before, and no Possession thereby, <hi>March</hi> 23. 1631. <hi>Somervel contra Somervel</hi> of <hi>Drum.</hi> And being once validat by Possession, it was not excluded by the Infeftment of Property of the present Heretor, though the annualrenter shew not the Infeftment of him who Constitute the annualrent, with the Proprietar his authors Infeftment; so that it did not appear whether both Infeftments flowed from one common author, seing the Infeftment of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nualrent
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:109710:182"/>
was prior to the Infeftment of Property, it was not excluded thereby, <hi>February</hi> 7. 1667. <hi>Smeitoun contra Tarbet.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. Annualrent may be either holden Ward, or Blensh, or by Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and useth not to be holden Feu or Burgage, and is most frequently Blensh for a Penny; but if no holding be exprest, it is held to be Ward; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Casualities of the Superiority befall to the Superiour, according to the kind of the holding, as in Property; so that being Ward or Blensh, it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in Non-entry, in the hands of the Superiour, without Declarator, and so ceasseth during that time, even though the constituent as Debitor, be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, though he may be lyable personally, upon any personal obliege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for paying thereof, <hi>March</hi> 23. 1631. <hi>Somervel contra Somervel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Annualrents may be either base, or publick by Resignation or Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to the requisits to accomplish it when base, it is fully shown before, <hi>Title</hi> 13. §. <hi>Base Infeftments.</hi>

                     <p n="5">5. So likewise annualrent falling in Liferent escheat, belongs to the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, during the annualrenters Life; and if it be redeemed, the Profite of the Money comes in place thereof, as followeth, <hi>a pari,</hi> from a Wodsett re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, which was fallen in Liferent-escheat; and therefore, the Money was ordained to be imployed upon annualrent for the Superiour, during the Life of the Wodsetter, <hi>June</hi> 29. 1661. <hi>Tailziefer contra Maxtoun</hi> and <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninghame.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. The <hi>English</hi> distinguish Rent in Rent-Service, Rent-Charge, and Rent-Seck; Rent-service is that which is due by the <hi>reddendo</hi> of an Infeftment of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, as a Feu or Blensh duty; this is a part of the Infeftment of Property, but hath the same effect by poinding of the Ground, as other Annualrents; Rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge is that which not being by <hi>reddendo,</hi> yet is so Constitute, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nualrenter may, <hi>brevi manu</hi> (his Terms being past) poind the Ground there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we have no such Annualrent, for we admit of no distress without publick Authority; but all execution must proceed by Decreet and Precept.</p>
                     <p>Rent-seck is so called, as <hi>reditus siccus,</hi> because it is dry, having no effect without Sentence; such are our Annualrents.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. There is a distinction of Annualrents mentioned, <hi>Par.</hi> 1551. <hi>c.</hi> 10. in feu Annuals, Ground-annuals, and Top-annuals, which <hi>Craig</hi> thinketh to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drat with the <hi>English</hi> distinction of Rents: But the consideration of that Act and Ordinance, in relation to the Articles there exprest, will make it appear, that the case being there of Tennents within Burgh, the Feu Annual is that which is due by the <hi>reddendo</hi> of the Property, either of the Ground before the House was built, or the Ground and House together.</p>
                     <p>Ground-annuals is a distinct several annualrent, Constitute upon the Ground, before the House was built; and the Top-annualrent is out of the House, which is the more clear, that when such Tenements were destroyed, the least abatement was of the Feu-annual, or Feu-duty; and therefore, the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar repairing the Tenement, was to pay the Feu-annuals, with abatement of a sixth part; and the Ground-annual, as being more ancient then the Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annual,
<pb facs="tcp:109710:182"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:109710:183"/>
                        <pb n="321" facs="tcp:109710:183"/>
suffered an abatement of a fifth part, and the Top-annual of a fourth part.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The chief effect of Annualrents, either by <hi>reddendo</hi> in Property, or seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Infeftments, is by poinding of the Ground, upon which the Annualrent is constitute, and that by an ordinary Action, whereby the Annualrenter pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth upon Letters to Poind and Appryze all Goods upon the Ground, for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Annualrent; and also for Poinding and Appryzing the Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and Property it self.</p>
                     <p>As to the first member, the <hi>English</hi> Custom extendeth it to all goods that shall happen to be upon the Ground at the Term, if they have but lain down thereupon.</p>
                     <p>And our ancient custom extendeth it to all Goods of the Possessors, &amp; <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vecta &amp; illata,</hi> by them, without retrinching it to what the Tennent is due to the Proprietar, Constituent of the Annualrent; and the Poinding in this case was extended to purge a Spuilzie, <hi>November</hi> 21. 1628. <hi>Watson contra Reid. June</hi> 26. 1628. Laird of <hi>Ednem contra</hi> Tennents of <hi>Ednem,</hi> where the pursuit was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declaratory to establish the pursuers Right, then for present Possession or Execution.</p>
                     <p>But thereafter the Lords have been accustomed to interpose with Chargers upon Decreets of Poinding of the Ground, to restrict the same in favours of Tennents, to their Terms mails from the Statute, 1469. <hi>cap.</hi> 36. bearing, <hi>that the Cattel of poor men, Inhabitants of the Ground, shall not be poinded for the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords debt, where the Mail extends not to the avail thereof;</hi> and though the Act seemeth Correctory of an evil Custom, to poind the Tennents Goods for the Masters debt, yet the same reason, equity, and favour of their Rusticity, craves the Extension of it to these <hi>debita fundi;</hi> and therefore, it was so restricted, the Tennents producing their Tacks, or offering to depone upon their Rent summarly, without taking a Term; but it was not found requisite that the Annualrenter should either lybel or prove the quantity of the Rent, <hi>February</hi> 14. 1674.

                     <p>There is a case proposed by Sir <hi>Thomas Hope, viz.</hi> If one having Right to some years of an Annualrent by Liferent, or otherways should appryze for these years, and that appryzing expyre, whether that appryzing expired will carry the right of Property, not only from him who constitute the Annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, but from the Fiar of the Annualrent himself, so that the Infeftment of annualrent should become extinct, which seems to be resolved affirmatively, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the nature of the Right; for the Infeftment of annualrent, being <hi>jus sed ignobilius,</hi> becomes extinct, if the annualrenter there upon do appryze the Property, and be Infeft: and therefore, whoever appryzeth for years of the annualrent, the Infeftment thereof, unless it be taken away by satisfaction, or redemption, extinguisheth the Infeftment of annualrent, without distinction, whether the appryzing be led for any years belonging to the Fiar, Liferenter, or any other: and whereas the difficulty seems to be, that the Liferenter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prejudge the Fiar of the annualrent, or appryze more from the Fiar of the Land than he had; It is answered, the Fiar needs not be prejudged, because he hath a virtual Reversion, and might thereby redeem from the Annualren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and take the Liferenters Right: Neither doth the appryzing exclude the annualrent it self, as to years posterior, by the Tenor of the appryzing, but by the nature of the right constitute to that very end, that an Apprising for any years of the Annualrent is drawn back <hi>ad suam causam, viz.</hi> The original Infeftment of the Annualrent; and so excludes all posterior Infeftments: and therefore, extinguisheth not only these, but even the Infeftment of Annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent it self ceaseth, by accession of the property, <hi>ut juris nobilioris;</hi> but if the Fiar of the Annualrent were neglective in so dubious a case, it is like the Lords would repone him, satisfying the Liferenter. In the case of competition, the Infeftment of Annualrent it self will be preferred to the posterior Rights, though no Apprising followed, <hi>January</hi> 29. 1635.

Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Servitudes are either constitute by the deeds of men, or by the Law, which provideth a competent portion to either of the surviving Spouses out of the Lands and Tenements of the other during the Survivers Life; as if the Wife survive, she hath the third of her Husbands Tenements: and if the Husband survive, he hath the Liferent of the Wifes whole Tenements, and that <hi>provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one

Liferents are sometimes provided particularly, and sometimes generally for the whole, or such a share of the Conquest, during the Marriage, which though not fulfilled by the Husband in his Life, is effectual against his Heirs, and is not accounted a fraudulent provision, though it be the whole Conquest, even amongst Merchants, yea it was found effectual for recovering the rents of the Conquest Lands without Infeftment, against the Husbands Heir, in the case of the Relict of <hi>Johnstoun</hi> Merchant in <hi>Glasgow.</hi> And where a Husband purchased Lands in favours of his eldest Son, being then an Infant, and not to himself, yet his Relict was found to have Right to her Liferent thereof, as being a fraudulent deed in prejudice of the obliege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Conquest, <hi>July</hi> 3. 1627.

So Conjunct-fiars may receive and enter the Heirs of Vassals, and have the benefit of their Ward, Non-entry, Liferent-escheat, and may grant Gifts thereof effectually, even as to the time after their death. So also a Conjunct-siar, infeft with her Husband in Lands <hi>cum Sylvis,</hi> was found thereby to have right to make use of the Woods for her and her Tennants use, <hi>January</hi> 10. 1610. <hi>Hunter</hi> and others <hi>contra</hi> Relict of <hi>Gadgirth, Vide Title</hi> 13. § 41.</p>
                     <p>Liferenters have not these Casualities of Superiority; yet a Baron having disponed his Barony, reserving his Liferent, was thereby found to have right to receive the Heirs of his Vassals, but not singular Successors, <hi>Ianuary</hi> 11. 1611. <hi>Crawfurd contra</hi> Laird of <hi>Glaspen.</hi> And there is reason, that the Fiar dispon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with reservation to himself, whereby his own Infeftment stands <hi>pro tanto,</hi> should have greater power then a Liferent apart or by reservation, not being before infeft, conjunctfees though publick, as ordinarly they are; and thereby, as to the Superiour, the Fee is full, and the casualities of Ward and Non-entry excluded: yet the Heir may enter to the Property, and compel the Superiour to receive him.</p>

Terce is the third of the Tenements, in which the Husband died infeft, as of Fee provided to his Wife surviving by Law or Custom, though there be no provision or paction for that purpose. The original hereof, as hath been shown before amongst the interest of Marriage, is from that obligation upon the Husband to provide for his Wife; which therefore positive Law hath determined to a third of his Moveables, if there be Children in the Family, and if there be none, to a half: but in either case, she hath a third of his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements. And though as <hi>Craig</hi> observeth, by our ancient custom, Terce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to a third of the Tenements a Husband had the time of the Marriage; yet since, it extends to a third of those he stands infeft in as of fee the time of his death; and so, when he is denuded before his death, the Terce is excluded. Yea, a base Infeftment without possession, granted by a Husband to his Creditor, was found to exclude his Wife from a Terce of that Land, <hi>January</hi> 27. 1669. <hi>Bell</hi> of <hi>Belford</hi> contra Lady <hi>Rutherford.</hi> This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of Law is more equitable and proportionable, then ordinarly are their provision by Contract of the Husband, who being carried with affection, doth oft-times provide his Wife to the prejudice of their Children, and ruine of their Estate, which this Terce keepeth alwayes proportionable, and maketh the Wife sharer of the Industry and Fortune of the man, and therefore more

careful over it; and upon the contrary, giving out but small Provisions to their Wives at their Marriage, when oft-times they do but begin to have Estates, which they increase not according to the increase of their Fortune; but the Law doth more fitly order the Wifes Provision to be increased or decreased, according to the condition of the man.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The Terce taketh place ordinarly, where the Husband died infeft as of Fee; and it hath no effect, till the Widow take Brieves out of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celery, directed to Sheriffs or Bailies to call an Inquest of fifteen sworn men, and thereby to serve the Brieve; which hath two Heads, the one, <hi>That the bearer was lawful wife to the defunct;</hi> the other, <hi>that he died in fee of such Tenemnts.</hi> This is a pleadable Brieve, and hath no retour; but Service alone is sufficient enough to give the Wife interest that other Liferenters have.

But Custom hath so far proceeded, as not only to allow voluntary provisions, how great soever, but therewith to add a Terce of any other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Tenement, unless the voluntary Liferent were accepted in satisfaction of the Terce, which indeed were reasonable in many cases. The voluntary Liferent being oftimes small and suitable to the Estate the parties have when they Marry, but cannot make a <hi>rationabilis tertia;</hi> if by Conquest, their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state should grow great, neither is it reasonable, that though the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary provision be never so great, that a Terce should be given, though litle remained to the Heir, only because by Ignorance or negligence, the clause in satisfaction were not adjected: Which satisfaction may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be proved by Write, but by Presumption, from the design of parties, in the Contracts of Marriage, which are <hi>uberrimae fidei;</hi> For suppose, which is ordinary enough, that a Liferent of Lands are provided by the Contract of Marriage; yet some Lands are not mentioned, but there is a Clause adject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Liferent of the whole Conquest, were it <hi>rationabilis terlia,</hi> to give the Wife a third of that which is omitted, though she had a particular Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of more, and the whole Conquest, though never so considerable; Yea, it came lately to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <pb n="339" facs="tcp:109710:192"/>SERVITUDES are distinguished in Real and Personal, though neither of them be personal Rights; yet these Servitudes whereby one Tenement is subservient to another Tenement, and to persons only as having Right to, and for the use of that Tenement, are called real Servitudes, as not being subservient directly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but to things: And the other are called Personal; because thereby the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement is subservient directly to Persons, and not with respect to any other thing, as Liferents, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Before we come to the particular kinds of these real Servitudes, it will be fit to enquire how such Servitudes are Constitute; and next how they are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute and Ceass.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to the first, these Servitudes require no Infeftment, though they may be Constitute by Infeftments, yet there is no necessity of Infeftment, to their Constitution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Real Servitudes cannot be Constitute by any personal Right, as by Contract, Paction, Testament or Legacy, neither by Disposition or Assigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone; the reason is, because they are real Rights, and cannot be Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute by any personal Right, which though they be oftimes the remote cause of real Rights, yet there is more requisite to their Constitution; and therefore, though such personal Rights may be sufficient against the granters thereof, by a personal Objection, whereby they cannot come against their own deed, yet they are not sufficient against singular Successors, neither do they affect the Ground.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> All real Servitudes are Constitute by Possession or Use; for things corporeal are said only to be Possest; therefore Incorporeal Rights, as Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes have rather use then Possession to Consumate them, which though it be the last requisite to accomplish Servitudes, yet is not sufficient alone, but must have another Title, either by the express consent of the Proprietar, or by Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; there is no difference in what way the consent be adhibite, so it be in Write; and the Obliegement to grant any Servitude with Possession, is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to the formal Disposition or grant thereof, as it is in the most of these Rights, which do essentially require nothing else, but Consent alone, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with Possession, and not any other Solemnity, as Obliegements to grant Assignations, Discharges, Renunciations, are equivalent to these Rights them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when formally made.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Civilians</hi> debate much, whether Servitudes can be introduced by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, and whether in that case there be requisite a Title and the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:109710:193"/>
Knowledge, wherein we need not insist, seing our Prescription be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only by Statute upon the course of fourty years, in most cases presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both a Title and Knowledge, but theirs being upon ten years, against those who are present, may require more, yet many, even of the learnedest of them, account Prescription sufficient, without Title, or any other then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed Knowledge.</p>
                     <p>With us, the Servitude of a way to the Kirk, was not found Constitute by Possession thirty years, but by immemorial Possession, going and coming that way uninterrupted, without any Write; for here the way was claimed at the nearest to the Kirk; whether the Desenders Lands were under Cropt or not: For though a way to the Kirk be due to all parties in the Paroch, without Consent or Prescription, yet it must be with the least detriment to the interja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Lands, and so cannot always be the nearest way, but must go about Corns; and though thirty or fourty years Alternative, was not sustained to Constitute a way thorow Lands, even under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Servitudes are also extinct by Prescription of Liberty; for as Servitudes by Prescription take away the Liberty or free use of the Tenement servient: So Liberty is recovered in the same way; for though in the short prescription in the Civil Law, simple forbearance of the Servitude, will not import prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unless some contrary Acts that may hinder the use of it, were done by the Proprietar of the servient Tenement: Yet in our long Prescription of fourty years simple forbearance of the use may suffice, as presuming the will of the party to be, to relinquish the Servitude, and to suffer Liberty to be recovered; and when the Servitude is Constitute by Write, the same will be the effect, seing the Write and Obliegement prescrive not being used, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed fourty years.</p>

To descend now to the kindes of Servitudes, there may be as many as there are wayes, whereby the liberty of a House or Tenement may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained in favours of another Tenement; for Liberty and Servitude are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, and the abatement of the one, is the beeing or inlargement of the other.</p>
                     <p>Servitudes, in respect of the subject matter, are either in reference to City-Tenements, such as houses for Habitation, not for the use of Agriculture or Pasturage, whether they be in Towns or Villages, or not: And in Countrey-Tenements, such as Fields and Grounds, and all houses for the use thereof, as Stables, Barns, Byers, Kilns, wheresoever situate in Town or Countrey.</p>
                     <p>Servitudes upon City-tenements are very many, whereof we shall point at the prime; They are either positive or negative. A positive Servitude is that, whereby the servient Tenement is not only restrained of its liberty, but is constrained to suffer some things to be done to the behove of the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Tenement, contrary to its Liberty. Negative Servitude is, whereby the freedom of the servient Tenement is only restrained.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The prime positive Servitude of City-tenements is, the Servitude of support, whereby the servient Tenement is lyable to bear any burden for the use of the dominant; and that either by laying on the weight upon its walls, or other parts thereof; or by putting in Jeests or other means of support in the walls of the same, which the <hi>Romans</hi> called <hi>servitutem tigni immissi;</hi> or otherwayes, this Servitude may be, by bearing the pressure or putt of any
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:109710:194"/>
Building for the use of the dominant Tenement, as of a Vault or Pend, or the like: Such is the servitude of Superstructure, whereby any Building may be built upon the servient Tenement; like unto which is now frequent in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> when one Tenement is built above another at divers times; or divers Stories or Contignations of the same Tenement, are bought by divers Proprietars, and thereby the upper becomes a distinct Tenement, and hath a Servitude upon the lower Tenements, whereby they must support it.</p>
                     <p>The question useth to be moved here, Whether the owner of the servient Tenement be oblieged to uphold or repair his Tenement, that it may be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to support the dominant Tenement. There are opinions of the learned and probable reasons upon both parts; for the affirmative maketh the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rule, that when any thing is granted, all things are understood to be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith that are necessary thereto: So he who constituteth upon his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement, a Servitude of support, must make it effectual. And for the negative, Servitudes are odious, and not to be extended beyond what is expresly grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or accustomed, to which we incline; and therefore, it would be adverted how the Servitude is constitute, that if it appear, the Constituent hath granted this Servitude, so as to uphold it; or if by custom, he hath been made to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, not upon the account of his own Tenement, but of the dominant, he must so continue; and it is not only a personal obligation, but a part of the Servitude passing with the servient Tenement, even to singular Successors: But if it appear not so constitute, it will import no more then a Tolerance, to lay on or impute the burden of the dominant Tenement upon the servient, which therefore the owner of the servient neither can hinder nor prejudge; but he is not oblieged to do any positive deed, by reparation of his own Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement, to that purpose, but the owner of the dominant Tenement hath right to repair it for his own use, by reason of his Servitude, and the owner of the servient Tenement cannot hinder it; yet in what he thereby advantageth the servient Tenement, he hath upon the owner thereof the obligation of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, <hi>in quantum lucratus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it be objected, that within Burgh, the owners of the inferiour and supporting Tenements are oblieged to repair for the behove of the superiour Tenements, the owners whereof may legally inforce Reparation; yet, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth not this to be the nature of the Servitude, but a positive Statute or Custom of the Burgh for the publick good thereof, which is concerned in upholding Tenements. But mainly, the reason of it is, because when divers owners have parts of the same Tenement, it cannot be said to be a perfect division, because the Roof remaineth Roof to both, and the Ground support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both; and therefore, by the nature of communion, there are mutual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations upon both, <hi>viz.</hi> That the owner of the lower Tenement must up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his Tenement as a Foundation to the upper, and the owner of the upper Tenement must uphold his Tenement, as a Roof and Cover to the lower: Both which, though they have the resemblance of Servitudes, and pass with the thing to singular Successors; yet they are rather personal obligations, such as pass in communion even to singular Successors of either party.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The next positive City-servitude is, of Stillicides or Sinks: Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licide is the easing-drop which falleth off any house or building, or the rain turned off a Tenement either by dropping or by spout; concerning which, consider what may be done freely without any Servitude; for thereby it will easily appear, what Servitudes are competent herein. The
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:109710:194"/>
main question is, Whether the owner of any Ground may build Houses or Buildings closs to the march of his own Ground, whereby his easing-drop will fall upon his neighbours Ground, or if by spout, he may make the rain that falls upon his own Tenement, run over upon his neighbours. And though it may appear from that common rule, <hi>Cujus est solum, ejus est usque ad Coelum,</hi> that thereby the owner may build upon any part of his own Ground what he will, even though it be to the detriment of his neighbours prospect or light: yet, no man may dispose so upon his own Ground, as to put any positive prejudice, hurt or damnage upon his neighbours; as if he should alter the course of any River or Water, running within his own Ground, so that it cause an alteration thereof in his neighbours Ground, or by damming of the water, make it run upon his neighbours: And therefore, he may not so build upon his own ground, as by gathering the water from its natural way, he should make it fall together upon his neighbours ground; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, any neighbour might take away both the Profit and the Pleasure of his neighbours Tenement, or closs, by Spouts or Kennels carrying in the rain water thereupon in abundance. And albeit it be not so palpable in the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing-drop as in Spouts, what the neighbours detriment may be, yet the very Roof of the house is a considerable gathering of the water: and therefore, every man ought so to build, as that the drops of the building may fall upon his own Ground, which commonly in neighbourhood is counted two foot and a half within the Marches, according to the ancient Roman custom, <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctore Marciano.</hi> If it were not so, but that the first builder might build to his March, no question the second might do the like; and so there should be no way to convey the drop, without much detriment to both. And though ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might, by a Spout, keep the water from falling upon his neighbours ground; yet, that Spout might fail, and at least his neighbonr be put to the trouble of an Action, to cause him keep it right, which his neighbour cannot inforce upon him. But, as the <hi>Romans</hi> account it as a delinquence, &amp; <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num infectum,</hi> as a damage like to befall, though not befalling when any thing was built, to hang over the high way, or whereby a neighbour might have probable damage: and therefore, either caused the doer to demolish it, or to find Caution not to damnifie his neighbour: So from that same ground of equity and expediencie, it ought to be in this case. There is an exception here of Towns and Villages, which for common conveniency, do allow Houses to be built closs together, which is tacitly imported in the incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Towns, or union of Villages, in which, the custom of the place must be the rule.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. What hath been said of Stillicides, holdeth more apparently in Sinks, either for conveying of water-filth, or any thing else, upon or thorow the neighbours Tenements, which cannot be done, unless there be a Servitude thereupon either by consent or prescription.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Negative Urbane Servitudes, do chiefly concern the light view or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Tenements; for the owner of every Ground may build thereupon at his displeasure, though thereby he hinder the view and prospect from his neighbours Tenement, or the coming of the Sun-beams or light thereto, which being but in relation to the extrinsick benefite of that which is not in, but without the Tenement, is not accounted a positive damage, from which the owners of neighbouring Tenements must abstain, as in the case of Stillicides and Sinks, and so much the rather; for common utility would be highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, if the first builder might hinder his neighbour to build upon his own
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:109710:195"/>
Ground, upon pretence that thereby his light or prospect were hindred; So that it is free for the owner to build what he will, though thereby he darken his neighbours Tenement. For helping the inconveniency that may ensue by this liberty of building, two Servitudes use to be introduced, both restraining the owners liberty; the one is, by giving light or prospect to the dominant Tenement, whereby the building upon the servient Tenement may neither be lifted higher, nor any building where there are none, or any Window or In-let, whereby there may be prospect from the dominant Tenement to, or through the servient, may be marred or altered: the other is, whereby the prospect or view of the servient Tenement is restrained, in that there may be no building thereupon, or Windows opened therein, which may look to the House, Closs or Garden of the dominant Tenement.</p>
                     <p>These Servitudes of light or prospect cannot be introduced by the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and use thereof, though time out of minde: but there must be either consent or prescription, by hindering the owner of the servient Tenement to use his freedom; for the first builder, though he have light or view for an hundred years through his neighbours ground, doth not thereby nut a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude upon his neighbour; but if he have been in use to hinder his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to take away that prospect in any lawful way, by reiterat acts during the time of prescription. And therefore, though two Purchasers bought Houses from the same Owner, neither of them was found to be astricted not to build as high as they pleased, albeit to the prejudice of the light and view of the other, <hi>Hope</hi> Servitudes, <hi>Somervel</hi> contra <hi>Somervel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Predial or Countrey Servitudes, whereby one Ground or Field is subservient to another, may be as manifold as the free use of the one may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained or impaired, for the profite or pleasure of the other; the chief of which in use with us are Wayes, Watering, Watergangs, Fewelling, Pasturage, Thirlage.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Wayes are a part of the reservation from Property, and the necessary vestige of the ancient community of the earth: Of which before, <hi>Tit.</hi> 12. § 16. and, which are understood as the common pertinents of all grounds, free Ish and Entry are implyed in the very right of Property, though not exprest: but that doth not infer Wayes or Passages from every part of the dominant Ground, thorow every part of the servient, which would make both unprofitable, but it must be in the way, lest hurtful to either. And now by long custom it is every where determined, and can be no further claimed, then according to ancient custom: and it is a necessary effect of Property, rather then a Servitude, seing it is mutual and equal to either ground, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one cannot be called dominant and the other servient, untill custom or consent have so determined, that the wayes which are constitute are more profitable to one Tenement, and more burdensom to another, whereby this becometh the servient, and that the dominant.</p>
                     <p>Wayes are distinguished by the Romans, according to the measure or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densomness of them in three kindes: The first and least is, a Road for a man to walk or ride by, which they call <hi>Iter;</hi> the second called <hi>Actus,</hi> is a way for Carts; the third which retaineth the common name, is, whereby droves may pass. Of these, the greater comprehends the lesser; our custom sticketh not to this distinction, but measureth the way according to the end for which it was constitute, and by the use for which it was introduced, as having only a
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:109710:195"/>
Foot-road, or only a way for leading of Loads upon Horse-back, or a way for leading of Carts, or a way for driving of Cattel; It is observed according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. There is another Distinction of Ways amongst the <hi>Romans;</hi> and with us, in publick and private Ways; publick Ways are these which are consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute for publick use, and which go from one publick place to another, as from one Burgh to another; or from a Burgh to a publick Port; This is called a a High-way, And by the <hi>Romans,</hi> an Imperial or Pretorian way: And with us, the Kings High-way, for preservation whereof, there are express Statutes, <hi>Parliament</hi> 1555. <hi>cap.</hi> 53. <hi>Par.</hi> 1592. <hi>cap.</hi> 156. And this is patent to all the Leidges, without respect to any Land, yea and to all Strangers having freedom of Traffick.</p>
                     <p>Privat Ways are these which are Constitute by privat Parties, for private use, whereof both are, or at least one end is to a private place, and is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Servitude to the use of that place for which it is Constitute; So a Way, the one end whereof is at a publick Place; may be a privat way, if the other end thereof be from, or for the use of a private place; as a Way from a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat place to a City or Church, which doth not fall in to any publick Way; for in so far it remaineth private, and cannot be made use of, but for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove of the place or ground from which it comes; but it is not the largeness or latitude of the Way, that makes a publick or private Way: For a private Way may be as large as a publick. Private Ways are Constitute as other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitudes by Prescription, by going and coming that way uninterrupted, time out of minde, or fourty years without Write, or any other Right.</p>
                     <p>Private parties may repair these Ways becoming difficult; so an Heretor having a Way to the Kirk, and to a Royal Burgh, at a Foord where there was an old Bridge, was found (the Foord becoming difficult) to have right to rebuild the Bridge, though the one end of it was but upon his Land, and the other end upon his neighbours who withstood it, <hi>Nicol. de servitudibus,</hi> Sir <hi>James Cleiland contra Cleiland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. Watering is a Servitude of taking water, proper to one Ground for the use of another, whether it be for the Cattel of the dominant Ground, which is most ordinary, or for other uses thereof, and it doth ordinarly carry, a way for these Cattel to come to that Water thorow the Servient Ground; but if it be only a Way to publick Water in Rivers or publick Lochs, it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth nothing from the Servitude of a Way, unless with the Way, there be also the making use of the private Water in the Fountains, Ponds, or other places proper to the servient Ground.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. A Watergang is a Servitude, of conveying Water thorow the servient Ground, for the use of the Dominant; and if the Water be proper, and belong to the Servient Ground, the Servitude is the greater, but hath no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent name; such are the Aquaeducts to Milns and other uses; for without such a Servitude, Water may not be altered or diverted from its course, as was found, where the Water-course was the March betwixt the Heretors, that the one could not change its old Channel (though it returned thereto again) without consent of the other, though he alledged no prejudice, but the want of the pleasure of the Water, and Fishing of Trouts, and that thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he might make use of it upon his side, <hi>June</hi> 25. 1624. <hi>Ballantine contra Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoun.</hi> It was also found, that an Heretor might not divert the Water from
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:109710:196"/>
its own course upon his own Ground, to the prejudice of others having the right of Fishing therein, <hi>Hope, de actionibus in factum,</hi> Bairdie <hi>contra</hi> Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Feweling is a Servitude of suffering Fewel to be taken from the servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Ground for the use of the Dominant and Inhabitants thereof. And it is ordinarly in Peats, Turffs and Heather; and it doth necessarly import Fields to win the Feuel upon, and a way to bring it away, though these be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest. This Servitude is sometimes Constitute indefinitely upon a whole Moss or Muire, and sometimes upon a particular place thereof, and accordingly it is to be regulate by the consent or custom which did Constitute it. The like is in the Way for carrying the Feuel, which sometimes is a Cart-way, sometimes only a Load-way.</p>
                     <p>Feweling is presumed to be comprehended under Pasturage, though not exprest; as the Minor Servitudes are involved in the Major, yet this presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is taken off by contrary Custom, or express paction, for they are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable, <hi>asiter &amp; actus,</hi> are under <hi>via,</hi> there being no end nor Interest to hinder a man to go or ride, where a Cart or Drove doth pass; but where common Pasturage is Constitute, it is a several and separable Interest to break the ground for Fewel, Feal or Divet, which in so far exclude the other party, and appropriats that part of the Grassto the Feweler; and so it was found, that a Servitude of Pasturage introduced by fourty years peaceable Possession of the Pasturage, was not to be extended to Feal and Divet, seing the Acquirer was interrupted in these, <hi>February</hi> 15. 1668. Laird of <hi>Hayning contra</hi> Town of <hi>Selkirk.</hi> And where the Servitude was only Constitute for Feal, Divet, Clay and Stone, in a large Muir indefinitely, it was not found to hinder the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietar to rive out a part of the Muire, leaving enough that might serve that Servitude for ever unplewed, and with condition, that if that sufficed not, more of the Muire should be left Lee again, wherein respect was had to the publick utility of making a large Muire to be profitable, <hi>June</hi> 21. 1667. <hi>John Watson contra</hi> Feuers of <hi>Dunkennan.</hi> The like was found in a Servitude of Few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elling upon a Muire of vast bounds, that it did not hinder the Proprietar to Plow: But the most convenient places for Fewelling were appointed to be laid aside, as they were adjacent to the Dominant Tenements, so that they might be secure of perpetual Feweling, which the proprietar might never plow, <hi>January</hi> 20. 1680. Earl of <hi>Southesk contra Melgunt</hi> and others. But in all these by the nature of the Servitude, they should not be extended further then for the use of the Dominant ground, and so not applicable by the Heretor of the Dominant ground, to any other not inhabiting the Dominant Field; yet if Custom and Prescription hath been to the contrary, it over-rules all; and so it was found, that an Heretor or his Tennents, having right to a common Muire, not only might win Fewel there for his own use, but sell it to others, <hi>June</hi> 21. 1611, <hi>Moniemusk contra Pitfoddels.</hi>

Pasturage is a Servitude, whereby the Grass of the ground servient, is applyed to the use of the ground Dominant, and this sometimes reacheth to the full benefite of the Grass; so that the Proprietar hath no share thereof, but the benefite of the Tillage and other pertinents beside the Grass, whereby he may Till when he pleaseth, or open the Ground for other effects of Property, as to win Coal or Stone, unless by consent or Custom it be otherways regular; but so far as remains Grass, belongs wholly to the other.

                     <p>Pasturage being constitute in reference to the Dominant ground, though it be indefinite and promiscuous, must be regulate and proportionat according to the use of the several Dominant grounds, having right thereto proportional to the Rent thereof, or the Goods it may hold, and Fodder in Winter.

                     <p n="15">15. The chief and most frequent Servitude in <hi>Scotland</hi> is Thirlage, or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction of Lands to Milns, wherein the Miln is Dominant, and the Lands astricted are servient. For as hath been shown before, a Miln is a distinct Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement from Land, and is not comprehended under the name of part and pertinent thereof, unless there be an Erection in Barony, Lordships, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Milns at first were built, as sometimes they are yet, without any astriction or Thirlage, but only to gain by the Work thereof, an equivalent hire, and so it is a voluntary personal Contract of Location and conduction, none being oblieged to grind their Grain thereat; but such only come as please, and for such hire as parties do accord: Yet these who come to a Miln without astri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and without express paction, are understood thereby to agree to the ordinary Multures of Corns not astricted, which are called <hi>Outen-Town-Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> But now most Lands are astricted to certain Milns, and for a certain quantity of Multure, far beyond the value of the work or grinding of the Corns; but upon other considerations, whereby it is a part of the Rent of the Lands astricted, as when an Heretor astricts his own Tennents to his own or anothers Miln, it is a part of their Rent, for the more Multure they pay, they pay the less Rent; and so it is alike to them, whether it be great or small, or otherways. When a Superiour gives out Lands upon condition of Thirlage, the Multures are a part of the <hi>reddendo</hi> or price: and it is a general rule, that none can thirle Lands but he that is Fiar, and hath power of disposal thereof; and therefore, astriction though it be not favourable, but hath the ordinary <hi>odium</hi> that other Servitudes have, yet it is not to be accounted an unjust and intollerable Bondage.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. There are many questions about Thirlage, which may be reduced to these two heads; first, How Thirlage is constitute and instructed. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, How far it is to be extended; As for the first, we shall proceed from the ways more evident to these, which are more dubious; and first positively, and then negatively.</p>
                     <p>The first and most unquestionable way of constitution of Thirlage is, when an Heretor Thirleth his own Lands to his own Miln, by consent of his Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, whereby the Multure becomes a part of the Rent. Secondly, When an Heretor dispones his Lands with express condition of Thirlage thereof to his Miln, or to any other Miln. Thirdly, When the Heretor of Milns or Lands, Feues and dispones the Miln with the Multure of his own Lands, <hi>per expressum,</hi> all these ways are not contraverse constitutions of thirlage, whether they be in an Infeftment, Contract, bond, or other personal right, for these being cled with Possession, are sufficient to constitute a Servitude, though the right of the Miln, being a separate Fee. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

As to the negative, first, Thirlage is not inferred by use of coming to the Miln, and paying Multures there at, though immemorial, even though the Multures payed were as great as the thirle Multures, <hi>March</hi> 13. 1635. <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi> contra <hi>Menzies.</hi> The reason hereof is, because such payment is but <hi>voluntatis, non necessitatis;</hi> and therefore, can no more infer a Servitude, then they who, past memory, came such a way to a Town, were astricted only to come that way: But Infeftment in a Miln, with the astricted Multures of such Lands <hi>per expressum,</hi> and fourty years possession of paying the insucken Multures, was found to constitute the Thirlage, though the Feuars were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feft <hi>cum molendinis,</hi> before the Feu of the Miln, and sometimes went to other Milns, which not being frequent, and for some whole years, was found but clandestine, and such as occurs in all Thirlages, and no legal interruption, <hi>June</hi> 29. 1665. Heretors of the Miln of <hi>Kythick contra</hi> Feuars.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Thirlage is not inferred, because the Lands are a part of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors Barony, having a Miln of the Barony, where the Vassals Infeftment contains <hi>cum Molendinis &amp; Multuris,</hi> or a Feu-duty <hi>pro omni alio onere,</hi> or such a Feu-duty allanerly, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 26. 1631. <hi>Oliphant</hi> contra Earl of <hi>Marshal.</hi> But where the Barons Disposition contained not these Clauses, his giving a subaltern Infeftment of a part of his Barony, which part was thirled to the Miln before, it was not found liberat, but continued thirled to the Miln of the Barony, though the Miln and Multures of the Barony were disponed thereafter to another, <hi>July</hi> 17. 1629. <hi>Newlistoun</hi> contra <hi>Inglis.</hi> For, if the Vassal had acquired that part of the Barony with the Multures, it would have been exprest particularly or generally, seing thereby the seller behoved to diminish the rental of his Miln.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Thirlage of a Barony or any part thereof, was not inferred by a Disposition or Infeftment of a Miln granted by the Baron, though it be the only Miln of the Barony, seing he expressed not it to be so, nor expressed any Lands nor the Multures thereof, but only dispo ed the Miln with the perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, <hi>July</hi> 12. 1621. <hi>William Douglas</hi> contra Earl of <hi>Murray.</hi> In this case, there were several acts of Court thirling the Tennants, and long possession, which was not insisted on, but only the act of Court, which was not found sufficient, seing it was only by a Bailie, without warrand or consent of the Heretor, albeit cled with fourty years possession. But, a Decreet against the Tennants for astricted Multures, and immemorial possession, was found to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute Thirlage to the Miln of the Barony, albeit the defender was infeft <hi>cum molendinis,</hi> prior to the Infeftment of the Heretor of the Miln, and did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times go to other Milns, but clandestinely, and sometimes was brought back by force, <hi>June</hi> 24. 1665.

                     <p>Fourthly, Thirlage is not inferred by any deed of Tennants, Possessors, Wodsetters, Liferenters, or any other but the Fiar; and therefore, there will be no Process sustained against the Tennants for Multures, unless the Fiar be called, <hi>February</hi> 9. 1628.

                     <p>Fifthly, Thirlage of Lands to another mans Miln, doth not infer a Thirlage
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:109710:198"/>
of the Teinds of these Lands, though acquired by the Heretor who thirled the Lands, <hi>July</hi> 7. 1635.

                     <p n="18">18. The next point proposed, was the effect and extent of Thirlage, being constitute, which is exceeding various; for clearing whereof, advert, That thirlage is either introduced and instructed by Custom and Prescription, or by Paction and Write; when it is by Prescription and Custom, it is wholly regulat by Custom, and the Heretor of the Miln and his Tennents, can get no more, and wil get less then they instruct to be their ancient custom, which holds where thirlage is constitute by write, but generally with the multures, sequels, and services used and wont, for then also custom must rule it, and the Heretor of the miln will not be put to prove what the custom was before that Write, though it relate to custom past; but long custom present will be sufficient presumption and proof of what was that preterit custom, if the contrary cannot be proven; and though it should be proven, yet fourty years possession will alter the case, and either increase the Servitude or the Freedom.</p>
                     <p>If the Servitude be constitute by Writ, special regard is had to the tenor of the Writ, which therefore varieth thirlage accordingly; So thirlage simply exprest in the Writ, without mention of all Grain growing upon the ground, was found to extend to all Corns growing thereupon, abstracted to other Milns, or sold, though they had payed no Multure past memory for sold Corns, <hi>June</hi> 26. 1635.

                     <p>Teinds, as the Word denoteth, signifieth the tenth of that which is Teind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and besides the civil Decimations that have been imposed by Soveraigns upon their Subjects, as a Tribute for defraying of publick Charges; there have been anciently and frequently Teinds granted for Sacred and Pious uses; So <hi>Abraham</hi> gave to <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> the Teind of the spoil of his Enemies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 20. <hi>Jacob</hi> voweth to God also the tenth of all that God should give him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 22.

The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens also did Consecrate their Teinds to their Idols, and payed them to their Priests: Thus <hi>Plinius, Cap.</hi> 14, and 19. observeth: And <hi>Herodot</hi> observeth in his first Book, the like of <hi>Syrus.</hi>

It hath run over the Christian World, and the Teinds of these Parochs have been payed to the Pastors and Ministers of the Church.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. From these and the like grounds, most of Papists, and some of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Divines, have concluded Teinds to be <hi>jure divino,</hi> as being Institute and Consecrate by God himself, having a moral and perpetual foundation, that these who are set apart from worldly affairs, to the service of God, should have a competent Liveliehood from these for whom they serve, but the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the <hi>Quota,</hi> to be the tenth part rather then any other proportion, is a positive Law that God manifested, and was observed before the written Word; and was retained by the Heathens, even after they had deviat from the true God: But most of the Protestant Divines, hold Teinds to be the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Dedication and Consecration of men, for Pious uses, and to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in a tenth part from the example of <hi>Abraham, the father of the faithful,</hi> and of the Divine Constitution, in the Judicial Law; but there is no Divine moral Precept in the Word for Teinds, of which there is no mention in the New Testament, even where the mentainance of Ministers is purposely spoken to; but only that these who <hi>serve at the Altar should live by the Alter. That these who sow Spiritual things, should reap Temporal things,</hi> which doth hold forth a moral duty of Recompense, to provide a competent Liveliehood for these who are separat from the World for our cause, but doth not infer a tenth part or any other determinat proportion, but what is convenient.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Teinds are defined by the Canonists, to be a tenth part of all profites and increase; and they are of three kinds, personal, predial and mixed: Personal are the Teinds of the profite of personal industry, as by Trading, Negotiation, Artifice, Science: Predial are of the natural Fruits of the Ground or Water: mixed are of the Industrial Fruits of the Ground.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But our custom alloweth of no personal Teinds; and of these predial and mixed, such only which have been in use, according to the Custom of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places; such are Teind Fish, for which the buyers of the Fish were found liable, because of that custom past memory, <hi>February</hi> 15. 1631. <hi>Brice Semple</hi> and <hi>Schaw contra Brown.</hi> But where the Fishers were fourty years in Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Fishing, without Teind, in such a Bay, it was found sufficient to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate them, <hi>November</hi> 24. 1665.

About the time of Abolition of Popery in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Popish Clergie did grant more frequently long Tacks of their Teinds: the King also gave Donatives of Teinds and erected them with Church-lands into Barronies and Lordships, so that there remained little of them, no way able to entertain the Ministers; and much Contraversie was like to arise about them, till all parties having interest submitted and surrendered the same to the King. First, By the general surrender of Erections and Teinds, Secondly, By a particular surrender of some Beneficed persons. Thirdly, Of the Bishops. Fourthly, Of the Burrows. The King, upon the 2. of <hi>September</hi> 1629.

therefore, the Titular or the Tacks-man of the Teinds, having perpetual or hereditable Right, should sell the same to the Heretors, at nine years puchase; and where the Right was temporary or defective, the price thereof should be made less accordingly.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. And for that effect, a Commission was granted for valuation of Teinds, and for disponing thereof as aforesaid, and for modifying and localling Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendsto the Ministers: His <hi>Majesty</hi> reserved to Himself only a yearly Annui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ten shilling Scots out of each Boll of Wheat and Barley, eight shilling of Pease and Rie, six shilling of Oats where the Boll rendered a Boll of Meal, and proportionally less where it rendered less: these Decreets were Ratified and prosecuted by several Acts of Parliament, 1633. <hi>cap.</hi> 8, 15, 17, 19.

The Commission did also give power to value the Teinds, that the Annuity might be known, and to uplift and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone for the bygone, and the Current Annuities until they were sold, and accordingly Collectors were appointed by the Earl of <hi>Lowdoun,</hi> in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places of the Kingdom.

of <hi>Lowdoun,</hi> after his Fathers death, who did make some progress therein, in the same way as his Father had done, but a stop was put thereto by the Kings Warrant, in <hi>anno</hi> 1674. which doth yet still continue: and with this stop, by a Proclamation from the King, all the arrears of the Annuity before the year 1660. were simply Discharged.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The Rule prescribed by the King, for valuation of Teinds, to fix them to a constant yearly duty, was this, that where the Teinds were severally known from the Stock, and set by Tack or Rental, the same should be also valued severally, deducing a fifth part for the ease of the Heretor, because fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Church-men had drawn the rate of the Teind above the just va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, by their Stocked and Rental Bolls: But where the Stock and Teind were not severally known, the fifth part of the Rent was decerned to be for the Teind.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Teinds by the Canon Law, were all constitute into Benefices, which follow the several Offices in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which were either Prelacies or inferiour to Prelacies: Prelacies were the sewho had Chapters and Convents, And therefore, one had the Prelacy or preserence amongst the rest of their Colleagues, such were Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Prioresses: Abbots and Priors had the Prelacy amongst the Mouks, of several Monasteries, as the Prioresses had over the Nuns.</p>
                     <p>There were also some few Monasteries which keeped the name of Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or Ministries, and the Prelate was called Minister, of which there are four in <hi>Scotland;</hi> the Minister of <hi>Fale, Peebles, Scotland-wall,</hi> and the <hi>Trinity-friers</hi> of <hi>Aberdene:</hi> Next unto these, were the Provosts of Collegiat Kirks, insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for singing of Mess, specially for their Founders and Patrons; these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vosts governing their Prebend, who were skilful in Musick, and had their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Stalls in which they sat, for the more orderly singing of their parts of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, from which these Prebends were designed of the first, second, or other Stall. Some of the Colledge-Kirks were founded by the King and great Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: The Chapel-Royal is a Collegiat-Church, Governed by the Dean of the Chapel; which Office is now annexed to the Bishop of <hi>Dumblain,</hi> under whom are the Prebends of the Chapel-Royal.

Viccars were either such as were substitute by Parsons and other Clerks, or such as had a distinct Office; and therefore, were not changeable by their Constituents, and were called Viccars of cure <hi>cum cura animarum;</hi> or perpetual Viccars: Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains were Clerks, having <hi>curam</hi> institute for their accommodation who were far from ordinary Churches; and therefore, were Erected upon the Expenses of the Founders, who were therefore Patrons; and of all other Patrons suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to have greatest interest in these Benefice; so that after the Reformation, these Chaplanries and Prebendaries, were declared to return and be disposed upon by their Patrons, to Bursers of Colledges, <hi>Par.</hi> 1592. <hi>cap.</hi> 158. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Prebendars were such as had Prebendam or a Benefice, which was at first a common name, but was made special by use to these Clerks, who had no other special name.</p>

Though these Offices were abolished by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, there was no other way fallen upon, for managing of Benefices, but by giving Secular persons the Designations of these Offices, who therefore were called Titulars, because they had the naked Title without the Office of Bishops, Priors, Abbots, Provests, &amp;c. who in Lieu of the consent of Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Convents, appended only the common Seal thereof; and when Bishops were set up again, and Chapters appointed for them, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the major part thereof was requisite, with the Seal; Yet it was not necessary that they should be Chapterly conveened, <hi>Parliament</hi> 1606. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</p>

The interest of Bishops in their Benefices, is much alike with Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters as to their entry, which is regulat by their Consecration or Translation, which if before Whitsonday, gives them the benesit of that year; and if after Whitsonday, it gives them the half. During their incumbence, they have not only the Fruits and Rents of the Benefice, but the power to set Tacks for nineteen years, with consent of their Chapters, <hi>Vide</hi> § 17. and to receive Vassals, and to constitute Commissars; all which are effectual after their death or removal.

In all which, the Ministers interest is of two kindes; for either he hath the Benefice, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage or Viccarage, or hath only a Stipend modified thereof; for these Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices did ordinarly belong to the incumbents of particular Paroches, and sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Office of serving the Cure there: and therefore, when these Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were not erected in Temporal Baronies and Lordships, or otherwayes so affected by Titles, Tacks or new Erections, that the Ministers thereby could not have a competency, they betook themselves to the Benefice, and had the same Right and Priviledges as to them, as beneficed persons formerly had, and might set Tacks thereof in the same way, and with the same restriction, as is before declared. But more frequently, the Ministers had modified Stipends, which were appointed by the King and Parliament to be modified out of the Teinds, whatever the Title or Interest of any other person were therein; which they could not reach, if they took them to the Benefice it self, as they might have done by the Act of <hi>Par.</hi> 1581. <hi>cap.</hi> 102.

The Interest of Ministers was according to the nature of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices whereunto they were to have right, or out of which their Stipends were to be modified; for all Kirks were either Patrimonial, or Patronat, and by clearing Patronage, it will easily appear what Kirks are Patrimonial: For, this distinction is taken from that of persons in the Civil Law, in these who are <hi>ingenui</hi> or fully free, and <hi>libertini</hi> or become free, but with some acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements and services to the Authors of their freedom, who were therefore called their Patrons: So there stood the like relation betwixt Patrons and Kirks patronat, as betwixt Patrons and Libertines, the ground whereof was an eminent good deed done by the Patron or his Predecessor to that Kirk, especially these acknowledged in Law,

Signifying the building of the Church, or giving of the Stipend, or of the Ground necessary for the Church, Church-yard, Manse or Gleib, were the grounds for constituting the Patronage, which were sufficiently instructed by custom of the Kirks, acknowledging such a Patron.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Patronage is also, either Laick or Ecclesiastick; Laick is that which belongs to secular persons; Ecclesiastick, that which belongs to Church-men, as when a Bishop hath the right of presentation to a Kirk, not in his own Diocess; there he presents, but another must confer as Ordinar, and so he is but Ecclesiastick patron.</p>

                     <p>Ecclesiastical Benefices were so ordinarly patronat, that there were scarce any free, but all were presumed o be patronat; and where the right of patronage did not appear to be established in any other, the Pope was presumed patron before the Reformation; and after the Reformation, the King is presumed patron, <hi>jure Corona,</hi> where the right of another patron appeareth not. There are other patronages belong to the King, <hi>jure privato,</hi> as when the King or his predecessors acquired any rights of patronages from any private person; or when the King or his predecessors founded or doted the Benefice; or when any Lands or Baronies fall in the Kings hand as Superiour, by recognition or forefaulture, all such having annexed thereto, or comprehended therein, the Advocation, Donation and Right of patronage of any Kirk, the King doth thereby become patron; all those patronages are at the Kings dispose, and transmissible to any Subject by the Kings proper deed, either annexing or incorporating the same in Baronies or Lordships, or by distinct Gifts, for the patronage doth ordinarly pass as annexed to Lands, Charters of Burghs, Baronies, or Lordships, yet they may pass without Infeftments, as <hi>jura in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporalia.</hi>

                     <p>The Patronages of all Bishopricks belong to the King, who designs the person to be Bishop, and though the Chapter may use the formality of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they do not refuse the Kings Designation: The order of this Election is prescrived, <hi>Parliament</hi> 1617. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. where the Dean and Chapter are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to choose the person, whom the King pleases to nominat and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, he always being an uctual Minister of the Kirk, who being Elected, hath sufficient right to the Spirituality of his Benefice, but not to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porality, till he have a Charter from the King, and do homage, and swear obedience to him; but the Arch-bishop of Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> is to be elected by the Bishops of <hi>Dunkel, Aberdene, Brichen, Dumblane, Ross, Murray, Orknay, Caithness,</hi> the Principal of Saint <hi>Leanards</hi> Colledge, the Arch-Dean of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> the Viccars of Saint <hi>Andrews, Leuchers</hi> and <hi>Couper,</hi> or most part of them, <hi>Parliament</hi> 1617. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. And by the same Act the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow</hi> is to be Elected by the Bishop of <hi>Galloway, Argile</hi> and <hi>Isles,</hi> and the ordinar Chapter of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> or most of them, the Bishop of <hi>Galloway</hi> being Conveener of the Electors; and now the Bishop of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> since that Bishoprick was Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, is by the Erection made an Elector and Conveener.</p>
                     <p>The King is also Patron of many Laick Patronages, and there are several other Laick Patronages belonging to Subjects, Ecclesiastick Patronages belong now only to the Bishops, to whom some Kirks are patrimonial or Mensal, the Fruits whereof are a part of the Bishops Benefice, and the several Paroch Kirks are not distinct Benefices, but <hi>partes beneficii,</hi> but most be served by the Bishop himself, or a Minister who is a Stipendiary, and by the 19. <hi>Act Parl.</hi> 1633. all Ministers are appointed to be provided with sufficient Stipends, being eight Chalders of Victual, or eight hundereth Merks at least, except in singular cases, referred to the Commissioners for plantation of Kirks, who are authorized as Commissioners of Parliament, to value Teinds, modifie Stipends, and grant Localities for fixing thereof upon particular Lands.</p>
                     <p>The Bishops have the Patronage of some Kirks without their Diocies, and do present to the Bishop of that Diocie, but if the Bishop should acquire any patronage of a Kirk within his own Diocie, that Kirk cannot be Patronat, but becomes free, and is conferred by the Bishop, <hi>pleno jure,</hi> for he cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to himself, yet by the Collation, the person Collated is not a Stipendiar, but is Parson or Viccar, and hath the full benefite of the Fruits, except in so far as they are restricted by Tacks, set lawfully by them or their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors.</p>
                     <p>The common Kirks which were to be provided by the Bishops and their Chapters in common, were not properly Patronat by Presentations, but by No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations and Collations, yet the Incumbents were not Stipendiaries, but enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed these Kirks as Benefices. But after the Reformation, when Bishops and Chapters were supprest, these common Kirks were declared to be of the same nature with other Parsonages and Viccarages, and to be conferred by Presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the lawful Patrons and Collation, whereby they become then Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; the King, or these to whom he gave right being Patrons; but after the Restitution of Bishops and Chapters, <hi>Parliament</hi> 1617. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. these common Kirks were restored to their ancient condition. Colledge Kirks were Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, whereof the King was Patron, except some few which belonged to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:109710:209"/>
Chaplainries, and Altarages were under Patronage of the Founders or their Successors.</p>
                     <p>Before the Reformation there were but few inferior benefices below Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, <hi>viz.</hi> Collegiat and common Kirks, Parsonage and Viccarages, which are but very few, and many be found by the Stent Rolls, whereby eveny Parsonage and Viccarage are Taxed apart, as distinct Benefices; the far greater part of all the Teinds of <hi>Scotland</hi> did belong to Prelacies, such as Bishopricks and Abbacies, and all the paroch Kirks which belong to them, are not distinct benefices, but a part of their patrimony, and were served by themselves, their Viccars, or their Substitutes, without any fixed maintenance, but <hi>ad placitum,</hi> so that there was no patronages of all these Kirks, and the ordinar provision thereof was, the Viccarage or small Teind, and sometimes Viccar pensions out of the parsonage Teinds.</p>
                     <p>After the Reformation all monasteries being supprest, they return to the King, <hi>jure Coronae,</hi> as to their whole benefices, both the Teinds or Spititua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and Lands and Baronies or other Temporal Rights; but the King gifted the most part of these benefices, both Spirituality and Temporality, to the Nobility and Gentry, and Erected the same in Temporal Baronies and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, but with burden of competent provisions to the Ministers of all the Kirks, which were parts of the patrimony of the saids great benefices, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Lords of Erection, coming in place of these Monasteries, had right to all the Teinds of the Kirks, which were the patrimony thereof; and the Abbots and Priors, did nominate their Viccars in these Kirks, so the Lords of Erection did nominate the Ministers to the same, and presented them to the Church-men, to be tryed and admitted, and thereupon assumed the Title of patrons, though properly they were not such, because the Ministers had no benefices, but were Stipendaries, having no Rights to the Fruits till the year 1587. when the Temporalities of all benefices belonging to Arch-bishops, Bishops, Priors, Prioresses, or whatsomever Ecclesiastical benefite belonging to any Abbay, Cloister, Friers, Monks, Channons, Common-kirks, and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiat kirks, were annexed unto the Crown, with several exceptions, <hi>Act</hi> 29. <hi>par.</hi> 1587. and though that Act seem only to annex the Temporality then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to these Church-men, and not to extend to the Temporalities alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Erected to secular persons, yet by the exceptions of the many Erections therein contained, it hath been ever held as an Annexation of all the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities that did belong to these benefices: but the Spirituality or Teinds, are declared not to be annexed, but by the Act, 115, <hi>Parliament</hi> 1592. Erections either of kirk-lands or Teinds in Temporal Lordships, after the said Act of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexation, are declared null, except such parts and portions of the kirk-lands, already erected in Temporal Lordships, to such persons, as since the Act of Annexation, have received the honours of Lords of parliament, and have sitten and votted in parliament, as Temporal Lords, whence the question ariseth, whether that exception derogates only from this Act, or also from the said general Act of Annexation, but by the 195. Act parliament 1594. all Erections since the said general Act of Annexation, not excepted in the said Act, are declared null, which doth also leave a doubt as to to the Erections, preceeding the said Act of Annexation; and by the second Act, parliament 1606. Restoring bishops, it is declared for the better satisfaction of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Subjects and faithful Servants, whom His Majesty hath rewarded with Erections, Feues, patronages, Teinds and Confirmations of Teinds, patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages and other Rights of Abbacies, and that they may not be put in mistrust,

therefore ratifies the hail Erections, Infeftments, Confirmations, Patronages, Tacks, and other securities of Benefices, not being Bishopricks given, dispon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and confirmed by His Majesty, during the Parliament, 1587. before or sinsine, agreeable to the saids Laws and Acts of Parliament, and faithfully promits, <hi>in verbo principis,</hi> never to quarrel the same, which seems to give further ground to Erections, though qualified with that provision, that the saids Erections be conform to the Acts of Annexation and Laws made sinsine, whereby the same might only extend to the Erections, excepted and warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the said Act of Annexation, which excepts several Erections formerly made, and leaves some Kirk-lands to the Kings dispose, by subsequent Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: In this case did King <hi>James</hi> leave the condition of Kirk-lands, Teinds and Patronages.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> the first coming to the Crown, and being informed of the great Benefite His Father might have made by suppressing of Popery, and the Popish Benefices, if He had not gifted them away before He consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, did resolve to recover the same to the Crown; and therefore made a very ample Revocation of all Deeds done in prejudice of the Crown, or any of His Royal Progenitors, and in the year 1627. there was a Reduction in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of all Erections of Kirk-lands, Teinds, Patronages, which did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to whatsomever Abbacy, Priory or other Benefice, and Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Ratifying the same, with all Infeftments of Heretable Offices or Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities: Which Revocation and Process having made a great noise, the King gave Commission to several Noblemen, and others, to endeavour an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with these who had right to Erections, or any right to Kirklands or Teinds, whereupon there was a Submission made by many persons who had right to Kirk-lands and Teinds, containing a Procuratory of Resignation in the Kings hands, <hi>ad perpetuam remanentiam,</hi> of the Superiority of all Lands, and other Temporal Rights, pertaining to whatsomever Erection of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porality of Benefices, reserving and excepting the Property of all the saids Lands, and others whereunto they had right, before or after; the saids Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, paying the ancient Feu-duties to His Majesty, that were payable to Kirk-men, and that such demains and mensal Lands of the saids Benefices, as were never set in Feu or Rental by the ancient Titulars, before the Act of Annexation, nor by the King, and were then possessed by any of the Lords of Erection, should be Feued to them and no others, for such Feu-duties as His Majesties Commissioners should appoint; they did thereby also submit to His Majesty, what satisfaction He should give them for the Feu-duties, and other constant Rent of the Superiorities Resigned; and all rights of Teithes that they had, that His Majesty might appoint the quantity, rate and price thereof, to be payed by the Heretors to the saids Titulars of Erection, with a burden of Annuity to the King, excepting the Teinds of the Surrenderers own proper Lands, being always subject to His Majesties Annuity: Which Submission His Majesty accepted, and there followed thereupon an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Resignation at <hi>Whitehall, May</hi> 14. 1628. There was also a Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made by the Bishops, of all Teinds belonging to them, or their Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Kirks, providing they be not damnified in their Benefices, as they were then possessed, either in quantity or quality, whether the samine were pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Rental Bolls, or drawn Teind, so that the Submission did only reach to Teinds that were in Tack, or other use of payment, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Bishops or beneficed Persons, were not then in Possession by Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Bolls, or drawn Teind; this Submission was in <hi>Anno</hi> 1628. There is also a Submission by the Burrows of their Teinds, in the same year; and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:109710:211"/>
a fourth Submission, by several persons having right to Teinds, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1629.</p>
                     <p>The King did pronounce His Decreet Arbitral, upon the Submission of the Lords of Erection, upon the second of <hi>September</hi> one thousand six hundred and twenty nine, whereby He Ordains the Lords of Erection to have ten years Purchase for the Feu-duties; and all their constant Rents, consisting of Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or Money; the Victual being reckoned at an hundred Merks the Chalder, deducing so much of the Feu-duties, as were equivalent to the Blensh-du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, contained in the Infeftments of Erection, for which nothing was to be payed; and allowing the Lords of Erection to retain the Feu-duties un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they were redeemed: His Majesty did also decern, that each Heretor shall have his own Teinds, that such as have right to other mens Teinds, shall after valuation thereof, whereby the fifth part of the constant Rent, which each Land pays in Stock and Teind, is declared to be the Teind; and where the Teind is valued severally, that the Heretor shall have the fifth part of the yearly value thereof, deduced for the Kings ease; and the price of the said Teind for an Heretable Right, was made nine years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase: And for other Right of Teinds, inferiour to Heretable Rights pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably according to the worth thereof, to be determined by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to be granted by His Majesty to that effect, and that both for Tacks of Teinds and Patronages. There are also Decreets by His Majesty upon the other Submission, to the same purpose, and by the tenth and fourteenth Act, <hi>Par.</hi> 1633. the Superiorities of all Kirk-lands are annexed to the Crown, except these belonging to Bishops, with the Feu-duties of the said Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, reserving to the Lords and Titulars of Erections, who subscribed the general Surrender of Submissions. Their Feu-duties till they be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ten years purchase, and reserving to them the Property holden of His Majesty, for payment of the Feu-duties contained in the old Infeftments, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the Annexation.</p>
                     <p>By the 12. <hi>Act Par.</hi> 1633. the King restricts his general Revocation in <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 1625. Registrate in the Books of Secret Council, <hi>February</hi> 9. 1626. in a Proclamation then emitted; and another, <hi>July</hi> 21. 1626. to the annul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all pretended Rights to the Property of the Crown, as well annexed as not annexed, whereof an account hath been made in Exchequer, and of the principality unlawfully disponed by His Predecessors, against the Laws and Acts then standing; and to the annulling of Erections and other Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of whatsoever Lands, Teinds, Patronages, and Benefices, formerly belonging to the Kirk, and since annexed to the Crown, and any other Lands and Benefices, Mortified to pious uses, and of Regalities and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Offices, and the change from Ward to Blensh or Taxt-ward, since the year, 1540.</p>
                     <p>Upon this progress it may be questioned, whether the Patronages that formerly belonged to Church-men, and were annexed to the Lands, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows or Benefices, and thereafter were erected in Temporal Estates, do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the King or Lords of Erection. And next, whether these more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Patronages of the Patrimonial Kirks of Abbacies, whereby the Lords of Erection coming in the Abbots place, do claim the Right of Presentation, or Nomination of Stipendiary Ministers to these Kirks, do belong to them or the King.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="375" facs="tcp:109710:211"/>As to the first, there seems less difficulty that the Patronage which did belong to Abbots of Kirks, which were not of their Patrimony, but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they had only <hi>jus presentandi,</hi> do belong to the King, because such Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages are annexed to the Crown, by the general Act of Annexation, which though it does not mention Patronages, yet the Barony or Benefice wherein such Patronages were comprehended, were expresly annexed: And Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or Benefice, being <hi>nomina universitatis,</hi> will comprehend Patronages In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate therein, or annexed thereto, so that without Dissolution, no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject can pretend right to the Ecclesiastick Patronages of Abbots, Priors, &amp;c. and as to the Lords of erection, who fall under the exceptions of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Act of Annexation, they having submitted and surrendered all their Titles of erection to the King, and particularly their Patronages; and thereupon the King having by His Decreet Arbitral, Ratified in Parliament, reserved only to them their Property, Lands and Teinds, and Feu-duties till they be redeemed; and the Superiority being again annexed, which is the <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium directum</hi> of these ecclesiastical Baronies, the ecclesiastick Patronage of the Abbots comprehended, <hi>in nomine Barroniae,</hi> do therewith belong to the King unless they have been Disponed after Dissolutlon; or a Subjects Title to the Advocation, Donation, or Right of Patronage of such Kirks, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by prescription; for the act of prescription, 1617. hath no exception of the Kings Right, to which the prior act that the King should not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged by the neglect of His Officers, doth not extend, but that interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on within the fourty year, is requisite even for the King, the form whereof was ordered by the Lords of Session, and approven by Parliament, 1633. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. But there is much more difficulty as to the other point concerning the Patronage of these Kirks, that were parts of the Patrimony of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, which before the Reformation were not Kirks patronat, but patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial; but thereafter being dissolved, and declared distinct Paroch Kirks. The Abbots power of nomination of Viccars in these kirks, became to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised by Presentations to the Kirks, which Presentations were given by the King to some Kirks, even where there were erections; but in most ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, the Lords of erection did present, as coming in place of the Abbots, and did in their Original or subsequent Right, insert the Patronage of some, or all of the Patrimonial Kirks of these Abbacies; and where the Right of Patronage is not exprest, the Lords of erection have but small ground to pretend to these; and where they are exprest and perfited by Prescription, they are secure, so that the question will remain as to the power of presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to the patrimonial Kirks of Abbacies, where prescription hath not cleared the question, but that sometimes the King, sometimes the Lords of Erection have presented, which was largely debated in <hi>November</hi> 1677. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Patronage of the Kirk of <hi>Allan,</hi> whereunto the Laird of <hi>Watertoun</hi> had presented as deriving Right to an erection prior to the Act of Annexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and having desired from the Council, Letters to Charge the Bishop to grant Collation upon the foresaid Act of Parliament, ordaining Bishops to try and Collate upon the Patrons presentation, the matter was remitted by the Privy Council, to the Lords of Session, in respect that the Officers of State, did claim right to that patronage, as belonging to the King, whereupon the Lords did at first, sist any further progress in admitting either the person pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the King, or by <hi>Watertoun,</hi> till the matter were discussed, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hearing, the Cause at length in their presence, <hi>Wattertoun</hi> having alledged that his Author had an erection, bearing the Patronage of this Kirk, <hi>per ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressum;</hi> and that such Patronages were not annexed to the Crown, because they were not comprehended in the Abbots Rights; such Kirks not being
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:109710:212"/>
then Patronat but Patrimonial, and that the King in his Decrect Arbitral had determined nothing anent Patronages, but that the Lords of erection had always enjoyed the same, and that the Lords of erection retaining the right of the Teinds, the patronage belong to them as consequent to the Teinds, out of which the provisions for the Kirk is payable, and it being answered for the King, that though the Abbots had not the formal Right of presentation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Kirks were not then patronat, yet they had the right of Nominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or substitution of the Viccars who served in these Kirks, in place of whom are now the Stipendiary Ministers; these new patronages arise form the Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of these Abbacies into distinct parochs, must belong to the King, and the power of nomination or presentation of these Stipendiars, was compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in, and annexed with these Benefices to the Crown, by the first Act of Annexation, but especially by the Annexations, 1633. whereby upon the surrender of the Lords of erection, of all their Rights, and specially of their Patronages; the King by his Decreet Arbitral, had decerned to them only ten years purchase for the Feu-duty, and nine years purchase for the Teind, they could pretend to no more, and so to no right of Patronage. Likeas the King in the Interruption made by the 12 <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> 1633. did express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare, that he will insist in his general Revocation, as to the particulars enumerat in the <hi>Act</hi> of Interruption, whereof patronage is one: In this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the Lords being desirous that the matter might be determined upon the clearest grounds, and to know if prescription had cleared the matter, and either party having alledged possession, the Lords before answer, Ordained either party to adduce all the evidence they could, whether the King or <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertoun</hi> and his authors had been in possession, how long and what way.</p>

                        <pb n="379" facs="tcp:109710:213"/>1. ATACk of it self is no more then a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Contract of Location, whereby Land or any other thing having profite, or fruit, is set to the Tacks-man for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the fruit or profite thereof, for a hyre, which is called the Tack-duty; which therefore did only obliege the Setter and his Heirs, to make it effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to the Tacks-man, but did not introduce any real Right, affecting the thing set, and carried therewith to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Successours.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But so soon as the thing set ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be the setters, the Tacks could not reach it: Thus it was with us tillthe Statute, <hi>Par.</hi> 1449. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. whereby purchasers and singular Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors were disenabled to brake the Tacks set to the Tennents: By this Statute, Tacks become as real Rights, affecting the ground: And because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come the length to be esteemed as Rights of Property, they are ranked here amongst Servitudes personal; for as Liferent-rights are real Rights, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Servitude upon Hereditaments to the person of the Liferenter, during life, whereof a Liferent-tack is a kind; so other Tacks do subject the thing set to the Tacks-man for a time, and affect the same, though it pass to singular Successors, albeit the Statute only expresseth, <hi>that buyers shall not break Tacks, and is in favours of the poor Labourers of the ground, for whose security it was chiefly intended;</hi> yet it is extended against all singular Successors, whether by Sale, Exchange, Appryzing, Adjudication, or any other way, as the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute beares, <hi>in whose hands soever the Lands come;</hi> and also in favours of all Tacks-men, <hi>whether they be labourers of the: ground or not;</hi> whereby Tacks are now become the most ordinary and important Rights; and if the great favour of this Statute made them not in other thingsto be strictly interpret, they would render Infeftments of small effect.</p>
                     <p>That we may proceed orderly in this matter, we shall consider; First, The constitution of Tacks. Secondly, The extent and effect of them. Thirdly, The kindes of them. Fourthly, The restricstions and defects of them. Fifthly, The avoiding and removing of them.</p>
                     <p>As to the First, Tacks are also called Assedations, as a setting or set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Tenement in the Land, the <hi>English</hi> call them Leasses. Some Tacks are also called Rentals, as being the constitution of a fixed Rent, and they are of longer endurance then ordinary Tacks, being of one or more Liserents, and have somewhat special in them, of which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As to the Constitution of a Tack, consider; First, Who may Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute it. Secondly, Of what. Thirdly, How. For the First, to the Constitution of an effectual Tack, the setter must not only have all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities requisite to Contract, but he must have right to the thing set, and
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:109710:214"/>
power to administrate, which being Tacks, may either be granted by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, if it be special, as to the Tacks, or at least as to matters of great importance; and a general Clause for others, or otherways by Tutors, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, or other Administrators of the affairs of others, concerning whom <hi>Craig lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Dieg.</hi> 10. moveth and removeth this doubt, whether Tutors, &amp;c. may set Tacks for longer time then during their Office, which he resolveth negatively, even though it were without the Minors Detriment, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ancient Tack-duty, seing he is so far hurt as not to have the free disposal of his own: The subject whereof, Tacks are ordinarly set are Lands; but it may be any other thing having fruite or profite, as a Fishing, an Office, or a Casuality.</p>
                     <p>As to the manner of Constituting Tacks, they must be considered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; First, As personal Rights. Secondly, As by the Statute becoming real; as they are personal Rights, the consent of the setter, and Tack-man agreeing in the rent, is sufficient.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But as Tacks are become real Rights, there is a necessity of write, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in a Tack of one year, which may be verbal, but if the agreement be for more years, the setter may resile; and though the Tacks-man be in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, if he resile, it will have no effect as to subsequent years, <hi>July</hi> 16. 1636. <hi>Alexander Keith Contra</hi> his Tennents; the like though the Tennent possessed and builded Houses conform to the agreement, yet the penalty of paying a years rent by the failzier to the observer, was found to stand, <hi>July</hi> 15. 1637. Mr. <hi>Andrew Skein contra</hi> But if once there be a Tack, the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters promise not to remove the Tennent during his life, was found effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, and not to be resiled from, <hi>Nicol. de migrando,</hi> Lumbsden <hi>contra</hi> Black.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The write requisite to constitute a Tack, requireth not many Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but if the thing set, the Parties, the Rent and the Time, be cleared, the Tack will be valid: It was ordinarly granted by the setter to the Tacks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for such a Duty, without any mutual obliegement upon his part, like unto a Charter; but because the Tennent not being bound, might at the end of any year before <hi>Whitsonday,</hi> renounce such a Tack and be free, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his favour, therefore they are now ordinarly by Contract, whereby the Tacks-man as well as the Setter, is oblieged to stand thereto.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Craig</hi> saith in the fore-cited place, <hi>Pactum de assedatione facienda, &amp; ipsa assedatio, parificantur, praecipue si possessio sequatur,</hi> which is unquestionable as to the setter and his heirs; and was also found against a singular Successor, by a personal obliegement in a Contract of Marriage, providing Lands to a wise, and warranding the same free of all Teinds, except such a quantity which was in use to be payed, whereby a posteriour Assignation to the Tack of these Teinds was excluded, <hi>March</hi> 20. 1629. Laird of <hi>Finmouth</hi> contra <hi>Weyms.</hi> The like of a Tack and Decreet Arbitral, decerning a Tack to be granted: This was in a Spuilzie, <hi>Hope,</hi> Spuilzie <hi>John Crawford</hi> contra</p>
                     <p n="7">7. As a Tack becometh a real Right, it must necessarily be cled with pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, but requireth no Seasine or Instrument, or other solemnity, <hi>July</hi> 11. 1627. <hi>Wallace</hi> contra <hi>Harvie, January</hi> 22. 1611. Laird of <hi>Pitsligo</hi> contra <hi>Philorth.</hi> The like, though the Tacks-man was in possession, yet not by vertue of the Tack, but by vertue of a Wodset, though the Tack was renewed the time of
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:109710:214"/>
the time of the Wodset, <hi>Hope</hi> removing, <hi>Walter Ord contra</hi> Tennents of <hi>Fydie;</hi> and therefore, a posterior Tack being first cled with possession, was preferred to a prior Tack, <hi>June</hi> 23. 1627. Mr. <hi>John Mcmillan contra Gordoun</hi> of <hi>Troquhan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. Yet a Tack after redemption of Wodsett Lands, is valide against sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Successors, as a part of the Reversion, though it attain no possession before the setter be denuded: But it is contrary in a Back-tack, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to follow a Redemption of an Annualrent for it, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p n="9">9. As to the extension and effect of Tacks, they are little less then of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftments, for thereby the Tacks-man is maintained against all parties having interest till the Tack be out-run, and be warned, even though set by a Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renter, it will maintain the Tennent against the Fiar, either from removing till warning, or from paying more then the Liferenters Tack duty, though it be small, <hi>July</hi> 6. 1610. Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce contra</hi> Captain <hi>Bruce.</hi> Yea, though the Tack-duty was elusory, set by an Appriser to a person being no labourer of the ground, <hi>February</hi> 3. 1631. <hi>Blaues</hi> contra <hi>Winrham.</hi> The reason why Tacks by Liferenters are effectual, for the year in which the Liferenter died; because by Act of Parliament, Tennents can only be warned to remove fourty dayes preceeding Whitsonday; So that if the Liferenters live till thirty nine dayes before Whitsonday, their Tennents cannot be removed, but brooks <hi>per tacitam relocationem,</hi> till the new time of warning.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. A Tack hath also the benefit of a possessory judgement upon seven years peaceable possession, as an Infeftment, without necessity to dispute the setters right, <hi>July</hi> 13. 1636. Bishop of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> contra <hi>Gilbert Brown,</hi> which was found where the Tack did bear to be granted by the setter as heretable Proprietar. Otherwayes, a Tack by a Liferenter, Tennent or Donator, might claim the benefit, <hi>December</hi> 1. 1676. Mr. <hi>Patrick Home</hi> contra Sir <hi>Laurence Scot.</hi> And therefore, if it were alledged, that the setter or liferenter had any other temporary title, it would be admitted without Reduction, if the Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renter or beneficed person granter thereof were dead.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. A Tack set by an Heretor for a Tack-duty to be payed to his Creditors, was found a real Right effectual to the Tennents; but whether it would be found a real right in favours of the Creditors in the same cause, it was first determined <hi>negativè,</hi> and thereafter <hi>affirmative:</hi> But it is not like, the Lords would continue it, not being the <hi>habile</hi> way to secure Creditors, and being a great mean of insecurity to purchasers, <hi>February</hi> 13. 1627. <hi>Samuel</hi> contra <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel.</hi> The negative is also observed by <hi>Spots</hi> Tacks, <hi>James Morison</hi> contra <hi>Brown</hi> of <hi>Nunlands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Tack was preferred to an Apprising, whereof the denunciation was fix dayes after the date of the Tack, though the Apprising was led before posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon the Tack, <hi>March 25. 1628.

                        <pb n="382" facs="tcp:109710:215"/>12. A Tack is a sufficient Title for Mails and Duties, and against all poffes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, and it is obligator against the setters Heir for the profit of the Land, though the Tacksman was never in possession, nor used diligence therefore during the setters life, which was a long time, <hi>July</hi> 13. 1610. <hi>Porterfield</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra <hi>Ker;</hi> and in some cases, it is a good title for removing.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. A Tack set by a Husband and his Wife, whereof the duty was payable to the longest liver of them two, found to give her right to the Tack-duty after his death against his Heir, though she had no other right of the Lands, and was otherwayes sufficiently provided, <hi>February</hi> 14. 1637. <hi>Home</hi> contra <hi>Hepburn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Tack set to a man and his wife for nineteen years, found to belong to the wife as Liferenter, if she survive, and not to be disposable by the Husband without her consent, <hi>Spots.</hi> Marriage, <hi>William Gourlay</hi> contra <hi>Jean Megill.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. As to the third point proposed, concerning several kindes of Tacks, they are either verbal or by write. Liferent-tacks are for certain years; ordinary Tacks or Rentals, principal Tacks or Sub-tacks, express Tacks or by tacite relocation; and these which are set by Wodsetters to the granters of the Wodset, are called back-tacks, amongst which there are few specialities but what concerns Rentals, Sub-tacks or tacite Relocations.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. A Rental is a Tack set to kindly Tennents, which are the Successors of the ancient possessors, or these who are received by the Heretor, with the like priviledge as if they were ancient possessors: And therefore, when Tacks are set to persons, acknowledging or constituting them kindly Tennents, they are equiparat to these that are set expresly under the name of Rentals.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Such Tacks are understood to comprehend more kindeness and friendship in the Tennent to his Master, then other Tennents; And therefore, the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taller may not assign them, nor introduce a sub-tennent, unless the Rental bear expresly that power, but may himself remain upon the ground as <hi>colonus,</hi> the same being in his own labourage. And Rentals are strictly interpret as to this point, but are more favourably extended then other Tacks, as to any other point; because of the kindness and friendship designed to the Rentaller thereby: and no Tack is accounted a Rental unless it bear so, or that the Teunent is acknowledged as kindly Tennent. And albeit after the expiring of Rentals, there successors have no right to maintain them in possession; yet frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of favour they are continued, and pay grass-sums at the renovation of their Rentals, wherein they have ordinarly considerable ease.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. And therefore, the ordinary Tacks must contain an express and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat endurance, otherwayes they are null, not only as to singular successors, but even as to the setter and his Heirs, because they are not constitute <hi>habili modo.</hi> And therefore, if they have no time, they laste but for a year; and if they have no determinate time of ish, they last no longer; and they do not ordinarly give power of Assignation or Sub-tack, unless this be exprest: Yet the granting of them does not annul the Tack, but only the Assignation or Sub-tack, without warrant annuls these, but they annul Rentals, like to the alienations ofWard-vassals.</p>
                     <p n="18">

Rentals do require write, not only as a probation, but as a solemnity in their constitution, and can be granted by none but the Heretor of the Ground; but if they be renewed by Tutors for the accustomed Grassums, it may be accounted as an Act of lawful administration, much rather then that Tutors should have power to expell the kindly tennents. It hath not come in controversie, whether Donatars of Ward, Non-entry, or Liferenters may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel kindly Tennents: Or whether their Title would not be relevant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in removings against them, though not against the Heretor, wherein this would make for them, that all these temporary possessors have not, <hi>plenum dominium,</hi> and can but make use of the Fee as the proprietars did, though they may out-put and in-put ordinary tennents.</p>
                     <p>The old Decisions have varied whether a Rental be sufficient, being in the Heretors Court or Rental Book, though the Rentaller can show no original subscribed by the Heretor; yet there are Decisions for it, more then against it, <hi>July</hi> 5. 1625. <hi>Maxwel contra Grahame.

Fifthly, Tacks are taken off by the contrary consent of both parties, though they be not expired, as when they are really left by the tennent, and possessed by the Master: Or when by write they are renunced and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for verbal renunciations may be resiled from before they be perfected in write, in the same manner as verbal tacks may, and much more promises to renunce; this way of renunciation is express and direct.</p>
                     <p n="36">36. Sixthly, Tacks are taken away by tacite and implyed renunciation, and by passing therefrom, as by taking a posterior tack for fewer years, and making use thereof, albeit but a minute, not by Contract, nor subscribed by the tacksman, nor in his hand, but his acceptance proven by witnesses, and by paying conform, <hi>January</hi> 17. 1632.

                     <p n="37">37. Tacks are taken off as to possession, by removing of the Tennents, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther voluntarly, as is before exprest; or more ordinarly, judicially by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of removing, which is most frequent and important; and therefore, is reserved to be spoken of together in this place, though there be diverse kinds of removings, having respect to diverse Titles; for though removing be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent against all Possessors, whether possessing without any Title, or by an insufficient Title, as an invalide Infeftment or the like, yet the rise thereof is for removing of Tennents.</p>
                     <p n="38">38. Removing is either summar without warning, or solemn upon warning; again summar removing is either by paction or Law; By Paction when it is so agreed by the Tack or other Write, that the Tennant shall remove at such a Term without warning, which will be sufficient at that time, <hi>Craig hic.</hi> This will hold upon Dispositions, whereupon the Disponer may be compelled to remove summarly without any such express Clause, which was also extended in favours of Appryzers, against their Debitors possessing a House, <hi>March</hi> 26. 1612. <hi>January</hi> 18. 1623. Earl of <hi>Lothian contra</hi> Sir <hi>John Ker</hi> and his Son. But it is more questionable, whether it will be sufficient at any time thereafter, if the Tennent be suffered to possess, <hi>per tacitum relocationem;</hi> especially, seing the Statute for warning is a publick Law, introduced for the good of poor Tennents, whose rusticitie is excuseable, if they advert not to anterior Pactions, <hi>Nam pacta privatorum non derogant juri communi:</hi> Yet upon the contrary, <hi>cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que libet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Summar removing is competent by Law without Paction, in all cases where the Statute appointing warning, takes no place, which is chiefly regulate by the reason of the Statute, that Tennents be not put at unaworse to seek their
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:109710:220"/>
habitations, or at an unseasonable time of the year; and therefore, it is not necessary in several cases.</p>
                     <p>First, where the Possessor is not Tennent, but a vitious Possessor; or where the Possessor hath nothing but an insufficient Infeftment or tollerance: For the Statute is only in favours of Tennents, who are lyable for Mails and Duties.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Warning was not found necessary for removing Possessor from a Tower or Fortalice, though set in Tack, <hi>Hope hic,</hi> Lady <hi>Saltoun contra</hi> Mr. <hi>William Livingstoun,</hi> or from a Coal, <hi>Ibid. Wolmet contra Niddrie.</hi> Or from the possession of a Liferenters House or Land, after the Liferenters death, and that upon suplication, it was obtained without Process, <hi>Hope</hi> Liserent, <hi>Prestoun contra Cockpen.</hi> And this was competent at the instance of a Liferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter against these who continued the possession of a former Liferenter, after her death, <hi>January</hi> 12. 1622. Lady <hi>Kincaid contra</hi> her Tennents.

Removing is also competent by sorce of of Law upon a Process, to find caution for the rent, or to remove; of which before. As to what is special in Tacks of teinds, hath been considered in that <hi>Title.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The prime kind of removing is that which is solemn upon Warning; for clearing whereof, we shall first consider the order pre-required. Secondly, The interest of the pursuer. Thirdly The exceptions of the Defender. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The effects of removing.</p>
                     <p n="39">39. The Order of removing of old was thus; The Master of the ground
did only verbally intimate to the Tennent to remove at the next <hi>Whitsonday;</hi> and the only solemnity requisite was, that before the said term he appeared before the door of the Tennent and broke a Lance there, as a Symbol of his breaking the tacite relocation betwixt them; whereupon the second day after <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonday,</hi> he came <hi>braevi manu,</hi> and expelled the tennent; or at least laid out some of his Goods to compleat the solemnity of his removing, <hi>Craig hic,</hi> Hence arose many quarrels, violences and breaches of the publick Peace; when the tennent had any reason or pretence, for which not to remove, or otherways was unwilling, and not compelled by Law or publick Authority, but by private force.</p>
                     <p n="40">40. <hi>For remeid whereof, that excellent Statute concerning warning and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of tennents was made,</hi> Par. 1555. cap. 39. <hi>prescriving the Order of removing thus;</hi> That the Master of the Ground give a Precept of warning in write, commanding his Officer (which may be any person he pleaseth) for whose name, a blank is set in the Precept, to go fourty dayes preceeding <hi>Whitsonday,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate to the tennent that he remove himself, his family, sub-tennents, goods and gear, at the said term, and leave the tenement void and red, that the warner may enter in Possession: <hi>this may be done either personnally or at his dwelling house.</hi>
                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="41">41. We come now to the <hi>Tit.</hi> requisite for removing, which must be a real Right of the ground, except the question be against a party who is person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally oblieged to remove; And therefore, first, there needs no Title against such parties, who had the possession from the pursuer, for these can never question his Title, whose interest depends thereupon, but acknowledging him by payment of Mails and duties, will not be sufficient without a Right in the pursuer.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a personal or incompleat right is a sufficient Title for removing against the granter of it, or his Heirs, if it contain a Clause to remove, or put the pursuer in possession, expresly or by consequence.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Infeftment of property or Liferent is a sufficient Title in remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that upon production of the Seasine only; where the Defender shows no better Right, <hi>Nicol.</hi> removing, <hi>Adam Wat contra Ord:</hi> But the Seasine must be both before the warning and the term, except first in the case of Heirs, this being a possessory judgement, and a continuance of the predecessors pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session; so that the Tennent cannot be in doubt or hazard to quite the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,

as he may be in other cases, where he may be lyable, both for the rent and rendering the possession to another party, and so it was sustained at the instance of an Heir, though his retour and Seasine were after the warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>February</hi> 9. 1610.

It was also sustained at the instance of a Fiar upon a Warning made by a Liferenter and Fiar joyntly, <hi>November</hi> 27. 1629. <hi>Ramsay contra Hoom.</hi> But a removing was not sustained upon a warning made by the Fiar, before the Liferenters death, no not to take effect at the next <hi>Whitsonday</hi> without a new warning, <hi>June</hi> 30. 1669. <hi>Agnew contra</hi> Tennents of <hi>Dronlaw.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though Infeftment be the best Title for removing, yet it must be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> It takes no place being upon Infeftment, proceeding upon a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of <hi>Clare constat, Hope hic, Stevinson contra Stevinson;</hi> and that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect this Precept is but the Assertion of the granter: Yet if either the Predecessour of that Heir was in Possession, or the Superiour himself, it would suffice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It holds not in base Infeftments, not cled with Possession, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Authors Right be instructed or acknowledged, if the Defender have any Title.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> a tack is a sufficient Title for removing, if it contain expresse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the power to out-put and in-put Tennents, or if it be a Liferent-tack, or for nineteen years or above, as hath been now shown amongst the effects of Tacks; but this must proceed either upon the setters Right or a Possesso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry judgement in the setter or Tacks-man.</p>

                     <p n="42">42. We come now to the Exceptions against removing, to speak nothing here of common Exceptions, or of thr pursuers want of a sufficient Title, which are rather objections then exceptions, and are sufficiently cleared by what we have said upon the Titles of Removing. It must be adverted, that before the Defender can have any exception admitted to his probation, he must find Caution for the violent profites, if he succumb: And that by the said Statute, 1555. <hi>Cap.</hi> 39. justly introduced in respect of the contentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of parties to keep possession; yet this will not hinder objections against the Titles or the like, being instantly verified and not making delay, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motive of that Act to prevent delays.</p>
                     <p n="43">43. These exceptions, though they be many, may be thus Martialled; they are first against the order and warning. Secondly, Upon deeds done by the Pursuer. Thirdly, Upon the interest of the Defenders Master. Fourthly, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Defenders own interest. Fifthly, Upon obedience.</p>
                     <p>For the first, every point of the warning now related, is so necessary that the omitting of any one affoordeth a sufficient defence; yer a warning was not found null, though made at a Kirk-door, where there were no divine service accustomed, being in the time that divine service used to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Kirk being known a distinct Kirk, <hi>Nicolson hic, Hoom contra</hi>

                     <p>Removing is also elided by prescription, upon three years forbearance to pursue; And that by the Statute, 1579. <hi>cap.</hi> 82. for thereby the pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is presumed to pass from his warning; but these three years are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, <hi>anni continui,</hi> but <hi>anni utiles:</hi> from the warning without account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time betwixt the warning and Term, but from the Term, to which the warning was made; because none can be said to delay to pursue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be necessitate to pursue, which is not till after the Term, it was so decided <hi>February</hi> 6. 1629. Lady <hi>Borthwick contra Scot</hi> of <hi>Goldilands.</hi> But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving may be sustained before the Term, that it may take effect precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the Term: Otherways many Tennents may be disappointed, who take upon the warning of other Tennents, their Rooms, and renunce their own, or are warned therefrom; and so removing was sustained before the Term, to take effect then, <hi>November</hi> 21. 1671. <hi>James Riddel contra Charles Zinsan.</hi> But the process being once intended, it continues till the great prescription of fourty years, except such as are not wakened every five years, for such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrive in ten years by the Act 9. Par. 1669.</p>
                     <p>The exceptions of removing at the instance of the Master of the ground, are very frequent and various; for it is ordinarly proponed and sustained, that the Defenders are Tennents by payment of Mail and Duty to a third party, who is not warned nor called; neither are they put to dispute their Masters Right to be valide, which holdeth, whether his Right be an Infeftment, Liferent-right or Tack; and though the Tennent hath been put to condescend what the Right is, and that in <hi>specie,</hi> it is a valide Right, though he needs not dispute the particular defects of it, nor the competition of it with any other Right: That hath been done, that the pursuer might know how to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel their Masters Right; but I have never observed that Litiscontestation has been made, or a Term assigned to Tennents, to instruct their Masters Right; therefore this defence is but dilatory, and should not be sustained, unless in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly verified by Tacks or Discharges from the alledged Master, which would be repelled, if the Tennents have interverted the pursuer or his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Possession; or if the pursuer were singular Successor, not presumed to know any interest but of the Possessors, if the Tennent, produce his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Seasine, with his Tack or Discharge, it would instruct this Dilator, which is sufficient upon the not calling the Tennents Master, for his not being warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is proper for himself to alledge, and the partie will in the same Process get warrand to cite that Master, who must defend himself upon his own Rights; and therefore, this defence was sustained to Tennents, though they conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended upon no other Right to their Master, but tacite Relocation, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 2. 1628.

                     <p n="44">44. Violent profites are so called, because they are such profites as are due by, and for violent Possessioa, whatsoever way it be, by warning and remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ejection, intrusion, or succeeding in the Vice, and they are opposite to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary profites, which were due by tacit Relocation, or were formerly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to be payed. Violent profites are pursued for by a several Action, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Decreet of removing is obtained: Wherein the Decreet of removing is both a sufficient Title, and probation of the violent Possession, against the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties removed therein, and their Possession needs not again be proven, and their defences hindering the pursuer to obtain Possession, would not be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, unless they offer to prove the pursuer himself was in Possession, or others by his warrand, <hi>June</hi> 19. 1610. <hi>Hector Monroe contra</hi> Laird of <hi>Balna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goun.</hi> Neither will any other thing but real obedience, by giving, or at least offering the void Possession, take them away though the Land lye waste.</p>
                     <p>But violent profites were also found competent against these who were not warned, against whom Decreet of removing was not obtained, to wit, against any who suspended the Decreet, and thereby hindered the defenders attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Possession, <hi>Hope</hi> Mails and Duties, <hi>Ker</hi> of <hi>Fairnieherst contra Turnbul.</hi> Yea, a party obtaining Possession by a Decreet of removing, after Litisconte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station, in the reduction of the Decreet, was found a violent Possessor, and lyable to violent profites himself, <hi>Hope</hi> Possession, <hi>Gordon</hi> of <hi>Abergeldie contra</hi> Lord <hi>Forbes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the quantity of violent profites by the custom of Burgh, it is double Mail of the Tenements within Burgh, <hi>Hope</hi> Mails and Duties, <hi>Christian Buchan contra Marion Seaton.</hi> But in Lands, it is the greatest profites that the pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er can prove he could have made.

Violent profites are also sustained against all Defenders <hi>in solidum,</hi> as in Spuilzie; but when diverse compeared and proponed partial objections against removings and succumbed, they were found lyable for the violent profites of the Lands, in the exceptions severally, <hi>Hope</hi> Mails and Duties, <hi>William Wallace contra Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Blair.</hi> Otherways partial exceptions are not here competent, <hi>Hope</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, Laird of <hi>Balnagoun contra Hector Monro.</hi> Neither will any excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be admitted, which was competent and proper in the Decreet of remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, relative to Right or Possession.

Succeeding in the vice is a kind of intrusion, whereby after warning any person comes in possession, by consent of the parties warned: Or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, against such there needs no warning but a summar Process, as in other intrusions, having the same probation, for in both, the possession must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which with the warning is sufficient, but can have no effect till Decreet of removing be obtained against the Tennent warned.</p>
                     <p>Though Violent profites be the ordinary effect, both in removing and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in the Vice; These will proceed as to attaining possession, and no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent profites be obtained, when there is any colourable Title which might have made the warned partie, reasonably doubt of the pursuers interest, or of his own Right, <hi>Hope</hi> removing, <hi>Walter Ord contra</hi> Tennents. But this useth ordinarly to be so provided in the Decreet of removing, and will be hardlie sustained thereafter, by recanvassing the defences competent in the removing; that it may appear whether there were a probable ground in them or not, at least the defender would protest for the reservation, as to the violent profites; for if this were again sustained, it would bring over-head all the many intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat defences competent in removings; of which formerly. And therefore in the removing pursued by the Earl of <hi>Argile contra Mcnaughtoun;</hi> the Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the defences, but declared that they would have consideration thereof, as having probable ground to debate, and would modifie the excrescence of the violent profites over and above the ordinary profites.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. That which doth most properly agree to the nature of a Pledge or Wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set with us, is where any Inseftment or security is granted. in security of a sum of Money, or for relief of Cautionry, or any other sum, which bears expresly, <hi>that the Land or Right is disponed for security or relief;</hi> and therefore needs express no Reversion; for it is necessarly implyed, that so soon as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or satisfaction is obtained, the Infeftment granted in security ceasseth; so that if the granter of the Infeftment, or any other bound in the principal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, either make payment, or the receiver thereof by his intromission, be satisfied, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> the Infeftment is extinct: Yea, if the debitor granter of the Infeftment and Security should instruct compensation, as it would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish the principal Bond, so would it in consequence the Infeftment for security thereof. This Infeftment being really a Pledge, it is consistent with the Infeftment of Property in the debitor, as two distinct kinds of Rights, and thereby the debitor is not denuded, even although the Infeftment for Security were publick by Resignation; because it is not a Resignation sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <hi>in favorem,</hi> but <hi>ad effecsum, viz.</hi> for Security; and therefore, when the debt is satisfied, the debitor needs not be re-invested, but his former Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of property stands valide.</p>
                     <p>Like unto these in all points are Infeftments upon Appryzing, which are truly <hi>pignora praetoria,</hi> whreby the debitor is not denuded, but his Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment stands; and if the Apprising be satisfied within the Legal, it is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, and the debitor needs not be re-invested; and therefore, he may receive Vassals during the Legal; and if he die, the appearand Heir intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metting with the Mails and Duties, during the Legal, doth thereby behave himself as Heir, as was found, <hi>February</hi> 21. 1663. <hi>Henry Hamiltoun contra William Hamiltoun.</hi> Which holds olso in Adjudications, by the late Act of Parliament, come in place of Appryzings.</p>

As to these Wodsets in this place; and that first, as to the Constitution of Wodsets: And next as to the destitution thereof.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As to the Constitution of a Wodset, it must be according to the thing or Right impignorat for a Tack or Liferent: An Assignation to these or any other cessible right may be given in Wodset for security, and under Reversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But the ordinary Wodset is by Infeftment of Property, or of Annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; the conception whereof is not under the name of Impledging, Impignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Hypothecation or the like, but in the terms of Disposition, or Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby the property of the thing Wodset passeth, and is established in the Wodsetter: But under Reversion to the Constituent, whereby it hath two parts, the Infeftment and the Reversion. The Infeftment in Wodsets, is in all points like to other Infeftments, whether they be Infeftments of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty or of Annualrent; or whether they be publick, holden of the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents Superior, or base holden of himself; so that all the specialities of Wodsets resolve in Reversion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A Reversion is a paction and condition, or provision for redemption of any thing alienat upon such Terms as are agreed upon, which of it self is no more then a personal obligation, whereby the Wodsetter is oblieged, until by that excellent Statute, <hi>Par.</hi> 1469. <hi>cap.</hi> 27. It is declared, that the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion shall be effectual, not only against the first Wodsetter himself, but all his Successors in the Wodset Lands, whereby reversions are accounted as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retable and real Rights, affecting singular Successors, in the same way that Tacks are made real Rights, by the Statute thereanent.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>English</hi> by reversion, do not understand a Right of Redemption, but a Right of Survivancy or Succession; as the reversion of an Office is a Title to that Office, after the removal of the present Incumbent. And that which we call a Wodset, they call a Morgage; for a Gage is a Pledge which is really ingaged: And Morgage is a Pledge, the Redemption whereof dieth, or is extinct, if it be not used at the time, and in the manner agreed upon by the parties, of that with them in their Morgages, not only Clauses irritant, or <hi>

                           </gap> legis Commissoriae,</hi> are valide: But if the provision for Redemption, be for a definite time, that being elapsed the Morgage becomes irredeemable by their common Law, what remeid may be had in the Chanclery upon equity, I know not.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Before we come to the Solemnities requisite for Constituting Reversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is necessary to distinguish the several kinds thereof: Reversions are either Legal, arising from Law and Statute, and not from consent of parties, as are the Legal Reversions of Appryzings and Adjudications; or they are Conventional, by the consent of parties, which are either Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in the body of the Wodset-right or a part, they are also either principal
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:109710:226"/>
Reversions or eiks to Reversions; and they are either solemn and perfected, or only inchoat, such as Promises, Bonds and Conditions for granting Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Legal Reversions require no other solemnity, then what is requisite to the legal constitution of the right whereupon they follow. The common solemnities requisite for Reversions and other Writes of old, was only the Seal of the granter, without necessity of his Subscription.

It is required, that all Reversions, Bonds and Obligations for making of Reversions, be not only sealed, but subscribed by the granters own hand; and if he cannot write, by his hand led at the pen by a Nottar; or otherwayes, they make no faith, unless the same by consent of parties be regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat in the Books of a Judge Ordinar, or that it be a Reversion within Burgh, contained in the Instrument of Resignation and Seasine of Lands by the Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and Town-clerk. And by the Act of <hi>Par.</hi> 1579. <hi>cap.</hi> 80. Reversions, As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signations and Discharges thereof, and eiks thereto, or other Writes of great importance, are ordained to be subscribed and sealed by the principal parties; or if they cannot write, by two Nottars before four designed witnesses, else to be null and of no faith. But the matter of Reversion is perfected by the Act of Parliament, 1617. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. ordaining all Reversions, Regresses, Bonds or Writers for making Reversions, Assignations and Discharges of the same, to be registrat in the Register of Seasines and Reversions within sixty dayes of their dates, otherwayes to have no effect, save only against the granters thereof, but not against their singular successors acquiring perfect and lawful Rights: But this is not requisite in Infeftments of Burgage-lands within Royal Burghs, nor in Reversions incorporat in the rights of Wodset. Upon consideration of the inconvenience &amp; insecurity of Burgage-lands, the Lords by Act of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derunt,</hi> ordained the Burghs to take sufficient Caution of their Town-clerks present and to come, to insert in their Books all Seasines given by them of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements within Burgh, and all Reversions or Bonds for granting Reversions, Assignations thereto, and Discharges thereof, Renunciations and grants of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and that within sixty dayes after the giving of Seasine, or present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them of the Reversions or others foresaids, under the pain of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of parties, acquiring <hi>bona fide</hi> for onerous causes, that they may incur by such latent rights; declaring, that such Seasines and Reversions, not insert in manner foresaid, to be esteemed as latent and fraudulent, keeped up of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to insnare lawful purchasers; which Act of <hi>Sederunt</hi> is dated, <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 22. 1681. So that, as by the first Act Reversions are made effectual, by this last they are made evident, that acquirers may be secured against latent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions, and by the registration, or being in the body of the Wodset, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of sealling is taken off, and for the most part in desuetude. It is also consequent from this last Act, that not only formal and solemn Reversions in the body of the Wodset or registrat, are effectual against singular successors, but also Bonds and Writes for making of Reversions, otherwayes there needs no ordinance to registrate these for the purchasers security, if of themselves they could affect purchasers: But promises of Reversion are no wayes effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al against singular successors, unless they have been brought into write, at least by Decreet before these successors right, because being only probable by oath of party, the oath of the author will not prove against his singular succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor. Neither will Declarations, Back-bands or conditions of Trust, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under Reversions; but they remain obliegements personal upon the person intrusted, unless they contain express obliegement to re-dispone, which is a reversion, albeit it be not formal; or if it bear, to denude himself
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:109710:227"/>
in favours of the disponer or any other; but if it be but in trust to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove, though thereupon, <hi>via actionis,</hi> he might be compelled to denude, yet is no reversion, and however hath no effect against singular successors, unless they be registrate as aforesaid; except in so far as they may be grounds of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction against the parties intrusted, or their singular successors partakers of the fraud.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It is also frequently provided in Reversions, That if the condition of the Reversion be not performed betwixt and such a time, the reversion shall expire; and sometimes it is provided so to be, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> without Declarator. This is a clause irritant, irritating or annulling the Reversion, which in the Civil Law is called, <hi>Pactum Legis Commissoriae in pignoribus,</hi> and is thereby rejected and void as an usurary paction, whereby the Wodsetter getteth more then his just interest as a penalty: which therefore, as in other cases, ought to be modified to the just interest; especially seing indigent Debitors, through necessity of borrowing money, will be easily induced to such Clauses. And therefore, a Back-band for redemption of a Tenement, bearing such a Clause irritant, was found null two years after the terme, and after a Decreet of removing all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorations being satisfied, <hi>July</hi> 8. 1636. <hi>Cleghorn</hi> contra <hi>Ferguson.</hi> The like was found in an Assignation to a Bond under reversion of a smaller sum, which was found penal and modified to the just interest, <hi>June</hi> 25. 1623. <hi>Mitchel</hi> contra <hi>Robson.</hi> Yet such clauses irritant are effectual upon the failie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, unless they be purged by performance, which is ordinarly received when offered at the bar, in the Declarator of the expirie of the reversion: So was it found purgeable at the instance of the Reversers Creditors, 19. of <hi>March,</hi> 1631.

                     <p>And therefore, the Irritancie was not found purgeable before the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, where the Reversion was of Lands disponed for a competent price by a true sale, <hi>January</hi> 17. 1679. <hi>James Beatsone</hi> contra <hi>Harrower.</hi>

                        <pb n="414" facs="tcp:109710:233"/>WE are not here to speak of the common wayes of extinction of Infeftments, and other rights, as the extinction of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter, Prescription, Forefaulture, Homologation, or acceptance of incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible Rights, neither to these ways by which an infeftment is extinct as to one, but is conveyed to another, which falleth in consideration amongst conveyances of Rights: But of these ways proper to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish Infeftments, and make the right toceass, and to return to the Superiours, and these are two. either by consent of the Vassal, or by Law.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Infeftments are extinct by consent, by resignation made by the Vassal, who stands Infeft in the Lands to his Superiour, <hi>ad perpetuam remanentiam,</hi> to which there is necessarly required, as a solemnity thereof, an Instrument of resignation in the hands of a Nottar, in the same way that their constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was perfected by an Instrument of Seasine, their distitution is consumate by an Instrument of resignation, which no other write nor acknowledgement of the Vassal, of the being thereof will supply, much less will the deeds done otherways prove; and as in Seasines there must be a tradition or delivery of Possession by some Token or Symbol, as by Earth and Stone, &amp;c. So in the Instrument of Refignation there must be a re-delivery of the Possession by an accustomed Symbol, which ordinarly is by delivery of Staff and Bastoun; yet in this they differ, that the delivery of the Seasine must be upon the ground of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, naturally or by union; but the Resignation may be any where: And as Seasine may be given, either to the Vassal or his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator; so may the Resignation be either to the Superiour himself or to his Commissioners, authorized to that effect.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And though Instruments of Resignation use to be by Procurators, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by a Procuratory of Resignation: Yet as there may be Seasines given by the Superiour, <hi>propriis manibus,</hi> so may there be Resignations by the Vassal.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But in both the Instrument of Resignation alone is not sufficient, as being but the assertion of a Nottar; but they must have for their warrand a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, or other Adminicle; and therefore, it is Statute, <hi>Par.</hi> 1563. <hi>cap.</hi> 81. That where such Resignations are by Procurators, the Procuratories be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the party or Nottars; and if the Resignation be <hi>propriis manibus,</hi> that the Instrument be so subscribed, otherways to be null, because the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Instrument is in that case the only probation of the Warrand thereof: But if there be a Disposition or Obliegement to Infeft the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Resignation, though not subscribed by the resigner, will be sufficient as warranted by the Disposition or Obliegement. But Seasines and Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did formerly differ in this, that Seasines must be registrate within sixty dayes after dates, <hi>Par.</hi> 1617. <hi>cap.</hi> 16.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="415" facs="tcp:109710:233"/>4. But so needed not Instruments of Resignation <hi>ad Remanentiam;</hi> for though by that Statute, Renunciations of Wodsets are to be registrat, it was not extended to Renunciations of irredeemable Rights <hi>ad remanentiam,</hi> these being either omitted by inadvertency or of purpose, in the favours of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, that Rights may be taken with their consent: Yet in so far, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Statute was defective, till the late Act of <hi>Par.</hi> 1669. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. whereby Instruments of Resignation are null, if not registrat within sixty dayes. By which, and others to that purpose, purchasers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> may better know the condition of these with whom they contract about Infeftments, and be more secure of lurking rights then any where (so far as I can learn) in the World.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. By this Resignation so made, the property is consolidate, as it was the time of the Resignation, and is affected with all real burdens, or <hi>debita fundi,</hi> that validly affected it before, as Feues, Tacks, Annualrents, Servitudes. For, though all such burdens as are not warranted by the Superiours consent, or by Law, cease when the Fee returns to the Superiour, either for a time by Ward, Non-entry, &amp;c. or for ever by Recognition; yet when it returns thus by consent, it comes <hi>cum suo onere,</hi> which is very just and fit, seing else such securities might easily be evacuat, by voluntar Resignations in the Superiours hand. There is another Resignation, which is called <hi>in favorem,</hi> being for new Infeftment to the resigner or some other, but thereby the Fee is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, but either renewed or transferred; and therefore, it shall be considered hereafter.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Craig</hi> upon this head, very fitly moveth and solveth this question, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Vassal may renunce and resign his Fee to the Superior, though he be unwilling; and instances in two cases; First, in a Vassals holding a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable parcel of Land Ward, and did thereby become obnoxious to his Superiour for the value, his Tocher having relation to the whole Estate, which Tocher did much exceed the worth of the Tenement: And yet a resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof being judicially offered, the Superior was suffered to refuse it, unless the value of the Marriage were first payed. The other of a Burgess, offering to renunce his Burgesship for shunning a great Taxation put upon him: and therefore, solveth the case upon the common Axiom, <hi>Cuique licet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciare favori pro se introducto.</hi> And therefore, the Fee of its nature being gratuitous in favours of the Vassal, may be renunced, but that will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge the Superiour of any casuality befalling to him before the renunciation, but will have only effect <hi>ad futura:</hi> and therefore, a Vassal judicially disclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Superior, was not admitted so to do, to exclude the Life-rent already fallen, <hi>March</hi> 26. 1628. <hi>John Stewart</hi> contra Laird of <hi>Wedderburne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>No Contract, Obligation or personal Right, nor any less then an Instrument of Refignation, will take away Infeftment; for though these may be sufficient against the granters thereof, by a personal objection, whereby they cannot come against their own deed: Yet truly, the real right stands in them, and they are not denuded thereby; and so a Renunciation, without the solemnity of an Instrument of Resignation, will not suffice to obliterat an irredeemable Fee, though it may be sufficient to evacuat any personal right, as Servitude not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Infeftment; yea, or a Liferent, though constitute by Infeftment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is communicable to no other persons by Infeftment, and therefore, passeth by Assignation or Resignation. The reason hereof is, because by the common custom of Nations, real Rights cannot pass by sole consent, without
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:109710:234"/>
artaining possession in the way prescribed by Law: and therefore, this sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical possession, which alone the Law alloweth as sufficient, either in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution or destitution of Fees, must be adhibite, and the real possession of the Tenement it self will not suffice in either case, as is before instanced in Seasines by several decisions. So a Renunciation without a formal Resignation, was not found relevant to take away the Infeftment renunced against a singular successor, <hi>November</hi> 23. 1627. <hi>Dumbar</hi> contra <hi>Wilson.</hi> Resignation cannot be effectual, if the resigner be not infeft; for he who is not invested, cannot be divested, or if by his Infeftment, he hath no valid right.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Craig</hi> discusseth this question also in that place, Whether consent of one who is infeft, and thereby hath right, will validat the Resignation of another who is not infeft and hath no right: Which he determineth in the affirmative, with good reason; for though the consent alone would not be sufficient, yet seing the form of the resignation is done, though in the name of him who hath no right, yet by consent of him who hath right, here is both the substance and solemnity of the act; and it is alike, as if the Resignation had been by the consenter, which I doubt not will hold, though the consent be but adhibit in the beginning of the Disposition or Contract. And though the consenter, for all right he hath, doth not dispone, as is ordinary, for further security; yea if the consent be not repeated in the Procuratory of resignation, or mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Instrument of Resignation; for being exprest generally in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the Disposition or Contract, it reacheth to every Article thereof, and all done conform thereto. Consent hath the same effect in the constitution of Fees; and so the consent to an Annualrent, by a party having right and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feft, was found to validate the Annualrent, though the Disponer was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feft; and so did exclude a Tack set by that consenter afterward, <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 15. 1630. <hi>Jean Stirling</hi> contra</p>
                     <p>Yet, if more persons should dispone for their several rights, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting one to another, if any of them be omitted out of the Procuratory or Instrument of Resignation, in whom truly the right standeth; Nonthing will be validly done, though that party be also in the Disposition: And this is the reason, why when many persons dispone or resign, they do it all with one mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual consent; for thereby each of their rights doth contribute to the deed of the rest, though some of them were omitted to be repeated in the Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, Instrument of Resgination, or Infeftment following thereupon, the deed would be valid: But it is safest to repeat their consent in the Resignation and Infeftment.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Infeftments are also extinct, when the Superior adjudgeth or appriseth from his Vassal; for thereby it was found, that the Property was consolidat with the Superiority, <hi>Spots.</hi> Apprising, <hi>Stevinson</hi> contra Laird of <hi>Craigmillar.</hi> Or, if the Superiour succeed as heir to the Vassal; in which case, though the Superiour upon supplication obtained Precepts out of the Chancelary, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feft him in the Fee, it was thought, as Superior, he might have infeft himself as Vassal: But he would not have been so secure by a Declarator of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solidation, upon the Superiours special Retour, as Heir to his Vassal in the Lands; because, that way would make a defect in the security of Land-rights by the Negisters, in which, Decreets of Consolidation are not required to be recorded; whereas the Superiors Seasine, either on the Kings Precept or his own, behoved to be registrat; and if the Superiour acquire the property by Apprifing or Adjudication, the allowance thereof must also be registrate. The

                        <pb n="417" facs="tcp:109710:235"/>
The like effect will follow, if the Vassal become Heir, or singular Successor to the Superiour, whereby being infeft in the Superiority, he may as Vassal resign to himself as Superiour <hi>ad remanentiam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. It is more disputable, how and under what consideration Fees are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, otherwayes then by consent: Some hold that they are extinct by the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trocious delinquency of the Vassal against the Superior, as the penalty or punishment thereof; and others conceive, that acknowledgement and fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being necessarly involved in all Fees (as is shown before) though it be not exprest; So this is implyed as a legal resolutive or irritant Clause, that if the Vassal failie in his duty, his Fee becomes void. And others hold, that Fees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their own nature gratuitous, even though there be a cause onerous, yet they retain the nature of a Donation: and therefore, as all Donations are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable <hi>propter ingratitudinem;</hi> So are these, which soever of these be the ground, the consequences and effects are much to the same purpose. But I incline to the middle opinion; for unless it were evident by Law, that the penalty of that delinquence were such and so applyed, it would hardly be consistent upon that ground, seing otherwayes, as we have shown before of delinquences, the punishment is publick, and would belong to the Magistrate: And therefore, for several delinquencies, forfaulture of Fee is introduced, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out benefite to the Superiour, who as a private party, can have no more but a reparation equivalent to the damnage sustained by him; and so the aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Fee, without his consent or incroaching upon the border of his property, would not infer, for its reparation, the return of the Fee, how great soever. And for the last, though Fees of their nature be gratuitous, yet they are oft-times for an equivalent price, and so the less ingratitude can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; yea, though it be true, <hi>Si ingratum dixeris, omnia dixeris,</hi> yet fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and trust is a much stronger bond then gratitude: and the breach there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath the most powerful consequence, betraying of trust being most hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and hateful to mankinde; and therefore, seing fidelity is necessarly and properly in all Fees, and is essential thereto and inseparable therefrom, it look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth likest the surest ground from whence the eviction hereof may flow, And if it be truly gratuitous, it is an aggravating circumstance, making the deed more odious. But whatsoever it be, it is agreed by all, that the deed must be of knowledge, moment and attrocity, though there be many such heaped up by the Feudists, yet many of them have no place with us, where both such deeds are rare, and therefore the decisions thereupon are few; and certainly our Fees being ordinarly onerous, are not evacuated but by such as are either named and known in Law, or which are very attrocious. There be three such wayes of extinction, which have peculiar names in Law, <hi>Recognition, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,</hi> and <hi>Purpresture.</hi> Of which therefore in the next place.</p>
                     <p>Recognition is the Superiours returning to own the Fee; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be extended to all the wayes by which it returneth through the Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals infidelity, as is hereafter exprest. But the least culpable, and yet most ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of incurring Recognition, is by the Vassals disponing irredeemably or under reversion, his Fees holden Ward: for by this he renders himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to serve his Superiour, and in a manner renunces and disclaims him. This kind of Alienation makes recognition of Ward-lands, but Fees feu or blensh do not recognosce by such Alienations, but by the attrocious infidelity of the Vassal.</p>
                     <p n="10">
                        <pb n="418" facs="tcp:109710:236" rendition="simple:additions"/>
10. The nearest cause of Recognition, is the Vassals alienation of the Fee without consent of the Superiour, which is a legal clause irritant implyed in the nature of proper Fees or Ward-holdings, though it be not exprest, that though the Vassal alienat the Fee, it shall return to the Superiour, whether the rise hereof be from the personal obligation of fidelity, which the Vassal oweth to the Superiour only, or from the obliegement of gratitude and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or from that peculiar choice of the person and race of the Vassal which the Superiour hath made, contrair to which, a stranger cannot be obtruded upon him; neither can the Vassal withdraw himself from the fidelity, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himself unfit for his service, or from all these; yet in this do most agree, that the nearest cause of Recognition is the alienation of the Fee. So then, the main difficulty is, what is meaned by that Alienation by which Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is incurred, <hi>Craig, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>dieges.</hi> 5. declareth, that this Alienation cannot be by naked Contract or Disposition, till Seasine follow; for, these being but personal and incompleat Rights, do not alienat the Fee from the Vassal, but only constitute upon him a personal obliegement so to do. It is also clear, that by Infeftment granted by the Superiour upon resignation, there can be no recognition, because the Superiours accepting of the resignation, importeth his consent; So that, the question will only remain, when the Vassal granteth Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position or Charter <hi>a se</hi> to be holden of his Superiour, and before the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours Confirmation obtained giveth Seasine: For, the Confirmation being the express consent of the Superiour, if the Seasine be after it, there can be no hazard of Recognition, or otherwayes, while the Vassal granteth a subaltern Infeftment to be holden of himself.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. As to the first case, it seems there can be no recognition incurred by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftments granted by the Vassal to be holden of his Superiour, because, if these be confirmed, the Right is null, and there is no alienation nor transmission of property, but the Vassal granter of the Infeftment remains still Proprietar. And therefore, such an Infeftment is equivalent, as if the Vassal did alienat upon condition, that the Superiour should consent; and if he did not consent, the Infeftment to be null. In which case, most Feudists do agree, that by such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftments there is no recognition; and this reason is the more fortified, that <hi>Craig</hi> in the fore-cited place relateth, that an Infeftment null for want of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistration, was not found to infer Recognition, in the case of the Kings Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocat against <hi>Kenneth Mackenzie and Bain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For solution of this difficulty, it is not to be denyed, that if a Seasine be null by defect of any substantial, or essential, necessarly requisite to Seasine or sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical delivery of possession, there would follow no Recognition, as if there were no tradition of earth and stone, or symbol requisite or not, by the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour or his Bailie or not, to the Vassal or his Procurator or not, upon the ground of the Land naturally, or by union. But though Seasine may be null, by defect of some accidental solemnity introduced by Statute or Custom, and not necessarly involved in the nature of tradition, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction or year of the Princes Reign, though Law should declare the Seasine null for want of these; yet, the Vassal performing such essential requisites, the Feu falleth in Recognition: and therefore, there seemeth no ground to follow that Decision adduced by <hi>Craig,</hi> excluding Recognition upon the nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Seasine for want of Registration. But as to the case proposed, the Superiours Confirmation is not essential to the Vassals Seasine; neither is it so required by the common Feudal Customs, as with us: for thereby, if the Superiour did acquiesce, approve or homologate, the Seasine granted by a
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:109710:236"/>
Vassal to a stranger, the same would be valid without a formal Confirmation in write; albeit by our Custom, such Infeftments till Confirmed are null, not only as to the Superiour, but as to all other third parties, and so is become as a substantial of the Infeftment, not being truly essential by the common Fedual Customes, it doth not exclude Recognition; and as <hi>Craig</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited place rendereth the reason, that Infeftments by the Vassal, <hi>a se,</hi> not Confirmed, infer Recognition, is because he hath done all that in him is to alienate the Fee, there being no Act remaining to be performed by him or his Procurator; and therefore, in the Declarator of Recognition, pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the instance of Lady <hi>Anna Hamiltoun</hi> Lady <hi>Carnagy contra</hi> Lord <hi>Cranburn,</hi> upon the Earl of <hi>Dirletouns</hi> Disponing of the Lands of <hi>Innerweek</hi> holden of the King Ward to <hi>Cranburn,</hi> and Infefting him therein to be holden of the King; this Defence was not found relevant, that the Seasine was not Confirmed, and so null, though done upon Death-bed, accepted for a Minor absent and inscient, and recalling and reducing.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. For in such cases as in rebellion or escheat, there is no priviledge of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority nor of deeds upon death-bed against the Superiour, though done by a minor, except the deeds upon death-bed, be in prejudice of the Heir and be reduced by the Heir, <hi>ex capite lecti.</hi> But in this case <hi>Dirletouns</hi> Heir did not quarrel the Disposition made by him, as done upon death-bed, but did take a gift of recognition from the King. But where the gift of recognition was not granted to the Heir-male, who was heir in the investiture; but to an heir Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, the Heir-male proponing, that the alienation was upon death-bed, and so null as to him: The Lords found, that if the Disposition was upon death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, the Defence was relevant and competent by way of exception, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarator of recognition not being a possessory Judgement: But where the Disposition was in <hi>leige poustie,</hi> and was delivered with a Precept of Seasine simply, without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. It is much debated amongst the Feudists, whether by Sub-feudation, Recognition be incurred, or whether it be comprehended under alienation; because <hi>in libro Jeudorum,</hi> albeit alienation of Fees be expresly prohibite, yet in the same place, as <hi>Craig</hi> observeth, Sub-feudation is allowed; because by sub-feudation, neither the personal right betwixt Superiour and Vassal is altered, seing the Vassal continues Vassal, and lyable to all these: Neither is the real right and interest of the Superiour in the Fee it self diminished, but he hath the same access thereto, as if there had been no sub-feudation; yet Sub-feudation in all cases is accounted alienation: And where alienation is prohibite, Sub-feudation is understood; and so <hi>Emphitiosis,</hi> or Feu-ferm, which is at least a perpetual Location. For solving this difficulty, it must be remembered, that <hi>feudalia</hi> are <hi>localia,</hi> regulable according to the custom of the several places, and according to the Nature of Feudal-rights, and common Feudal-customs, where special customs are not; and therefore, there is no question of this point in <hi>France,</hi> or most places in <hi>Germany,</hi> where alienation of Fees many ways is allowed: But in <hi>Italy</hi> and other Countreys, where the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Feudal Customs rule ordinarly according to the Feudal-books. The doubt remaineth, which may be cleared thus: First, Though in some cases aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be extended to Location, yet it is not so by the common feudal Customs.
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:109710:237"/>
Secondly, If the Subfeu-dation be a real Feu-ferm, whereby the Feu-duty is considerable and competent to intertain the Vassal; such Sub-feudation is thereby accounted only Lacation; Nor doth it infer recognition, being in effect no more then a perpetual Location, whereby the Antinomy in the Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal Law is sufficiently reconciled, that such Sub-feudations are not alienations: But if the Sub-feudation be Ward, Blensh, or in Mortification, or though it be under the name of <hi>Emphyteosis;</hi> yet for an elusory, or an inconsiderable and unproportionable Feu-duty, which by no estimation can be correspodent to the profite of the Fee, but within the half of the true worth; in these cases the Sub-feudation is alienation inferreth recognition.</p>

As to our own Customs in this point, they do agree to the common Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal Customs, as to Subaltern Infeftments, Blensh, Ward, or in mortification, or Elusory, or unprofitable Feus. But as to Feues by which the major part of the profite of the Ward or Fee is not taken away, though such cases have not occurred to be contraverted, they seem not to infer recognition; for if the major part be not alienate, Subaltern Infeudations, though Blensh or in Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, infer not recognition, when these rights are <hi>disjunctim</hi> of parts of the Fee; There appears no reason, that the Subfeudation of the whole, with a Feu-duty equivalent to the half of the true Rent, whereby in effect the half is not alienate, seing the <hi>dominium directum,</hi> of the whole, and the profite of the half is retained, should infer recognition, especially now when generally Fees are granted for Causes Onerous.</p>

Purpresture or Purprysion is the vassals going without his bounds, and incroaching upon the Property of his Superiour; for purpryses signifie the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts and Marches, the ground of it is from the fidelity and gratitude the vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal oweth to the Superiour; and therefore, should not invade his Inheritance; but this is not extended to incroachment upon the Superiours Commonty, as <hi>Craig</hi> relateth the opinion of the Lawers in his time, in a purprysion moved by the Constable of <hi>Dundee</hi> against the Town of <hi>Innerkeithing.</hi> But where the Superiour hath the right of Property, burdened and barred with a right of common Pasturage, acquired by the vassal by consent or prescription, which though it marreth the effect of the Superiours Property, so that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Till or Manure the same in prejudice of the Pasturage; yet he remains di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect

Proprietar; and if Coal were found in that ground, it would be his alone: In which case, if the vassal should rive out and labour that ground whereof he got common Pasturage, it would be purprysion, as is clear in the case of the common Moores, disponed to none by the King in Property; and therefore, belonging yet to His Majesty in Property, the riving out, or appropriating whereof, is declared purprysion, Parliament 1600. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p>Purpresture must also be a known and manifest incroachment, as if a vassal should exclude a Superiour from a whole distinct Tenement; but when he is about Marches it is not sustained, unless they be clearly manifest by March Stones; Or that there hath been an antecedent Cognition of the Marches; and therefore, the action is either turned into a Cognition, or at least before an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, a Commission is granted to cognosce.</p>
                     <p>Purpresture is thought to be incurred by incroachment upon the High-ways and publick Rivers, as belonging to the King; but it could be inferred against no other then his Vassal, and it being so ordinary by course of time, to change the High-ways, or rather for the High-ways to change, when there becomes any impossibleness therein: There are other Statutes appointed for securing thereof upon far less certification then Purpresture, so that I conceive it could hardly be inferred upon that ground.</p>
                     <p>Purpresture was only competent to be cognosced by Barons, comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Superiour Dignities, but by none of their Vassals or Sub-vassals, <hi>Par.</hi> 1477. <hi>cap.</hi> 79. But now it belongs only to the Jurisdiction of the Lords of Session, as all other Recognitions do.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. <hi>Craig</hi> hath largely &amp; learnedly Treated of the feudal Delinquencies: adducing the Feudal Customes of the neighbouring Nations, and the Opinions of many learned Feudists thereupon, both generally and particularly, enumerating the most ordinary Delinquences, for which they hold Vassals to lose their Fees; He doth also give his own opinion, how far these or the like would be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained with us, but adduceth little what had been sustained. But this much in general, that <hi>mitiores pena nobis semper placuere:</hi> And in Conclusion, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>Dieges.</hi> 6. he makes Superiours lose their Superiority, and the same to befal to their Vassals, for the same Delinquencies, for which the Vassals lose their Fee, to their Superiours, except what concerns the honour and reverence due by Vassals to their Superiours; which therefore will not consist with attributing the Feudal Delinquencies to ingratitude, which can hardly be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to give rise to the Superiours losing his Superiority; and therefore, it must be from that mutual friendship and fidelity betwixt the Superiour and Vassal, arising from the Feudal Contract, since his time there hath scarce any thing been observed in relation to Recognition, or ammission of Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon Feudal Delinquencies, except what concerns alienation of proper Fees, or Ward-holdings, without the Superiours consent, or what may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Recognition, as it is implyed in foresaulture, so that we are yet much left to infer the Feudal Delinquencies, resolutive of Infeftments from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of these Rights.</p>
                     <p>Though <hi>Craig</hi> hath not gone near the length of Forraign Feudists, in assigning the specialities resolving Fees; yet if we should go his length, there would be found few unquarrellable Rights of Superiority, or Property in the
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:109710:240"/>
Kingdom, but which might in a considerable time, give ground enough to extinguish the Right, either of the Superiour or Vassal: And since no such thing hath been moved upon either part, the general acquiescence of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must make these Delinquencies resolutive of Infeftments, much narrower and much more upon the Vassals part then the Superiours, for our Custom hath never given the Vassalthe right of Superiority upon the Delinquencies of the Superiour.</p>
                     <p>All Fees, yea and Liferents by Infeftments, do necessarly imply an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the Superiour, and fidelity to him, and thence only, and not from gratitude ought the Causes of disolving Fees be deduced, for though pure Donations are disolved by attrocious ingratitude, yet the most proper Fees were never pure Donations, but were from innominate Contracts, Do <hi>ut facias,</hi> and the services due thereby, were not by way of gratitude, but by way ofspecial Contract: And there is most of pure Donation in the most improper Fees, such as Blensh and Mortification which are almost allodial; and yet the fewest resolutive Delinquencies are in these, and Feu-ferms were at first granted for cultivating Barren Grounds, and paying a Feu-duty, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non out of them, and where they have a considerable Rent, they are far from being purely gratuitous, and are rather perpetual Locations. And in most Fees of all kinds, there are not only Casualities and Profites; but they are ordinarly granted by way of sale for a competent price; and therefore, the Delinquencies resolving them, should neither be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor esteemed equal, but should be much more sustained in proper Fees, or Ward-holdings, importing personal or military Service, then in improper Fees.</p>
                     <p>Yet all Infeftments being in the Terms and Tenor of Fees, they must have a <hi>reddendo</hi> and acknowledgement of the Superior and fidelity too, not only as obliegements, but as resolutive conditions implyed therein; and therefore, wilful and open disowning the Superiour by Disclamation, or Infidelity, in breach of Trust, should from the nature of the Feudal Contract resolve the same.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. Though breach of Trust be a general Term, the extent whereof is not determined; yet certainly it must import the Vassals being Actor or Accessory in conspyring or taking away the life of the Superiour, or mutilating or wounding him, or in taking away his Right of Superiority: Under which accession may be justly comprehended, the not revealing to him of these ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards; but this would not reach to the revealing of any loss or detriment the Superiour might have in his other Estate, or the concurring or acting against him therein.</p>
                     <p>It may also be extended to Conspyring, or Acting, or not Revealing these things which might infer upon the Superiour, Infamy, equiparat to death or wounds, but it seems not to import a duty in the Vassal to give Council to his Superiour, or not to reveal his secrets; neither inferring Life, Limb, nor Fame; for though these be Acts of Gratitude and Friendship, yet they are not implyed in the Fidelity of all Vassals, but only such as owe Militar and personal service: I shall not determine how far breach of Trust in impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Fees, could extend to the Wife, Children, and Family of the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="428" facs="tcp:109710:241"/>But proper and Military Fees by Ward-holding, do not only import Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but Assistance and Council to the Superiour, by which the Vassal can be accessory to no attrocious Deed against the Life and Blood of the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but against any Infamy may befal him, or any great detriment in his Estate, and so will reach to Deeds of hurt or disgrace to his Wife or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by Adultery, Fornication, or attrocious Violence upon their persons, or attempts thereunto; and may also extend to the revealing of the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours secrets, or not Defending him against his Enemies or such as attack him, or deserting of him in that case; and in case of a necessary flight, by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouring, in not crying for help and relief; and in lawful War, in not concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with him, or deserting him, while with any probability of prevailing, he stood in fight, if the Vassal were then near him, but it will not import his concourse, active in private quarrels by force of Arms, which are not warrantable.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. In all cases the ignorance of the Vassal not being affected, or his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness will excuse these Delinquencies, and whatever he acteth in self-defence, or upon provocation of the attrocious injury of the Superiour, or by publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or in the service of his Prince, or anterior Superiour in Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding: Or unless the attrocious Deeds be past from by the Superiour, by owning his Vassal after the knowledge thereof, or by a considerable times forbearance to quarrel the same, especially when in the mean time, either the Superiour or Vassal dies; for though death obliterats Crimes as to the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet the righ arising to the Superiour in the Fee, from the Delinquence, as a resolutive condition is not excluded by the Vassals Death, if the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our were ignorant of the Fact, or not in capacity to vindicat the same through publick Calamity, or his Pupilarity or absence; but by the mutual friendship and strict Union betwixt Superiour and Vassal; small evidences will import the passing by former Delinquencies, especially when not questioned, during the life of both parties.</p>
                     <p>There are multitudes of specialities proposed by <hi>Craig,</hi> as Delinquencies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving Fees, not only in relation to the Superiour, his Person and Family; but also of invading his House, befieging the same, or entering it by force, or invading his Property, which is the ground of Purprysion, acknowledged by our Custom; or by denying or refusing to show the Superiour the Marches of the Fee, or denying any part of it to be holden of him, or not showing him his Holding and Investiture, being solemnly called to that purpose (which take no place with us; for our ordinary custom for Superiours as well as others, is to pursue Improbations of their Vassals Rights wherein the Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications is not the loss of the Fee, but the presumptive falsity of the Writes) or the denying to do justice to Superiours; but also in relation to the Fee, if he waste or deterioat it: Yea, in relation to the Vassals own Person, as if he fall in Incest, or if he kill his Brother, or commit any Paracide, or if he contract friendship with the Enemies of his Superiour: And gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, whatever may make him unfit or unworthy to attend his Superiou, or to be in his Court, but none of these are implyed in the Fidelity of any Vassal.</p>
                     <p>There be special grounds of resolution or extinction of Fees by the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Nature or Tenor thereof, as Feues become extinct, <hi>ob non solutum canonem,</hi> and other Fees are extinct by resolutive Clauses, as to both which we have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>Title</hi> 13. §.</p>

                        <hi>Craig</hi> doth hold, that by the delinquence of Vassals, Conquest, or <hi>feuda nova,</hi> become extinct and return to the Superiour; but Heretage, or <hi>feuda vetera,</hi> do but become extinct as to the delinquent Vassals and his Descendents but is not returned to the Superiour, but divolved to the next Collateral of the delinquent Vassal descending from the first Vassal, who would have suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded if the delinquent Vassals had died without issue, and who must enter Heir to the delinquent Vassals predecessor; but in this the interest of the Superiour is too far restricted; for we have no custom nor tenor to enter any person heir to a Defunct, while a nearer heir is existent, whatsoever his delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be, except <hi>Paricide.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He doth also move this question, That if the Vassal have committed a Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal delict against the Superiour, and a publick crime inferring forefaulture, whether the Fee would fall to the King, or to the Superiour, or if the first sentence of forefaulture or recognition would prevail: but does not determine it. Yet the first deliquences, sufficient to extinguish the Fee, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in, must give the preference; for the sentence of forfaulture or recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition is but declaratory, and hath effect, not from the sentence, but from the deed inferring it.</p>
                     <p>There is no difference, whether the delinquence inferring recognition, was before the Vassal was actually entered or after; but it is more questionable, whether recognition would be incurred by the deeds of the appearand Heir in his predecessors life; which could have no effect as to Collaterals, who are not <hi>alioqui successuri,</hi> seing they may be excluded by a descendent, which in men is alwayes in hope: And if the heir apparent die before his predecessor, it can have no effect to exclude either his Collaterals or Descendents; and it is more probable, that though the heir apparent should survive, he would not be excluded, seing feudal delinquences are now so little extended.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. It hath been much and long debated, and is not yet decided, whether Recognition can be incurred for ay attrocious deeds dne by sub-vassals, whereby the Superiour might claim the right of the sub-vassals. Fee to fall to him by Recognition; Or, Whether Recognition can only be incurred by the deeds of the immediat Vassal. The case in question was, where a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vassal rose in rebellion against the King, whereby his Fee, as all his other Rights, were confiscate to the King by forefaulture, which could but confiscate them as they were in his person, with the burden of all real Rights of Liferent, Annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or other subaltern Infeftments of the forefaulted person: But if the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulture of the sub-vassal did also comprehend Recognition, the sub-vassals Fee would fall to the King and belong to his Donatar, without any real Right or Burden contracted by the forefaulted person, except such as were confirmed by the King, either by a special Confirmation, or by that general consent of the King, inviting all his Subject to set their Ward-lands feu, by the Act of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> 1457. <hi>cap.</hi> 72. which would preserve such Feus, being constitute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Act of <hi>Par.</hi> 1633. rescinding that Act as to the Vassals of the King and Prince, as was found, <hi>Feb.</hi> 12. 1674. Marquess of <hi>Huntley</hi> contra <hi>Gordoun</hi> of <hi>Cairnburrow; November</hi> 16. 1681. <hi>Campbel</hi> of <hi>Silvercraigs</hi> contra Laird of <hi>Auchinbreck</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Argyle.</hi> And therefore, if Recognition were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in forefaulture, in that case it behoved to infer a general rule, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition might be incurred by all attrocious deeds against gratitude and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, omitted not only by the immediat Vassal, but by all subaltern Vassals, and would not only be competent to the King, upon deeds of treason committed
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:109710:242"/>
against him by his sub-vassals, but by all deeds of attrocity done against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Superiour by his sub-vassals; as if his sub-vassal should kill, wound or betray his Superiour. So that the question behoved to return, whether there were any feudal Contract or Obligation of fidelity betwixt the Superiour and his Sub-vassals; for if that were, then Vassals might fall in Recognition by such deeds, not only against their immediat Superiours, but against all their mediat Superiours, though never so many. For, though the case in question be most odious and unfavourable, being rebellion; yet it hath its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per punishment introduced by Law and Statute, whereby the rebel loseth Life, Land and Goods to the King, to whom all his Subjects owes fidelity, as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, though all do not owe the feudal Fidelity as Vassals; yet, if Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion take place as to the King, it must likewise fall to all other Superiours, whatever way the Land be held, Ward, Feu, Blensh or Mortification, if they have not a confirmation or consent of the Superiour, anterior to the deeds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring Recognition. We shall not therefore anticipat the publick determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the question; if custom hath determined it, what will take place? for all feudal Rights are local, but there hath not yet appeared any case, by which a Donatar by his Gift and Presentation, being infeft in the Fee of the Kings sub-vassal, forefault has excluded these who had real Rights from the forefaulted person before the treasonable fact, though much hath been disputed upon the Act of <hi>Par.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. concerning the quinquennial possession of forfaulted persons, especially from the last clause thereof, bearing, that no person presented by the King to feu Lands forefaulted, nor any Vassal of any Feuer forefaulted, shall be compelled to produce their Acquittances of their Feu-mail, or Annualrents of their forefaulted Lands of any year preceeding the forefaulture; which doth clearly acknowledge, that when the Feuers right is forefaulted, his Sub-vassals right is not forefauted, yet it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that would not end the controversie by the Act 72. <hi>Par.</hi> 1457. because these rights of the Sub-vassals of the forefaulted Feuer, might have been confirmed by the King, specially or generally by the foresaid Act, 1457. But the general Confirmation from that Act can have no effect, because the the sub-vassals whose Rights are preserved by the Act, are not Feues grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Ward-holders, but are subaltern Infeftments granted by forefault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Feuers. And without question, the King hath given no consent to any to grant Feues, but to Ward-holders only; for, though the Law hinders them to grant sub-feues or Annualrents, yet there being no consent or confirmation by the King thereto. Therefore, if the King his immediat Vassal be forefaulted, all the ancient Feues granted by him of the Lands holden Ward, will stand valid, as being consented to by the King by the foresaid Statute: But the Feues granted by him of Lands holden Blensh or Feu, will fall in consequence with his own Feu or Blensh, and cannot defend against forefaulture, more then An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nualrents or lucrative Tacks granted by him, which Law doth allow, and yet fall with his right, unless consented to, or confirmed by the Superiour.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. PRESCRIPTION is the common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction and abolishing of all Rights, and therefore is reserved here to the last place; the name and nature whereof we have from the Civil Law, wherein Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription is sometimes largely taken for any exception, but hath been appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priat to the most common exception in all cases, whereby all Actions and Causes are excluded by course of time; and so Prescription had no further effect, then to maintain the possessor in possession by exception, but not to recover possession, being lost, and could not constitute the right of Property.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In this, Prescription did chiefly differ from Usucapion by the ancient Roman Law, that Usucapion did constitute Property, and therefore is defined by <hi>Modestinus, l.</hi> 3. <hi>ff. de Usucapione; Adjectio vel acquisitio dominii per continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem possessionis temporis lege definiti.</hi> To which, description the name doth agree; for, <hi>usu-capere est capere ex usu aut possessione,</hi> to take or acquire by use
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:109710:243"/>
or possession; But every possession was not sufficient, unless it were a posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion as Proprietar, or for the possessors own use only: So detention of any thing in the name, and for the use of another, and for the possessor only in security, as a Pledge or Wodset, cannot Constitute property.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As to the time appointed for Usucapion, Moveables were acquired by continual possession for one year, <hi>l.</hi> 10. <hi>ff. de usucapion. Inst. eod in principio.</hi> And Immoveables being in <hi>Italy</hi> by the space of two years: Other Immoveables by the space of ten years, against these in the same Province; and twenty years against these out of the same Province, <hi>auth. mala fidei, C. de prescript. longi temporis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From which common Rule, some cases of greatest moment were excepted; As first, publick Rights belonging to Emperors and Kings, which (as all do agree,) cannot be acquired by Usucapion or Prescription in less then thirty or fourty years, and many think by no less then an hundred years, or immemorial possession.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Things belonging to Cities, which in some cases could not be prescrived without an hundred years possession, at least without thirty or fourty years.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Things belonging to the Church, against which no other can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire by Prescription in less then fourty years; and against the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by special priviledge, by the space of an hundred years only.</p>
                     <p>The recent <hi>Roman</hi> Law hath taken off all differences betwixt Usucapion and Prescription, <hi>Tit. de usucap. trans.</hi> whereby in either case Property is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: Yet in the ordinary acceptation, Prescription which is short in Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, is commonly called Usucapion; but we make only use of the name of Prescription for both.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Prescription or Usucapion amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> required three things, continuation of Possession uninterrupted, <hi>bona fides,</hi> and a Title, besides the kind of Possession, and time before-mentioned,</p>
                     <p>As to the first, prescription is unquestionably interrupted by real inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption or discontinuation of Possession; it is also interrupted by civil Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion by Litiscontestation, Process, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. As to the <hi>bona fides,</hi> or innocent Possession required in Prescription, it is commonly agreed, that it is requisite at the beginning of the Possession in shorter prescriptions, but that it is presumed in the longest prescription. The Civil and Canon Law differ in this, that the Civil Law requireth only <hi>bonam fidem</hi> at the beginning, so that if any person acquire any thing from him whom he believeth to be the owner thereof; and so believing beginneth to possess, though thereafter he understand that his Author was not the true owner, yet prescription doth proceed: But by the Canon Law it proceeds not: But if at any time before prescription ended, he knoweth the thing belonged to another, prescription is impeded: Yea, though prescription were ended, if the right of another appear. Most of the Canonists hold, that in <hi>foro conscientiae,</hi> the possessor is oblieged to restore, unless the knowledge and forbearance of
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:109710:244"/>
the owner, do infer or presume a Dereliction of the thing or consent, which takes no place in the case of ignorance, or error of the owner.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. In either case it is contraverted, whether he who doubteth of his or his Authors right be <hi>bonae fidei,</hi> or <hi>malae fidei</hi> possessor.</p>
                     <p>The common ground in which all agree, is that the possessors Credulity and Belief of his own and his Authors Right makes <hi>bonam fidem,</hi> and his knowledge of the Right of another <hi>malam,</hi> which seemeth to infer, that he who doubteth, must be in <hi>mala fide,</hi> because he believeth not his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour to have had Right, doubt and belief being contraries: And upon the other part, he who only doubteth, cannot be said to know the right of another.</p>
                     <p>The most rational Conciliation is by this Distinction, that doubting being like the dubious Ballance, when it enclineth more to the belief of the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, and Authors Right, then of the right of the other. The Denomination and effect is taken from the stronger, and he is said to believe his own Right, and can no ways be said to believe the Right of another, whose doubtful opinion doth rather incline to his own Right then the others; and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise, when his opinion enclineth more to believe the Authours Right then his own.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. These things being hidden Acts of the Minde, it is very difficult to know who is in <hi>bona fide</hi> or <hi>mala fide;</hi> but <hi>bona fides</hi> is presumed, unless a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probation, or vehiment presumption be for <hi>mala fides,</hi> of which <hi>Menochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de arbitrar. Jud. quast. cas.</hi> 225. relateth many, whereof these are chief; First, He who possesseth without a Title is ever presumed <hi>malae fidei</hi> posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessor. Secondly, Common fame in the Neighbourhood, that the thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired belongs to another. Thirdly, If it be intimate or declared to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer, before he acquired that it was anothers. Fourthly, The extrajudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial confession of the Acquirer, or of witnesses that the thing belonged to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Fifthly, If the Acquisition be not with observation of the ordinary So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities. Sixthly, If the Acquisition be from a Procurator, and the Acquirer did not see his Warrand, albeit he had one. Seventhly, If the Acquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be from a prodigal person. Eighthly, If the Acquirer take unaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed wayes of Security. And last, By whatsoever the Acquirer is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieged to know by Law, <hi>scire &amp; scire debere aequiparantur in jure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. As to the Title requisite in prescription, thereby is not meaned a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient valide Title, which needed not the help of prescription, but a colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Title is sufficient, as that which is acquired by Emption; the Emption is Title enough for prescription, though the seller had no Right, or that which descendeth from any other by Succession, Legacy, Donation, &amp;c. And ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, whatsoever way Property useth to pass, is sufficient for prescription, though it be not sufficient alone to Constitute the Property, to which there is requisite the Authors Right, and the transmission thereof; but to prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the manner of transmission is enough for <hi>bona fides,</hi> and continuation of possession supplieth the rest.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Prescription although it be by positive Law, founded upon Utility more then upon Equity, the introduction whereof, the <hi>Romans</hi> ascribed to to themselves, yet hath it been since received by most Nations; but not so as
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:109710:244"/>
to be counted amongst the Laws of Nations, because it is not the same, but different in diverse Nations, as to the matter, manner and time of it; and therefore, Nations under no common Authority, do not prescrive properly against each other, albeit by long patience and no contradiction, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent may be inferred, even by the Law of Nations.</p>
                     <p>The grounds and reasons of prescription, are first, publick utility, <hi>Ne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minia rerum sint incerta, neve lites sint perpetuae:</hi> And also because the Law ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth it as a Dereliction of the owners Right, if he own it not, neither pursue it within such a time. In the Civil Law though prescription reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all kinds of things, Moveable and Immoveable, yet with these Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. First, These things that are not in Commerce, as they are not capable of express alienation, so neither of preseription.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Things stollen, whereunto for utilities sake to repress that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Vice, the Law hath stated an inherent and real Vitiosity, that passeth with the thing Stollen to all singular Successors; and therefore, though such things be acquired by a just Title, though for a Cause onerous, and an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent price, and by continuation of Possession <hi>bona fide;</hi> yet prescription taketh no effect because of the inherent Vitiosity. The like is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of Rapine or violent Possession: Yet the Fruits and Profites of such things belong to the <hi>bonae fidei</hi> possessor, rather by that Right that followeth possession, <hi>bonae fidei:</hi> (Of which formerly in the Title, <hi>real Rights,</hi>) then by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It runneth not against Pupils by the Civil Law, though some think that it is not to be understood of their Moveables; yet it runneth against other Minors, but they may be restored if they pursue for Restitution, in the time and manner prescribed in Law.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. To come now closs to our Law concerning Prescription, our common Rule of Prescription is by the course of fourty years, both in Moveables and Immoveables, Obligations, actions, Acts, Decreets, and generally all Rights as well against these absent as present, we have not these differences, which we have shown were in the Civil Law; and because our Prescription is so long, there is little question with us, <hi>de bona fide.</hi> But there must be continual pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session free from interruption, and in Lands and other Fees a Title, of which hereafter.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. By our ancient Custom, there was no place for Prescription in any case which hath been Corrected by our Statutes, both as to long and short Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription. First, as to personal Rights, in <hi>Par.</hi> 1469. <hi>cap.</hi> 28. &amp; <hi>par.</hi> 1474. <hi>c.</hi> 54. it is Statute, that as to all obligations that should be pursued thereafter, and that were not then depending in Law, before the making of that Act; that if the Creditor did not follow or pursue the Obligation within the space of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, and take document thereupon, the same shall be prescrived and of no avail: Which Statute, though it mention only Obligations, (that is to say, simple Obligations) was also extended to others, as Contracts of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, whereupon no Marriage followed, as may be inferred, <hi>argumenta a contrario,</hi> from the Decision, <hi>February</hi> 26. 1622. Sir <hi>George Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun contra</hi> Lord <hi>Sinclar:</hi> And afterward it hath been ordinarly extended even to Contracts of Marriage, wherepon Marriage followed, <hi>November</hi> 27. 1630. <hi>Lauder contra Colmiln.

The Title in heretable Rights, being ground-rights of Lands or Annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, is very well distinguished, by the last Statute, betwixt Conquest and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retage; for, Heretage which hath descended by succession, from a predecessor, is content with a more slender Title, <hi>viz.</hi> Seasines without the Warrands or Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, but only bearing, that they proceed upon Retoures or Precepts of <hi>Clare constat,</hi> providing that the possession hath been by vertue of these Seasines: So that not only there must be possession for fourty years together, but Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines consecutive, proper to the several possessors during that time: But pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasers must not only have for their Title, a Seasine preceeding the fourty years prescription, but if they found upon their proper right, they must also produce a Charter preceeding the fourty years. And therefore, though a purchaser should possess fourty years, and show his Seasine anterior thereto; yet would it not be a Title for prescription, unless he produce a Charter before that time, where, by Charter, must not be understood a solemn Charter as it is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from a Disposition or Precept, but as it comprehends these; for many valid Infeftments have no Charter, but Seasine proceeds upon the Precept of Seasine contained in the Disposition. And though a Precept of Seasine were only shown as the warrand of the Seasine, the same with fourty years posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion by vertue thereof, would perfect Prescription: for the Seasines of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, without Warrand or Adminicle, are but the assertions of Nottars, and not probative; yet they are sufficiently probative, not only by the immediat Warrand or Precept whereupon they proceed, but upon the mediat Warrand; as if a Seasine be produced with a Bond or Obliegement, to grant an Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conform to that Seasine, <hi>vide Tit.</hi> 3. § 19. But purchasers may well conjoin their own Title and their Authors; So that if he can show in his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors persons, consecutive Seasines for fourty years, upon Retoures or Precepts of <hi>Clare constat,</hi> and possession conform, it will be sufficient: or if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not show such Seasines and Possession in their Authors for the whole fourty years; yet, if they show the accomplishment of fourty years by their own Seasines and Warrands thereof, and possession conform, these may compleat the Prescription.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. This Statute doth not only secure Rights, and Lands, and Annualrents, by fourty years peaceable possession <hi>cum titulo,</hi> but also other heretable Rights, such as Wodsets; for, Registrat or incorporat Reversions being exprest as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, Wodsets must be comprehended in the Rule, and all Infeftments for Security or Relief, which do imply a Reversion incorporat. It will also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Infeftments of Teinds; for, though Teinds be <hi>separatum Tenementum</hi> from the Stock, yet both are ground-rights or Infeftments of the Land; yea, Infeftments of Life-rent, if possessed and unquarrelled for fourty years, show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Seasine and the Warrand or Adminicle thereof, the same would make the Liferent-right irreducible, or might perfect Prescription, being joined to their Authors Rights; yea, this Statute hath been extended to long Tacks of Lands, Teinds or others.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. A right to Teinds may be prescribed, as well as other Rights, by fourty years possession; but a right to by-gone Teinds, being founded in publick Law, prescribes not, except as to the by-gones before fourty years; and the possessor cannot prescribe an absolute immunity and freedom from payment

within the fourty years, and in time coming, seing all Lands in <hi>Scotland</hi> by Law are lyable in Teind, but such as never payed any being <hi>cum decimis inclusis,</hi> or belonging to the <hi>Cystertian</hi> Order, Templers and Hospitallers, or Gleibs, <hi>February</hi> 7. 1666.

This Statute is also extended unto rights of Patronage, or Offices which are heretable rights, though they be not alwayes constitute or continued by Infeftment; yet fourty years possession by the original right in the first acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or by the continuation in their successors, does establish their rights against all quarrelling by Reduction or Declarator. Yea, this Statue is extended to long Tacks, which (if cled with fourty years peaceable possession, either in the Tacksman or his Assigneys, or their Heirs who need no service) cannot be quarrelled, but stand valid, not only for these fourty years, but for all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent years unexpired: As was found in a Tack of Teinds, though set with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out consent of the Patron, and the Bolls liquidate to ten shilling, <hi>July</hi> 7. 1677. the Parson of <hi>Prestounhaugh</hi> contra his Parochioners.</p>

                     <p n="25">25. Prescription doth not only exclude the preference of other better Rights, which if insisted upon within prescription, would have been preferred as anterior, and thereby the posterior right <hi>a non habente potestatem.</hi> But all ground of Reduction by the King, or other Superiours or Authors, is exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; So that the neglect of the Kings Officers cannot be obtruded by the Act of Parliament, declaring that their neglects shall not prejudge the King, neither any nullity in the titles of prescription, except it be in the essentials thereof: So, prescription cannot sustain a perpetual Tack without Ish, which is essential thereto; nor a Seasine without a Symbol, generally or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, or not given upon the ground of the Land. But all requisites in Rights introduced by Custom or Statute, and not essential thereto, are cut off by Prescription.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Our Statutes have introduced several short prescriptions, as the Rights to which they relate do require, which we shall shortly represent, not according to the time they were introduced, but according to the time of their endurance, most of them occurring to be considered in their proper places, with the rights whereto they relate.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. And first, Our Law hath introduced the <hi>annus deliberandi,</hi> in favours of Heirs, because if once they enter or immix themselves in their predecessors Heretage, they become lyable for their whole Debts, though far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the worth of their Heretage; and therefore, the Heir appearand hath a year to deliberate whether the Heretage will be profitable, during which, he may not only enquire, but may pursue Actions of Exhibition, <hi>ad deliberandum,</hi> And if they forbear they are free of all Actions against them or the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage during that year; and therefore, that priviledge prescrives in a year and day, after the Defuncts death.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. Secondly, by the Act of <hi>Par.</hi> 1661. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. There is a preference granted to the Creditors of Defuncts preferring them to the Creditors of the heir or appearand heir; so that all diligences by the Creditors of Defuncts, against the Defuncts Estate, shall be preferred to the diligences, for Debts contracted by appearand heirs, providing the saids diligences of the Defuncts Creditors, be compleat within three years, after the Defuncts death; albeit the being compleat be not exprest in the Statute: Yet by the design thereof, it must be so understood; for if Diligences inchoat in these three years, though
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:109710:249"/>
prefected thereafter would be sufficient, the preference would not be for three years, but might come to be for thirty years.</p>
                     <p>Compleat Diligences are Appryzings, or Adjudicrtions with Infeftment, or a Charge against the Superiour to Infeft, Poinding, and Decreets for making Arrested sums or goods forth-coming: And by the said Statute, Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by heirs or appearand heris of the Defuncts Eltates, are declared not to be valid against the predecessours Creditors, unless made a full year after the Defuncts death, so that after that year the heirs Dispositions are not limited, though they should prefer their own Creditors to the Defuncts; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Defuncts Creditors had need to use Inhibition, or Inchoat their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence by charge to enter heir, which may be within the year of deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they may also then Arrest, though they cannot Insist in pursuits upon any of these or other grounds, till the year pass: For this Act doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the diligences of the Creditors of the Defunct to the voluntary Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons granted by the heir to their own Creditors, but only to the legal diligence of their own Creditors; therefore, this preference of the Defuncts Creditors prescrives in three years, or rather in two years, because within the year of deliberation they cannot pursue, unless the heir enter or immix; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this priviledge prescrives in two years after the year of delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. Thirdly, There is a Triennial prescription of Spuilzies, Ejections, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusions, which comprehends succeeding in the Vice of parties removed, <hi>par.</hi> 1579. <hi>cap.</hi> 81. This prescription by the Statute, runs not against Minors.</p>
                     <p>This prescription doth not take away the Right, but only the priviledges thereof, as proceeding upon a short Citation, and the oath <hi>in litem,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to the party injured, to declare his loss, and the violent profites; but hinders not the Restitution, or Recovery of the thing, with the ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites.</p>
                     <p>There is also a Triennial prescription of Merchant Counts, House Mails, and the like, which is only as to the manner of probation, that if these be not pursued within three years from the time they are due, witnesles shall not be admitted to prove the same, but only write or oath of party: But in this prescription, Minority is not excepted, <hi>par.</hi> 1519. <hi>cap.</hi> 83. which is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Rents of Lands in the Countrey, <hi>January</hi> 20. 1627. <hi>Gavin Ross contra Fleming.</hi> In both these Prescriptions (if Actions be intented within the prescription of three years) Custom hath not limited these Actions to three years, but they continue for fourty years, which might have much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently been cut of by three years, for thereby the Action which is acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory was more priviledged then the principal Right to which it is accessory, which is amended in part by posterior Statutes.</p>
                     <p>There is another Triennial prescription in removings, that if they be not pursued within three years, there can never be purfuite thereafter upon the same Warning, where in Minority is not excepted, <hi>par.</hi> 1579. <hi>cap.</hi> 82. This prescription was not reckoned from the date of the warning, as being uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but from the Term to which the Warning was made, <hi>February</hi> 6. 1629. Lady <hi>Borthwick contra Scot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="31">31. There is a Quadriennial prescription in favours of Minors, to reduce deeds done by them in their Minority to their enorm Lesion, from their age of twenty one compleat, to their age of twenty five conpleat; but these Actions being intented within that <hi>Quadriennium utile</hi> did last for fourty years, till the late Act of Parliament anent prescription and interruption.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. There are several Quinquennial prescriptions; As first, all Arrestments upon Decreets, prescrive five years after the dates thereof; and Arrestments
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:109710:250"/>
upon Dependences, prescrive in five years after Sentence, upon the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, if the saids Arrestments, be not pursued or insisted upon, during that time.</p>
                     <p>By this Statute Ministers Stipends and Multures not pursued for within five years after they are due; and likeways, Mails and Duties of Tennents, not being pursued within five years after the Tennents removal prescrive, unless the said Stipend, Multures, Mails and duties, be proven resting by oath, or special write, acknowledging what is resting; and that all Bargains concerning move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables or sums of Money, probable by witnesses, shall only be probable by write or oath of party, if the samine be not pursued within five years after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the bargain.</p>
                     <p>There is also a quinquennial prescription of the Legal Reversions of special Adjudications whereby Lands are adjudged only equivalent to the sums, by the Act of Parliament, <hi>September</hi> 6. 1672: <hi>cap.</hi> 19.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. There was a seven years prescription of the legal Reversions of Appriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; And there is Septennial prescription of interruptions, which if they be not renewed every seven years, prescrive by the Act of Parliament, <hi>December</hi> 8. 1669. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. There is likewise a Decennial prescription by the said Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1669. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. of all Actions upon warnings, Spuilzies, Ejections, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restments, or for Ministers Stipend, Multures, Rents of removed Tennents, which Actions prescrive in ten years, if they be not renued every five years, but prejudice of any shorter prescription of the saids Acts by former Acts of Parliament, which gives ground to alter the former Custom anent the Trien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial prescription, that the Actions intented thereupon may prescrive in three years.</p>
                     <p n="35">35. And by the same Statute, there is introduced a prescription of twenty years of Holograph Bonds, and Holograph Missives; and subscriptions in Compt Books without witnesses, unless the verity of the said subscriptions be proven by the defenders oath; by which manner of probation there is action competent, till the long prescription of fourty years.</p>
                     <p n="36">36. All these short prescriptions are declared not to run against Minors, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept only the prescriptions of Removings, and Merchants Compts, &amp;c. which except not Minority, though they do immediately follow prescription of Spuilzie, Ejections, &amp;c. which do except the same, and so appear to be of design omitted in the former Triennial prescriptions; and therefore, it is not like the Lords will extend the exception of minority thereto, as they would not appoint a years Rent to Superiours, in Adjudications as in Appryzings, because it was omitted in the Act anent Adjudications, next unto the Act anent Appryzings, in which it was exprest, until the late Act of Parliament, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the years Rent to Adjudications.</p>

                     <p>HAVING now gone thorow all the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kinds of privat Rights, both as to their Nature and Constitution, and as to their Extinction and Distitution; We are come to the second part of our Design propos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Conveyance and Transmission of these Rights, which stand in force and are not exstinct; for the extinction of a right is no conveyance of it seing thereby it ceasseth to exist.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Rights are Conveyed, or Derived, either amongst the living, or from the dead; and in both, the Conveyance is different, in personal and real Rights: And in Immoveable and Heritable Rights, the Conveyance amongst the living, of personal Rights, is by Assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; of real Rights by Dispofition, and promiscuously of both by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscation: Conveyance of Right from the dead, is by Succession, in Moveables by Executry; in Heritable Rights, by the succession of Heirs, and other like successors; of which in order.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Personal Rights or Obligations, are sometimes incommunicable, and not assignable, or transmissible, either by reason of the matter, such as most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal and parental Obligations are, or where there is a singular consideration of the person, as in Commissions, Trusts, &amp;c. Most of these are Intransmis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, even by the consent, both of Debitor and Creditor: Yea, generally, all Obligations are Intransmissible, upon either part directly without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the other party, which is clear upon the part of the Debitor, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, without consent of the Creditor, liberate himself, and transmit his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon another, though with the Creditors consent he may, by dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: Neither can a Creditor force his Debitor to become Debitor to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without his own consent, as when he takes him oblieged to pay to him or his assigneys.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Yet, that Obligations may become the more useful and effectual, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome hath introduced an indirect manner of transmission thereof, without the Debitors consent, whereby the assigney is constitute Procurator; and so as Mandatar for the Creditor, he hath power to exact and discharge, but it is to his own behove, and so he is also denominat Donatar, and this is the ordinary conception of Assignations. The like is done amongst Merchands, by an order, whereby the Debitor is ordered to pay such a person; the debt, which indeed is a Mandat, but if it be to his own behove, it is properly an
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109710:253"/>
Assignation; and in savours of Creditors, Law hath introduced judicial As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signations upon arrestment, and by appyzing and adjudication.</p>
                     <p>Assignations are more frequent with us then any where, there is scarce men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof in the Civil Law: It is also called, <hi>Cessio,</hi> which both there and with us, is most applyed to <hi>Cessio bonorum &amp; actionum;</hi> where not only Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, but property of things: and generally, all Rights are ceded from the Debitor to his Creditor; from this Term the, the assigney is also called Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner, as the assigner is also called Cedent.</p>
                     <p>Under Assignations are comprehended Translations, being Transmissions from a prior assigney to a posterior; or Retrocessions, which are returning back of the Right assigned from the assigney to the Cedent, which are also cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Repositions.</p>
                     <p>For clearing the matter of Assignations; First, consider the requisites to make them perfect and valid Conveyances. Secondly, what are the effects and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thereof.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. For the first, an assignation doth necessarly require the clear expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Cedent assigney, and thing assigned; and though the ordinarly Stile of it be known, yet any terms that may express the transmission of the right assigned from the Cedent to the assigney, will be sufficient, as if the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent assign, transfer and dispone make over, set over, gift or grant the thing assigned to the assigney, or nominat or constitute him his Cessioner, assigney, donatar, or procurator to his own behove; and therefore, an assignation to a Bond, was found valid, both against principal and Cautioners, both being in the dispositive Clause, though the Cautioners were omitted in the Clause (with power, &amp;c.) which was not, though a necessary clause, <hi>Decem.</hi> 12. 1622. <hi>Johnstoun</hi> contra <hi>Jack.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The conveyance of Bonds or other Writes, wherein the name of the Creditor or Acquirer is left blank, have become of late very frequent, and have occasioned many debates, as to the Conveyance of such Rights, and the effects thereof: As first, Whether the leaving the name of the Creditor or Acquirer blank be warrantable, or a fraudulent conveyance, to conceal and keep in the dark, to whom the right belongeth, that Creditors may not know to affect it by legal diligence: The reason ordinarly given for taking Writes in that way, is to shun the trouble of assignations, translations or inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations thereof, as they pass from hand to hand, according to that Tenor of Obligation, frequent in other places, whereby the Debitor oblieged him to and perform such things, <hi>latori presentium;</hi> by which he is oblieged to pay to none, but he may get up the Bond, and safely pay to any that hath it.</p>
                     <p>There is another reason of taking blank Bonds to shun compensation upon any debt due by the Cedent; for the Law alloweth compensation against the assigney, upon any debt due by the Debitor to the Cedent, before the assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was intimate: But when the Debitor gives a Bond blank in the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors name, he is thereby understood to pass from compensation, which hath been sustained, <hi>Vide Title</hi> 11. upon compensation, for it is a just personal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection against him who granted the blank Bond, not to stop the effect or exc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof, upon any other debt due by him to that party, to whom he granted the Bond. And albeit such blank Bonds may pass amongst Merchants,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109710:253"/>
where intimations are not necessary upon Bills of Exchange, which are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the orders of Merchants thereupon without intimation: and though such Bonds may pass amongst persons of intire Credit, yet such conveyances, if they should be encouraged, and pass currently without intimation, would be of dangerous consequence, and give occasion to much fraud; for thereby Creditors should not know in whose person such rights stood and how to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them for just Debts: And although the granter of such blank Bonds, or the haver, who so transmits them, may be excluded from compensation: Yet others who may have interest to propone compensation in the same way, as they may found upon a Discharge granted by the receiver of the blank Bond to the Debitor therein, cannot be excluded from alledging compensation, there being no personal objection against them. And likewise, Conveyances without a Cause onerous, in prejudice of anterior Creditors, by persons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvent and fraudulent; so that if either the first receiver of such blank Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, or the posterior receivers thereof be insolvent, and without an equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Cause onerous, do transmit such blank Securities, only by delivering the same, the intermediat havers can hardly ever be known, whose Creditors might affect the right while in their hands, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Upon which consideration, the first occasion that occurred to the Lords, being a blank Bond, granted by <hi>Marjory Sandilands,</hi> and delivered to <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Veatch,</hi> he did deliver the same to <hi>Marion Geddess,</hi> who filled up her name in the blank left for the Creditor, and registrate the Bond against <hi>Sandilands</hi> the Debitor; yet <hi>Tailziefer</hi> who was <hi>Veatches</hi> Creditor, having arrested all sums in <hi>Sandilands</hi> hands, due to <hi>Veatch</hi> in the competition, betwixt <hi>Tailziefer</hi> the arrester and <hi>Geddess,</hi> whose name was filled up in the blank, and the Bond registrate in her name before the arrestment, the sum remaining yet unpayed in <hi>Sandilands</hi> hands, the arrester was preferred, in respect that albeit <hi>Geddefs</hi> name was filled up in the blank Bond, and it so registrate before the arrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet the delivery of the blank Bond by <hi>Veatch</hi> to <hi>Geddess,</hi> being in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect an assignation, was found to require intimation; and therefore, <hi>Tailzie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> the arrester was preferred: In this case <hi>Veatch,</hi> who was first Creditor, was insolvent.</p>
                     <p>And albe it the Lords in the competition betwixt <hi>Thomas Hendrison</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid George,</hi> decided, <hi>Jan.</hi> 18. 1668. preferred <hi>Hendrison,</hi> whose name was in the Bond as Creditor, and who offered his oath for clearing, whether the bond was blank, <hi>ab initio</hi> and when filled up, yet the Lords did not leave it to his oath, but took witnesses, <hi>ex officio,</hi> who proved that they saw the Bond filled up with <hi>Henriesons</hi> name before the arrestment laid on by <hi>Thomas George,</hi> in the hands of the Debitor, as due to <hi>Short</hi> his Creditor before the arrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet there was nothing adduced to prove that ever the Bond had been blank, or delivered to <hi>Short.</hi> And likewise, a Bond blank in the Creditors name, being delivered by the receiver of the Bond to a Creditor of his, in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his debt, the same was found relevant to be proven that the blank Bond was delivered before the Declarator of Escheat of the party, to whom it was first delivered in satisfaction of a Debt due by him before he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunced, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 19. 1676. and <hi>Jan</hi> 17. 1677.

                     <p>There hath been nothing done since to take off the necessity of a formal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation made to the Debitor, of the filling up of the Creditors name upon production of the Bond, it self showing that name to be filled up; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

                     <p>As to the manner of probation, that the Bond was blank, <hi>ab initio</hi> in the Creditors name, it is a strong evidence that it is written with a hand different from the body of the Bond; for though blank draughts of Bonds be frequently drawn up by Writers and Nottars, leaving the sums, the names of the Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Creditor blank, which are filled up by any that makes use of the draught, yet at the subscription, the filler up of the sum, the Debitor and Creditors name should be exprest; for these are more Substantial then all the rest of the Bond, so that if the Creditors name be not filled up with the hand that wrote the Bond, or of him who insert the date and witnesses; it will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to have been blank; in which case, the Debitors oath may be taken, to whom he did deliver it for his own use, and that persons oath to whom he did deliver the same, whereby the progress of it, till it come to him whose name was insert, will be found out; and upon this ground a Disposition of Lands bearing to be to two persons for themselves and other Creditors of the Dispon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers after-specified, after which, there were several lines written with another hand, inserting particular Creditors and sums, without mentioning of the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up there, or at the Date of the Write; therefore an Inhibition by a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor of the Disponers, was sustained to reduce the right, of these Creditors filled up in the blank, as presumed to be filled up after the Inhibition, although the date of the Disposition was before the Inhibition, unless it were proven by witnesses insert in the Disposition or others above exception, that the blank was so filled up before the Inhibition, <hi>Jan.</hi> 15. 1670.

                     <p>These blank Bonds are so little favoured, that when the Debitor depones that he is only debitor by a Bond blank in the Creditors name; which he did deliver to such a party for his own use, but knows not now who hath the Bond; and consequently to whom he is debitor, it will not liberat him from the debt of that party to whom he did deliver it, though it may make him lyable to double payment to that party, and to him who hath the Bond, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own deed in delivering the Bond blank in the Creditors name, which infers that hazard: Yea, if the Debitor should depone that the Bond was blank, <hi>abinitio,</hi> and delivered to such a party, but afterwards it was shown to the Debitor, filled up in the name of such another party, before the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restment, whereby he became debitor to that party, and not to the first; it is not like that quality will be respected, unless he depone that he had payed before the arrestment; for in <hi>Veatches</hi> case, the filling up of <hi>Geddess</hi> name was unquestionably offered to be proven, that the Bond was registrat in <hi>Ged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess</hi> name, before the arrestment, which is much stronger probation then the oath of the debitor.</p>

or the matter made Litigious upon these personal Rights, before Infeftment, they are not <hi>habile</hi> to affect a real right, or a singular Successor therein; but because appryzings within the legal, may be taken away in the same manner as personal rights; therefore the assignations, discharges and back bonds, by these who have right to the appryzing, being made within the legal, are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, if thereupon the matter be made litigious before the expyry of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Reversion or Inhibition used thereupon, they will be effectual against the singular successors, even after the Legal is expyred, but after expyry of the Legal Infeftments upon appryzings are in the same case as Infeftments upon Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redeemable Dispositions for they are the foundation of the rights of most Lands in the Kingdom, and if personal Rights should make them insecure after the expyry of the legal, it would be of great inconvenience.</p>

It is more dubious and hath been diversly decided, when the excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are personal against the Cedent, in mutual Contracts, the Contracter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self can have no action unless he fulfil his part; but whether his assigney will be in the like case is the question, which is at large cleared, <hi>Tit.</hi> 10. §. 16. and therefore shall not be here repeated.</p>
                     <p>Judicial assignations are oftwo sorts, according to the matter conveyed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, which if it be moveable is conveyed from the debitor to his Creditor by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restment and decreet, for making the arrested sums and goods forthcoming, and if it be Heretable by appryzing or adjudication.</p>
                     <p>As to the first, that the progress upon arrestment may be clearly taken up; we shall first consider the arrestment it self. Secondly, The lousing of it. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The action for making forthcoming.</p>
                     <p>Arrestment is a precept or command of a Judge, ordaining the thing arrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to remain in the same case it is when arrested, till such things be done as are prescribed in the precept, or Letters of arrestment: It is sometimes extended to any preparatory Precept of a Judge, antecedent unto any further process, so the first Citation or securing of persons till tryal were made, or surety found, its called an arrestment or attatchment, as appears in the force of the Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers arreftments of Delinquents, <hi>Par.</hi> 1487. <hi>cap.</hi> 99. <hi>Par.</hi> 1528. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. But ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restment proceeds most ordinarly upon an Interlocutor sentence, as when par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are contending for Peats, Turffs, or Corn upon debateable Land, these use to be arrested till the mater be decided, whereby the thing arrested be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes litigious, and any thing done to the contrary hath the effect of breach of arrestment, and is of the Nature of <hi>innovatalite dependente,</hi> which therefore must be summarly restored and put in <hi>statu quo</hi> and brings no advantage but loss to the actor.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. But arrestment which we are now about, is Precept or Letters of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restment, arresting Debts or Goods in the hands of any party, haver thereof, at the instance of the Creditor of him to whom the Debts or Goods belong to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main under arrestment, untill the debt whereupon the arrestment proceeds, be secured or satisfied; therefore arrestments may be granted by all Judges ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar, Superior or Inferior; but the arrestment of an Inferior Judge was only
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109710:257"/>
found effectual in Process before himself, and before no other Inferiour Judge, <hi>March</hi> 8. 1634. <hi>Smith</hi> contra <hi>Miller.</hi> But upon occasion of this debate, most of the Lords thought an Inferiour Judge might proceed upon the Lords arrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, passing in the Kings name, and there is not wanting ground to think that an Inferiour Judge may proceed upon the arrestment of another, seing all of them proceed alone upon the Kings authority, as if the defender change his Domicile. An arrestment made by the Inferiour Judge, where hedwelt before, ought not to be ineffectual, nor he necessitate to pursue before the Lords, as was found in an arrestment before the Admiral, March 22- 1637. <hi>

                     <p>Arrestment requires no other solemnity but the execution thereof, by him to whom the Letters are directed, which requires the like requisites as other executions do: of which hereafter.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. There hath been an extraordinary form of arrestment, sometime used and sustained, whereby Creditors did arrest the Goods of their Debitors in the Debitors own hand, and thereupon did pursue such as bought from them, whereof there is an instance observed by <hi>Dury, Jan.</hi> 10. 1624. betwixt the Laird of <hi>Innerweek, John Wilkie</hi> and the Lady <hi>Bothwel,</hi> wherein <hi>Innerweek</hi> having arrested a parcel of Wool in the Lady <hi>Botwels</hi> hand, upon a debt owing by her to him, and she having thereafter sold the Wool to <hi>John Wilkie,</hi> who payed the price, he was decerned to make forthcoming the true worth of the Wool to <hi>Innerweek,</hi> although nothing appears instructed, that there was any Collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion betwixt the Lady <hi>Bothwel</hi> and <hi>Wilkie,</hi> but what may be conjectured from the Lords allowing the price of the Wool. This kind of arrestment hath not been drawn in example, for I have found no instance of it observed by any since that time; and as the instance observed, is but the arrestment of one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, if it were to be allowed it might be extended to more particulars, even to all the moveable Goods and Means of the debitor, and certainly it would be ordinarly so used; as straitning the debitor more, that he could dispose of nothing, but to the use of the arresting Creditor, and so it would become an Inhibition in Moveables, yet much more inconvenient, because Inhibition must be published at the Mercat Cross, and registrat; whereas arrestment may be done most privatly before two witnesses: And though Inhibitions at first were designed to disable debitors, not only to dispone or dilapidat their Lands or heritage, but their Moveable Goods, as the stile of Inhibition doth still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, yet experience did early show, that there was a necessity for current course of Moveables, and that it could not consist with Traffick and Commerce, that no man could securely buy Moveables without inspection ofregisters; and therefore, Inhibitions have now no effect as to Moveables, much less should arrestment of the debitors moveables in his own hand, which could with no reason affect the moveables, when disponed for a just cause to third parties,

much less could it infer breach of Arrestment against the buyers after Arrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and all the effect it could have, were only to superad upon the Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the penalty of breach of Arrestment thereby to Confiscat all his Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, whereas there are ordinarly liquidat penalties agreed upon, of consent of Debitor and Creditor.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. Arrestment being a personal Prohibition, used against him in whose hands the Arrestment was made, if he die it is not extended to his Successors, but they may dispose of the Goods or Sums Arrested, unless it be renewed in their hands, in the same manner as an Inhibition, which is also a legal Prohibition, extending to Heretable Rights as Arrestment doth to Moveables; but though the Debitor whose Goods or Sums were Arrested die, the Arrestment ceasseth not, but the debt being established against his successors, Processmay proceed upon the Arrestment, <hi>Feb.</hi> 19. 1669: <hi>Isobel Glen</hi> contra <hi>John Home.

                     <p n="39">39. In these Competitions it must be considered that arrestment doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute no Right in the Arrester, but is only a legal Prohibition to alter the condition of the thing arrested, and to pay or deliver the same to the Arrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers debitor; but that it may remain in his hand for satisfaction of the debt arrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for: And it is only general arresting all sums of Money or Goods, in the hands of the party in whose hands it is laid on, due or belonging to the arrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers debitor, for satisfying of the debt whereupon the arrestment proceeded; and therefore, cannot be of more effect, then a denunciation of Lands to be appryzed, or a Citation on a summonds of Adjudication; and therefore, doth Constitute or Transfer no Right, but is a legal diligence, rendering the subject matter arrested litigious, so that the party in whose hands the arrestment is made, cannot alter any sums or debts belonging to that debitor in prejudice of the debt arrested for, until the Arrestment be loused, and Caution found for the debt or Decreet, absolvitor or declarator be obtained, excluding the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restment: And if he do any thing in the contrary, it infers breach of Arrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, confiscating his Moveables, and he is lyable, as if the sums or goods remained in his hand, <hi>pro possessore habetur qui dolo desiit possidere:</hi> And though the Arrestment have no intimation to the Arresters debitor, or any of his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors; yet if any of them recover the sums or goods arrested by the Collusion or neglect of the party, in whose hands arrestment is made, he will still remain lyable; and if he have not acted <hi>bona fide,</hi> he will incur the breach of arrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as if by Collusion and gratification, he or his procurator (whose deed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109710:261"/>
will be presumed his) oppose the arrester, and procure delay to compear, and depone and acknowledge the debt, or he holden as confest to another arrester; neither will he be liberat by offering his oath, that he gave no such Warrand, for the imploying a Procurator is a sufficient Warrand for all the common course of Process, and requires no special mandat: Yea, if he pay or deliver to any other arrester, or even be poynded upon a Decreet at his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, he will not be liberate, seing he ought to have raised a Process of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiple poinding, calling the debitor and all the arresters or assigneys to dispute their several rights, that once payment to the party, found to have best right, might liberate him; yet if he have payed, he does thereby without a direct assignation, come in the place of the party to whom he hath payed; and if he can show that parties right, is preferable to the arrester insisting, he will be heard thereupon.</p>
                     <p>And unless it be found that he proceeded warrantably, not only will he be decerned to make forthcoming, though it infer double payment; but he to whom he payed unwarrantably, will be compelled to restore and satisfie the arrester, the subject having been litigious by his arrestment, before the other party recovered the same, albeit he have recovered payment, <hi>bona fide,</hi> without any fault in him, but by the litigiousness of the subject; For payment made <hi>bonafide,</hi> with a preferable Right, relieveth only the payer, who was or might have been compelled to pay, being conscious of no other Right: For it is not relevant for the party obtaining payment, <hi>bona fide;</hi> nor will that ground of Law secure him, <hi>qui suum recipit, licet a non debitore non tenetur re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituere,</hi> which holds only in voluntary payments, <hi>a non debitore,</hi> and where the subject is not litigious.</p>
                     <p>Upon the same ground, albeit the party in whose hands arrestment is made, collude not, but do equally passive, or equally oppose the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors: Yet if the debitor collude and propone Defences against some of the Competitors, and not equally against all, and thereby procure delay, and Terms to prove, if he succumb, though another pursuing in a seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Process, before the same or different Judge, obtain Decreet and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereupon, yet he will be necessitate to refound, if he had not a prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Right.</p>

If the party in whose hands arrestment was made, appear and offer to depone, if the pursuer suffer him to depone generally, that the time of the arrestment he had neither Goods nor Sums belonging to the Debitor in his hands, the arrester will not, <hi>ex intervallo,</hi> obtain him to be more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly interrogate, <hi>ad vitandam frandem &amp; perjurium;</hi> but if before, or at his oath given in general, there be special interrogators offered by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or the Judge, whether at any time in his hands, sums or goods belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the arresters Debitor, and how, and when he satisfied or deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the same, he will be holden as confest, unless he depone particularly that he be not his own Judge, as to the time when he was due, or when he ceassed to be due; For he may pretend or imagine, that the time of the arrestment, he was not debitor, because he had payed to an Assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, whose Assignation was prior to the arrestment, albeit intimation was not prior, though he had promised payment before intimation, yet he could not thereupon have been compelled to pay it, if before payment an arrestment had interveened, because his promise could be but understood
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109710:261"/>
to be according to the parties Right' to whom he promised, which he could not quarrel; but if another did exclude that party, he could not be lyable to double payment, albeit he had given a Bond of Corroborati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unlesse the Assigney had offered to intimate, and he had hindered the same, as unnecessary, and promised payment; for then through his own fraud or fault, he would be lyable to pay both parties; and therefore, the promise of payment was only found relevant to exclude an Arrestment, after the promise, to be proven by the Oath, or Write of the Arrester, and not of the Promiser, or party to whom he promised; yet if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise were not so proven, and thereby the Arrester were preferred; the party promiser, in whose hands the Arrestment was made, was declared free of the promise, unless there had been Transaction, or that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miser had undertaken the hazard, Mr. <hi>James Elphingstoun</hi> contra <hi>George Home</hi> and the Laird of <hi>Steonhope,</hi> December 11. 1674.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. That which Transferreth the Right, is neither the Arrestment, the Citation, nor any thing in Process, but only the Decreet for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forthcoming, which is in the same conditions, as to Subjects, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restable as Appryzings, or Adjudications are to others, which do not import full satisfaction of the Debt, and do not fully liberate the Debitor, but that other diligences may be used for the same debt, unless he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse till the legal expyre; and in the same way after Decreet, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king forthcoming, the Arrester may use other Diligences, but in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with other Creditors using diligence, he may not exclude them and keep up his own diligences, but hath his option thereof.</p>
                     <p>Seeing the Arrestment maketh the Subject Arrested Litigious, it hath the common effect necessarly introduced by Law, <hi>in re Litigiosa,</hi> that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choat diligence cannot be excluded, either by the voluntary deed of the Debitor, or by any legal diligence posterior, unless the user of the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choat diligence become negligent, <hi>Nam vigilantibus, non dormievtibus jura subveniunt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The application of these Grounds will easily clear the preference in the competition of Arrestments with Assignations, or of Arrestments with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restments.</p>
                     <p n="43">43. And as to the Competition betwixt Assignations and Arrestments; an Assignation duely intimate, is a full and compleat Transmission of the Right assigned, if by its nature it be assignable, and thereby the right of the Cedent ceasseth, and the Assigney becomes Creditor, and hath no necessity of any further diligence to compleat the Right: Therefore no posterior Arrestment will be preferred to an Assigney, if the intimation be before the Arrestment, which is accounted, not only by dayes, but by houres: But if the intimation and execution of the Arrestment be both in one day, and express no hour, if the Arrester be not negligent, they will come in, <hi>pari passu,</hi> because no priority doth appear, <hi>Spots.</hi> Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Creditor, Mr. <hi>Cornelius Ainsly</hi> contra <hi>

of debts in competition, but to the anteriority of diligence, as is evident in Appryzings and Adjudications.</p>
                     <p n="44">44. But if the Arrestment be prior to the Intimation, the Arrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is preferable, if it fail not in diligence; and therefore, an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restment was preferred to an Assignation intimate the same day, but two hours thereafter, <hi>January</hi> 30. 1629. <hi>Davidson</hi> contra <hi>Balcanquel:</hi> Yea, an Arrestment upon a dependence, was preferred to a posteriour Assigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though intimate half a year before sentence, upon that dependence, <hi>Hope</hi> Assignation: It must be in the discretion of the Judge to determine, when Arresters fail in diligence.</p>
                     <p n="45">45. And as to Intimations, they are inquestionable, if done by Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or by Charge of Horning, at the instance of the assigney upon the assignation, because the Letters bears, that the assignation was produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Judge, passer of the Bill: and there is little doubt, that assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations attaining effect by Possession, will be in the same case, as if inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate by Instrument: Or if Bond of Corroboration be obtained upon the assignation, or Discharges instructing payment of a part of the debt assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Or if in Process, the Assignation be Judicially produced; but the case is not alike, nor have I observed it decided, if Citation before the Assignation be Judicially produced, will exclude an Arrester, <hi>medio tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore.</hi>

                     <p n="46">46. As to the competition of Arresters, the first Arrestment, not failing in diligence, is preferable; and therefore, the first Arrester was preferred, though prior but by one day, though both obtained Decreet upon the same day, and both used full Diligence, <hi>February</hi> 1. 1666. Collonel <hi>Cuninghame</hi> contra <hi>Layel.</hi> And likewise, an Arrestment by Letters from the Lords of Session, and first Citation thereupon, being insisted in without negligence, was preferred to a posterior Arrestment, though obtaining the first Decreet, before a Sheriff, in respect that Decreets before the Lords, cannot be so summarly obtained, especially, seing they must abide the course of a Roll, <hi>November</hi> 23. 1677.

to him who is the procurer of it; yet even in that case, it was found to accress to the first Right, with absolute warrandice, <hi>June</hi> 21 1671. <hi>John Nielson</hi> contra <hi>Menzies</hi> of <hi>Enoch.</hi> But now to return to what is special in Dispositions.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A Disposition is the transmission, or conveyance of real Rights from the Disponer to his singular Successor, not in contemplation of the Disponers Death, for such are comprehended among successions, from the dead as Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies, Donations, <hi>mortis causa,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>A Disposition is said to be a conveyance, and so it is taken, not for the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positive act of the Will only, but whatsoever else is requisite to compleat the conveyance, as Tradition, Resignation, Possession, though a Disposition is oftimes taken as distinct from these, for the more clear uptaking of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of real Rights; Consider first, what is requifite to transmit them by the Law of Nature, without any positive Law or Custom: and next, what by these is requisite to transmit the several Rights.</p>
                     <p>As to the first, it hath been shown in the Title (<hi>real Rights</hi>) how far Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Property is competent by the Law of rational Nature, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted, but that though there were no positive Law nor Custom, that the rational Creature is naturally instructed how to Dispone and Alienate his own, the power of Disposal being the Characteristick of Dominion, which is natural to man, being created Lord of the Creatures.</p>
                     <p>The question then is, by what act men may naturally exercise the power of Disposal, which can be no act of the Understanding, that being only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative, and nothing active nor operative, for Constituting or Transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Rights, but it must needs be an act of the Will, for by it, Rights are both acquired, Relinquished and alienate: There may be three acts of the Will about the Disposal of Rights, a resolution to Dispone a Paction, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract or Obligation, to Dispone, and a present will or consent, that that which is the Disponers, be the Acquirers. Resolution terminats within the Resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and may be dissolved by a contrary resolution, and so transmits no Right; Paction does only Constitute or transmit a personal Right, or Obligation whereby the person oblieged may be compelled to transmit the real Right It must needs then be the present dispositive will of the Owner, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyeth the right to any other, which is exprest by such words, <hi>de presenti, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> Disponeth, Alienateth, or Annualzeth, Gifteth, Granteth, Selleth, &amp;c. which connot properly import an Obligation, having its effect in the future; though there may be Obligations consequent as to delivery, warrandice, &amp;c. But these Terms do expresse something presently done, and not ingaged to be done, and so can be nothing else but Alienation or Transmission of the Right itself.</p>
                     <p>That the Dispositive will of the owner alone, without any further, is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to alienate his Right, without Delivery or Possession, is evident in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Rights, wherein the Dispositive Clause of Assignations or Translations is sufficient; Intimation or Possession being introduced for expediency in some cases, by our Custom, that the dispositive will is also sufficient to transmit real Rights; it appeareth, because the will alone is sufficient to retain, not only Rights, but even Possession it self, though there be no Corporeal act exercis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein; and therefore, the act of the will alone, as it retaineth, so may it relinquish that Right or Possession, whereby it ceasseth to be the former
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109710:266"/>
Owners; and therefore, if the Will be not simply to Relinquish, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or transmit the Right to any other, <hi>hoc ipso,</hi> that other doth become <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> Dominion being the power of disposal, which is a Faculty, and no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal thing, and may be fitly Constitute in the Acquirer, by the will of the Disponer, unlels the Acquirer reject it, for the Disponer before having the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power of disposal, and remitting that power to the Acquirer, the thing cannot be said to be <hi>nullius,</hi> as being relinquished; and therefore, the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or disposal of it, must either be in the Disponer or the Acquirer; not in the Disponer, because by his will, which is sufficient to Relinquish or quite it, he hath remitted it; and therefore, that power must be in the Purchaser, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he reject it: This is the more evident, that Positive Law and Custom, which requireth Delivery or Possession, resteth in symbolical or imaginary Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, as by delivery ofEarth and Stone, for Land of a Penny for Annualrent, and in some cases requireth no Possession, so the Fisk acquireth real Right without Possession; and the right ofLegacies, and others from the dead, are transmitted without possession.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But for Utilities sake, not only the <hi>Romans,</hi> but almost all Nations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire some kind of Possession, to accomplish real Rights, that thereby the will of the Owner may sensibly touch the thing disponed, and thereby be more manifest and sure, so the Law saith, <hi>Traditionibus &amp; Usucapionibus, non nudis pact is dominia <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> transferuntur,</hi> with which our Custom accordeth.</p>
                     <p>It useth here to be debated, whether Possession it self be sufficient to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish Dispositions; or if there must be Tradition, or delivery of that Possession, by the disponer to the acquirer, the forecited Law seems to require tradition; or at least Usucapion, or Prescription, which doubtless are the most proper ways to accomplish dispositions; yet Utiliter and Equivalenter Possession, lawfully attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by vertue of the Disposition, although not delivered by the Disponer, will be sufficient, as if the disponer were not in Possession himself, and so cannot deliver it, yet the Acquirer may recover it from the detainer, or the acquirer might have been in Possession before, by any other Title, as by Custody, Conduction, &amp;c. In which case, none require delivery; yea, it is more que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable, whether the Possession would not Consumate the disposition, though unlawfully attained, as if the disponer not being in Possession, the acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er attained the Possession from a third party, <hi>vi aut clam,</hi> though he might be oblieged to restore that Possession to the third party; yet whether it would not exclude a posteriour disposition, though more Legal Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; It is a Question as probable in the Affirmative, as in the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
                     <p>It remaineth then that Possession is the accomplishment of the Disposition of real Rights, so that not the first Disposition, but the first Possession, by vertue thereof preferreth. This Possession is not alike in all cases, for in some real, in others symbolical, Possession is requisite, which cannot be supplied by real Possesson it self, as in Propertie of Lands or Annualrents by Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein the disposition and natural Possession makes no real Right without Seasine, <hi>July</hi> 12. 1628. <hi>Bennet</hi> contra <hi>Turnbul.

                     <p>Possession is requisite, not only to the conveyance of the Property of Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Goods, but also of Liferent-rights, Tacks and Rentals, Servitudes, Pledges; which Tacks, though they be truely personal Rights of Location, and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute

only as real Rights by Statute, yet Intimation will not transmit them; but there is necessity of Possession: and though Liferents be more properly real Rights, because Constitute by Infeftment; yet seing a Liferenter cannot Infeft another as a Fiar can, Assignation or Disposition is sufficient, but it must be cled with Possession: But Reversions, though they be accounted as real Rights by Statute, require no Possession for Transmitting them, but an Assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation duely Registrate, according to the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Par.</hi> 1617. is sufficient as a publick Intimation.</p>
                     <p>In Moveables, Possession is of such efficacy, that it doth not only consumate the disposition thereof, but thereupon the disposition is presumed without any necessity to prove the same, which was found sufficient to inctruct the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a Ship from Possession, without vendition in Write, <hi>July</hi> 26. 1623.

                     <p>The most ordinary and important conveyances are of Lands and Annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, which pass by Infeftment, for perfecting whereof, there must not only be a Disposition, but also a Resignation in the hands of the Superiour, and new Infeftment granted by him to the Acquirer thereupon, or by Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or for obedience upon Appryzing or Adjudication: For disposition of Lands to be holden of the granter, do not transmit the granters Right, because he continues Superiour in the direct Dominion, but it becomes an Original Right, constituting a new subaltern Infeftment.</p>
                     <p>Resignation is either in favours of the Superiour himself, for consolidat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Property with the Superiority; and therefore, is called Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>ad perpetuam remanentiam:</hi> Or it is a Resignation in the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours hands, in favours of the Resigner himself, or infavours of an Acquirer; and therefore, is called Resignation, <hi>in favorem.</hi> The first of these is no transmission, but an extinction of the Fee, and hath been spoken to in that Title.</p>
                     <p>The second is not properly a transmission, because it passeth not from, but returneth to the Resigner; yet ordinarly under diverse Considerations, as when he resigns from himself and such heirs, in favours of himself and other heirs, or when he resigns a Ward holding, that it may be returned blench, or few; for the right understanding of Resignations, <hi>in favorem,</hi> consider the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities requisite thereto, and the effect which flow from the several steps thereof.</p>
                     <p>For the first, a Resignation must proceed upon a Disposition, or Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Resignation, having in it the effects of a Disposition, which must be in write, for the Instrument of Resignation being but the assertion of a Nottar, will not be sufficient alone, without an adminicle in write, and though Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <hi>propriis manibus,</hi> can have no Procuratory yet the Disposition whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it proceeds, must be shown.</p>
                     <p>The second step in Resignation, is the Act of Resignation it self, which necessarly must be by way of Instrument of a Nottar, expressing the warrand of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Disposition if it be done by the resigner, <hi>propriis manibus,</hi> or the Procuratory if it be done by a Procurator, and that conform thereto, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signer or Procurator compeared personally before the Superiour or his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109710:267"/>
having special warrand to receive Resignations, and that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation was made in the hands of the Superiour by Staff and Bastoun, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Resigner or his Procurator to the Superiour, as the token or sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of the thing resigned, and that the same was accepted and received by the Superiour, or his Commissioners, by taking the said symbol in their hands, for new Infeftment, to be given to the Acquirer; and though the Resignation useth to be made by the Vassal, or his Procurator on their knees, and so is exprest in the Instrument, either generally or specially with all humility, and that the superiour or his Commissioner, use to deliver the Staff as the symbol of the Fee to the Acquirer, which is also exprest in the Instrument; yet these are not essential, but that without the being or expressing of the Instrument will be valid.</p>
                     <p>The last step of this transmission by Resignation, is the Superiour or his Commissioners, giving new Infeftment to the Acquirer, the nature and requisites of which Infeftment, hath been exprest before in the Title <hi>Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Solemnities of Resignation are so effectual and necessar, that the omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of any of them annulleth the Resignation; and therefore, Renunciation without a formal Resignation, though it may be sufficient against the Renuncer, yet it is not sufficient to take away Infeftment, renunced against singular suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors: Nor can it constitute any real Right in the person of the Acquirer, unless he had, <hi>aliunde,</hi> another right standing in his person, in which case, the Renunciation might exclude the Renuncer, or his Heirs, to quarrel that right, <hi>Hope</hi> alienation, <hi>Hamiltoun</hi> contra <hi>Mcadam:</hi> The reason thereof is, because, <hi>jura eodem modo destituuntur quo constituuntur;</hi> and therefore, as Infeftments cannot be constitute without an Instrument of Seasine, so they cannot be desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute without an Instrument of resignation, or at least another Instrument of seasine, with the superiours Confirmation, or upon his Charter for obedience, so that renunciation being personal, operats nothing, except in the case of Wodsets, which are extinguished by a renunciation registrate by the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> 1617. But even Wodsets cannot be transmitted without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. But where it is said that the resignation must be by the Vassal or his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator, this question ariseth, if the Assignation be made by him who is not truely Vassal, but with consent of the true Vassal, <hi>quid juris, Craig, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>dieg.</hi> 1. shows, that in his time this question was not clearly determined, nor is he positive in it, but this far, if the resigner had no Title, no consent could be sufficient: yet if he had a colourable Title, the consent of the true Vassal might validate it: If the true Vassal be consenter to the Procuratory of resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, either expresly bearing, that the disponer, with consent, &amp;c. consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute his Procurators: Or if he be consenter to the disposition, by being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest in the entry thereof, which is holden as extensive to the whole dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so as repeated in the same, will be as valide, as if the consenter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had granted the disposition, or Procuratory for the Act of the disponer, though more express and amplified, is no more but his consent, and so the other consenting, doth the same materially, which he would do if he were disponer, formally, but if his consent be adhibite after the resignation is made, it is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly personal, and cannot have influence on the resignation, which was before it; or if he but permit or give license to the disponer, or which is alike, if he consent, that the disponer dispone in so far as may concern the disponers
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:109710:268"/>
right, these will not be sufficient warrand for the resignation, but if he give warrand or consent to the resignation, it is sufficient; neither is there neces sity to distinguish, whether the disponer have a colourable Title or not, se ing it is the consent of the true Vassal and the resignation as flowing from, and warranted by that consent, which transmitteth the right; and therefore, an Infeftment of an annualrent, granted by a person not Infeft, was found valide, because a consenter thereto was Infeft, and so it did exclude a valide right flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that consenter to a singular successor thereafter, <hi>viz.</hi> a Tack, <hi>Decem.</hi> 15. 1630. <hi>Jean Stirling</hi> contra Tennents.</p>

                     <p n="11">11. As to the effect of resignation, there is no doubt, but when the same is truely made, and Infeftment follows conform, the resigner is fully divested, and the acquirer is fully invested, and if there be conditions or provisiions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bearing express clauses irritant, that the acquirers Infeftment shall be null, and the disponers Infeftment shall revive, or he have regress, how far these are effectual, till by resignation or judicial process, the same be recovered, is more fully cleared before, <hi>Title Infeftments.</hi>

                     <p>It is no less evident, that before resignation be made the disposition or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatory, operats nothing as to the real right, which notwithstanding remains fully in the disponer, though he be personally oblieged to perfect it, albeit there be no such express obliegement in the disposition; yet by the nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the disponer is oblieged to Infeft himself, if he be not Infeft, and to Infeft the acquirer, <hi>Hope</hi> alienations, <hi>William Gladstanes</hi> contra Laird of <hi>Mckerstoun:</hi> Yea, the disposition of property being accomplished, carrysall real right of the Land, or Bonds for granting real right, in favour of the disponer, or his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, neither assigned nor mentioned in the disposition, <hi>July</hi> 1. 1623. <hi>Craigy Wallace</hi> contra <hi>John Chalmers.</hi> Yea, a liferent carryeth the reversion in the disponers person, as to the Liferenters Liferent use, that ther eupon he might redeem a Wodset: So likeways a disposition of Lands immediatly before a Term, not expressing an Entry, nor Assignation to the rent, was found to exclude the disponer therefrom, though Infeftment followed not, till after the Term, <hi>Spots.</hi> Mails and Duties, <hi>Andrew Caldwal</hi> contra <hi>Robert Stark.</hi> And generally, it carrys Mails and Duties, as including virtually an Assignation thereto, <hi>July</hi> 15. 1629. <hi>Inter eosdem:</hi> And though the Disposition, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatory, cannot constitute a real right, yet it doth sufficiently exclude the Disponer or his Heirs, from troubling the Acquirers Possession there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The Main question then is, what is the effect of a resignation, when done and accepted by the Superiour, and no Infeftment following thereon, where, in that case, the right standeth, whether in the Disponer, Acquirer, or Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, and whether the resigner be fully thereby denuded, or if he may not grant a second resignation, whereupon the first Infeftment being recovered, will be effectual: This is very learnedly debated by <hi>Craig</hi> in the forementioned place, where he sheweth, that the common opinion was, that the second re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation,

                     <p>Before this Statute in the year 1469. there is no mention in our Law or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, of Appryzing or Adjudication: But Appryzing was thereby intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced

in this manner, that where the debitor has not Moveable Goods but Lands, the Sheriff shall cause sell the Lands to the avail of the debt, and pay the Creditor, which shall be redeemable by the debitor within seven years, and if he cannot find a buyer, he shall appryze the debitors Lands by thirteen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the best and worthiest in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

According to this Act, Appryzings did proceed by Sheriffs and Baihes, who for satisfying of debts, Liquidat by Decreets, issued Precepts for denunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such Lands to be appryzed upon fifteen days warning, conform to the act of Parliament, which denunciation was publickly read upon the ground of the Land, before witnesses, and a Copy thereof left fixed thereupon, and also at the Mercat Cross of the head Burgh of the Jurisdiction, where the Lands ly, and to the debitor whose Lands were to be appryzed, expressing the Creditor, sum, day and place of appryzing, that all parties interested might appear, persons of Inquest and Witnesses were also summond to the same dyet; and ordinarly the place was upon the ground of the Lands, that the value and worth thereof might the more clearly appear, where, after discussing of the Appryzers Claim, the hability of the persons of Inquest, and Witnesses, so much Land was appryzed and adjudged as was worth the sum, the years Rent to the Superiour, and expenses of Infeftments; and if the Lands were burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any former annualrents, whereby a proportion of Land could not be appryzed, free of burden; there was appryzed an annualrent forth of the Lands, effeirand to the sums, and expenses foresaid, and redeemable in the same manner; which was sustained by the meaning and intent of the Statute, though by the words of it, appryzing of Lands was only mentioned, it was ever extended to all Heretable Rights; thus it continued till the Lords of Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, upon exceptions against the Sheriff, upon his interest, relation, or eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or upon the lying of Lands in diverse Jurisdictions, for preventing of expenses by many appryzings, where the Lands in one Jurisdiction sufficed not, did grant Letters of appryzing under the signet, direct not to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar Sheriffs, but to sherifts in that part, which being frequent, did come to run in course to Messengers, as sheriffs in that part, &amp;c. And thereby the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzer, in respect the Letters had a blank for inserting the Messengers name, did choise the Messenger, who did denunce all Lands and other Heretable Rights, which the appryzer pretended to belong to his debitor: And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the Letters bore dispensation of the place, did apprize, at <hi>Edinhurgh,</hi> all that the appryzer clamed, in satisfaction of the debt, without knowledge or consideration of the value of the Lands, or others appryzed, or proportion to the sums appryzed for, and thereupon was Infeft in the whole, and payed to the superiour a composition for a years Rent of the whole, which was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable accession to the Debitors debt, and behoved to be payed by him, and by the saids appryzings, the appryzer might, and oftentimes did enter in possession of the whole Lands, without being countable for the rents thereof, of what quantity soever: By this abuse, the intent of that excellent statute for appryzings, was enervat, and the same turned in a meer Formality, until the <hi>Par.</hi> 1621. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. which began to correct that exorbitant abuse, and declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed appryzers countable for their intromissions, in so far as exceeded their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nualrents, to be imputed in their principal sums, <hi>pro tanto,</hi> and that they being thereby satisfied of their sums, principal and annual, composition to the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and expenses of appryzing and infeftments, that thereby the appryzing should expyre, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> and it is also declared, that if the Lands appryzed

be not worth of free rent, effeirand to the annualrent of the said sums, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore redemption he shall be satisfied of the superplus. By which Act it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that Minors may redeem Lands appryzed from them at any time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their age of twenty five years compleat, yet so, that after the first seven year, the appryzer shall have the benefit of the whole Mails and Duties till he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, which hath always been extended to Lands appryzed from persons being Major, if a Minor succeed, during the Legal; and if a person being Major succeed to him who was Minor, he hath the benefit of Reversion of seven year, in so far as was not run in the Minors life, and if less remain then a year, at the Minors death, the Major hath a full year to redeem after the Minors death; and by the Act 1669. of the abrogat Parliament, 1641. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzers were declared countable for the rents of appryzed Lands intrometted with by them, during all the time of the Legal, whether competent to Minors or others.</p>
                     <p>And because of another great abuse, by the debording of Appryzings from the first institution. that the first appryzer, appryzing the whole Estate, the other Creditors had no more but the Legal Reversion, which did ordinarly expyre, the subsequent Creditors not being able to raise money to redeem the anterior appryzer, whereby the first appryzer carried the whole Estate, and excluded all the rest, and being ashamed to take so great a Legal advantage, and sometimes not daring to make use of it, did ordinarly compone with the debitor, his appearand heir, or some confident to their behove, whereby the debitors heir recovered his whole Estate, by satisfying one Creditor, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all the rest; therefore the <hi>Par.</hi> 1661. by their <hi>Act</hi> 62. anent debitor and creditor, declared that all appryzings deduced since the first of <hi>January</hi> 1652. or to be deduced in time coming, within a year after the first appryz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which became effectual by infeftment or Charge, should come in <hi>pari passu,</hi> as if one appryzing had been led for all the sums, and thereby the legal was extended to ten year; and it is declared, that whensoever the appearand heir or any to his behove, shall acquire right to any expyred appryzing, that the same shall be redeemed from them within the space of ten year, after their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, by posterior appryzers, upon payment of what they truly payed, in so far as shall not be satisfied by their intromission.</p>
                     <p>But neither did this statute cure the abuse of appryzings; and therefore the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Par.</hi> of the 6. of <hi>septem.</hi> 1672. upon consideration of debording of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzings from the first design, and of the great inconveniencies arising there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by for the bringing in of all appryzers within year and day, did give way to break the credit and ruine the interest of the most considerable Heretors in the Kingdom, that creditors being thereby invited, under the hazard of being excluded to appryze within a year; and thereby one wilful, malicious, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitous Creditor apprizing, all the rest followed, and intirely brook their credit, unless they would pay all their debt in one day; therefore, the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, did in place of Appryzings, ordain adjudications, to proceed before the Lords of Session, for adjudging the Lands and other Heretable Rights of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitors, effeirand to the sums appryzed for, and a fifth part more in place of the penaltiies and sheriff-fee, and allowed Witnesses for either party, for clearing of the Rental and rate of the Lands, in the several places where they ly, and appointed the adjudger to have present Possession of the Lands adjudged, not being accountable for his intromission during the Legal, redeemable only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in five year, whereby the Creditor had easie accress for his satisfaction, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all hazard or account, which had been the ground of many tedious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:109710:271"/>
of Count and Reckoning for the Intromission of former Appryzers, and wherein the Adjudgers is to have the Consent of his debitor, both as to Right and Possession, and delivery of the Evidents; and it is declared, that if the debitor do not instruct, and deliver a good Right, and consent, as said is, that the creditor might adjudge all the debitors Estate in the same manner, and to the same effect, as is appointed by the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Par.</hi> 1661. between debitor and creditor.</p>
                     <p>We shall not here speak of Adjudications and Appryzings, as they are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Executions, and of the Order and Solemnities requisite to them, as such; but only as they are Conveyances of real Rights, wherein we shall consider; first, upon what ground Appryzings proceed. Secondly, against what Rights they are competent. Thirdly, what is the effect of the Process, or Decreet of Appryzing, without further Diligence. Fourthly, what is the effect thereof, when further Diligence is used. Fifthly, what is the effect thereof when In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment is obtained. And lastly, in what manner it ceaseth and becometh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. As to the first, Appryzing is an Appretiation and Judicial Vendition of the thing appryzed, from the Debitor to the Creditor; and as in all Venditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there must be <hi>merx</hi> and <hi>pretium,</hi> or the price in numerat Money; for if the mutual consist in any thing else, it is not Sale but Exchange; therefore the ground of Appryzing must be numerate and current Money, and if originally it be not so, it must be liquidat before Appryzing can proceed; neither can it proceed but upon a Decreet establishing the Debt by Registration, or otherways in the person of the Appryzer active, and of the Debitor Passive; yet an Assigney intimating before the Cedents death, may Appryze summar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without Action, establishing the Debt in his person, as hath been shown, <hi>Title Assignations.</hi> Neither could Appryzing proceed upon Heretable Bonds, unless the same had been made moveable, by Requisition or Charge; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was found null, proceeding upon an Heretable Sum, bearing a Clause of Annualrent, though payable without requisition upon a single Charge of six days, seing that Charge was not given <hi>July</hi> 20. 1622. <hi>John Cranstoun</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Laird of <hi>East-nisbit. Hope</hi> Obligations, <hi>Alexander Mowat</hi> contra the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors of <hi>John Richardson. John Cranstoun</hi> contra Laird of <hi>Lugtoun.</hi> But Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterior Decisions have run in the contrair, that if the sum were payable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Requisition, Appryzing might proceed thereupon without a Charge, as well as Poynding or Arrestment, <hi>July</hi> 4. 1627. <hi>Edgar</hi> and <hi>Johnstoun</hi> contra <hi>Findlason. July</hi> 10. 1629. <hi>Clackmannan</hi> contra <hi>Barroun.</hi> In which case, the principal sum was payable at a precise Term, and no mention of any Term or time thereafter, and yet was Appryzed for, after that Term, <hi>January</hi> 25. 1642. <hi>John Seatoun</hi> contra <hi>James Loch.</hi> But if Infeftment have followed, or Requisition be requisite, the sum must be made moveable, before Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzing: But other Sums, though by Destination Heretable, yet hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Summar Execution by the parties consent, Appryzing is sustained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. As to the second point against what Rights Appryzings extend; First, though Letters of Appryzings contain power to poynd Moveables, which must be searched for; yet that which is properly called Appryzing, extends to no Moveables, but only to Heretable Rights, as Lands, Annualrents, Liferents, Tacks, Reversions, Heretable Bonds, <hi>July</hi> 25. 1623. Earl of <hi>Errel</hi> contra <hi>Buckie;</hi> and therefore, it extends not to the Mails and Duties of the Appryzed Lands, before the Appryzing, <hi>Feb.</hi> 14. 1623. <hi>Saltcoats</hi> contra <hi>Home.</hi> The like, though
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:109710:272"/>
the question was against the Debitor himself, and that the style of the Appyz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bore, all Right that the Debitor had to the Lands to be Appryzed, <hi>March</hi> 13. 1627. <hi>Mackre</hi> of <hi>Balmagie</hi> contra <hi>Livingstoun.</hi> And where an Annualrent is Appryzed, it extends not to the bygone Annualrents, which are Moveable; but these being Moveable, are Arrestable, neither doth it extend to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties after Denunciation, and before Appryzing, <hi>Feb.</hi> 16. 1633. <hi>Harper</hi> contra <hi>Cockburn</hi> and <hi>Johnstoun.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Appryzing is extended to all Heretable Rights, though they were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to Assigneys, but to the Debitor and his Heirs only, or failing, such Heirs to return; and therefore, publick utility and the favour of the Creditor makes it more effectual then any voluntar Disposition or Assignation could be, so an Appryzing was found to carry a Right, though not granted to Assigneys, <hi>Hope</hi> Appryzing, <hi>John Brown</hi> contra <hi>Fssilmont</hi> of <hi>Buckie.</hi> And a Husband grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Right to his Wife, but with provision that she should renounce it, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it in his own life allennerly, a Creditor of his Appryzing that Land, and requiring the Wife to renunce, was found to have right thereto, <hi>spots.</hi> Appryzing, Lady <hi>Huttonhal</hi> contra <hi>Cranstoun</hi> of <hi>Moristoun.</hi> An Appryzing of the ground Right and Property of Lands, and all other Rights, &amp;c. car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth not only the Property, but all other real Right, or Obliegements for granting thereof, and though no Infeftment follow, the Appryzing so conceived will carry any Right, which requireth not Infeftment, as if it had been specially Denunced and Appryzed, <hi>June</hi> 19. 1635. <hi>James Rule</hi> contra <hi>Alexander Home.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="16">16. To come now to the third Point concerning the Efficacy of the Process and Decreet of Appryzing, without further Diligence; and first, it hath the effect of an Assignation, without necessity of Intimation, and carries all Rights which require not Infeftments to transmit them, as Liferents, Reversions, Tacks And so an Appryzing was found to carry the Legal of an anterior Appryzing, though the Denunciation, whereupon it proceeded, was anterior to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation whereupon the first Appryzing proceeded, and thereby at the time of the Denunciation of the second Appryzing, neither was the first Appryz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in being neither the Denunciation thereof, and so could not be Denunced or Appryzed; yet the Denunciation of the Ground-right, and all Right com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent, or that might be competent to the Debitor, was found to carry the Reversion of the said first Appryzing, <hi>Novem.</hi> 18. 1624. Doctor <hi>Kincaid</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra <hi>James Halyburtoun.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="17">17. Though second Appryzings carry the legal Reversions of anterior Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzings without Infeftment: Yet Infeftment is frequently taken thereupon, that the posterior Appryzer may have Interest thereby, to reduce or quarrel the Anterior Appryzings, and to pursue for Mails and Duties, or Removing, if the Anterior appryzer should forbear.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. The second effect of Appryzing is, that the Debitor is thereby so far divested, that after his death, Infeftment may be taken by the Appryzer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out transfering or Infefting the Debitors Heir, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 20. 1624. <hi>Lag</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra his Tennents. So likewise the heir of the Appryzer dying before allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or Infeftment upon Supplication obtained allowance from the Lords, and Letters to Charge the Superiour to receive him, <hi>Spots. hic, Alexander Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer</hi> Supplicant. The like was granted by the Appryzers Assigney, <hi>March</hi> 22. 1626. <hi>Collace</hi> contra Lord <hi>Elphingstoun.</hi> Yea, an appryzer did obtain allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:109710:272"/>
and varrand to Charge the heir of the Superiour, contained in the first allowance, being dead, <hi>Decem.</hi> 5. 1628. Laird of <hi>Corsbie</hi> contra <hi>Kilsyth.</hi> From this ground it is, that an Appryzing excludes prior assignations, granted by the Debitor, to the Mails and Duties of the Lands appryzed, as to Terms after the appryzing, <hi>Hope</hi> assignations, <hi>George Meldrum</hi> contra Laird of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struther.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="19">19. And when an appryzing was led before an Husbands death, it exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Wife from a Terce, <hi>Hope</hi> appryzings, <hi>James Chrightoun</hi> contra Relict of <hi>John Cranstoun:</hi> Where he doth also observe it to exclude a subsequent Ward, in respect the Superiour gave a Charter upon the appryzing, in his Vassals life, though no Seasine followed thereupon, <hi>Ibidem, George Hamiltoun</hi> contra Tennents of <hi>Newburgh.</hi> And albeit <hi>Dury</hi> observes, that in the case betwixt the Lord <hi>Fleming</hi> and the Lord <hi>Balmerino,</hi> dispute the 7. of <hi>March</hi> 1633. it was not decided, but superceeded in hopes of agreement, whether a Superiour could be compelled to receive the Minor himself till his Majority, it seems the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ought to receive the appryzer upon his legal diligence, but prejudice of the Ward, during the Minority of his former Vassal, though he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Minor, yet he would be necessitate to receive the appryzer, and his heirs whatsomever, though the Lands were Tailzied, and to return to the Superiour himself.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. The third effect of appryzing is, that being a legal diligence, it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the thing appryzed litigious, not only from the date of the appryzing, but from the date of the Denunciation: So that no voluntary deed of the Debitor, after the Denunciation can prejudge the appryzer, if he be not <hi>in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi> Thus a Tack set by the debitor after Denunciation, was found null, <hi>Spots.</hi> appryzing, <hi>Peter Blackburn</hi> contra <hi>Walter Balvaird.</hi> Yet where the appryz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was negligent, and obtained not Infeftment, nor did diligence; therefore, for some years, a Tack set by a Debitor before the appryzing, but having its Entry after the appryzing, was preferred thereto, <hi>July</hi> 11. 27. <hi>Wallace</hi> contra <hi>Harvie.</hi> Yea, no Infeftment or diligence being used upon an appryzing, for many years, an arrestment thereafter was preferred to the Mails and Duties of the Landsappryzed, <hi>Feb.</hi> 14. 1623. <hi>Saltcoats</hi> contra <hi>Brown.</hi> But Custom since hath always preferred appryzings to arrestments, although there were no Infeftment or diligence upon the appryzing, because it is a legal assignation, and needs no Intimation, unless the appryzer had relinquished his right; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though that case of <hi>Saltcoats</hi> was adduced, an appryzer of an annualrent, was preferred to an arrestment, though the appryzer neither was infeft nor used diligence, for nine years before the arrestment, <hi>Feb.</hi> 23. 1671. Lord Justice Clerk contra Mr. <hi>John Fairholm.</hi> It is said, no voluntary disposition deed of the debitor after the denunciation, will prejudge the appryzing, because if the deed done thereafter be necessary, and that thereunto the debitor was specially oblieged before, and might have been directly compelled; such, even after denunciation may be preferred, as an annualrent proceeding upon a Bond, prior to the denunciation, containing an obliegemement to Infeft, in that annualrent, the Infeftment thereupon, though after denunciation was preferred, <hi>Hope</hi> appryzing, <hi>Samuel Henderson</hi> contra <hi>John Mcadam.</hi> The like of an Infeftment, whereof the Charter was before denunciation, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But now of a long time, Charges against Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours for Infefting appryzers, <hi>salvo jure ejuslibet &amp; suo,</hi> have been still sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because it is unusual and difficult for the appryzer to get his debitors Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, unless it were the Extract of his Seasine, and the Superiours receiving him upon obedience, cannot prejudge him; and therefore, the Superiour was ordained to receive the appryzer, though himself was in possession, by vertue of a Right, <hi>March</hi> 5. 1634. <hi>Black</hi> contra <hi>Pitmedden.</hi> The like, whatever Right the Superiour might pretend, <hi>March</hi> 11. 2636. <hi>Margaret Scot</hi> contra <hi>Gilbert Eliot.</hi>

Duties, his pursuit was only sustained, for so much of the appryzed Land as she should choose, the rent whereof would be equivalent to eight <hi>per cent.</hi> of the sums appryzed for, he being countable for the superplus, more then his annualrent and publick burdens, the defenders House and Mains being always excepted, seing there was sufficient of other Rents, <hi>June</hi> 27. 1672. <hi>Nicolson</hi> contra Sir <hi>William Murray.</hi> But the power granted to the Lords to restrict appryzers, is only personal and peculiar to the debitor, and not to the poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior appryzers, <hi>July</hi> 28. 1671. <hi>Murray</hi> contra Earl of <hi>Southesk</hi> and others. Secondly, All appryzings led since the first of <hi>January</hi> 1652. before the first effectual Compryzing, obtaining Infeftment, or charging the Superiour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or within a year after the same, or to be led thereafter upon any perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal debts, come in <hi>pari passu,</hi> as if they all had been contained in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzing, the other appryzers paying to the first effectual Compryzer, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses of his compryzing, and Infeftment thereupon, but the year is not to counted from the Infeftment or Charge, by which the appryzing becomes ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, but from the date of the Decreet of appryzing, <hi>July</hi> 4. 1671. Laird of <hi>Balfour</hi> contra Mr. <hi>William Dowglas.</hi> But this extends not to appryzings or annualrents, or other <hi>debita fundi;</hi> and accordingly it was decided by the Lords, that those other appryzers behoved to pay the whole composition to the Superiour, <hi>Feb.</hi> 5. 1663. <hi>Robert Graham</hi> contra <hi>John Ross.</hi> Yet these ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzings that were prior to the Act, were not found to come in <hi>pari passu,</hi> from the dates of the appryzings, albeit the Act bear, that they should come in as if they were in one appryzing, but only from the date of the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi> And as to what the first appryzer had possessed, <hi>bona fide,</hi> before the act of his intromission, exceeded his annualrent, the same should be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the expenses of the compryzings and composition, and in payment of the sums appryzed for, <hi>pro tanto, Jan.</hi> 7. 1665. <hi>Graham</hi> of <hi>Blaitwood</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra <hi>Browns.</hi>

                     <p n="44">44. Adjudication is <hi>remedium extraordinarium,</hi> introduced by Custom, where apprysing could have no place, as when the debt to be satisfied is not a liquidat sum or goods ordinarly liquidable, but is a disposition of Lands, containing expresly or virtually, an Obligation to Infeft the acquirer, or some other: Or an Obligation consisting in some fact to be performed: Or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, where the debitors heir renunces to be heir, whereby there is no Party from whom the Lands can be apprysed; therefore, <hi>Haereditas Jacens</hi> is adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This remeid is introduced by the Lords, who having ample power to administrate Justice in all cases, and to make orders for that effect, do supplie the defect of the Law, or ancient Customs, by such new remeids, as such new occurring cases do require, amongst which adjudication is a prime one, which <hi>Craig</hi> testifieth to have been unknown to our Predicessours, and being but recent in his time, and few decisions thereupon, the nature and effect of it was little known, but is now by course of time further illustrate.</p>
                     <p>Adjudication hath place in two cases; the first and most ordinary is, when the heir recounces to be heir, in which case adjudication is competent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the debt to be satisfied be liquidate or not. The other is, when the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liegement to be satisfied consisteth <hi>in facto,</hi> and relateth to the Disposition of particular things; which Disposition or Obliegement, not being fulfilled by the debitor or disponer, though all ordinary diligence be done, then adjudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation taketh place to make the same effectual.</p>
                     <p>As to the first case, adjudication upon the appearand Heirs renuncing to be heir, proceedeth upon these ways, if he be pursued as lawfully Charged to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heir, for satisfying of his Predicessors debt or obliegement, he may renunce
<pb facs="tcp:109710:278"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:109710:279"/>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:109710:279"/>
to be heir (if he have not meddled) either in the Process against him, as Charged to enter heir in the first instance, or some time thereafter, by Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or Reduction, if he renunce in the first instance, when the debt is not yet instructed and established, as when it proceeds not upon a clear Bond or Write, but abides Probation by Witnesses, or otherways then before the Process of adjudication, there must be a Process and Sentence against the heir renunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>cognitionis causa,</hi> for establishing and proving the debt; in which, because there is necessity in all Processes, to have a defender, the appearand heir re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuncing, is only called to supply that place, <hi>cognitionis causa,</hi> but without any effect against him, but only <hi>contra haereditatem jacentem.</hi> But if the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and heir renunce in the second instance, after Decreet obtained against him; Or in the first instance, when the Ground and Title of the Pursuite instructs the debt, then there needs no other decreet, <hi>cognitionis causa;</hi> but the Pursuer Protesting for adjudication, the same will be admitted sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marly.</p>
                     <p>Adjudication it self is a most simple and summar Process, whereby the heir renuncing, and the debt being established, as said is, the whole heretage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunced, orbenefite, whereto the heir might succeed, is adjudged by the Lords to the pursuer for satisfaction of the Defuncts obliegement, wherein the heir re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuncing is again called to sustain the part of a defender, which is only for forms sake, for he can propone nothing, and one single summonds is sufficient with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out continuation; because it is accessory to a prior Decreet, as <hi>Dury</hi> observes, but expresseth not the Parties, <hi>Feb.</hi> 26. 1629. And all is adjudged, <hi>periculo potentis,</hi> whatsoever the Pursuer pleaseth to Lybel, alledging that it might have belonged to the heir entring: Yea, though any Party having Interest, should compear and instruct that he hath the only Right, and the Defunct was fully denuded; it would be incompetent, <hi>hoc loco, Spots.</hi> adjudication, <hi>Cairncorss</hi> contra Laird of <hi>Drumlanrig.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="46">46. The reason is, because the Adjudication is but <hi>periculo petentis,</hi> and can give no Right, unless the Defuncts Right, competent to the heir renuncing be instructed. Neither can the adjudger, who is a stranger to the debitors right be put to dispute the same, in obtaining the adjudication; yet the Lords admitted a singular successor to propone upon his Infeftment, that the Defunct was denuded and adjudged, not the Property, but all Right of Reversion, or other Right competent to the appearand heir, <hi>July</hi> 22. 1669. <hi>Alexander Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingstoun</hi> and <hi>Sornbeg</hi> contra heirs of Line of the Lord <hi>Forrester.</hi> In this case the matter was notour to many of the Lords, that the Lord <hi>Forrester</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Sons, did contract his Estate with one of his Daughters, to Leiutenent General <hi>Baities</hi> Son, who was thereupon publickly Infeft. But the reason why appryzings and adjudications have past so much at Random is, because the appryzings have deboarded from their ancient form, by an Inquest, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lands, which therefore would never have appryzed Lands, but where the debitor was commonly repute Heretor, or Heretable Possessor: But when appryzings came to be deduced by Sheriffs in that part, constitute by the Lords by Dispensation at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where persons were made the Inquest, who knew nothing of the Lands, then all became to be appryzed which was claimed, and though the appryzer would not pay a years Rent for entering him in Lands, where he had no probability of Right in his debitor; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est inconvenience was as to the Lands holden of the King, it was little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Expences, to passe one Infeftment for all; and other Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:109710:280"/>
getting a years Rent, <hi>salvo jure,</hi> they were not suffered to Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert.</p>
                     <p>But now Adjudications being in place of Apppryzings, and passing upon Citation before the Lords, it is not like they will adjudge Lands where the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitors are not, at least repute heretable Possessors or Liferenters; for now the Lords are in place of the Inquest: And albeit as they suffer Decreets in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, to pass <hi>periculo petentis;</hi> so they will suffer Adjudication to pass of all that is Lybelled; but if any other shall appear, and make it appear that they and their Predicessors have been holden and repute Heretable Possessors, and that there was no Right repute to be in the Debitor, the Lords might readily superceed to adjudge, till some evidence were given of the Interest of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitor, Seasines having been now Registrat, since the year 1617. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Reversions, though <hi>adjudicationes,</hi> of these might more easily pass then, because no Infeftment would follow: But where Lands are adjudged, and Infeftments follow, there arises thence grounds of pleas and pursuits, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for Reduction and Improbation, upon which all the Heretors of the Lands contained in the Infeftments, would be oblieged to produce their Rights, and open their Charter Chests, to parties having no pretence to their Estates. The adjudication was sustained of all Lands generally, without condescendence, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 14. 1638. <hi>Corser</hi> contra <hi>Dury.</hi> But where the Defender appeared not, or contraverted it not in the adjudication, Process for Mails and Duties of the Lands adjudged, was sustained in the same Libel, <hi>Ibidem.</hi> And in adjudication of a Reversion, the Declarator for redeeming the same, was sustained in the same Lybel, <hi>July</hi> 8. 1629. <hi>Dury</hi> contra <hi>Kinross.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="47">47. In adjudication all is competent to be adjudged, Which should have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen the heir entering, as Lands, Annualrents, Reversions, Tacks, Liferents, and all Heretable Bonds; yea, not only these Rights themselves, but the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone Rents and Duties thereof, preceeding the adjudication, and after the Defuncts death, may be adjudged and pursued against the Possessors and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trometters in that same Process, because these are competent to the Heir re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuncing, and there is no other way to attain them, as in the case of appryz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which are not extended to bygones, seing these may be arrested, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued as Moveables belonging to the Debitor, as was found in the said case, <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser</hi> contra <hi>Dury.

                     <p n="49">49. <hi>Craig</hi> observeth, that it was doubtful in his time, whether there were a Legal Reversion competent to any renuncing, and afterward returning to Redeem Adjudications or Appryzings, wherein he favoureth the affirmative, but the said Statute, <hi>Par.</hi> 1621. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. determineth the case, and granteth a legal Reversion, in favours of these who have posterior Adjudications, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the space of seven years, or ten years since the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Par.</hi> 1661 betwixt Debitor and Creditor, which is also competent to any Renuncing in their Minority, and being restored against the said Renunciation; but it is not competent to any other Heir renuncing; yet if the Heir, though Major, find that he hath prejudged himself, by renuncing a profitable Heritage, he may grant a Bond, and thereupon cause within the legal, adjudge and redeem the former Adjudications, which, though to his own behove, will be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, there being so much equity and favour upon his part, being willing to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the whole debts.</p>
                     <p n="50">50. It is clear by the said Statute, the Lands or Heretage of a Defunct may be Adjudged, the heirs renuncing, not only for satisfaction of the Defuncts debt, but of the heirs own proper debt.</p>
                     <p n="51">51. Adjudications are taken off and extinguished in the same manner as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzings are, by intrometting with the Mails and Duties of the Lands adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as is clear from the said Statute. And though cases be not so frequent in Adjudications, as in appryzings; to clear the other ways of their extinction: Yet the reason being the same in both, there is no doubt but the determination will also be the same.</p>
                     <p n="52">52. The other manner of Adjudications, is for making effectual Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or obliegements to Infeft, whereupon, when the acquirer hath used all diligence competent in Law, against the disponer to fulfil the same, by obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:109710:281"/>
Decreets and Horning Registrat thereupon, either against the Disponer or his Heir, Law being there defective, and cannot make the Disposition or Obliegement effectual; the Lords have allowed Adjudications of the Lands disponed, whether in Fee or Liferent, <hi>July</hi> 19. 1611.

                     <p>And thereupon the Superiour will be discerned to receive the Adjudger, as was found in the case of an Obliegement to Infeft a Woman in Liferent, holden of the Superiour, wherein she having used Horning, the Superiour was decerned to receive her, <hi>July</hi> 10. 1628. <hi>Harris</hi> and <hi>Cunningham</hi> contra <hi>Lindsay.

                     <p>These Adjudications do not come in <hi>pari passu,</hi> with other Adjudications within the year, nor any other with them, <hi>July</hi> 16. 1675. <hi>Campbel</hi> of <hi>Riddoch</hi> contra <hi>Stuart</hi> of <hi>Ardvorlick.

                     <p n="53">53. By the late <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Pavliament,</hi> anent adjudications, there are introduced two new forms of Adjudications; the one special of Lands effeirand to the sum, and a fifth part more, in case the debitor produce his Rights, and put the adjudger in his Possession, of his particular Lands adjudged: But if he do not, adjudications are to proceed as appryzings did generally of all the debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Lands, or real rights, <hi>periculo petentis,</hi> redeemable within ten years: These Adjudications are come in place of appryzings, especially the general adjudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, which are declared to be in the same condition in all points as appryz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were by the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Par.</hi> 1661. <hi>cap.</hi> 62. Except as to the lengthening of a Reversion from seven to ten years: So that what hath been said of Appryz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, will have the same effect as to general Adjudications; but special Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications being equitable and favourable, will not meet with such strictness: This Statute hath taken away the greatest Reproach upon our Law, which for every debt indefinitely appryzed every Estate great or smal, which had no excuse, but that the debitor might redeem in seven years: But all debitors being necessitat to appryze within a year, or to have no more then the legal Reversion, paying the whole debts, the power of Redemption came to be of little effect, few being able to pay all their debt in one day: But now if any debitor complain, that his whole Estate is adjudged, and no proportion keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed betwixt the debt and his Estate, it is altogether his own fault, seing he might offer a proportional part, and liberat all the rest of his Estate; which part is Redeemable also in five years: And though a fifth part be added, it is no more then the ordinary penalty, being an 100. Pounds for a 1000, Merks, and 50. Merks for the Sheriff-fee; makes 200. Merks, being the fifth part of a 1000. Merks, and which was sustained in the most favourable cases of Appryzings from the beginning, and the Reversion was for seven years.</p>

                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:109710:281"/>Adjudications being executive Decreet, the Lords allow them the greatest dispatch; and to prevent Collusion, whereby some debitors might be post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned by debate and probation till the year pass, which would excludethem; Therefore the Lords do not suffer Co-creditors to stop Adjudications, that they might see for their entress, and put the pursuer to abide the course of the Roll, unless they produce an Entress, upon which the Ordinar will hear them immediatly without going to the Roll, <hi>Jan. 22. 1681.</hi> Earl of <hi>Dundonald</hi> contra <hi>Dunlop</hi> and his Creditors. Neither is the Superiour suffered to propone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, <hi>Jan.</hi> 13. 1675. <hi>Kinloch</hi> of <hi>Gourdie</hi> contra Mr. <hi>James Blair</hi> and <hi>James Strachan.</hi> Yea, the Lords sustained the establishment of the debt in the same Lybel with the Adjudication, <hi>July</hi> 26. 1676. <hi>Alexander Boyd</hi> contra <hi>Boyd</hi> of <hi>Pinkill.</hi> But if the debitor himself appear, the Cause goes to the Roll; and if there be prior adjudgers, defences proponed against the debt, or adjudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are not like to be verified within a year of the first adjudication; the Lords adjudge and reserve these defences <hi>contra executionem,</hi> by Suspensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; In which terms will be granted, because of the reservation; but there is this advantage, that how long soever the Suspension be of expeding, the first decreet being within the year, brings the adjudger in <hi>pari passu.</hi>

                     <p>THE Conveyance and Transmission of all kinds of Rights from private parties to the Fisk, are here comprehended under one common Term and Title of Confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: It is not proper in this place to treat of the Fisk, or priviledges thereof, or upon the several Causes, upon which Confiscation followeth; these being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Rights; but we shall only consider the several kinds of Rights, or things that befal to the Fisk from private parties, and how they return to private parties again, by Gifts and Processes thereupon; and this is either in reference to Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, Liferents, or the Property and Stock of Heretable Rights and others</p>
                     <p>Moveables fall to the Fisk, either wholly and intire, and that is chiefly by Denunciation and Rebellion, or by some special Statute, the penalty whereof is Confiscation of Moveables; such are breach of Arrestment, or Deforcement wherein, though the private party injured have an interest; yet in effect the whole is Confiscat, and a part belongs to that party, by vertue of the Statute thereanent, whereby they are constitute Donatars: Or otherways some particular Moveables befalleth to the Fisk; either by Custome, as Waith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goods, Ship-wrack, &amp;c. or by Statute. Liferents befal to the Fisk by the Denunciation of the Owner, and remaining unrelaxed year and day, or by such Statutes, whose penalty is the loss of the Liferent.</p>
                     <p>The Stock or Property of Heretable Rights, fall to the Fisk by forefaulture, or becoming caduciary; the Confiscation of the whole Moveables is called the single-escheat; and of the Liferent, is called the Liferent-escheat. We shall only speak of the Single-escheat of Moveables by Denunciation; having spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of breach of Arrestment and Deforcement, <hi>Title Reparation.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Of Liferent-escheat.

And lastly, of things Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciary, especially by Bastardy, and last Heir, and of Gifts and Processes thereupon.</p>

The <hi>English</hi> do more properly call this Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Out-lawerie, whereby the partie becumes Out-law, and hath not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to stand in Judgement Active or Passive: And if such should be called by us, the Denunced, it were smoother, and more suitable then the odious term of Rebell. Seeing Horning is the ground both of single Escheat, and Liferent Escheat: It would be fit to go through the several Requisites there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in order, and the <hi>nullities</hi> arrysing thereupon.</p>
                     <p>First, the Letters of Horning must be Signet: And therefore though the Bill was past, and the matter small, and the parties Indigent, a Horning not Signet was found <hi>null</hi> 1. of <hi>June</hi> 1610. <hi>John Megill</hi> contra.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Executions, or Indorsations thereof must bear, that the partie was charged personally, or at his dwelling house, designing the house. And therefore a Horning was found <hi>null</hi> by Exception, for not designing thereof, though the partie was designed to be Burgess of such a Burgh, which might have presumed his dwelling place to be there, <hi>July</hi> 14. 1626 <hi>Adam</hi> contra Baillies of <hi>Air,</hi> yet a Horning was sustained, though not designing the dwelling house <hi>nominatim;</hi> but by discription of it. Thus, the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers Execution did bear, that he charged the partie designed by such Lands, at his Dwelling House, it being proven, that he then dwelt there, <hi>November</hi> 9. 1632. <hi>Montgomerie</hi> contra <hi>Fergushall.</hi>

If the Charge be in absence, at the parties Dwelling House, the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must bear the Messenger to have craved entrie to give the Charge to the Partie, or his Wife and Familie and not getting Entrie, six Knocks to have been given by the Messenger, at the most patent Gate, or Door thereof, yet this being wanting in the Extract, the same was sustained, It being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Keeper of the Register, and his Servant, That when the Horning was offered to the Register, these words were in it, and by the Messenger, and Witnesses insert in the Execution, that the Knocks were used, the intent of the Cause being Alimentarie and Favourable, <hi>March</hi> 28. 1637. <hi>Scot</hi> contra <hi>Scot.</hi> But this is not to be drawn in Example: For the Register of Horning is that upon which the People ought to rest, and nothing ommitted to be exprest in the Register should be supplied by the principal Hornings, Messenger, or Witnesses: For Executions of Hornings cannot be proven by Witnesses, and consequently no matterial point thereof,</p>

Knocking at the Door audiblie is necessary, without which, Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might be Clandestine, and never come to the parties know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And therefore the Messenger must express this as truely done, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he runs the hazard of being a Forger, if the Executions be improven, that either the Knocks were not given or were given fraudulently, that these within might not hear, as if the Gate had been but Struck with ones hand, a piece of Earth, or Stick, which could not reach theirEars that were within, for the affixing of a Coppie may be more easily evaded: Seeing the partie may send of purpose to take the Coppie off, being none of the Witnesses in in the Execution, albeit sometimes, even the Witnesses carrie away the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, and the Messenger may imagine that his Executions were true, when he said he left a Coppie affixed, because it was affixed when he began to move from the Gate; Yet if he saw it carried away, his Executions would be found false, and he would not escape punishment. A Horning was also sustained, though it bore neither Personally, nor at the parties Dwelling House, seeing it bore a Coppie to have been given, which necessarily imported to have been personally apprehended, <hi>July</hi> 22. 1626. <hi>Stewart</hi> contra <hi>Hannai.</hi>

Tacks also fall under single Escheat, unlesse they be Life-rent Tacks: and Assignations to Life-rent Tacks, and other Life-rents have been found to fall under single Escheat, because the direct Right is incommunicahle; For no Life-renter can put another Life-ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in their place, but canonly assign the profits befalling to the Life-renter by the Life-rent Right: So that it is no Life-rent in the Assigney, but is as the <hi>jus mariti</hi> in a Husband, which is as a Legal assignation: Likewise, Clauses of Relief in Heritable Bands fall under single Escheat, because there is no He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Clause adjected to the Clause of Relief, but Assignations to Heritable
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109710:286"/>
Bands makes them not fall to under single Escheat, because the Creditors right is directly Transmitted and Stated in the Assigneys Person. The single Escheat of Ministers carries the meliorations of their Manses, but the Escheat of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor carries no more then what is his own Interest, and not the Share of the Wifes, Bairns, Creditors, Legators, or nearest of Kin, which is Escheat by their own Rebellion only, even though the Testament were Execute by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creets, at the Executors instance against the Debitors, <hi>December</hi> 21. 1671. Mr. <hi>Arthur Gordon</hi> contra Laird of <hi>Drum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="16">16. As to the other Question, how farr the Denunceds Debts or Deeds affect his Moveables fallen in Escheat, it is clear, that the Debt contained in the Horning affects the Escheat, whether in the hands of the Thesaurer, or Donatare, <hi>Par.</hi> 1551. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Par.</hi> 1579. <hi>cap.</hi> 75. And likewise all Intromet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with Escheat, by Gift, Assignation, or otherways, upon a single Sum monds of Six days, <hi>Par.</hi> 1592. <hi>cap.</hi> 143.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is clear, that no Assignation, Disposition, or other Deed done by the Denunced, after Denunciation, not being for fulfilling an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Obleigment before Denunciation, for a Cause <hi>onerous</hi> to a lawful Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, can affect the Moveable Goods or Debts of the Denunced: But when the Denunciation is upon a Criminal Cause, the Escheat takes not only effect from the Denunciation, but from the committing of the Fact: Therefore a Donatar of Escheat recovered a Sum due to the Rebel, though Assigned before the Fact, and payed before process, Seing intimation was not before the Criminal fact, <hi>Hope, Chalmers</hi> and <hi>Gordoun</hi> contra <hi>Gordoun.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, These Debts or Deeds of the Denunced, do not simplie affect the Escheat Goods, unlesse they be Consumat, or lawful Diligence done before the up-taking of the Escheat Goods, by the Thesaurer or Donatar; Yea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore general Declarator, for that being the Intimation of the Donatars Gift, it renders it to him to be a compleat <hi>valid</hi> Right, after which no Creditor not having a real Right, or Legal diligence before, can have any Access, unless the Donatar, by back-band to the Thesaurer, be otherwise obleiged: And therefore a Donatar having obtained general Declarator, was preferred to a Lawful Creditor arresting after Declarator, <hi>February</hi> 22. 1628. <hi>Anderson</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra <hi>Gordon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Question remains, how far Lawful Creditors, whose Debt is before the Denunciation, or Criminal Fact, using diligence thereafter, but before Declarator, or obtaining Assignations intimat, or Dispositions cled with Possession before Declarator, may thereby effect the Escheat Goods? For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer thereunto, though in <hi>rigore Juris,</hi> the goods and debts of the Denunced fall to the Fisk, as they are the time of the Denunciation, or Criminal Fact: And the Declarator, according to the nature of all Declarators, doth not constitute the Fisks Right, but declares the same to have been from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, or Criminal Fact (albeit as an Assignation, it doth constitute the Donatars Right; Therefore the real Right passing to the Fisk without posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or at least the priviledge of the Fisk might in the full Extent thereof, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all posterior diligences or deeds: Yet such hath been the Royal benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of our Kings, and there Favour to Lawful Creditors, that in this they accompted <hi>id solum nostrum quod debitis deductis est nostrum.</hi> For which the Thesaurer hath been accustomed to prefer Creditors, giving Gifts of Escheat
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:109710:287"/>
to them before others, and in taking Back-bands from them, in favors of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creditors; Yea by long custom, Creditors, whose debts were anterior to the Denunciation, or Criminal Fact, doing diligence before Declarator, are preferable to the Donatar, <hi>Spots</hi> escheat, <hi>James Nisbit</hi> contra <hi>James Fullarton, February</hi> 24. 1637. <hi>Pilmure</hi> contra <hi>Geggie.</hi> In this case the escheat belonged to a Lord of Regality, and the Arrestment was laid on before the gift of escheat: But where the Donatars Gift was in payment of his own debt, he was preferred to an Arrester, arresting the Rebels goods after the gift, but before Declarator, <hi>February</hi> 27. 1623. <hi>Thomson</hi> contra Laird of <hi>Murckil,</hi> but voluntary deeds of the Rebel after Rebellion, as Assignations not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timat before Declarator, for satisfaction of Debt due before Denunciation, or Criminal Fact, are not preferred to the Donatar, <hi>Hope assig.</hi> Sr. <hi>James Stewart</hi> contra <hi>Alexander Wardlaw, John Clerk</hi> contra <hi>William Naper,</hi> and <hi>James Cramfoord</hi> contra <hi>John Mcaul.</hi> And though an Assignation not being inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat before Rebellion was preferred to the Donatar, yet it was in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a Decret of Council decerning, that Assignation to be made, and so not voluntary: So a Donatar was preferred to an assigney, whose assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation bore a cause <hi>Onerous,</hi> and was before Declarator, but after Rebellion, <hi>December</hi> 6. 1631. and <hi>February</hi> 26. 1633. <hi>Conheth</hi> contra <hi>Earlston. Decem.</hi> 18. 1629. Laird of <hi>Caprington</hi> contra <hi>Cuninghame, February</hi> 2. 1632. <hi>Lindsay</hi> contra <hi>Nisbit.</hi> Where the Assignation bore not a cause <hi>Onerous,</hi> Yet a Lawful Creditor obtaining Disposition from the partie denunced, cled with posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, was preferred, <hi>ibid. Johnston</hi> of <hi>Corhead</hi> contra <hi>Johnston.</hi> In like manner a disposition made by the Rebel for a Just debt, before the Giftor Declarator was preferred to the Donatar: Here it was not exprest, that the debt was before the Rebellion, <hi>February</hi> 10. 1635. <hi>Mosman</hi> contra <hi>Lockhart.</hi> Where there seems some difference in the Decisions, wherein these points seem clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, 1. Dispositions and delivery of Goods, because moveables are more easily transmissible in favours of Commerce, and so have always a presumptive Title upon Possession: So that if the Goods be bought in a Mercat, there seems no Question, or if bought out of Mercat from a Rebel, getting the price which accresseth to the Fisk, unlesse the Buyer was in <hi>mala fide.</hi> And though getting the Goods in Satisfaction of a debt, before the Rebellion, be more questionable then a present Exchange of the Goods and Price, the former decisious favour that also. The Lords did lately find, that a Rebel selling part of his Corns, to provide necessaries for Sowing of the ground, the Crop whereof fell to the Fisk, the bargain was <hi>valid.</hi> 2. Legal Diligence upon Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restment being compleat before Declarator, are <hi>valid,</hi> though after Rebellion; Yea the Decisions favour even the inheat diligence, if the Arrestment was before declarator upon a debt before Rebellion. And it was so found, <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 19. 1667. <hi>Jsobel Glen</hi> contra <hi>John Hoome.</hi> But voluntary Assignations seem not effectnal, if they be not compleat by Intimation before Rebellion, and though they be, if Payment or Satisfaction, either in Money or renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bands, innovating the Rebells Band, be not obtained before Rebellion, the Donatar was found preferable, but otherwise the Creditor, by Precept, As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation or otherwise, getting payment of his debt, prior to the Rebellion, and obtaining payment, before Declarator was found secure against the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natar, <hi>February</hi> 11. 1675. <hi>William Veatch</hi> contra <hi>Executers</hi> of <hi>Ker.</hi> But though actual Payment were obtained by Assignation after Declarator, it will not Secure the Creditor <hi>December</hi> 20. 1676. <hi>inter eosdem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="17">

                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:109710:288"/>17. The matter of Escheat being thus cleared, we come to the gift there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and Declarator thereupon.

                     <p>Gifts of Escheat are in effect, the Assignations thereof by the Fisk, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Intimation is the Declarator. So that a Posterior gift, with a Prior general Declarator is preferable to a prior gift, with a posterior Declarator: But where there is yet no Declarator, Preference is by the first Citation, if the same was followed with Lawful Diligence: And therefore a Posterior Gift, whereupon Citation was prior, but three days was preferred to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Gift, <hi>Jan.</hi> 31. 1635. Laird of <hi>Renton</hi> contra Laird of <hi>Lambertoun.</hi> If there be no Citation, or Declarator, the Donatars possession is sufficient alone, and will, preferr a posterior Gift though granted to the Rebel himself, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Diligence upon the Prior Gift. And if two gifts be produced as ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses, without any Diligence on either, the first gift is preferable.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Gifts of Escheat, as all other gifts by the King are <hi>null,</hi> if granted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Casuality fall, as an erection of Kirk-lands, in a temporal Lordship was found <hi>null,</hi> because a commendatar stood then in the right, and did not Resign or Consent: And therefore a posterior Erection to that Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, upon his own Dimission was preferred, <hi>February</hi> 24. 1666. Sr. <hi>Robert Sinclair</hi> contra Laird of <hi>Waderburn.</hi> And so a gift of escheat before De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation was found <hi>null,</hi> by exception; Because it mentioned no particular Horning whereupon it proceeded, though done by the Kings own hand at Court: And though Anterior Hornings were produced in the Process, and no other Donatar, nor Officer of State quarrelled the same. <hi>November</hi> 20. 1628. <hi>Weston</hi> contra <hi>Stewart.</hi>

Declaring it a sufficient evidence of Simulation, of any Assignation, or Gift of Escheat, if the Rebel himself, his Wife, Bairns, or near Friends, remain in Possession of his Tack, and Goods, to their own uses, and behove; yet it is not declared, how long their possession must be; Seing the Rebel ordinarily, for some time is in possession, till the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natar use diligence: But where the Rebel retained possession till his death, a Gift though declared was found <hi>null</hi> by exception, <hi>July</hi> 12. 1628. <hi>Morison</hi> contra <hi>Frendraught, June</hi> 26. 1611. <hi>Gairdner</hi> contra Lord <hi>Gray:</hi> Yea, it was found <hi>Simulat,</hi> where the Rebel possessed, 9. years, <hi>June</hi> 27. 1622. <hi>John Inglis</hi> contra Laird of <hi>Capringtoun,</hi> and other Circumstances, concurring 4, or 5. years by the Rebel, was found sufficient, the Donatar having consented to several Tacks, and Wodsets granted by the Rebel: And yet the same Gift was found <hi>valid</hi> in part, in so far as concerned Heritable Rights, acquired by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natar from the Rebel, <hi>December</hi> 23. 1623. <hi>Ballantyn</hi> contra <hi>Murray,</hi> four or five years Possession of the Rebel, were found sufficient to infer <hi>Simula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> though the Donatar was a Creditor, and the Rebels Lands apprysed, seing the appryser possessed not, but the Rebel, 6, and 9. of <hi>January</hi> 1666.

                     <p>The next ground of the <hi>Simulation</hi> of gifts of Escheat, and presuming the same to the Rebels behove is, when it is taken in the name of the Children in his Family, which was found Relevant, without mention of the Rebels Possession, <hi>June</hi> 25. 1622.

Or to there own behove by their infeftments, as Lords and Baillies of Regalitie: But Liferent-escheat is not only Penal, but is a Legal Consequence of the Condition of the Rebel, whereby he being out-lawed, and having no person in Judgement, is excluded from the Possession of all his Rights, and is esteemed as <hi>civiliter mortuus,</hi> whereby his Fies become open, and are in the hands of his Superior, whether the King, or any other Superior, by his continuing unrelaxed year and day: And therefore the diligences done against, or the deeds done by the Rebel, for satisfying of his lawful debts contracted before Rebellion, do not effect his Liferent-escheat, as they do his Single-escheat, though they be done before year and day ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, being after the Rebellion: And so Arrestments, or Assignations, even though before Rebellion, have no effect after year and day is run, because these being but Personal, and Liferent-escheat a reall Right flowing from the Superiority, whereby the Vassal is denuded of the Liferent: Therefore the effect of these Personal rights ceaseth; But all reall rights flowing from the Vassal before the Rebellion, as Fews, Annualrents, Tacks, Appryzings and Adjudications whereupon there was a Charge, are effectual, and not excluded by Liferent-escheat, though these are excluded by Ward, which is a Casuality following the nature of Fewdal Rights; Whereas Liferent-escheat ariseth not from the Nature of Fies, but is introduced by Law or Custom, and therefore the Fie falls in the hands of the Superior as it was in the hands of the Vassal, with all the Real burdens he had fixed upon it: Neither does Posterior voluntary Infeftments, though for debts prior to the Rebellion, and granted before Declarator, exclude the Liferent-escheat, <hi>Jannuary</hi> 18. 1611. <hi>Samuel Ord</hi> contra the Laird of <hi>Craigkeith.</hi> The like, where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment was granted after Rebellion, but within year and day, <hi>January</hi> 23. 1627. <hi>James Wallace</hi> contra <hi>Thomas Porteous.</hi> Where there is an excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on insinuat, unless there had been an prior obliegment before the Rebellion, to grant thelnfeftment, as if in that case (though in <hi>cursu Rebellionis</hi>) it would be sufficient to exclude the Liferent.

                     <p>But, because, who are the Parents, is sometimes dubious, procreation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Secret both in the Act and Effect: For clearing thereof, it is the common rule in the Civil Law.

The presumption, that the Children born in Marriage are the Husbands, requires such time as they might have been lawfully procreat, when both parties were free, and unmarried, which if it was 9 moneths before the birth, it is sufficient, but if less, the presumption will not suffice; Unless it appear the Child was unrype, and born before the time, otherwise the Child will be presumed to be the former Husbands. This is <hi>presumptio juris,</hi> and admits contrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. As first, if the Father were absent, or impotent, the time that the conception could be, which absence is not necessarily beyond Sea, as the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> require the fathers absence: And therefore, if he be within the four Seas during the time the birth is in the Womb, this presumption prevaileth against his absence with them: But with us it will be sufficient, that his absence be special, and circumstantiat, that there remaineth no doubt, that he could not have been present. As if the Father were in prison, or at very great dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: So that a short time might not suffice him to be present. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption will also be taken off, by the Testimony of both Parents agreeing, that the Child belongs to another Father, and so is a Bastard: But the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of either of them will not suffice, as <hi>Craig</hi> relates, of a Lady, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing controversie with her Son, she was accustomed to consesse that he was a Bastard: And of a Queen, related by the Doctors, whose name they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, Who, at the time of her death, declared to her Son, that he was not the Kings Son, yet he was received as King, in his Fathers place. It hath been more frequently seen, that the Father hath disowned the Child born of his Wife, which though it might inferr suspicion and reproach, yet not Bast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardrie, unless the Mother also of consent, or by process were made to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it. It will not be sufficient to eleid the foresaid presumption, though the Wifes adulterie should be proven; Yea, though at a time answering to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:109710:294"/>
the time of conception, though it hath an ordinary course of 9 moneths, yet hath had such variations, that the Child hath been accompted belonging to the Father, by reason of the Marriag, though it preceeded the Birth of the Child, only by the space of 8, 7, or the beginning of 6. moneths; Especially if by the judgement of <hi>Phisicians immaturity</hi> of the Child concurred; Yea, this presumption will atribute the Child to the Father, though the Child be born 9 10, or 11. moneths after the Fathers Death: But in these cases, the Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the circumstances may make the Mothers Testimony alone sufficient to instruct the Bastardie of the Child: Neither is Marriage here accompted, by the Solemnization thereof in the Church, which in some places is ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without that, and though with us, it be a requisit solemnity, yet it is not of the being of Marriage. And therefore, Cohabitation, as Man and Wife sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth the Solemnity of publick Marriage, which being a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>Act,</hi> and having no record, could seldom be proven; Yea, though it could be proven by the Oath of both parties, or otherwise that there was never a formal Marriage, if the parties were capable of Marriage, Cohabitation would supplie, for after Contract, or Promises of Marriage, or <hi>Sponsalia,</hi> if copulation follow there is thence presumed a Matrimonial Consent <hi>de presenti,</hi> which therefore, cannot be past from by either, or both parties, as having the essential requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits of Marriage If diligence be used for performing that Solemnity, though it take no effect, the Contract of Marriage will make the Child lawful, as when, in the time of the Proclamation thereof, the one partie died, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Craig</hi> relateth a case: Yea, in the case of <hi>Edward Younger</hi> there mentioned, who having begotten Children under promise of Marriage, but refusing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, or perform it, the Woman having obtained Sentence of the Commissars (who are Judges of Matrimony and Legitimation) against the said <hi>Edward,</hi> for Solemnizing the Marriage, which though he obeyed not, the Children were accompted Lawful, and capable of Succession.</p>
                     <p>Marriage, as is before shown, Title <hi>conjugal Obligations,</hi> is proven by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation of the Father and Mother as married persons, which was sustained upon 10. years Cohabitation, as Man and Wife, though it was offered to be proven the Child was reput Bastard, <hi>July</hi> 7. 1626. <hi>Somervail</hi> contra <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro.</hi> And there being a mutual probation, whether a Defunct was lawful, or a Bastard, and six Witnesses being examined on either side, though several of the Witnesses on the one side proved, that the Defunct was reput Bastard, and that his Mother gave signes of Repentance publickly in the Church, for Fornication with his Father: But others proving that they were in there house, and saw them Cohabit, as Man and Wife, but did not mention how long, the Defunct was found to be no Bastard, but a lawful Child, <hi>Jan.</hi> 15. 1676.

So then <hi>ultimus Haeres,</hi> and Bastardrie, are of the like Nature, which being <hi>caduciarie</hi> Confiscations, fall to the Fisk, because no other can have right, there may be this difference betwixt them; That in the case of the last Heir, Creditors, for their satisfaction, may confirm the Defuncts Moveables, and so recover the same, for their own Satisfaction, in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:109710:296"/>
which case, they would be lyable, as other Executors, to the remanent Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors of the Defunct, and to the Fisk, or Donatar, for the superplus: As in the place of nearest of Kin, &amp; to the Relict also for her part, but this being only for obtaining their own Satisfaction, and for shunning a more extraordinary way, by Adjudication (which also they may use at their option) they ought not in prejudice of the Fisk, to have the third part of the Defuncts part, as other Executors, but in the cases of Bastardry, Confirmation of Executors is not competent, because the Bastard, being excluded from the power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Testament, can have no Executor.</p>
                     <p>Concerning last Heir, the greatest doubt is, who they are, and in what Cases they take place? As to the first, <hi>Craig, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Dieg.</hi> 17. is not posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, whether Superiours be last Heirs of the Defunct, in the Fies held of them, or if the King be the last Heir for all: And according to the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Feudal Customs, there is no doubt, the Feus return to the several Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, for thereby none could succeed (without Express provision in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) but the lawful Issue of the Descendent of the first Vassal, whose Person and Race was peculiarly chosen, and confided in by the Superiour.</p>
                     <p>But now Fies not being gratuitous, as at first, but for <hi>onerous</hi> causes, besides the <hi>reddendo &amp; service,</hi> and ordinarly granted to the Vassal, and his Heirs what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somever: Which failzing, the King, by his Prerogative Royal, excludeth all other Superiours, who are presumed to retain no right, nor expectation of Succession, unless by express provision of the Investiture, the Fies be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to Heirs Male, or of Tailzie, which failzing, to return to the Superior: In which he is proper Heir of Provision.</p>
                     <p>As to the other Doubt, in what case the King is last Heir, <hi>Craig,</hi> in the forenamed place relateth, that some were of opinion, That if the Defunct had no Heirs within the 7th degree, the King taketh place as last Heir. And that others thought it to hold in Collateral Successions, but his own opinion is in the contrary: That any Heir, of what degree soever hath Right, which suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the ground now laid, that the King hath right, as last Heir to the Heritage become <hi>caduciarie;</hi> Because no other partie can be instructed law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heir. So he reporteth, it was found in the case of the Earl of <hi>Marr,</hi> who was served Heir to Lady <hi>Elizabeth Dowglas</hi> Countess of <hi>Marr,</hi> beyond the tenth degree. And that the Lord <hi>Seatoun,</hi> that he might have a Title to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the Lands of <hi>Longnidrie,</hi> against <hi>Forrester,</hi> served himself Heir to the granter of the Wodsett, beyond the 7th degree, whereof several degrees were Collateral. And the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Henrie</hi> the 4th Succeeded to <hi>Henrie</hi> the 3. though not within the 15. degree.</p>
                     <p>The gift, or right of <hi>ultimus haeres</hi> hath no effect, till Decreet of Declarator be obtained thereupon, in the same way as in Bastardry, <hi>July</hi> 20. 1662. Laird of <hi>Balnagoun</hi> contra <hi>Dingwal. July</hi> 31. 1666. <hi>Thomas Crawford</hi> contra Town of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>

                     <p>SUCCESSION to Defuncts, is the most Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Title in Law, for thereby the Rights of all persons, do necessarily passe once, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently often, in every generation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Rule and Course of Succssion ought to be accurately searched out, and followed; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Channel of Succession is with us divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in two currents, by the one whereof, all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Rights; and by the other all Moveable Rights are conveyed from the dead to the living. The first passing unto Heirs, the second unto Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors: We shall in this Title consider, that which is common to Succession, and in the subsequent Titles, that which is proper to the several kinds thereof.</p>
                     <p>As to the common Consideration of Succession, we must severally inquire. First, what Natural Equity holdeth forth of Succession, 2. What the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Law. 3. What the Civil <hi>Roman</hi> Law. 4. What the Feudal Customs. last, What our own Law, and consuetude, provideth concerning Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesion.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the first, it may seem, that Succession hath little Foundation, far lesse a competent Regulation, in Equity, or by the Law of Nature; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the matter of Succession is so variable, That every Nation, Yea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every Province, and many Cities, have their several Constitutions and Customs for Succession, arguing it to be wholly in the Arbitriment of People, and Authority over them.</p>
                     <p>Yet this will not follow, that Succession hath no Rise, nor Rule in Equity; For, as hath been ofttimes showen before, most of the Rights of men, are ordered in Equity; Yet so, as they are put in the owners power, who may
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:109710:298"/>
alter the same by there will. So it will be found in the matter of Succession, which appeareth thus.</p>
                     <p>First, Succession was before Constitutions or Customs, of Constitution there will be no doubt, these are but Rare to this day, Succession being yet ordinarily by Custom, and Custom necessarily implyeth Antecedent <hi>Acts</hi> of Succession, Inductive thereof, which therefore, behoved to have some other Rule, then the Custom thereby introduced. 2. Where there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law nor Custom, concerning Succession: As when People from divers Countries do gather into new Plantations, in <hi>America,</hi> and live not severally, as parts of their Mother Countries, but joyntly: Such have goods, which by their death, become not <hi>caduciarie</hi> or <hi>nullius,</hi> to be appropriat by the first Occupant. If therefore, they remain in the Property of some persons, which needs must be by some Law, it can be by no other, then Natural Equity, or the Law of rational Nature. 3. It is not to be thought, that GOD, who hath allowed Propertie, would leave Man distitute of a Natural Rule, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to Regulate it after the Owners Death, though there were no Law, nor Custom about it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But it is not so dubious, that there is a Rule of Equity in Successions, as what it is, for clearing thereof, we shall parcel it out thus: First, every Right, being a Faculty, or Power of Exaction, or Disposal; It is a chief interest and effect of it, that the Owner may dispose thereof, not only to take effect presently, but if he please to take effect after his Death, and by the Law of Nature, the sol will of the Owner is sufficient to passe, or transmit his Right, if communicable, both in his life, and after his Death.</p>
                     <p>So then, the first Rule of Succession in Equity, is the expresse will of the Owner, willing such persons to Succeed him in whole, or in part. It may be objected, that the will of the owner is not the Rule of Succession, because there lyeth upon the Owner a Natural Obligation, to provide for his Relations, not only during his Life, but after his Death; As it is said, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. v. 8. <hi>He that provideth not for his own, especially these of his own Familie, hath denyed the Faith, and is worse then an infidel.</hi> Which importeth that infidels have naturally that Principle: And therefore, the first member of Succession, in Equity, must be those of the Defuncts Family, and not those of his Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Choice. This doth indeed well conclude a Natural Obligation on all men, to provide their own; But first, it will not extend so far, as to inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitat the Owner, to dispose of his own, either in his Life, or after his Death: So that there remains a competent provision for his own, otherwise, he might not even gift in his Life, but he may gift, both to take effect in his Life, and after his Death: And is not necessitat, to institute his own as Heirs, but to provide them. 2. The dutie of Provision, is a Personal Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, but the power of Disposal, and Succession thereby, is a Real Right, which are <hi>toto genere</hi> different Rights; Now Real Rights are not hindred, nor altered by Personal Obligations, though the Disponer hath failed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains Debitor, as an obliegment to dispone, is no Disposition: But the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent dispositive <hi>Act</hi> of the will doth only Constitute, or convey the Right: Which, though it be <hi>posterior</hi> to an obliegment, in favours of any other, that doth not <hi>annull</hi> the Disposition, though it oblidge the Disponer. If there be no express will of the Defunct, the main difficulty is, what is the second Member of Natural Succession: wherein the presumed will of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:109710:299"/>
takes place, which hath this Rule, <hi>quod naturaliter inesse debet, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumitur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore the Defuncts will is presumed to institute his own, whom he is naturally oblieged to, provid in the first place: So that it is not the oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to provide, but the Defuncts will presumed thence, which disposeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Succession, for the oblidgment to dispon, and the actual dispositon, are different <hi>toto genere:</hi> And if the oblidgement to provide, were the Rule, the express will of the ownèr could not over rule it; Where there is a custom of Succession, the Defuncts will is presumed, to be according to that custom; But that hath its efficacie, rather from the Custom, as it is a positive Law then from Equity.</p>
                     <p>The presumed will of the Defunct, to provide his own, is not indefinit of all his own; But it hath a natural order, or substitution, standing in the nearest degree of Consanguinity: For natural reason sheweth, that as there is not an equal Relation, so there cannot be an equal Devision to all, and there being no Natural Rule of proportion, the nearest Degree must exclude the farther Degrees in Succession, which is clearly held forth in the foresaid Text; Having an Explicatorie, and Applicatory Term, <hi>especially these of his own Family:</hi> And as the proportion is unknown, so the benefite, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, would evanish. Therefore, what ever Natural Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Charity, may obleige the Defunct to have done expresly, his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed will hath no Rule beyond the first Degree.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Fourthly, Therefore the first Degree of Succession, by the conjectur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will of the intestat, is of Children, according to that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. <hi>If children, then Heirs:</hi> Which consequence doth necessarily import, That all Children are Heirs: Neither can this be an allusion from the Judicial Law, by which all Children were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Heirs; But the Male excluded the Female: Therefore it must needs be a consequence form the Law of Nature, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is no different proportion, held forth by this Text, or by the Light of Nature; The Succession of all Children must be in Equal shares, whether Male or Female, for in all Communions, and Partnerships, an Equal Division takes place, except an Unequal be expressed.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is more dark, whether by the Law of Nature, there be competent, the Right of Representation, whereby the Issue of the Defunct Children re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present them, and come in with the surviving Children, to get that Share, which their Defunct Parent would have got, if alive; whereby they would not succeed in <hi>capita,</hi> the whole Successors getting Equal Share, but in <hi>stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes:</hi> Whereby the Issue of the Defunct Children, though they succeed equally among themselves, yet unequally with the surviving Children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the whole Issue of the Defunct, get but an equal share with each of the surviving Children: As if a Father having three Children, the eldest dying before him, leaves one Child, and two Oyes by another Child, if there be place for representation, the Heritage would divide in three, the two surviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Children will have two third parts, the other third will divide in two, whereof the Child of the Defuncts will get one half, and the other half will divide equally betwixt the two Oyes: So then the question is, whether the Descendents will thus succeed, or if the Survivers will wholly exclude the Issue of the Deceasing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:109710:299"/>This Right of Representation, taketh place with us, and most other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the Right of Immoveables; Which we call Heritable Rights, whether it be of Descendents, or Collaterals: But doubtless in that the Course of the Law of Nature is altered, for the preservation of the Stock or Stem of the Familie: So that it is clear, that there is no Right of Representation, in Collaterals, by the Law of Nature, as that the Child, or Grand-child of a Brother should come in with a Brother, because the Propinquitie of Blood, Natural Affection, and so the Presumed Will of the Defunct is diminished: But it is not so clear in Descendents, neither shall we be positive in it, but it seems most suitable to Reason, and the Text adduced; That if the Issue of Defunct Children remain in the Familie, that they should come in by Representation, in the place of their Defunct Parent, for, these that are in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, extendeth to all that are not <hi>Forisfamiliat,</hi> whether Children or Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children, to whom there remaineth like affection, in the common Parent: but when the Defunct Child was <hi>forisfamiliat,</hi> and so presumed to have been provided, and to have gotten a Share, and therewith put out of the Familie, to live in a distinct Familie; In that case, there seems no ground for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation, which doth agree to our Custom, in the Succession of Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, wherein there is no Right of Representation, but the nearest of Kin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Issue of the Defuncts, which were of the same degree, which Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eession is certainly more near unto the Natural Succession.</p>
                     <p>What hath been said, may sufficiently clear the Natural Succession, of the Defuncts descendents, whether Children, or Grand-children, and while there are any Descendents, there is place for no other.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The third Branch of Natural Succession, failing the express will of Defuncts, and their Descendents, or the Issue of their Bodies, is of Parents, among whom, these in the nearest degree are preferable, as Father and Mother: And if the Father be dead, there seems to be place for Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to his Father, to come in with the surviving Mother Equally; But other Parents of, or by the Female Line, who are in another Family, from the ground laid in the Text, <hi>of providing these in the Family,</hi> seem not to come in to exclude Brothers, and Sisters, and other Collaterals in that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, as the Grand-father, and Grand-mother, on the Mother side: It will not be opposite to this, which is said, <hi>Children are not to lay up for Parents, but Parents for Children;</hi> which is not to be understood absolutely, but compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, and according to the ordinar course of Nature.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The fourth Link of Natural Succession, is Brethren and Sisters, among whom Brethren and Sisters German, being related by both Bloods, exclude these who are only of one Blood, by the Fathers side: the reason is, because the presumed will of the Defunct, being from their Interest and Relation, these of double Relation, by both Bloods, are preferable to these of single Relation.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The last degree of Natural Succession is, of Uncles, Aunts, Nepheus, Neices, all which being in equal propinquity to the Defunct, come in together, And failling these, the Succession would befall equally, to the nearest degree of Cousines, among whom the nearest degree excludeth the father, without Right of Representation: And these conjoyned by both Bloods, exclude these onjoyned by one. Husband and Wife, doth not succeed properly, either to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:109710:300"/>
other, but having a communion of goods, there is a Division by the Death of either.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The main question is here, whether there be Naturally, any difference in Succession, betwixt the Collaterals on the Fathers side, who are called Agnats, and the Collaterals on the Mothers side, who are called Cognats. <hi>Justinian</hi> in his <hi>novel Constitutions, cap.</hi> 4. 127. took off all distinction of Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats, and Cognats in Succession: For which he is generally reprehended by Interpreters, Who behold such a difference, even in equity, Cognats be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conjoyned by Women, who ordainarily, are under the power of others, even naturally by Marriage. And so being of another Family, they are not of the Defuncts own Family, as the Agnats are (amongst these, the Mother, Fathers Mother, or other Ascendents, on the Fathers side in his Family, are not hereby excluded) and so neither these or other, by their express, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed will, can transmit any Goods, or Estates. Yet this point remaineth more dark: And I conceive, what hath come by the Mothers side, or by the Grand-mother, &amp;c. therein the Cognats of her Blood would naturally suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, because there are two grounds of Presumption joyned, Propinquity of Blood, and Gratitude, or Remuneration to that Linage, by whom, such things by Succession came. So that <hi>Paterna Paternis, Materna Maternis,</hi> ought to take place in equity, as the presumed will of the Defunct, unless the express will, or the Law, or Custom of the place be to the contrare.</p>
                     <p>So much for the Natural course of Succession, which hath been the more insisted in, not only to shew the goodness and righteousness of GOD, instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting man, with an in-bred Law, written in his heart; though he were desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of any humane constitution or custom, so that he might walk justly, in this important matter of Succession: Albeit all the Lines of this Divine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, be no clear, to our Sin-dimmed eyes; But also that, where positive Law, or Custom is <hi>dubious,</hi> in the matter of Succession, or is defective therein, Emendation, and Extention may be fetched thereto, from the Law of Nature, we shall now proceed to the positive Law of God, given to <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> concerning Succession.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The Judicial Law, in the case of the Daughters of <hi>Zelophehad, Num.</hi> 6. 27. Determineth the order of Succession, in Lands or Immoveables, to stand as a perpetual Statute to the Children of <hi>Israel.</hi> Thus the first degree of Succession is, of all the Sons, whereby the Daughters, and their Descendents are excluded, but the Sons do not Succeed equally: For the first born had a double Portion, of all that the Father had, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 17. By which the eldest Son had twice as much as the other Sons: So that the Heritage being divided in one Portion more then there were Sons, of these the eldest had two, and each of the rest one; As if there be two Sons, it divides in three, whereof the elder hath two third parts, and the younger one third part; If there be three, the Heritage divides in four parts, whereof the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest hath two fourth parts, which is the half, and each of the rest hath one fourth part.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. This Right of <hi>primogeniture,</hi> was so secured, that the Father could not preser any other Son thereto, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 16. Failling Sons, the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance passes to the Daughters equally; For though the Text expresseth it to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:109710:300"/>
passe to the Daughter, in the singular number; Yet it is cleared by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, that all the Daughters are therein included, for the Daughters of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lophehad,</hi> though more in number, are found to have the said Right, and to get an Inheritance among their Fathers Brethren, by which it appeareth that the Right of Representation had place there, for all the Daughters of <hi>Zelophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>had</hi> were but to have that share which their Father would have had, if he had been alive among his Brethren, for they claiming the Right of their Father, whom they show not to have been in the company of <hi>Corah,</hi> thereby fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulting his right: So then, right of Representation must take place amongst all descendents: So that the Children of the Sons, though these Sons survive not their Father, would exclude the surviving Daughters, or would come in with the surviving Sons, not equally, and in <hi>capita,</hi> but in <hi>stirpes,</hi> whereby they would succeed to the shares of their pre-deceased Fathers, by Right of Representation.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The third degree of <hi>Jewish</hi> Succession, is failing Descendents, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance passeth to the Defuncts Brethren, and these failing, to his Fathers Brethren, and these failing, to the nearest Kinsman of his Familie, that is, the nearest <hi>Agnats</hi> on his Fathers side, where all the male <hi>Agnats,</hi> of the same degree are understood. It doth not appear whether in this <hi>Collateral</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, there be place for Representation; and though there be no mention of the Succession of Women, or their Issue, but only of Daughters, Some have thought, from the paritie of Reason, in everie degree, failing the Males, the Females are to Succeed, and to exclude further degrees of Males, as if there be no Brothers, but Sisters, these should exclude the Fathers Brother: It may be also thought strange, that in all this course of Succession, there is no mention of the Succession of Parents.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. In answer to these doubts, as to the first, I conceive, that in <hi>Collateral</hi> Succession, there is also place for Representation, so that the Brothers Sons as representing the Defunct Brother, their Father would exclude the Fathers Brethren. And so of the rest, because it is said, if there be no Brethren, the Inheritance shall passe unto the Fathers Brethren, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, unto the nearest Kins-man, and if there be no Right of Representation, the Cousin-ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or Father Brothers Son would exclude the Nephew, or Brothers Son, for Uncle and Nephew are never understood by the name of Cousins or Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but have that special nominate relation of Uncle and Nephew, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Brother Son, and therefore the Brothers Son, as representing the Brother, must succeed, and exclude the Fathers Brother. 2. <hi>Cateris paribus,</hi> Succession will certainly descend to the Brothers Son, and not ascend to the Fathers Brother.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. As to the second doubt, Ihold, that only Daughters and their Issue do succeed, and no other Females, or their Issue; the reason is, First, from the Text, where failling Sons, Daughters are exprest, but failling Brothers Sisters are not substitute, but Uncles. 2. The Division and Succession, and the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was Typical, and was not to passe from <hi>Tribe to Tribe,</hi> and therefore, Daughters succeeding, are appointed to Marry in their own <hi>Tribe;</hi> because ordinarily they were to be Married, when their Fathers suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession did probably appear; but this could not have been, if Fathers Sist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and these of further degree had succeeded.</p>
                     <p n="14">
                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:109710:301"/>14. As to the third, concerning Succession of Parents, it is sure, Mothers, and all <hi>Cognats,</hi> by the Mother side, being ordinarily of other Tribes, and Families, were for the reason now adduced, excluded from the Succession. The Text is clear, that only Kins-men in the Family, that is on the Fathers side succeed; But the reason why there is no mention of Fathers, &amp;c. May be, because the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> being Typical, is fixed to Tribes and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, it uses not to passe by Testament, or provision, or to be acquired fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then by Wodset, to return at the <hi>Jubile;</hi> Therefore among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> Lands passed by the ordinar course of Legittime Succession, and so came from the Fathers to the Children, which presupposes the Father to have been pre-deceased, and could not succeed.</p>
                     <p>By this Tract of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Succession, it is clear, that GOD, by his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Law, altered the effect of Equitie, and of his Moral Law, in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession: For, it hath been now shown from that place (<hi>if Children, then Heirs,</hi>) That all Children must needs be Heirs, not by the Judicial Law, but by Equity; And yet by the Judicial Law, not all Children are Heirs, but Sons exclude Daughters, and Females are excluded by Males of a far distant degree, which necessarily infers, that for expedience, the course of Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be altered. The like must also be in other effects of Equity, which are in our power.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. The order of Succession in the Civil Law, did exceedingly varie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in many points different, in the Ancient Law of the twelve Tables, in Honorarie Law, introduced by the Edicts and Customs of the <hi>Pretors,</hi> who had Authority to Supply, and Correct the Ancient Law; and in the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> Constitutions, especially in the Novel Constitutions of <hi>Justinian,</hi> they did all agree in this, that the chief mean of Succession, is the Will, or Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Defunct, which they held so Sacred, That all Pactions, or Provisio s, which might any way hinder the Free Liberty of Testing, or any Act, whereby Defuncts might be Restrained, or Constrained in the free Disposal of their Estates, were not only <hi>null,</hi> but <hi>exclusive</hi> of such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, from having any interest in the Defuncts Inheritance; Yet were the <hi>Romans</hi> so sensible of the Natural Obligation of Parents to provide their Children, that their midle Laws, necessitat Fathers either to institute ther Children, or expresly to <hi>exhaeridat,</hi> or disherish them, expressing their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquencie of Ingratitude, the kinds and measures whereof, the Law did determine: So that if the Children were past by in silence, and neither In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute nor <hi>exhaeridat,</hi> the Law declared the Testament <hi>void,</hi> and if they were <hi>exhaeridat</hi> without a due and true offence, it did allow the Children <hi>querelam inofficiosi Testamenti,</hi> that is, complaint against the Testament made <hi>contra officium,</hi> which is the Natural Obligation, or duty of Parents to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide their Children; For the like Reason, the same Complaint was compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the Fathers, against the Testament of their Children, but because that remeid might have been eleided, by exhausting the Heritage by Legacies, whereby the institution of the Children might prove ineffectual, for their provision: Therefore, the Law allowed Children a <hi>Legittime</hi> Portion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sourth part of the Heritage; which that, it might extend to all Heirs. <hi>Falcidius</hi> was the Author of that Noble Law, restraining Legacies, so that there might remain a Portion to the Defuncts Heirs, which Law and Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in Honour of his Name, was called the <hi>Falcidian</hi> Law, and <hi>Portio Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidia,</hi> whereby the fourth part of the free Goods of the Testator, remained
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:109710:301"/>
always Secure against Legacies, and when a new Subtilty was invented, to frus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trat the Falcidian Law: By taking away the Heritage, not Directly by Legacies; but Indirectly by Trust or <hi>Fidei-comisses. Trebellianus</hi> procured that Ordinance of the <hi>Senate,</hi> called <hi>Senatus-Consultum Trebellianum,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that Portion called also <hi>Trebelliarica,</hi> should remain safe against Fidei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Commissarie Trusts: And though it be the Common Opinion of the <hi>Doctors:</hi> That if the Defunct Expressly Prohibit the Heir, to take the benefit of his <hi>Falcidia</hi> or <hi>Trebellianica,</hi> they will be thereby excluded, yet the Common opinion, is that it cannot be extended to Children, as to their Legittime, whom the Law hath fullie secured, either by Ordaining them to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute Heirs in Whole, or at least in a fourth Part; which is their Natural, or Legittime Portion: And if they be Institute in less, they have Right to the Supplement of their Legittime Portion, or otherwise they must be Express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Justly Exheredat, and they have the Common benefit of other Heirs, of their <hi>Falcidia,</hi> or <hi>Trebellian,</hi> which the Testator cannot Frustrate, with out express Prohibition.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. If there be no lawfull Testament by theLaw of the twelve Tables (which is the Ancient <hi>Roman Law,</hi> and in comparison of the <hi>Pretorian,</hi> or <hi>Imperial Law,</hi> is only called the Law, or the Civil Law) the Succession of Defunct, falleth in the first place to the defuncts Children, or nearest descendents with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Distinction of any lawful Children, though Adopted, or <hi>Posthumus,</hi> or though of diverse lawful Marriages; whether <hi>Male</hi> or <hi>Female:</hi> So that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Defuncts familie, and in his Paternall power, for these who are emancipat, and demitted from the familie, and from under the Paternall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they are either really or presumptively provided, and so have no share of the Succession (of this Paternal Power, and Emancipation, see before, Tit. Obligations of Parents) These in the familie were called <hi>Haredes Sui &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarij;</hi> because they were <hi>ipso facto</hi> Heirs without solemnity or entrie; Among these, the Right of Representation had place, so that for example, the Grand Children succeeded with theChildren but not equally, <hi>et per capita;</hi> but <hi>per stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes:</hi> For theGrand Children had but the share of their defunct Parent equally among them, and so of all other descendents being in the Familie. The Pretors did in a part alter this, and brought in the Children or Issue emancipat with those in the family, without distinction, providing the emancipat brought in their goods, and adjected the same to the Inheritance, <hi>per collationem bonorum;</hi> yet because only the Law, that is, the <hi>Ancient Law,</hi> could make Heirs: The Emancipat were not called Heirs, but <hi>bonorum possessores.</hi> The <hi>Pretorian</hi> Law did also take off the necessitie, and dammage of the Succession, that none might be necessitate to be Heirs, yea all Heirs had the benefite of an Inventar, being timeouslyand duelie, made beyond which they were not lyable for the defuncts Debts.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The next degree of Succession, by the ancient <hi>Roman Law,</hi> was failing Descendents in the Familie, the nearest Agnats of the same degree succeeded; But there was no Succession ofParents, nor of Cognats related by the Mothers side (here Mother comprehends Grand-mother and all other Ascendentsof that kind) So the next Degree was of Brethren and Sisters, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. The <hi>Pretorian</hi> Law did also emendat this, and first brought in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with the Brothers and SistersGerman, or of both Bloods: And thereafter

the <hi>Tertullian Senatus-consult,</hi> failling the Fathers, brought in the Mother with the Sisters in their share, but not with the Brothers German, who if there were no Sisters German, excluded their Mothers totally, and, if for example there were a Brother German, and a Sister German, the Father being dead, the Brother had the half, and the Sisters half, was devided equally betwixt her and her Mother, and so the Mother is preferred to the Fathers Father, and to the Defuncts Brethren, and Sisters of one blood. Failling those of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the Brothers, and Sisters by the Fathers side, and these failling the nearest Degree of Agnats, in which the paritie of reason inferreth, that as in Brothers and Sisters, so in other Collateralls, these of both blood make a nearer Degree, then these of one blood. Failling all these, the <hi>Pretorian</hi> Law ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitts Spouses to be Heirs, each to other, the Husband to the Wife, and the Wife to the Husband, and last, the Fisk takes place as last Heir.</p>

                     <p>The Expediency of <hi>Primogeniture,</hi> is partly Publick, and partly Private: The Publick Expediency, is that the Estate of Great Familyes, remaining in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and undivided; They with their Vassals and followers may be able to defend their Country, especially against Sudden invasions, for with us in <hi>France Polland,</hi> and many other Places, the Great <hi>Families</hi> are the <hi>Bullwarks</hi> of their Countrey: Having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>As to Moveables, we shall not repeat, what hath been said, Title <hi>Real Rights,</hi> of the distinction of Heritable, and Moveable Rights, whether Goods, or Moveable Debts; but shall only hold forth, what becometh of Moveable Rights, after the Owners decease. And first, if the Defunct be Married, there was thereby acommunion of Goods, betwixt the Defunct and the other Spouse, which being disolved by Death, the surviver may withdraw their share, which share is estimate by the condition of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie at that time; for if in the Family there were a Husband, a Wife and Children, not <hi>forisfamiliat,</hi> the Wife her share is the third; but if there were no Children <hi>unforisfamiliat,</hi> the Wifes share is the half, which is not properly a Succession but a Division.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. The first degree of Succession, in Moveables with us, is by the will of the Defunct, by his Testament, or <hi>Codicil,</hi> whereby the Defunct may name Executors, and dispose of his Moveables, either in part by particular Legacies, or in whole, by an universal Legacie, whereby, in effect the universal Legatar is institute Heir in the Moveables, and if the Executor nominat, be not also universal Legatar, he hath but one office, and is not Heir for himself, but in name, and to the behove of the Legatar, and hath but <hi>fidei-comissum</hi> of the Moveables.</p>
                     <p>These Legacies, whether Particular or Universal, doth immediately trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Right to the Legatars, and their Successors: The Solemnities of Testaments, or Legacies are very plain with us, but we shall leave them to the Title <hi>Executrie.</hi>

Whereby Bands, bearing Annualrent, which before in all respects, were Heritable, by the Destination of the Annualrent, (Which, being perfected by Infeftment, is an Immoveable, and Heritable Right) are declared to fall under Executrie, and so to be Moveable. And yet by the said Statute, the Relict, and Fisk, are Excluded. The Reason exprest in the Statute, is, because the Obliegment upon the Debitor, to pay Annualrent, is, for the Profit of the Creditor; and not a Destination of Infeftment of Annualrent, in Favours of the Heir, to exclude the Bairns: And therefore such Clauses make not such Sums Heritable, as to the Bairns, and nearest of Kin: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they bear an Obliegment to Infeft the Creditor in Land, or Annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: In which case, they are properly Heritable, and belong only to the Heir; but if not, the same belongs to the Bairns, and nearest of Kin, <hi>Excludendo Fiscum &amp; Relictam:</hi> Whereby there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Another in the Testament, of Bands bearing Annualrent, which if their be Bairns, is Devisible in two parts whereof the one half is the Bairns part, and the other half the Deads part, and the Relict hath no part, being Excluded. So that in case of Escheat, such Sums are not Moveable, nor fall not under Escheat.</p>
                     <p>Yet, if such Debts become Simply Moveable, by a Requisition or Charge, or by the Death of the Debitor, or Creditor, before the Term of Payment of Annualrent: Or, otherways they remain in the Ancient Condition. And the Statute doth not Exclude the Fisk and Relict. But where a Charge could not be given through the Debitor, or Creditors Death, and there was no Requisition provided, and Decreet for Payment, was not found to make the samine Meveable, as it would have been, if the Band had been He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, by a Clause of Infeftment. And that because, by a Posterior Band of Corroboration, for the same Sum, Executors were Excluded, which no Charge nor Requisition doth alter; but it is still presumed, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitor would re-imploy the Sum, in the same way, to his Heirs, Excluding Executors. And therefore, a Process and Decreet for payment, was not found to make it Moveable, though these would make it Moveable, as well as a Requisition or Charge, if it had been Heritable, by a Clause of Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>July</hi> 12. 1676. <hi>Crystie</hi> contra <hi>Crystie.</hi>

That such Bands, bearing Clauses of Annualrent, may be Exhausted by the Debts, due by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct, bearing Clause of Annualrent. 2. It is Consequent, that the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, will get no Relief against the Heir, of Debts, bearing Clause of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nualrent, without Clause of Infeftment; in so far, as there are such Debts in the Executry, but the Heir will have relief thereof, against the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:109710:306"/>
Executor. 3. It followeth, that Debts, bearing Clause of Annualrent, and no Clause of Infeftment, will not Exhaust the Relicts part; Because, as she is Excluded from any Share of such Debts, due to her Husband; So she must be free of any such Debts due by him, as was found, <hi>December</hi> 23. 1668. <hi>Magaret Mckenzie</hi> contra <hi>Robertsons.</hi>

                     <p n="25">25. Succession, in Immoveable, and Heritables Rights, proceed wholly in a different manner. For Succession, in Moveables, is more near to the Course of Natural Succession, and to the Civil Law of the <hi>Romans,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally their Ancient and Midle Law; but the Sccession in Heritable Rights, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth more to the Recent Feudal Customs, of most <hi>Nations,</hi> whereby <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeniture</hi> is established, for the Honour and Preservation of Noble Families, and in them, for the good and safetie of their Kings and Countryes.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. Succession, in Immoveables and Heritables, do mainly differ, First, that in Moveables, the expresse will of the Defunct, by his Testament and Legacies, and Donations, in Contemplation of Death, have the first place, but in Heritable Rights, they have no place at all; Yea, no Personal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, or Obliegment of the Fiar, can have any effect in prejudice of his Heir, to take from him any part of the Heritage, directly or indirectly, by Legal Pursuits thereupon, if the foresaid Personal Right, or Contract was done in <hi>lecto aegretudinis</hi> upon the Fiars Death-bed: And though the same Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Contract, were made in the Fiars Health, or <hi>Liege pouste,</hi> it doth not alter the Succession, unless it be in the <hi>investiture,</hi> though, as being of it self, or having in it <hi>virtuallie,</hi> a Personal Obligation, it may by Process com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the Fiar or his Heir, to denude themselves, and to obtain new Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, conform thereto, as if by Contract, any partie may be provided, to be the Contracters Heir, in whole, or in part; his provision doth not make that partie Heir, in any Right, whereupon Infeftment hath followed, which only properly are Heritable Rights: Neither can that partie be served Heir of provision, to the Contracter thereupon, yet the Contracter may be compelled to take his Right accordingly to himself: And these Heirs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, which if he have not done, his other Heirs may be compelled to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to denude themselves, in favours of that partie provided to be Heir, conform to the Contract; but Dispositions, Obligations, or Contracts of any Heritable Right, on Death-bed, are <hi>null,</hi> and reduceable, in so far as may prejudge the Heir.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. The priviledge of Heirs, not being prejudged, by their Predicessors Deeds, done on Death-bed, is, as most of our Laws, by Ancient Custom, time out of mind, and not by statute, or written Law, for, though the Books, called <hi>Regiam Majestatem,</hi> treat thereof, yet these are no part of our Law, but have been compylled by some Stranger, who hath not fully known our Law, but by mistake, hath resolved most Cases, by the Customs of other Nations, especially of <hi>England.</hi> The reason of this Custom, may be conjectured not only from the Nature of Feudal Rights not disposable by Testament, but only by <hi>investiture,</hi> but also for publick utility, because persons on Death-bed are weak, the mind being easily affected with the trouble of the bodie, and so is easie to be wrought upon by insinuations, or importunities, to do deeds contrary their Interest, and former Resolutions, Especially by the <hi>Popish Clergie,</hi> who, having, for their own corrupt ends, Forged <hi>Puragatory,</hi> and Prayers for the Dead, their power of Indulgence,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:109710:306"/>
and Prayers for the Dead, their power of Indulgence and Pardon of Sins, did thereby deceive the Christian World, and obtained upon Death-bed so large Donations to their <hi>Clergie,</hi> to the prejudice of the Donators lawfull Heirs which therefore Our Ancient Custom hath wisely provided against.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. The main Difficulty is, in what cases the Law accounteth Parties to be on Death-Bed, or when they are in Health, and <hi>Liege poustie,</hi> for these are the two opposite Terms of Law, <hi>Liege poustie</hi> or Death-bed; for clearing whereof, these Points must be considered. First whether it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessar to Prove that the Defunct before the Deed in question, had contracted disease, or become sick, and whether it be necessar to condescend and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the speciall kind of Sickness, or that it was <hi>Morbus Sonticus,</hi> or a disease affecting the whole Bodie and Brain, or if the keeping the House, and the Parties Dying before he went abroad, be sufficient to infer Presumptive, that he had Contracted the disease whereof he Dyed, so soon as he keeped the house. 2.

                     <p>Death-bed is of so great Importance with us, as reaching the Estate, and Heritage of Parties, that the Lords have been very careful for clearing and fixing the same, that it may not be under uncertain conjecture or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and whereas by an ordinar Act of Litiscontestation, the Pursuer might prove his reason of Death-bed, by any two Habile Witnesses, or the Defender might in the same manner prove, the going Abroad to <hi>Kirk</hi> and <hi>Mercat,</hi> or Acts equivalent in Defence, or the Persuer might prove Suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, by way of reply, and all by any two Habile witnesses: The Lords have
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:109710:307"/>
taken a farr more secure sway, to allow probation to be Adduced for either Party, concerning the condition of the Defunct, as to Sickness or Health, and concerning his going abroad thereafter, and the manner thereof, whereby neither Partie hath the choise of the Witnesses, to be in a Capacity to influence them, but either Partie adducing Witnesses, there is scarce any one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examined, who knew any thing of the Matter, and so the Truth comes to clear and evident Light, and which probation stands in place of Litiscontesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for albeit it bear to be before Answer to the Relevancie, and that after the probation is closed, they are permitted to resume the Debate, as to the Relevancie, as to such Points as they desire chiefly to be noticed, and wherein they do believe, that sufficient Probation is adduced; which probation is closed, and may not particularly be debated upon, how farr any point is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which is only proper to the Lords, to consider with closs <hi>Doors</hi> yet, no new Litiscontestation can be made, or any new Fact admitted to be proven, after the Probation, before Answer is concluded and advised, or renounced, unless the Lords, <hi>ex officio &amp; proprio motu,</hi> for clearing of any part of the probation that remains Dubrous, require further, as they may do at the advising of any cause, even upon Litiscontestation; as was found upon <hi>Decem.</hi> 5, and 6. 1672. <hi>Clellands contra Clelland,</hi> of <hi>Falskin.</hi>

                     <p>To come then to the Points proposed to be cleared, for the first Point, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keeping the House presumeth Sickness contracted, or if Sickness must be proven, and what kind of Sickness. Albeit, the ordinar Stile of the reason of Reduction bear, thatbefore the Deed in question, the Defunct contracted the Mortall Disease, whereof he Died; yet it is not necessar to alledge or instruct, that it was <hi>Morbus sonticus, January</hi> 7. 1624. <hi>Schaw contra Gray.</hi> Neither that the Defunct was Bed-fast when the Deed was done, <hi>Feb.</hi> 1. 1622. <hi>Robertson contra Fleeming.</hi> And albeit, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of the contracting of Sickness, from his keeping ofthe House, be not alwayes sufficient alone, yet it is of great Importance, and a small probation of Sickness with it, will suffice; otherways, it were easie to keep all access from the Defunct of indifferent Persons, that might prove his Condition, and none be admitted, but Contrivers, and Concurrers in the Deed: And therefore a Deed done be a Man inclosed for the <hi>Plague,</hi> was found reduceable as done on Death-bed, as being done after the Defunct was inclosed on suspition of the <hi>Plague;</hi> and Dying before he came out, without necessity to prove he was Sick or Infected when, theDeed was done, seing there was no further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess for fuller Probation, <hi>February</hi> 23. 1665. <hi>Jack contra Pollock</hi> and <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord.</hi> This Presumption doth withstand a far stranger opposite probation of Health, when the Defunct went not abroad as was found in the said ease, <hi>Robertson contra Fleeming.</hi> That it was not Relevant to eleid Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, that the Defunct was in Strength and Ability, to have come to <hi>Kirk</hi> and <hi>Marcat,</hi> nor that the Defunct put on his Cloaths daily, and that any Disease he had was but Lent, and not <hi>Impedimentum rebus agendis;</hi> as was found in the said case, <hi>Schaw contra Gray.</hi> Neither that the Defunct lived a year and a half after the Deed in question, and was only hindered to come abroad by a <hi>Palsie,</hi> which troubled his walking, and made him not come abroad; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he did all his Affairs within <hi>Doors,</hi> as formerly, <hi>July</hi> 1. 1637. <hi>Cranston Riddell contra Richardson.</hi> And albeit, there be remembered a case of a Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition made be <hi>David Graham</hi> Merchant in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> for a Pious use to the <hi>

                        </hi> that his having on his Cloath the Contriving and Writing the whole Disposition himself, was sufficient to eleid Death-bed and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct Health; yet the Circumstances of that case are not fully known, not
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:109710:307"/>
being observed by any of the Lords, and the Decision hath ever been decryed since. But in the case of the creditors of the Lord <hi>Balmerino,</hi> against the Lady <hi>Couper,</hi> for reducing of the Disposition of his Estate to her, which was Decyded <hi>June</hi> 25. 1671. It was not found Relevant to instruct <hi>Liege poustie,</hi> that after the Disposition, my Lord made Bargains and Counts, seemed to be Merry and Laughed, keeped on his <hi>Cloaths,</hi> kept the <hi>Table,</hi> came from his <hi>Chamber</hi> to the <hi>Hall, Whisled</hi> to himself, and <hi>Danced,</hi> Albeit, no particular Disease, but only Sickness was proven. And in the foresaid case, <hi>Clelland contra Clelland,</hi> Health was not found proven, albeit, soundness of Judgement and Memory was proven: And that the Defunct did not only all his own affairs, but Trysted for others, and that he lived two years and a half, after the Disposition, and was in like condition, as he had been seven year before; so that it seems, that if the contracting of Sickness be proven, no contrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of any Acts within doors, will be sufficient to eleid the Reason of Death-bed; By all with decisions, the second Point proposed is sufficiently cleared.</p>
                     <p>As to the third Point proposed, whether Sickness being proven once Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, the Countinance thereof till Death must be proven. It is commonly held that if it be proven Sickness was contracted, and that Death follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>probatis extremis presumuntur media;</hi> And Sickness once being proven is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to continue, otherways it were scarce possible by a positive Probation to instruct the Continuance of the Sickness till Death, and this is only <hi>Presumptio juris:</hi> Laying the Burden of probation upon the Party that alledges Conva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescence.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Point for proving <hi>Liege poustie,</hi> either that there was no Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, or by Convalescence, if there had been a Desease; by going freely to <hi>Kirk</hi> and <hi>Mercat</hi> unsupported, is the ordinar and unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able defence against Death-bed, upon which Law and Custom hath pitched, as the most publick, and sure evidence of Health andConvalescence: So that albeit, the going to <hi>Kirk</hi> and <hi>Mercat,</hi> were but of design to Validat theDeed, yet if the attempt, be perfectly made out, it would be sufficient; and much more will be allowed, when the going abroad is Principally to hear Sermon or for Devotion, or about affairs to the <hi>Mercat:</hi> In which case, taking the Party by the Hand, or helping him at a ragged <hi>Ground,</hi> would not inferr Supportation, there being no design of Cautiousness in the Partie, but useing his ordinar way; as if a Gentlewoman accustomed to by led be the hand, should go so led to the <hi>Kirk</hi> or <hi>Mercat:</hi> By reiterated Acts it might be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for inferring Health or Convalescence, but if it did appear to be upon design, she behoved to forbear the prerogatives of herQuality, and go free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alone without being led, or if an old man, infirm by age, or any defect in his <hi>Legs</hi> or <hi>Feet,</hi> not arising from inward Sickness, should be helped in difficult places, in reiterated Acts in going to <hi>Kirk</hi> and <hi>Mercat:</hi> without design. And as to that qualification, whether it be sufficient to go the <hi>Kirk</hi> or <hi>Mercat</hi> Place, or at the Congregation orGathering at the <hi>Mercat,</hi> I have not observed it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly debated or decided, but that Parties when they went to the <hi>Kirk,</hi> ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narly went to the Prayers, and certainly it is the most secure way, that the going be to the Congregation, or Meeting at the <hi>Mercat,</hi> otherwayes pick't out wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, may be Chosen to wait upon the Party to the <hi>Kirk</hi> or <hi>Mercat-place,</hi> which in many cases will be very private, and will not expose the Party to publick View.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="tcp:109710:308"/>The fifth point concerning Supportation, is the ordinary reply against go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad, and as hath been said, it is ever to be considered, whether the Act appear to be of design or not, and that if the Acts be reiterat, and of course nothing that was ordinar for the Defunct in taking of help, when he was in unquestionable Health, will import Supportation; and therefore in the case, <hi>Pargilleis contra Pargilleis,</hi> decided <hi>Febr.</hi> 26. 1669. It having been proven that the Defunct was a very old Man, and that after the Disposition quarelled, he had severall times come to <hi>Calder,</hi> and <hi>done</hi> Affaires there: And that he went up from the <hi>Merca-place,</hi> in the <hi>Mercat</hi> time, to the place of <hi>Calder,</hi> being a Steep way, borrowed <hi>Money</hi> from the Lord <hi>Torphichen,</hi> told and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the same, which was found sufficient; Albeit, he was helped up <hi>Stairs,</hi> and down <hi>Stairs:</hi> and was helped to his <hi>Horse,</hi> and from his <hi>Horse,</hi> and his Man led his <hi>Bridle,</hi> and that he had a <hi>Staffe</hi> in his hand.</p>
                     <p>But when the going to <hi>Kirk</hi> and <hi>Mercat,</hi> is upon design, the least defect in the exact Performance will render it Inefectuall, and so in the case of the Disposition made by the Lord <hi>Couper,</hi> it having been evident that it was, of design to Validat the Disposition, that the next day after the Disposition, my Lord went to the <hi>Mercat</hi> at <hi>Couper,</hi> the laying hisHand upon <hi>Thomas Ogil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi> Hand, who walked by him, and that only at someimes, and in <hi>Ragged</hi> places where he was accustomed to take any walking by him, by the Hand before: Yet seeing he put nature to the outmost reach, to manifest Health by that Act, and could not fully perform it, it was not found Sufficient; but he was found to be Supported, and in the case, <hi>Clellands contra Clelland</hi> of <hi>Faskin,</hi> the Defunct finding that his Disposition was quarrelld and stopped at the <hi>Exchequer:</hi> As being done in <hi>Lecto;</hi> Immediatly after he caused make a <hi>Chair,</hi> with a Fixed <hi>

                        </hi> to bear his <hi>Feet,</hi> in which he was carried with Men till he came within two pair or thereby to the <hi>Kirk,</hi> and thence he walked to the <hi>Kirk,</hi> but there was no Congregation: And returned back to the <hi>Chair,</hi> and so was carried Home, and the Witnesses that were about him, being examined, whether he Walked freely, or with help, many deponed that severall Persons having walked close about him, they could not Distinctly know; and severall Witnesses having Deponed, that he Walked Freely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Help, and two having Deponed that he was Helped by themselves, his so going Abroad was not found Sufficient, neither was his being carried in the <hi>Chair</hi> found equivalent, as if he had Ridden upon his <hi>Horse;</hi> because a Sick-man might have required help even upon <hi>Horse-back,</hi> and would not have been able to have Ridden Freely without Help, and yet might have been Able to sit in a <hi>Chair:</hi> In this case a lso it was found that Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation was more positively Proven; Albeit, be fewer Witnesses: The Witnesses themselves being Supporters.</p>
                     <p>As to the sixth point proposed, whether going to Kirk and Mercat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supported, inferreth Health, or Convalescence, <hi>presumptione juris, &amp; de jure,</hi> So that a contrary Probation, that even then he was Sick, and so continued tiil IDeath, hath not yet been destinctly decided: Albeit, in <hi>Pargilleis</hi> case, it was not regarded, that the Witnesses deponed, that <hi>Pargilleis,</hi> when he came to the Mercat, appeared Sick, and continued Sick thereafter; Neither can any Conjectural Probation, in such case be Respected; Because <hi>Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor morbi,</hi> doth ordainarily remain, afterConvalescence, which, if it were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, would render that Defence uncertain, and conjectural; So that there can be no question, unlesse the Probation of the being then Sick, were <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:109710:308"/>
and <hi>pregnant,</hi> as if a Person in a hot Fever, wherein there is ordinarily strength enough, should come abroad to a Mercat, the Foam, and Furie of the Fever continuing in his Face, or if the Partie did Groan, and Bemoan himself, as Sick Persons use to do.</p>
                     <p>For the last point offered to consideration, whether <hi>Convalescence,</hi> can be proven otherways, then by going un-supported to Kirk and Mercat. I have seen no decision, whereby Death-bed hath been <hi>elided,</hi> upon such equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Acts; But on the contrare, it was found, in the Case of the Lord <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> that his coming to a Green, near his House un-supported, and stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, till he saw men play at Foot-ball, was not sufficient: And in <hi>Coupers</hi> case, his coming frequently with Strangers to their Horse, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times going up and down Stairs un-supported, and oftimes going out, and walking in his Garden, and once to a House, a quarter of a myle off, and all un-supported, were not found equivalent, to going un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supported to Kirk and Mercat. And in <hi>Clellands</hi> Case, his going several times to his Barn, and to some Trees, a pair from his Gate un-supported, were not found equivalent to going to Kirk and Mercat. Yet it cannot be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but there may be <hi>Acts</hi> equivalent: As if any Person should go a far Journey, but the equivalence must not stand in this, that the Defunct did Acts, requiring as much strengh, as going to Kirk and Mercat. In respect of this Difference, that going to Kirk and Mercat, exposes the Partie to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick view: Whereas other private Acts about his House, may be proven by a few Persons, prompted for that purpose: Which probation cannot be ballanced with any other; for clearing, that there was support, or help, as in the Case of going to Kirk or Mercat, or going a long Journey, where they may be had many un-prepossessed Witnesses.</p>
                     <p>Death-bed was not found <hi>elided,</hi> by ryding on Horse-back, a Journey, of about sixteen myles, Seing the party had a man, who rode behind him, and for some part of the way, was tyed to the man, which was found to be Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation.

                     <p>Heirs of Tailzie are also called Heirs of Provision, which terms are Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parat, both comprehending all Heirs, which are not according to the Line or Course of Law; and among others, Heirs <hi>Male,</hi> and Heirs of Marriage: Yet our Stile doth ordinarily distinguish them so, that where there is no alteration from the Lineall Heirs <hi>Male,</hi> and where there are severall Substitutions of certain Persons, or Lines, failling others by the tenor of the Infeftment, they are Specially called Heirs of Tailzie; but when there is an Alteration of the Lineal Succession, yet not Simply to Heirs <hi>Male,</hi> nor to divers Members of Tailzie they retain the common Name of Heirs, of Provision, as is most ordinar by Contracts of Marriage, providing Lands to the Heirs of the Marriage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Heirs Lawfully Procreat betwixt the Married Persons whether <hi>Male</hi> or <hi>Female</hi> do succeed; So that Daughters of that Marriage will exclude Sons of another Marriage, or Heirs of the Bodie of the Members of the Tailzie, whereby there Collateralls, or Ascendants are excluded: And in proper Tailzies, there are always divers Lines and Persons, <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female,</hi> substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute as Members of the Tailzie, as when Infeftment beareth Lands to be granted to the Fiar, and to the Heirs of his Body, or to the Heirs <hi>Male</hi> of his Body, or to his Heirs of such a Marriage, which Failling to such an other Person Named, and to the Heirs of his Body, or to the Heirs <hi>Male</hi> of his Body, &amp;c.

So then, all Succession with Us, is either of Heirs of Line, <hi>Male,</hi> Tailzie or Provision, Heirs of Line are also called Heirs General, so also are Heirs <hi>Male,</hi> and of Conquest, and these may be served Heirs by a generall Service: But other Heirs of Tailzie or Provision, by Investiture, cannot be served Heirs, but by a Speciall Service, serving them to such Particulars, whereunto they Succeed, by Infeftment or Provision; Heirs of Line are also Called Heirs whatsomever, because they are absolute without Limitation, and in all cases where Heirs whatsomever, is not specially altered by the Infeftment rights follow the Lineall Succession, as among Heirs <hi>Male,</hi> the same course taketh Preference, except that <hi>Female</hi> Heirs are excluded, as that first Descendents, then Brothers, &amp;c. do Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and Amongst Heirs of Marriages, the Eldest Son doth exclude the rest, and so in the Members of Tailzies.</p>
                     <p>We shall not need here to debate the Lawfulness, or Expediency of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting Heirs <hi>Male,</hi> or of Tailzie, or of Provision; having now cleared, that the first Ground and Rule in Equity, is the Will of the Propriatar, though he be Personally Oblieged to provide Competently for his own, especially those of his Family; And therefore, though severall of our <hi>KINGS,</hi> in their generall Revocations, have Revocked Tailzies, it can inferr no more, but a Scruple in them, and a Preserving of their Power, against the course of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription: But doth not infringe such Rights being Lawful in themselves. The Expediency of Tailzies, is the same with <hi>Primo. geniture,</hi> to preserve the memory, and Dignitie of Families: But as <hi>Primo-geniture,</hi> for that end, excludeth <hi>Females</hi> of nearest Degree, Heirs <hi>Male</hi> excludeth them Simply and Heirs of Tailzie, have had their Rise from Dissatisfaction, with some of the Fiars Race, or preference of them, otherwayes then by the Propinqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Blood; Some have also Tailzied their Lands, so as by Infeftments, to Introduce a <hi>Primo-geniture</hi> among Familyes, as the Law hath done among <hi>Males;</hi> as if the Land were granted to the Fiar, and the Heirs <hi>Male</hi> of his Bodie, which Failling, to the Eldest Heir <hi>Female</hi> of the Bodie, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, and their Heirs carrying the Arms, and Name of the Family: The intent of these Heirs of Provision, is also to preserve the Unity and memorie of the Family.</p>
                     <p>To come now to the Heirs of Line, the Law hath ordred them thus; first the Eldest lawfull Son, and his Descendents in order, by Right of <hi>Primo-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> excludeth all other Descendents, <hi>Male</hi> or <hi>Female;</hi> Failling Sons, the Daughters, and their Descendents do all succeed Equally, except in Rights Indivisible, which fall to the Eldest; Failling Desendents, the next Degree is of the next immediat Brother German, and his Descendents, and among Middle Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern, the immediat Elder Brother succeedeth in Conquest, whereunto the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:109710:311"/>
did not, nor could not succeed as Heir, but in all others, the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Younger Brother succeedeth, and therefore is called the Heir of Line; and the other the Heir of Conquest: If the Fiar be a Woman, her Brother German excludeth Sisters German, and of her Brothers, the immediate Elder Brother succeedeth inConquest, and the immediat Younger in heritage; Failing, Brothers German, Sisters German, and their Descendents exclude both Brethren and Sisters, by the Fathers side only, <hi>June ult.</hi> 1629. Mr. <hi>Robert Cuningham contra Multray.</hi> Failling Brothers, or Sisters German, Brothers by the Fathers side, succeed to the Defunct, whether <hi>Male</hi> or <hi>Female,</hi> the immediat Elder in Conquest, and the immediat Younger in Heritage. Failing all Brothers and Sisters, the Father or other <hi>Masculine</hi> Ascendent of his Line, succeed to the Defunct, whether <hi>Male</hi> or <hi>Female,</hi> and exclude the Brothers, or Sisters of that Ascendent, as a Grand-grandfather excludes his Brethren: Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Brethren to the Defunct: Failling Ascendents, the Fathers Brothers, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Sisters, and their Descendents, succeed in all points as Brothers and Sisters, the double Blood excluding the single Blood, and the immediat Elder Brother succeeding in Conquest, and the immediat Younger in heritage, and all Failling the Grandfather; and Failling him, his Brothers and Sisters the same way: And so upward, till there can be any Propinquity of Blood proven, which all Failling, the King taketh place as Last Heir.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. In this Line of Succession, observe, First, that there is no place for Adopted Children, or their Issue, but only for the Naturall Issue of the Vassal; Which cannot be changed by a Voluntar Act of Adoption, without consent of the Superior, in the Investiture, neither is Adoption in use with us in any case. 2. These Naturall Heirs, must also be Lawfull, whereby Bastards are excluded; who are such, appeareth by the former Title. 3. There is no place for Cognats, as to the Mother, Grandmother, or other Feminine Ascendent, or these of their side, but only to Agnats conjoined by the Father, Grandfather, &amp;c. Which holdeth, even though the heritage descended from the Mother, or these of her side, for in the service of Heirs, the nearest lawfull Heirs are only inquired, and retoured either by the Lineall Succession aforesaid, or by express Tailzie, or provision in the Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without respect from whence the Inheritance flowed; for which we have no Satute nor Custom; But in <hi>England,</hi> it is otherwayes for <hi>Paterna paternis,</hi> and <hi>Materna Maternis</hi> takes place, but with us the contrare was found in the case of <hi>John Gilbert,</hi> as <hi>Craig</hi> observeth, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Dieg</hi> 17. And he there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth that many afterward changed their opinion therein, and though there be equity in it, yet no Law nor Practique since, hath favoured the Maternal Line, but the Father was found Heir to his Son, even in the Lands where the Son was Infeft, as Heir to his Mother, and did exclude his Brother <hi>Uterin,</hi> by that Mother, <hi>February</hi> 5. 1663. <hi>Lenox contra Lintoun.</hi> 4. In all this Line of Succession, there is place for Representation of Descendents, in place of their Defunct Parents: So that <hi>Females</hi> of a further degree, by the Right ofrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation, exclude <hi>Males</hi> of a nearer degree, as the eldest Sons Daughter will be preferred in theGrandfathers Inheritance, to his other Sons in private Rights, though that be contraverse, by the more comon Feudall Customs, as is largely and learnedly dispute by <hi>Tiraquellus.</hi>

                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:109710:311"/>35. In this Lineall Succession, the Father, Grandfather, or other Ascendents of the Paternall Line, succeed in heritable Right, next unto Brothers and Sisters, and before all other Collateralls, or Agnats. We have shown before, why, there is no mention of Ascendents in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Succession, because such a case could hardly occurr among them. <hi>Craig, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Deig.</hi> 13. affirmeth that it was doubtfull in his time, whether Ascendants could succeed in heritable Rights, and that he heard the opinion of some learned men in the contrary, and that he had not found the Lords decide in it, and that it is contrare to the Feudal Law, and also to his own opinion; yet he brings both evident reason and example in the contrary, the reason is, that no Inquest can justly Retoure, that the Father Brother, is nearer then the Father: He bringeth also the Example of the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> served Heir in the Earldom of <hi>Angus,</hi> to his ownSon, whom he had infeft therein: And the Lord <hi>Colvill</hi> in likemanner, having infeft his Son in all his estate, though sum affirmed that this was by provision, in the infeftment; yet that the Service was, is sure, but that provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is uncertain, and though some also were doubtful, whether the Earl of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> was served, and infeft as Heir to that same Son, which well inferreth that the Father was not infeft as Heir to his Son, but not that he was not served Heir to him therein, for he might have been served, and not infeft; Whereby, the service as incompleat, became void, and the next Earl behoved to serve of new to the Son, who died last vest, and seased as of Fee: The Custom. and common opinion since, is for the Ascendants, and so the Earl of <hi>Roxburgh</hi> was served as Heir <hi>Male</hi> to his Son; The Lord <hi>Ker,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which ought to be the more favoured, as more conform to equity, and the Law of nature, which in <hi>Dubio</hi> ought to take place, where there is no Law, nor custom to the contrary, as with us there is none; Neither did I ever hear of one who attempted to exclude a father, by the Fathers Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terails: And though there had been no Decision upon it, neither have there been upon many other uncontroverted Customs, especially in Succession, but the acquiescence of all Parties, having interest in matters of so great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a strong Evidence of the Nationall consent by Custom: But it hath aho been so decided by the Lords, <hi>Hope,</hi> Succession, Mr. <hi>Robert Burnet contra Mauld;</hi> Yea a Son, being infeft as Heir to hisMother dying without Issue, his Brother uterin by the Mother was not found Heir to him, but his Father, <hi>February</hi> 5. 1663. <hi>Lenox contra Lintoun.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the alledged opposition of the Feudall Law, as hath been oft times said, it is Local; And therefore, as in <hi>England,</hi> all Ascendents are excluded, so in <hi>Germany</hi> they succeed in the next place after descendents, and are prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Brothers and sisters, according to theNaturall course ofSuccession. The reason why Brothers and Sisters of the Defunct, are preferred to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with us, may be, because such Fees do commonly proceed from the Father: And therefore by the continuance of that sameFatherly affection, are derived to the Brothers and Sisters, and because they are in more need of Provision then the Father.</p>

                     <p n="15">15. There is a case occurreth oft-times amongst heirs Portioners, when Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Obligations, and Provisions are granted in their Favours by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct, whereby, after his Decease, they become mutual Debitors, and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors; and sometimes these Provisions exceed the Estate, <hi>quid juris,</hi> whether do these Obligations evanish, and become extinct <hi>confusione;</hi> because the same Persons become Debitors and Creditors; or whether they do all stand, and in that Case, whether the first in Order will be preferred, or, if they all will be abated proportionally, to the value of the heritage. Thus <hi>Maitland</hi> observes, <hi>December</hi> 20. 1550. That a Father Infeft himself, and the heirs of the first Marriage, and thereafter resigned, and Infeft himself, and the heirs Male of the second Marriage, which failling his nearest heirs whatsomever, these heirs Male the second Marriage failled: And therefore, not the Daughter of the first Marriage only, but she, and the Daughters of a third Marriage Succeeded, by the second Infeftment, as his heirs whatsomever, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute to be his heirs of the second Marriage. <hi>Craig</hi> hath the Case, but otherways observed, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>dieg.</hi> 14. Where a person had provided his Lands to the heirs of three several Marriages; of each whereof there survived a Daughter: The question was, which of the Daughters should succeed? Whether the first, as having the first Provision, or the last having the last Provision: The parties were three Sisters, <hi>Aikmans.</hi> In which the Lords admitted all the three Sisters as heirs Portioners, and so confounded the Provisions, being all equal; and about the same thing, which must be the Reason, and not that which is there rendered. Because the Defunct, notwithstanding of these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, in Favours of heirs might have Disponed effectual, to a Stranger: And so likewise to his own Children of another Marriage; For that Reason would have excluded the Daughters of the first Marriage, and preferred the Daughter of the last Marriage. And as hath been shown, Tailzies of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, upon an anticedent, <hi>onerous obligation;</hi> Such as is Marriage, hinder the Fiar to dispone, or provide the same to his heirs of Lyne, representing him sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, and must fulfil his Obliegment; Albeit his Disposition to Strangers, not so representing him, will be effectual: And therefore, <hi>Craig</hi> in that same place observeth, in the case of <hi>Isobel Barron,</hi> who being heir to her Father of his first Marriage, by which it was provided, that the heirs of the Marriage should Succeed to all Lands conquest during the Marriage: And thereafter, having a Son of the second Marriage, who was his Fathers heir of Lyne, to whom his Father Disponed, or provided a Tenement acquired, during the first Marriage; Yet the said <hi>Isobel,</hi> as heir of that Marriage, recovered that Tenement from her Brother, as heir of Lyne. But the main difficultie remaineth, when the obliegment in favours of the heirs portioners are un-equal for when they are equal, whether they become extinct by confusion, or not, it is alike: But if they be so extinct, when they are un-equal, there will not be
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:109710:318"/>
an equal suffering, or abatement; but the greatest obliegment will be extinct, as well as the least: Neither can such obligations be wholly extinct, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, but only <hi>pro rata.</hi> So that if there be three heirs Portioners, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the obliegment granted to every one of them, can only be extinct for a thirdpart, because they are but heirs in a third part, and as to two third parts, each two of them are debitors to the third: And if the obligation exceed the value of the heritage, such of them as find themselves losers, if they enter heirs, may abstain, and renounce, and they, or their Assigneys, may pursue any of the rest that shal enter, for fulfilling of the Defuncts obliegments, but if they be considerat, when all the obligations joyntly exceed the value of the Estate, they will all Renounce, and Assigne there obliegments, and their Assigneys will be preferred, according to their dilignece, without considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the priority, or posteriority of the obliegments; but if they happen to enter, or when their provisions are not Personal to themselves, <hi>nominatim,</hi> but as they are heirs of Provision; and therefore necessarily require, that they must be heirs, before they can obtain their Provisions, then the obliegments or Provisions of each Portioner are extinct, as to their own proportion; but they have like Action against the others heirs portioners, for there proportion, as other Creditors have, the point will be clear by example; if three Sisters were provided by the Father, to un-equal Portions. The first to 15000. Merks, the second to 12000. Merks, the third to 6000. Merks. and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functs whole Estate, had only been worth 18000. Merks. All of them enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the case would be thus: The eldest would succeed to 6000. Merks of the heritage for her part, and the second would be lyable to her for 5000. Merks, as the third of the her provision, to whom she would also be lyable, for 4000. Merks, as the third of the seconds Provision, which being compensed, the second would be lyable to the first in an 1000. Merks, <hi>dc claro.</hi> In like manner, the first would be lyable to the third in 2000. Merks, and the third would be lyable to the first, in 5000. Merks, which being ballanced, the third would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitor <hi>de claro,</hi> to the first, in 3000. Merks. So the Interest of the first would be 6000. Merks, as her own portion: and one out of the Second, and Three out of the Thirds Portion, being in all a 10000. The second falleth 6000. as her share, out of which she is lyable in 1000. Merks, to the eldest and the youngest is due to her, <hi>de claro,</hi> 2000. Merks, whereby her interest will be 7000. Merks, the youngest Portion will be 6000. Merks, out of which she is due to the eldest, 3000. Merks, and to the second 2000. So there will remain only free to her 1000. Merks, This may clear the case as to liquid Sums, and as to Dispositions, or Provisions of Lands, or other obliegments in <hi>facto.</hi> These, or the Interest, or Value, will be the same way effectual, amongst the Heirs Portioners, as if they had been made to Strangers; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, where the same Disposition, or Provision is made to divers of them: For then either being equally oblieged to others, as representing the Defunct, the same become void, and in-effectual, <hi>protanto.</hi> As was found in the case of the Sisters <hi>Aikmans:</hi> But since the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> 1621. against frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent Dispositions, the first Disposition, or Provision, constituting, that Party Creditor may give ground to Reduce a <hi>posterior</hi> Disposition of the same thing, to another of the Heirs Portioners, as being without a Cause <hi>onerous,</hi> after contractiong of the first debt, but that will not hold in Bands, for Sums of Money, all which will have their effect, as is before said.

And it was found, that an Assigny might insist upon a Charge at the Cedents instance, after the Cedents death, though nothing followed thereupon during his life, <hi>June</hi> 18. 1631.

                     <p n="23">23. A special Charge to enter Heir, differeth from the general Charge in this, That the general Charge is in lieu of the general Service: for thereby the Creditor reacheth the Person of the apparant heir of his Debitor, and his Estate or Goods established in his person, unless he renounce: and so the general Charge is the ground of Process and Decreet for Payment. But thereby the Creditor cannot reach the Lands and Annualrents, which are not as yet esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the Person of the apparant heir, he not being specially served there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or infeft therein. And therefore, that the Creditor may reach these, he must use a special Charge, which supplieth the special Service and Eutry.</p>
                     <p>This special Charge, though it proceedeth upon Supplication without Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, yet it must be upon production of a Decreet at the Creditors instance, not only <hi>cognitiònis causâ,</hi> but for performance. And it is competent in two Cases: First, upon the proper Debt of the Party to be charged. For if the Debitor be unentered to some of his Predecessors, and so their Rights not esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in his Person; in that Case the Creditor must charge his own Debitor specially to enter heir in the Rights competent to him by that Predecessor, with certification if he enter not, the Creditor shall have such Process and Execution against that Land and heretage to which he might enter, as if he were actually entered therein: whereupon Apprising doth proceed. In this Case there is no necessity of an antecedent general Charge, which only is used to the effect that the Debt may be established in the Person of the Debitors apparant heir <hi>passivè,</hi> by a Decreet upon the general Charge. The other Case is, when the Debt is not the proper Debt of the Party charged, but of some Predecessor to whom he may be heir: in which Case the Debt must first be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> against him <hi>passive,</hi> and then followeth the special Charge. In this Case the special Charge cannot be till after Year and day, because it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth not only the Summons, but also the Sentence upon the general Charge, both which must be after Year and Day. When the Debt is the proper Debt of the Party charged, if the special Charge may not be at any time, even within Year and Day, or if it must be after the <hi>annus deliberandi?</hi> This makes for the Negative, That it needs not abide the Year of Deliberation, because the intent of the Deliberation, is not so much whether the Party charged will be heir, as whether he will personally subject himself to the ground of that Charge, For albeit he renounce not, it will not make him ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any of the Defuncts Debts, except it be by his fraud and collusion with one Creditor in prejudice of another. And therefore seing he cannot delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, whether he will be subject to his own Debt, he ought not to have the benefite ofYear and Day before the special Charge be effectual. Yet before the late Act preferring the diligence of the Defuncts Creditors to the heirs proper Creditors, there was no reason to allow special Charges for the apparant heirs own Debt, but more summar Execution than other Charges so to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the apparent heirs proper Creditors to be Heir.</p>

The remedy against both Charges to be heir, is a Renounciation to be heir, whereby the Renouncers Person and his proper Estate, will not be ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for his Predecessors Debt, but only his Predecessors heretage. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounciation useth to be offered by way of Exception in the Process upon the general Charge: and if the Defender be not absent, it is not ordinarily admitted by Suspension, except in favour of Minors: who though being apparant heirs they take a day to Renounce and fail therein, yet they will be restor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against the same by Suspension, without Reduction, <hi>January</hi> 25. 1628. <hi>Kennedy</hi> contra <hi>Mackdougal.

                     <p>The Lords may in Cases where an ancient or important Service is required, choose the Judge most fitting for the Affair.

                     <p>The tenor of the Brieve, is by way of Precept from the King to the Judge, To enquire <hi>per probos &amp; fideles homines patriae,</hi> That such a Person died at the Faith and Peace of our Soveraign Lord: And that the user of the Brieve, is the nearest and lawful heir. So this Brieve, hath only these two heads. And thus not only Heirs of Line may be served generally, but also Heirs of Conquest, being to Succeed to Reversions, heretable Bonds, or the like Rights, not having an Infeftment, or requiring a special Service: <hi>Hope</hi> Succession, Earle of <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar's</hi> Heirs. And no doubt, Heirs Male may be served generally, that they may succeed to the like Rights which may be conceived in their Favour, and whereunto they can have no other Access.

                     <p>The general Service of Heirs being retour'd, doeth so establish Rights not having Infeftment (as Dispositions, Heretable Bonds, Reversions, Apprisings, and Adjudications) in the Person of the heir served, as that no posterior heirs can have Right thereto, unless they be served heirs to the Person last served heir, though the Right stood in the name of the firstAcquirer, and not ofthe last heir, as an heretable Bond or Reversion remaining in the name of aFather, to whom his eldest Son was served heir generally, who dying without Issue, the second Brother must be served heir to his Brother, and not to his Father there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: as was thought by all the Lords after dispute <hi>in praesentia,</hi> albeit the matter was agreed without decision. <hi>Spots.</hi> Heirs, Captain <hi>Peter Rollo</hi> contra <hi>Stewart</hi> of <hi>

And though in special Services, the heir cannot be served to him who is last served special heir, unless he had been also Infeft: the reason thereof is, because the special Service as an incompleat Right evanisheth, and the next apparant heir must be served again to the same Defunct, but it is not so in general Services.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. The Entry of Heirs to Lands or Annualrents, the Fee whereof is by Infeftment is either by consent of the Superior voluntarly, or by Law. The former is by the Superiors Precept, which from the initial words thereof, <hi>Quia

And therefore commands his Bailiff to Infeft him therein. Infeftment being past according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, giveth that Party the real Right of Lands or Annualrents if done by the light Superior. It doeth also constitute the receiver thereof Heir <hi>passivè,</hi> and makes him lyable to his Predecessors Debts: but it will not constitute or instruct him Heir <hi>activè,</hi> or give him an active Title to pursue as Heir. Yea it will not be a sufficient title as to the real Right of the Ground against any other Party, than those who acknowledge the Giver thereof to be Superior, and the Receiver to be Heir. For if upon any other colourable Title, they question any of these, the Infeftment and precept of <hi>Clare Constat</hi> will not be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent alone, unless it have obtained the benefit of a Possessory Judgment or Prescription.</p>

But in case of the Defunct's Death out of the Countrey, or if it be <hi>dubious</hi> or controverse; the testimony of Witnesses, or proper knowledge of two, at least, of the Inquest, or Testificats from abroad, especially from the Magistrats of the Place where the Defunct died, or was buried, are requisite: or common Fame, as to Persons who perish, or are killed.</p>
                     <p>The second poynt of this Head is, that the Defunct died, last vest and Seised as ofFee: which must be instructed, by production of theInfeftment, specially the Instfrument of Seising, and warrant thereof or ground of the same: For though <hi>in antiquis</hi> the very Precept cannot be shown, yet the Charter, or Disposition willbe a sufficientAdminicle, to corroberat thisSeising, that it be not accounted only as the assertion of a <hi>Natar:</hi> Yea, there is no doubt, but since the Act of Prescription, consequent Seisings having the Course of fourtie Years, may instruct this point: being sufficient even in the case of Competition, which is much exacter than this.

But there useth small notice to be taken of Rebellion upon civil Debts: but only open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of War, or upon Treasonable Causes, whereupon the Defunct was declared Fugitve; which makes the Defunct, as to this poynt, not to die at the Faith of our Soveraing Lord. <hi>November</hi> 21. 1626. <hi>Seatoun</hi> Supplicant.</p>
                     <p n="35">35. The second Head of the Brieve, is, That the Pursuer is nearest and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heir to the Defunct in these Lands. Which resolveth in two points: First, that the Fee was provided to such Heirs, as are contained in the Claim, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Heirs of Line, or of Conquest, Heirs Portioners, Heirs of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, Heirs Male, or of Tailzie and Provision. And this can only be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed by the Defunct's Infeftment, and other ancient Evidents where in <hi>dutio,</hi> the Presumption is always for the Heir of Line. So that if it be not sufficiently instructed, that the Fee was provided to special Heirs, it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Heirs general, of Lyne, or Conquest according to Law: as if it be instructed by three consequent Seisings, which ordinarly do not express the the several Kinds of Heirs.</p>
                     <p>The other point of this Head is, That the Pursuer of the Brieve is nearest lawful Heir: which sometimes also is instructed by the Infeftment. As when the Person to be served, is a Member of Tailzie nominat: as if the Infeftment bear Land, or Annualrents, to be granted to the Feer, and to the Heirs of his Bodie; which failling to <hi>George</hi> his Brother, &amp;c. <hi>George</hi> pursuing a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Service, needs no further instruction: because, That he is <hi>George,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functs Brother, passeth without probation as <hi>Notorium.</hi> But ordinarly the Propinquity of Blood must be proven to the Feer, who died last infeft, or to some member of Tailzie substitute. For proving whereof, the Relation must be particularly condescended on, according to the Line of Succession, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the former Title, as that the Pursuer is the Defunct's eldest Son, or the eldest lawful Son of that Son; or that they are the Daughters of that Son, &amp;c. or the lawful Daughters of the Defunct, &amp;c. And it will not be sufficient to instruct, or serve the Pursuer nearest lawful Heir, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out condescending. Here also the propinquity of Blood, being condescend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, and proven; it is sufficient, in whatsoever Degree can be proven, though it were beyond the tenthDegree. Yea, any Degree being presumed to be the nearest Degree, unless a nearer Degree be instructed; for it resolves in this <hi>Negative,</hi> that there is no other nearer Degree; which as other <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> proves it self. And that thePursuer is not only nearest Heir, according to Lineal Succession, by Course of Law; but that he, nor none of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervenient Blood were Bastards, or unlawful Children, (which is instructed sufficiently by common Fame, or being so holden and repute, in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediates) it will be sufficient, that nothing is known to the Inquest, on the contrary, unless Bastardrie be on the other part alledged, and instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This propinquity of Blood is proven, either by Writ, or by Retours, Infeftments, or Designations, or Acknowledgments of the Feer for the time, bearing such a Person to be of such a Degree, or Relation to him. And <hi>in antiquis,</hi> Writs bearing such Designation and Acknowledgment, even by others of Fame, will be sufficient. For there is not equal evidence of Fame
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:109710:324"/>
required in all Cases. And therefore, when the Fee is to fall <hi>Caduciarie,</hi> and to cease from the Feer's proper Blood, lesse probation will serve, than when the Competition is betwixt divers Persons of the same Blood; or at least members of the same Tailzie: amongst whom the pregnantest probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will take place. So the Service and Retour of the Earl of <hi>Airth,</hi> then designed Earl of <hi>Strathern,</hi> was reduced; because the propinquity of Blood not sufficiently instructed: which could not be known by the Inquest, or was Witnesses, the progresse thereof being far past memory of man; and Hear-say, or common Fame was not found sufficient. Neither were the Writs produced sufficient to prove the said Earls Propinquity of Blood to <hi>David</hi> Earl of <hi>Strathern,</hi> Son to King <hi>Robert</hi> the second, or to <hi>Eupham,</hi> only Daughter to the said <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Patrick Graham</hi> her Spouse: which progress not being sufficiently instructed, the Right remained with the King, as the unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Descendent of the said King <hi>Robert</hi> the third, and so Heir of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the said <hi>David</hi> Earl of <hi>Strathern</hi> So that no other lawful Issue, being proven of the said <hi>David's</hi> own Bodie, nor of any other nearer Brother; all his Right remained with the King, as descending from King <hi>Robert</hi> the third, who was Brother to the said <hi>David</hi> Earl of <hi>Strathern. March</hi> 22: 1633. The King contra the Earl of <hi>Strathern.</hi> There is another Exception against this Head, That the pursuer hath slain his Father, Mother, Good-sire, Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, &amp;c. whereby he, and all his Issue are excluded from the Heritage of the Partie slain, if he be convict thereof by an Assyse and the next <hi>Agnat</hi> may be served. <hi>Par.</hi> 1594. <hi>cap.</hi> 220.

                     <p n="36">36. The third Head of the Brieve is, Of whom the Fee is holden in Chief, or who is immediat lawful Superior thereof: and this also be instructed by the Infeftments: whereby the Giver of the last Infeftment will also be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to continue Superior, and the Inquest will serve accordingly; unless ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Superior be instructed, or acknowledged by the Pursuer. Which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, in respect of the Pursuer's hazard of Disclamation, and that the subsequent Superior's Rights are in his own hand, and he cannot be prejudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Service; therefore that poynt will be so served <hi>Periculo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentis.</hi>

The fourth Head of the Brieve is, By what Service the Fee is holden, whether it be Ward, Blench, Feu or Burgage; which also must be instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Evidents. And if nothing else appear, the Fee is presumed to be Ward, because that only is the proper Fee, and the others are improper, declyning from the nature of Fees: and therefore are not presumed, but must be proven: And as <hi>Craig</hi> observes, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>dieg.</hi> 17.

                        <pb n="129" facs="tcp:109710:324"/>38. The fifth Head is, The Value of the Fee now, and in time of peace. The reason of inserting of this Article, is, because there is due to the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or a years Rent of the Fee, for the entire of the Heir, which is called the Relief: of which formerly, <hi>Title Superiority.</hi> And that it might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, and <hi>liquidat,</hi> there was a general Valuation of the whole Kingdom, which is called the old Retour, or old Extent. Thereafter there was a second Retour, called the new Retour, or Extent; whereby the new Retour of some Shires was made the Triple, and some the Quadruple of the old; Yea, different new Retours were in the same Shyre, but there is no new Retours in <hi>Southern Shires,</hi> upon the Border, which were frequently wasted with War, and little addition in the <hi>Northern Shyres.</hi> So the meaning of the Article is, what the Fee is worth now, that is, what the new Retour, or Extent thereof is, and what it was worth in the time of Peace, or what is the old Extent thereof. <hi>Craig</hi> declares, he could never find clear satisfaction in the reason of these expressions, especially, why the old Retour is called that which was in the time of Peace. And he conjectureth, that because our fore Fathers are said to rest in peace, therefore, by the same peace, is meant the time of our Predecessors. But I conceive the matter may be better cleared thus. The Casualities of the Superiority were, of old, the Chief Patrimony of the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and were further extended than of late: and therefore it seems, that the time of the making the new Retour, and cause thereof, was the frequency of War, requiring an Addition of the Royal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue And though, through the alteration of the Rate of Money, neither of the Retours be now considerable; Yet doubtlesse they were very consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in those times. So that by <hi>quid valet nunc,</hi> is to be understood in time of War, at which time the new Retour was made: which is the more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by the opposite member, what was the Value in the time of Peace. So that the old Retour, being that Value which was before the necessity of heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening thereof, by the War, is fitly said to be that which was in time of Peace: and the new Retour, that which was made in time of War. And immediately, after the Constitution thereof, the Brieve was made to expresse it, by the then present time, <hi>Nunc:</hi> which hath been always so continued, because the Style of Brievs is not to be altered. This is the more evident, that the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Shyres, which were frequently wasted, by Incursions, were not alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Extent: So that it hath been made in a time of War.</p>
                     <p>The new Extent is not only the Rule of Relief, but of Non-Entrie, in Lands holden Ward, and Blench: for the new Retour Mail is only due till general Declarator. But in Feu Lands, there is only regard to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for during the Non-Entry thereof, at least before general Declarator, nothing is due: but the Feu Dutie, and the Duplication thereof for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Annualrents have no difference, before or after Declarator: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are alwayes Retoured to the full Value of the Annualrent, and is thus exprest, <hi>quod valet seipsum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="39">39. The sixth Head is, Whether the Pursuer be of lawful age. Wherein we must distinguish betwixt Ward Holdings and other Holdings, Blench, Feu, or Burgage; For in these, any Age is lawful Age. but in Ward: Holdings, because the Superior by vertue of the Ward, hath the profit of the Land, during the Heirs Minority; therefore they cannot enter till their Majority, at which time, only the Heir is of lawful Age: which in Men is, twenty one Years compleat, and in Women fourteen Years compleat. <hi>January</hi> 27. 1610.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:109710:325"/>
of the Age, the Service will proceed, but the benefit of the Ward continueth with the Superior, by the Dispensation in the Disposition. The Heir Age must also be instructed to the Inquest, either as being <hi>Notour,</hi> by inspection of the Persons; for it would be Ridiculous, to prove a Gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed Heir to be Major, but in <hi>dubio,</hi> Witnesses, or other sufficient Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles must be adhibited.</p>
                     <p n="40">40. The seventh Head of the Brieve, is, In whose hand the Fee is; that is, to whom the profit and benefit thereof doth now belong. For ordinar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Fee is Retoured; to be in the hands of the Superior by reason of Non-Entrie, but sometimes retoured to be in the hands of the Supeiors, Superior, when the Sùperior hath lost the Casualities of the Superioritie, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Life; and sometimes it is in the hands of the Liferenters, by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct-Fee, or Liferent holden of the Superior; which doth not hinder the Entrie of the Heir to the Fee, yet excludeth Non-Entrie.</p>
                     <p>The remanent Particles of the Brieve, From what time, how, by what Service, by whom, and through what Cause; are but circumstances rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the last Head: that thereby it may appear, <hi>First,</hi> How long the Fee hath been in Non-Entry, or in the hands of the immediat Superior, or Liferenter. 2. How it came to be in that Condition: So it became in Non-Entrie, by the Vassal's Death, and in the hands of the mediat Superior, by the contumacie of the immediat Superior, in not entring his Vassal; and in the hands of the Liferenter, by the Infeftment of Liferent, granted by the Superior. 3. The kind of Service which relateth to the Fee's being in the hands of the Liferenter, in respect that the Liferent, is oftimes a different Holding from the Fee, and is ordinarly Blench; and therefore it is the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors Interest, to know what such Service is, and also to know by whom, and through what Cause, the Fee is in the hands of such a Person. These Circumstances therefore, do not make distinct Heads of the Brieve, and are not al ways necessary to be retoured, as the former Heads be.</p>
                     <p n="41">41. The points aforesaid being cleared, and instructed to the Inquest, the Service is the Sentence or Decreet: which ought to be sealed with their Seals, and with the Seal of the Judge, to whom the Brieve is directed, and is returned to the <hi>Chancerie,</hi> whence it is called a Retour, being Registrate there, and Extracted; till which it is not compleat: neither doth the Service ordinarly instruct the active Title but only the Retour. The Service is keeped in the <hi>Chancery,</hi> for Warrant of the Retour: Yet it was found, that Services before the year 1550. were sufficient to satisfie the Production in Improbations, or Reductions, without producing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour it self; because at that time the Books of the <hi>Chancerie</hi> were destroyed by War. <hi>Feb.</hi> 17. 1624.

                     <p n="50">50. There is another weighty and subtile Question in the Enty of Heirs, Whether that Person who falls to be nearest Heir at the time of the Defunct's decease, may not then be entered, though there be a nearer in possibility, or in hope? There is no question but when a nearer Heir is really or probably in Being, in the Womb, though unborn; that the Service must be stopped till the Birth. For in all things working in favour of those unborn, they are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as born: and that not only for presuming that there is a living Child, not a salfe Conception; but presuming that it is a Male Child, not a Female. And therefore Daughters of a Defunct cannot be served Heirs, if there be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of a <hi>posthumus</hi> Child, who is presumed to be a Son: whereby they will be excluded till the contrary appear. It was so amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> who therefore sent the Womb in Possession for the Child. But with us, the Fee of necessity must remain in Non-entry: and the Friends or nearest Agnats of the Birth, as Pro-tutors, may continue the Possession. But the difficulty is, when the nearer Heir is in possibility, and neither conceived nor born: and it occurs specially in two Cases. First, in the Case of Heirs ascendent: as when the Father succeeds to the Son, having no Issue, Brother, or Sister. For in that Case, though at the Defunct's death there be neither Sister nor Brother gotten or born; yet the Father may have them after. So that the question will be, Whether the Father may enter immediatly upon the death of his Son, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Children, Brother, nor Sister born, nor in the Womb; or if he must attend the future possibility of a superveening Brother or Sister? The other Case is in Heirs of Tailzie, whereof there was a notable instance, long debated in <hi>Anno</hi> 1647, and 1648. on this occasion. The Laird of <hi>Blackwood</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Natural Daughter <hi>Marion Weir,</hi> having no other Children, to Major <hi>James Bannatine;</hi> and in Contemplation of the Marriage, and for a Sum ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by the Major for satisfying his Debts, he disponed his Estate of <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> to Major <hi>Bannatine</hi> and the Heir to be procreat betwixt him and <hi>Marion Weir;</hi> which failing, to the Heirs of the said <hi>Marion Weir</hi> by any other law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Husband; which failing, to the Heirs of the <hi>Bannatine.</hi> The Major died without Issue: So the question was, whether <hi>Bannatine's</hi> Heirs should succeed, or if the Succession behoved to be pendent, till it appeared whether there would be any lawful Heir of the Body of the said <hi>Marion Weir,</hi> who was no Member of the Tailzie her self, but only the Heirs of her Body. The whole question resulted in this Point, Whether <hi>whilks failing</hi> was to be understood failing <hi>de praesenti</hi> at the time of the Feer's death, or failing simply as being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> at no time. The matter was not dicided, but transacted, Whereby <hi>Marion Weir</hi> being married to <hi>William Lowrie,</hi> and having Children during the dependence of the Plea, the matter ended by Transaction betwixt the <hi>Laird</hi> of <hi>Corhouse,</hi> who was Major <hi>Bannatine's</hi> Heir, and <hi>William Lowrie</hi> tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Burthen for his Heirs with <hi>Marion Weir,</hi> thus; That the tailized <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> should belong to <hi>Marion Weirs,</hi> Heirs: That <hi>William Lowrie</hi> for them should pay to <hi>Corchouse</hi> 20000 pound Scots, as the Sum which the Major his Brother
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:109710:327"/>
had contracted for payment of <hi>Blackwood's</hi> Debts, and had payed out upon Contemplation of the Marriage. There was a very equitable Transaction to the same effect, as if the Clause in the Tailzie had been interpret thus; That failing Heirs of <hi>Marion Weir,</hi> that is, so long as the Heirs failed, the Major's Heirs should succeed to him in the tailzied Estate. So that where there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came to exist Heirs of <hi>Marion Weir,</hi> both that they should succeed to Major <hi>Bannatine's</hi> Heirs, to wit, <hi>Corehouse</hi> who was served Heir of Tailzie to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Major <hi>Bannatine;</hi> and should exclude <hi>Corehouse</hi> his Heirs of Line. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Fee should never be <hi>in pendente</hi> at the death of the last Feer, but that Person should be entered as Heir of Tailzie, who at the death of the Defunct Feer, or at the time of the Service, was nearest Heir of the Tailzie: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Corehouse</hi> should succeed as Heir of Tailzie to his Brother, because at his death, neither of the two former Branches of the Tailzie were existent, <hi>viz.</hi> the Heirs betwixt the Major, and <hi>Marion Weirs</hi> heirs by another husband. And therefore, a judicious and just Inquest lerving a Brieve for the Heirs of Tailzie of Major <hi>Bannatine,</hi> could not but find that he died last vest and seased as of Fee, in the tailzied Estate of <hi>Blackwood;</hi> and that the Majors Heir of Line, to wit <hi>Corehouse,</hi> his immediate elder Brother, is the nearest Heir to the Major by the Tailzie, there being no Heir of <hi>Marion Weir</hi> then existent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or born, she being unmarried. For if she had then had a lawful Child, the Inquest behoved to have served that Heir, as nearest Heir of Tailzie to Major <hi>Bannatine,</hi> then his Heir of Line. Neither would that Child be exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; because the Child could not be Heir to <hi>Marion Weir</hi> while she was on life: for Heirs in that case were only mean'd, such as might be Heirs if she were dead. Suppose then there had been a Son betwixt the Major and <hi>Marion Weir,</hi> who had been infeft as Heir to his Father, and died without Issue; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion Weir</hi> at her death having then a Daughter by asecond Husband: that Daughter would have succeeded as Heir of Tailzie, albeit a Son of <hi>Marion Weir</hi> were in possibility, and in the nearest hope, and to whom the title of her Heir would be most proper, as being her Heir of Line, or Heir <hi>simpliciter:</hi> yet the Fee would not remain <hi>in pendente</hi> and vacant till the event of that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility, but the Daughter would be served as nearest, at the last Feer's death. And therefore, the Inquest could not justly swear, but that Major <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> Heir of Line, is his nearest Heir of Tailzie the time of the Service. For if it should be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that there were a nearer Heir in possibility or hope; the Inquest could not demur thereon: because an Heir in possibility is not, but only may be. And therefore, the Major's heir is the nearest heir of Tailzie, who needs not be served heir of Line to the Major. If the Major had an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailzied Estate; his Brother might renounce to be heir of Line to him in that Estate, and yet might be heir of Tailzie to him in the tailzied Estate, as being still his heir of Line <hi>demonshrativè:</hi> that is, the Person who might be his heir of Line. And therefore, after <hi>Corehouse</hi> his death, if he died infeft as heir of Tailzie to his Brother; if the question again had arisen betwixt <hi>Corehouse</hi> his Son as his heir of Line, and <hi>Marion Weirs</hi> Son being then existent; an Inquest could not justly ferver <hi>Corechouse</hi> heir of Tailzie to him in the Estate of <hi>Blackwood:</hi> because then <hi>Marion Weirs</hi> Son was a prior Branch of the Tailzie, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to exclude <hi>Bannatine's</hi> heirs of Line, which are the posterior Branch. Therefore, in lieu of this temporary Succession of <hi>Corehouse,</hi> resolving in his Liferent, as the Branches of Tailzies frequently do; he accepted 20000 <hi>l.</hi> which was his Brothers true Interest, and denuded himself in favour of <hi>Marion Weirs</hi> Son, the prior Branch. So we are left in both to a rational Debate, without decision. As to the first Case, we have already showen, both by Reason and Practice, That failing the Feer's Children, Brother and Sisters,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:109710:328"/>
his Father and Grand-father succeed, and exclude their Collateralls. So thence it necessarly followeth, that these Ascendents may be served with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay: otherways they could never be served; there being ever possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Issue of Men. Yet if they should not be entered before the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perveniency, even though but in the Womb, the same would take place: but if the Ascendent be actually entered, the Law affordeth no remedy, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, or Restitution. Neither can this difficultie be a Reason against the Succcession ofAscendents: because the question is only betwixt them and their own Children, and nothing operats in favour of their Brothers and Sisters, or their Descendents. As to the other Case, in the instance proposed, it seems the Succeession ought to have depended, till the event of the lawful Issue of <hi>Marion Weir.</hi> First, because that had a determined time, by the Course of Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> the fifteth or fiftieth two year of her Age; at which time, the Issue of Women is repute extinct: which is not so in the case of Men. Secondly, in Tailzies upon Contracts, and for onerous causes; respect is to be had to the meaning, and interest of the Parties contracters: and <hi>in dubio pars mitior est sequenda.</hi> And that sense is to be imbraced, by which the provisions can have some effect: and not that by which they can have none. Whereby it may seem, that it was <hi>Blackwood's</hi> meaning, that the Succession of his own Natural Daughter should be substitute, in the second member, to the Heirs betwixt the <hi>Major</hi> and her: and that while these were possibe, his Heirs should have no place. Otherways the second membet had been elusory. For if by sailling the Heirs of the <hi>Major</hi> with the said <hi>Marion,</hi> at the time of the said <hi>Major's</hi> Decease, <hi>Marions</hi> Heirs, by another lawful Husband should take place; her other Heirs could never take place. For she could not have another lawful Husband, at the time of the <hi>Majors</hi> her first Husband's Death.</p>
                     <p>Yet the Reasons on the contrary are no lesse pregnant; and that in this Case, as in the Case of Heirs ascendent, the Heirs nearest at the time of the Feer's Death, should have Rights immediatly to Succeed: because the Fee necessarly must belong to some Person, and it cannot hang in the Air, on a future possibility. Which is a principle, whereof mention and use hath been made frequently before. Secondly, if that were the meaning, then at the time of the Major's Death, the Lands were truely <hi>nullius:</hi> and so as <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciary,</hi> behoved to sall to the KING, as <hi>ultimus Haeres.</hi> But if it had been so exprest, That no place should be to the Heirs of the <hi>Major's</hi> other Heirs, till there were no possibility of Heirs of <hi>Marion Weir;</hi> the defficulty seems the same, that the Fee should be pendent, and <hi>nullius.</hi> It may be answered; That even in that other Case, the <hi>Major's</hi> other Heirs would succeed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that provision, which doth but resolve in aPersonalObligation to those Heirs, to forebear. Yet they were Heirs: and if contrary the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, they should enter, it would give interest to the Heirs of <hi>Marion Weir,</hi> to compel the <hi>Major's</hi> Heirs having entered, to denude themselves in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. But there was no such thing in this Case. And as to the Reasons upon the contrary, though it may seem, <hi>Black-wood's</hi> interest, that the Heirs of his Natural Daughter should be in the second Place; yet <hi>non fuit habilis modus</hi> to make the Fee pendent and <hi>nullius.</hi> But to that which is the main Reason; Otherways the second member behoved to be elusory: it is answerd, That it is not elusory, because the most ordinary and hoped Case was, That there should have been Heirs betwixt the <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Marion;</hi> who, if they had died without Issue, the Lands would have fallen to <hi>Marions</hi> Heirs by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other lawful Husband, and not to the <hi>Major's</hi> other Heirs. So that the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:109710:328"/>
case which fell out, that there was no Children procreat betwixt the <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Marion</hi> was not feared, and so not provided for: as it oft-times fares in such cases. Therefore we conceive it more probable, that in all cases, that Person, who at the time of the Defunct's Death, is in being born or unborn, may be Heir, and immediately enter, so soon as by the birth it appears who may be Served.</p>
                     <p>There hath a later Case occurred, and been determined on that occasion. The late Earl of <hi>Leven</hi> tailzied his Estate and Dignitie to the Heirs Male of his Body: Which failling, to the eldest Heir Female, without Division: Which failling to the second Son of the Earl of <hi>Rothess:</hi> Which failling to the second Son of the Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> who had Married the Earl of <hi>Levens</hi> Sist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Which failling to the second Son of the Earl of <hi>Weemes,</hi> who had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Mother. <hi>Leven</hi> left three Daughters after him, who died all un-ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <hi>Rothess</hi> having no second Son, <hi>David Melvil</hi> second Son to the Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> took a Brieve out of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> to serve himself Heir of Tailzie to the Earl of <hi>Leven.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Rothess</hi> took a Gift of the Non-entry, in the name of <hi>Sr. William Bruce,</hi> who raised an Advocation of the Brieve, with a Declarator, That while there was no hope of a second Son of the Earl of <hi>Rothess's</hi> Body, <hi>David Melvil,</hi> nor no Son of a subsequent Branch could be entered: Or declaring, That the Lands were in Non-entrie. Both members of the said Declarator the Lords did sustain, and stopped the Service: albeit many inconveniences were represented, thence arising. As that there could be no active Title for pursuing the Rights of the Familie, or for receiving Vassals: nor any Accesse to the Estate <hi>passivè</hi> by Creditors. But the Lords did reserve to the special Declarator, how far the Non-entry would reach, whether to the retoured Duties only, or to the full Rents. But many of the Lordswerc of opinion, that <hi>David Melvil</hi> should enter as Heir of Tilzie; Yet so that if the <hi>Chancelor</hi> had a second Son, he or his Issue would succeed, as Heir of Tailzie to <hi>David Melvil:</hi> and neither his own Heirs of Line, nor the Earl of <hi>Weemes's</hi> second Son. Because at the time of <hi>David Melvils</hi> Death, the <hi>Chancelor's</hi> second Son would be a nearer Heir of Tailzie to <hi>David</hi> than his own Son, as being of a prior Branch of the Tailzie. <hi>Feb.</hi> 22. 1677.

                     <p n="52">52. There do many questions arise, as to the Succession of Heirs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, by Clauses of Conquest in Contracts of Marriage. The main question is, what is accounted Conquest; Whether that which is acquired, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after disponed, be accounted Conquest, either as to the Wife, or to the Heirs, or Bairns of the Marriage. As to which it hath been shown before, that such Provisions infer not only a Succession to the Heirs, or Bairns of the Marriage, as Heirs of Provision; but thereby the Wife or Heir, and Bairn of the Marriage, have an interest as Creditors that the Husband, or Father cannot, <hi>ad arbitrium,</hi> do Deeds prejudicial to that which is once ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: but the Husband is not thereby bound up from disponing to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, for causes onerous; or to other Wives or Children, for compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Provisions. But he may not otherways intervert the design of those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, by taking the Rights to Wives, or Children of another Marriage; unlesse he have not means <hi>aliunde</hi> to provide them. And therefore the Husband being oblieged, to take all Sums acquired, during the Marriage to to himself and his Wife inConjunct-fee; having taken a Sum acquired during the Marriage, in the name of his second Son: his Relict was found to have Right to the Annualrent thereof. <hi>July</hi> 16. 1625. <hi>Knox</hi> contra <hi>Brown.</hi> The like, where the Bonds were taken originally in the name of the Bairns, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

But Clauses of Conquest, of all Lands acquired during the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, do not extend to Lands, acquired and disponed during the Marriage. Yea Conquest of Lands was extended where there was Disposition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Infeftment: with a burthen of a part of the Price upon the Disponer. <hi>January</hi> 24 1629.

These Clauses of Conquest do never extend to any thing, whereunto the Husband succ eds as Heir, or Executor; unless Succession be exprest. A clause of Conquest, oblieging the Husband to take all Lands, Annualrents and Sums, conquest, during the Marriage to himself, and the Heirs and Bairns of the Marriage, one or moe; found to constitute all the Bairns of the Marriage, Male and Female, Heirs Portioners: and that it was not alternative, that the Husband might either take the Conquest to himself; and the Heirs of the Marriage; or to himself, and Bairns of the Marriage, at his option.

The reason of introducing this passive Title, is in favour of Creditors, that they be not un-satisfied, or shifted by the heirs of the defunct Debitors: who, if they might continue possession of their Predecessors Means, and Estate, and be but countable; would rarely enter, and hundle up their Intromission, and with time ascribe it to singular Titles, abstracting their Predecessors Rights. And therefore it is an expedient Custom, that they should either enter le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally, and for good and all; or that they should wholly abstain. Especially seing the Law allows them a year, to enquire into the condition of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunct's heretage, whether it will afford them losse or gain: during which time they may deliberat; and if they abstain, can be troubled by none. So that though it may seem rigourous, for a small Intromission to make the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metter lyable for all the Defunct's Debts, how great soever; Yet it being so easie to abstain, and the hazard known; the Expediency and Favour of the Creditor, proponderateth the wilfull Disadvantage of the Debitors Heir.</p>

                     <p n="6">6. There are two Cases of Behaving as Heir, <hi>viz.</hi> Intromission with the moveable Heirship, and Intromission with the Lands, Teinds, Tacks, or other Rights which might have belonged to the Intromitter as Heir. In both which cases the Intromission will not infer this passive Title, unlesse the Intrometter might succeed in the same particulars. And therefore the appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Heir of Line and no other, can be lyable by Intromission with Heirship moveable, because the same can only belong to the Heir of Line. So the Intromission with Rents of Lands, Tiends or Tack, will not infer <hi>gestionem,</hi> unless by the apparant Heir, who would succeed therein, according as they are provided to Heirs of Line, of Conquest, Heirs male, or of Tailzie, or Provision. Neither will any other Intromission be relevant, but what is immediat, or by express Warrant, Command, or Ratihabition.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. A Tutor or Curator's Intromission will not infer <hi>gestionem</hi> upon his Pupil, unless he accept the same from the Tutor in his Accompts. Nor the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tromission of one having a general Commission, as Factor, &amp;c. It was so found in the Case of a Tutor's Intromission with the Rents of the Pupil's Predecessor's Lands, for the restitution whereof he was only found lyable. <hi>Nevember</hi> 3. 1665. <hi>David Boyd</hi> contra <hi>Tailzfair.</hi>

                     <p n="8">8. Behaving as Heir by Intromission with the moveable Heirship, is most unquestionable, when the said moveable is chosen, drawn, and separat by the Heir from the remanent moveables. In which case the apparant Heir will not be admitted to alledge, that the Defunct could not have an Heir or Heir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship moveable, when he formerly drew the same. <hi>July</hi> 13. 1631.

Heirship, doth not evidently appear: for that must be accounted the best, which is such in the opinion of the apparant Heir. And yet in favourable Cases Intromission with any Kind of moveables, out of which Heirship may be drawn, will be found sufficient, and repute as the Heir's choice. As the apparant Heir's making use of his Fathers Board, lying in his Bed; though he disposed not thereof, and though the same were standing in a House dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned to him by his Father before contracting of the Debt pursued on: seing he continued two years in possesion, and got no Warrant from the Lords, or made any Inventary thereof. <hi>July</hi> 14. 1626. <hi>Gilbert Johnston</hi> and <hi>Masson</hi> his Spouse contra <hi>Masson.</hi> The like by making use of the Defunct's Bassin, Silver Spoons, Timber Beds and Boards, without alienation thereof: though the beginning of the Intromission was, when the Intrometter was not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant Heir himself, but was Tutor to another Heir who was Idiot: seing he continued five years after the Idiot's Death, himself being then apparant Heir. <hi>January</hi> 17. 1627. <hi>Frazer</hi> contra <hi>Monimusk.</hi> Yet the contrary was found, where the Intromission began before the Intrometter was apparant Heir, there being a nearer apparant Heir: though it continued after that nearer apparant Heir's Death, when the Intrometter was apparant Heir. <hi>July</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. The ordinary Objections and Exceptions against Behaving as Heir by Intromission with the Heirship moveable are; <hi>First,</hi> That the Defunct was neither Prelat, Baron, nor Burgess, to whose Heirs only Heirship moveable is competent by the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament:</hi> the extent whereof is shown in the former <hi>Title.</hi> And therefore the Pursuer must condescend, and instruct that the Defunct was either Baron, Prelat or Burgess: which would besufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly instructed by the Defunct's Infeftments of Lands or Annualrents, at any time: for thence it would be presumed that he continued undenuded till his death, <hi>semel baro semper baro presumptivè.</hi> And this will be elided by this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, That the Defunct was denuded before his Death. For though some have been of opinion that <hi>semel baro semper baro</hi> is meant, that though a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son once infeft were denuded; yet his Heir would have Heirship as a Baron. For which I find neither Reason nor Decision: But it is most reasonable that he who is once proven to be a Baron, should be presumed so to continue, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the contrary were proven, that he was denuded, It was so found <hi>January</hi> 27. 1636. <hi>Straiton</hi> contra <hi>Chirnside.</hi> But if the Legal was not expired at the Defunct's Death, he is not esteemed denuded: and therefore his Heir hath Heirship. <hi>Feb.</hi> 26. 1663. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> of <hi>Drakies</hi> contra <hi>Monro</hi> of <hi>Foulis. July</hi> 8.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:109710:333"/>
1628. <hi>Dumbar</hi> contra <hi>Lesly.</hi> Neither will it be sufficient that the Defunct was once Burgess, but itmust be proven that when he died he was acting as a Burgess. So that neither the Heirs of honorary Burgesses, nor they who once were traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficking Burgesses and take themselves to a Country Life, their heirs, will have heirship moveable. And therefore <hi>semel civis semper civis</hi> is not presumed. Neither <hi>semel paerlatus semper praelatus:</hi> for if a beneficed Person were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived or demitted before the Death, his heir would have no heirship moveable.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The second Defense against Intromission with heirship moveable, and which is also competent against Vitious Intromission, is, That the Defunct died Rebel, and his Escheat was gifxted and declared before intenting of the Creditor's Pursuit. <hi>June</hi> 10. 1663. <hi>Gordon of Lismoir</hi> contra <hi>Keith. June</hi> 10. 1674. Lady <hi>Spenserfield</hi> contra <hi>Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Kilbrachmount. December</hi> 22. 1674.

For the Exception is equiparat to Executors confirmed, against Vitious Intromission: whereby Vitious Intromission is excluded, albeit the Intromission was before another was confirmed Executor, if the Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was before intenting of the Creditor's Cause. But it is no relevant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense, That the Defunct died Rebel, and so had no moveables, but that they were confiscat. Neither was it sufficient that the Escheat was gifted, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also declared, before the Creditor's Pursuit. As was found in the said two first Cases.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The third Defense is, That the apparant Heir intrometted by a Gift to himself, or to his behoofe; or by a Right or Tollerance from a Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. These being prior to the Creditor's Pursuit, although posterior to his Intromission, albeit not declared, are relevant: because the Donatar there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is in possession, and needs no Declarator. <hi>Feb.</hi> 26. 1663. <hi>Cuthbirt</hi> of <hi>Drakies</hi> contra <hi>Monro</hi> of <hi>

                     <p n="12">12. The fourth Exception is, When Moveables belonging to a Defunct, remain in his House whereunto his apparant Heir hath Right by Infeftment, wherein the Defunct had his Liferent or Tollerance: if the Heir enter in possession of the House, if at his entry he represent to any competent Judge, that there are Moveables in or about the House belonging to the Defunct, which he desires to be inventaried, or that such as cannot be preserved may be sold, that the price may be made forthcoming to all parties having interest; if Inventary or Sale be made by warrant of that Judge, the continuing of these Moveables in the House, or the Sale of those which cannot be preserved, will not infer Behaving as Heir. Yet the making use of the things in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventary, or the Sale of that which is not warranted; yea the ommission out of the Inventary of Moveables of any considerable value, was found to infer Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. <hi>January</hi> 25. 1632. <hi>Helen Scarlet</hi> contra <hi>John Paterson.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. The other ordinary member of Behaving as Heir, is by Intromission with the Rents of Lands, or Tiends, whereunto the Defunct had Right by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment; or entering in possession of these Lands and Tiends unto which the apparent Heir would succeed, which is the most direct Behaviour as Heir;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:109710:334"/>
and is only competent against such persons as might be Heirs in that wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they immix themselves. And so an Heir of line poslessing or intrometting with the Rents of Lands provided to Heirs male, or to Heirs of Tailzie or Provision; or the Intromission of these with the profits of Lands or Tiends befalling to Heirs of line; will only infer Restitution or Reparation: but will not infer a general passive Title, making the partie lyable to all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct's Debts.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. There are many Defenses which use to be proponed against this species of Behaviour. As first, it was an ordinary custom to shun this passive Title, that the apparant Heir granted a Bond of purpose to adjudge the Defunct's Right, upon the apparant Heirs Renounciation, and then take Right to the Adjudication: till the Lords by an Act of Sederunt, <hi>Feb.</hi> 28. 1662. did declare, that if apparant Heirs should in time coming, take Right to any Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryzing or Adjudication of their Predecessors Rights for their own Debt, and did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> thereby, whether before or after expyring of the Legal; they should be lyable as behaving as Heirs: which hath always since been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. And therefore no Defense for such Rights will be sustained, albeit it were a true Debt of the apparant Heirs, and not a simulat Bond granted of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe to adjudge or apprise.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it a relevant Defense, That the Lands or Teinds were appryzed or adjudged from the Defunct, albeit Infeftment had followed thereupon; if the heir apparant intromet without Right, or Warrant from the Appryser or Adjudger, within the Legal. <hi>Feb.</hi> 21. 1663. <hi>Henrie Hamilton</hi> contra <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Hamilton.</hi> But it is a relevant Exception, That the apparant heir's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tromission or possession was by Right from an Appryser or Adjudger, though the Legal was not expired: unless the Sum were fully satisfied by Intromission or otherways. <hi>January</hi> 10. 1662. <hi>Barclay</hi> contra Laird of <hi>Cragievar.</hi> The like though the apparant heir continued to possesse, for some time after the Apprysing was satisfied by Intromission. <hi>Feb.</hi> 26. 1663. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> of <hi>Drakies</hi> contra <hi>Monro</hi> of <hi>Foulis.</hi> Yea Intromission with the Rents of the Defunct's Land by his apparant heir, waselided by a Tollerance from a Donatar of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition, albeit not declared till after his Intromission; the apparant heir paying the single value of his Intromission. <hi>July</hi> 17. 1666. <hi>Thomas Ogilvie</hi> contra Lord <hi>Gray.</hi> But a Tollerance from Apprysers after their Intromis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, was not found relevant, <hi>July</hi> 11. 1671.

Yea they will not have Relief from the heirs who are lyable before them: because they have in their Person no active Title. Yet it is in <hi>arbitrio judicis</hi> to ordain the Creditor, on satisfaction to assign his Right, by which the heir behaving may indirectly attain Relief, as Assigny by the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor This favour will not be refused, unless the manner of Behaviour be very odious: as when it is fraudulent, by concealing the Immixtion; or that the Creditor himself having an other Interest, may be prejudged by his Assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And therefore heirs behaving, if distress'd for moveable Debts, they have no direct recourse against Executors. And if the Executory be mean, so that there be small provisions for the Wife and Children; the Creditor would not be ordained to assign. And it may so fall out in other Cases. The same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may occur, where heirs of Conquest, or heirs Male, of Tailzie, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision behave; if the prior heirs who are nearer of Blood have little benefit and provision.</p>

And the acceptance thereof is accounted <hi>praeceptio haereditatis,</hi> and as an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion

with the Inheritance, makes the apparant heir to represent the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct <hi>passivè.</hi> Yet with this temperament, that he shall be lyable only to the Debt contracted before the Disposition or Right made to him by the Defunct, in which Right he might have succeeded. Wherein apparant heirs are most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediently differenced from the other singular Successors without onerous Causes, that these are not ordinarly personally lyable, except in so far as they have disposed of such Rights as were fraudulently disponed to them in Trust, and in which they were interposed Persons to the behoof of the Disponer or his Children; but these Rights are alwayes reduceable at the instance of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Creditors. But because such Fraud is more incident to apparant Heirs, therefore these are personally lyable for the whole anterior Debts, and the Right granted by them may also be reduced upon the Statute 1621. Yet the personal Obligement doth remain and both are compatible: <hi>Hope, Successor Lucrative, Gray</hi> contra <hi>William Burgh.</hi>

This passive Title is not only extended to Dispositions of Lands bearing expressly a lucrative Title, as <hi>for Love and Favour,</hi> &amp;c. but though the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative thereof bear expressly a Cause onerous, which being betwixt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponer and his apparant heir proves not: and therefore the Cause onerous must be proven <hi>aliunde. Vide</hi> Title <hi>Reparation</hi> upon <hi>Circumvention:</hi> where the Narrative of Writs amongst conjunct and confident Persons, proves not the Cause to be onerous. And though there be a Cause onerous instructed, it will not be sufficient, unless it be equivalent to the worth of the Lands, to substain it against Reduction: but if the Cause onerous be considerable, the heir will not be lyable simply, or personally, but the Right may be reduced, and the heir may be lyble <hi>in quantum est lucratus.</hi> And therefore an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant heir having accepted the benefit of a Disposition and Infeftment, granted by his Predecessor to a third Party, but to the apparant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>.</hi> The like was found of a Disposition by a Father to his Son and apparant heir, though the Son offered to prove it was for equivalent onerous Cause: seing the Disposition it self did bear <hi>for love and favour and other good Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. November</hi> 22. 1671. <hi>Beaty</hi> contra <hi>Roxlurgh.</hi> But Bonds of Provision by Parents to Children infer no passive Title, though the Children be Heirs apparant. As when the Bonds are granted to the eldest Son, or Bonds of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, or a Tocher to Daughters, when there are no Sons, though in that Case the Daughters might be esteemed heirs apparant, although truly they be not; for a man is ever understood to be capable of having a Son: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Daughters are little more heirs apparant than Brothers. Yet Bonds of Provision or Tochers are reducible by anterior Creditors, if the Defunct had not a visible Estate sufficient for these Portions and his whole anterior Debts. And therefore accepting a Tocher did not make a Daughter lyable as lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Successor, though there was no Son; yet the Daughter and her Husband were found lyble to the Father's anterior Creditors, for what was above a competent Tocher, suteable to the Parties. <hi>December</hi> 23. 1665.

                     <p n="3">3. This Title is extended to Dispositions granted in the apparant Heirs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts of Marriage, which in many respects is accounted a Cause onerous. <hi>July</hi> 8. 1625. <hi>Gray</hi> contra <hi>William Burgh.</hi> Where the Son was not liberat, though he offered to renounce the Lands he had by Contract. And it was found that Lands being disponed and resigned by the Father in favour of the Son, by his Contract of Marriage, though they were for the present wadset and disponed with that burthen, and thereafter redeemed by the Son by his own means, so that there remained nothing in the Father, but the Superiority and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>; yet the Contract of Marriage was found onerous as to the Wife's Luerent. And in respect the Son was Minor and presently revoked the Disposition, and renounced all other Rights, except that of the Wadset which he had redeemed; he was liberat of the passive Title, and the Lands declared redeemable by any Creditor anterior to the Contract. <hi>January</hi> 14. 1634. Mr. <hi>David Courtney</hi> Minister contra <hi>Weems</hi> of <hi>Lothoker.</hi> In the like Case, where Lands were disponed by a Father to the Son in his Contract of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, for a Tocher payed to the Father for some Debts and Bairns Portions far within the worth of the Land; the Son was not found lyable in <hi>solidum</hi> as lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crative Successor, nor yet the Pursuer put to a Reduction: but the Son was in <hi>hoc processu</hi> put to compt and pay the superplus of the true price of the Land. <hi>June</hi> 17. 1664. <hi>Lyon</hi> of <hi>Murask</hi> contra <hi>Bannerman.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. This Title takes place not only in universal Dispositions, of the Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor's whole Estate; but a Disposition of any part thereof, is sufficient: seing the least as well as the most, is <hi>praeceptio haereditatis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. This Title is extended also not only to Dispositions made to, and accepted by the immediate apparant Heir; but also to the mediate apparant Heir, so that he be <hi>alioqui successurus,</hi> by the course of Law, necessarly: as what is granted to the eldest Son of the apparant Heir. Because the ground of this Title being to prevent Deeds in favour of the Disponer's Successors, prejudicial to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poner's Creditors, whose Debts are anterior; the reason holds as much where
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:109710:337"/>
he dispones to his Oye, who by the course of Law is to succeed to him, as to his Son. 2. It is <hi>Praeceptio haereditatis</hi> in the Oye aswell as in the Son. And therefore the Rule in this Title is not, that the Accepter be that Person who would succeed at the time of the Disposition, and so may seem to be immediat apparant Heir <hi>pro tempore:</hi> for so a Disposition by one Brother to another, or to a Brother's Son, the Disponer for the time having no Children; will not inferre this Title. <hi>November</hi> 22. 1662. <hi>Lawrence Scot</hi> contra <hi>David Beswell</hi> of <hi>Auchinleck,</hi> Nephew to umwhile <hi>Auchinleck. December</hi> 22. 1674. Heirs of <hi>Seatoun</hi> of <hi>Blair</hi> contra Sir <hi>Alexander Seatoun.</hi> The like though the Disponer was an old man, the time of the Disposition, and had little hope of Issue. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 17. 1632. Lady <hi>Spenserfield</hi> contra Laird of <hi>Kilbrachmont.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because the Brother or Brother's Son is not <hi>alioqui successurus</hi> by the course of Law, while the Brother's Children are in <hi>spe:</hi> and therefore such are never called apparant Heirs; neither is the presumption in them, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct would, in prejudice of his Creditors, adventure simply to dispone to such, while he had hope of Issue: but all this holds in Oyes. And it was so decided <hi>January</hi> 29. 1639. Lady <hi>Smeatoun</hi> contra <hi>Richardson</hi> of <hi>Smeatoun:</hi> where an Infeftment was granted by the Good fire to the Oye, reserving his Son's Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. And in the like Case, the Father who was but Liferenter, and his Oye Feer, by the Grandfather's Disposition, was found lucrative Successor. <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> 23. 1637. <hi>Lightoun</hi> contra Laird of <hi>Kinaber.</hi> But this Decision was stopped to be further heard.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But here occurreth the Question, If the Disposition be anterior to the Debt contracted, but the Infeftment posterior to the said Debt; <hi>quid juris?</hi> The ground of Doubt is, that though the Defender had a prior Disposition, yet by the Infeftment only, he was Successor: seing Lands pass not by Dispositions, but by Infeftments: and therefore he was clearly Successor <hi>post contractum debitum,</hi> and also <hi>ex causa lucrativa.</hi> 2. If this were not the meaning, the intent of the Law would be frustrate: for it were easy to make Dispositions and to keep them up, and in the mean time to contract Debts, when the Creditors could not know the Debitor's condition, and so contracted <hi>bonafide.</hi> This Case was not decided: but the like Case was formerly decided <hi>negativè,</hi> that the Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment though posterior to the Debt, did not inferre this Title; being upon a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition anterior to the Debt. <hi>February</hi> 23. 1637. <hi>Lightoun</hi> contra Laird of <hi>Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naber.</hi> The like was found, where there was an Obligement in a Contract of Marriage, to dispone Lands, prior to the Debt contracted: albeit both the Disposition and Infeftment were posterior to the Debt, and did not bear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly <hi>in implement of the Contract;</hi> which was presumed, seing no other Cause was showen. <hi>July</hi> 27. 1678. <hi>Thomas Ferguson</hi> contra <hi>Lindsay</hi> of <hi>Wauchope.</hi> For answer to the contrary Reasons; the first is upon misapplication of the words, <hi>post contractum debitum:</hi> which are not to be referred to Successor thus, <hi>successor post contractum debitum ex causa lucrativa;</hi> but <hi>successor ex titulo lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivo, qui titulus est post contractum debitum.</hi> So that if the lucrative Title be not after the Debt, this Title takes no place. As to the other reason, the same inconveniency will be of Dispositions to Strangers, which being keeped up, Creditors may contract <hi>bona fide.</hi> And yet Inhibition before Infeftment will not be effectual, unless it preceed the Infeftment and the Disposition: which will also be effectual against the apparant Heir. But if there be fraud in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up such Dispositions, which will be easilier presumed in the person of the apparant Heir, than a Stranger; it will be sufficient upon the common reason of fraud, to reduce the Infeftment, though the general passive Title be not inferred. The like was found where there was an Obligement in a Contract
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:109710:337"/>
of Marriage, to dispone Lands, prior to the Debt contracted: albeit both the Disposition and Infeftment were posterior to the Debt, and did not bear expressly <hi>in implement of the Contract;</hi> which was presumed seing no other Cause was showen. <hi>July</hi> 23. 1678. <hi>Thomas Ferguson</hi> contra <hi>Lindsay</hi> of <hi>Wau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chope.</hi> And lucrative Successor was not found inferred by the Infeftment of a Father to his apparant Heir after the Debt contracted: seing there was an anterior Obligement in the apparant Heir's Contract of Marriage, to grant the Infeftment, and Inhibition thereupon. <hi>Nicol. de haereditariis actionibus. March</hi> 31. 1626. <hi>Ker</hi> contra <hi>Sterling.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. This Title can take no place, first, where the Party to whom the Right is granted is not <hi>alioqui successurus</hi> in that same Right: because it cannot be <hi>praeceptio haereditatis</hi> where there can be no <hi>haereditas.</hi> And so a Disposition to an heir of Tailzie, of Lands not provided to that heir of Tail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie, cannot inferre this Title: though it may be reducible, as without a Cause onerous. Neither will a Disposition of tailzied Lands to an heir of line, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr this Title. For in that case it cannot be <hi>praeceptio haereditatis:</hi> albeit the Disposition will be reducible, as without a Cause onerous. But there is more reason, that Rights acquired originally by Predecessors, in name of their apparant heirs, cannot infer this Title: because the Predecessor himself ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver being Feer in that Right, the apparant heir could not be his Heir there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Neither can such Rights be reducible by the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> 1621. because the falling thereof, will not make the Fee return to thePredecessor who never had it: but the same can only be reached by a Declarator, That it was acquired by that Predecessor's means, after the Debt contracted; and therefore ought to be affectable, as if it were in the person of the Debitor, or his heir: which hath frequently been found relevant.</p>

                     <p>The whole interest of the moveable Goods and Rights of Defuncts, is comprehended under the term of Executory, wherein not only that which proper to the Executor by his Office, or Succession, is contained; but also
<pb facs="tcp:109710:339"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:109710:340"/>
                        <pb n="159" facs="tcp:109710:340"/>
that which befalleth to the Defunct's Relict, Children, and nearest of Kinne and to his Legatars and Creditors. We shall not here repeet what hath been said of Succession in general, of which at large in its proper place, <hi>Tit.</hi> 26. Where the rise and rule of Succession, both according to Equity and the Law of Nature; and according to the positive Law, and Custom of this and other Nations, is held forth. This much only in general; that the Will of the Owner is effectual in equity to dispose upon his Rights, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take effect during his Life, or after his Death. The former being compleat, constitutes a present Right, irrevocable by the Disponer: the later is ambulatory, and dependent upon the Owner's Will, and hath alwayes implyed in it the Condition of his Death; and therefore may be altered, abrogat, and derogat by a posterior Will. And thence it is called the Later<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will of the Defunct: because the Later-will is alwayes effectual, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to the former Will. It is also more favourablie interpret and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, than Contracts or Dispositions amongst the Living. And if there were no positive Law, the expresse or presumed Will of theDefunct would be the adequat Rule of his whole Succession.</p>
                     <p>But Succession being of great consequence, whereby all the Rights of men are at least once, and many times oftner, transmitted in every generation; therefore positive Law for utilitie's sake, hath justly and fitly preicribed the forms and solemnities thereof, that it may be clear and sure: and hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed remedies to make it effectual. And hath restrained the power of the Defunct's Will in some cases, especially in favour of the Defunct's Wife and Children, whom by the Law of Nature, he is obliged to provide. And hath also declared the Degrees of Succession, Meaning, and Presumption of the Will of Defuncts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Romans</hi> of all Nations, were most solicitous in this matter, and accounted it a publict interest; <hi>reipublicae interest, voluntates defunctorum effectum sortiri.</hi> And therefore they did exactly guard the power of testing, not only against Violence and Fraud, by severe Punishments, and exclusion from all benefit of Succession; but also they rejected and annulled all Pactions, restraining the power of testing, as <hi>pactum corvinum de haereditate viventis.</hi> Which was not only extended to Pactions made by Persons disposing of the Heretage of Persons, to whom they might succeed, but even to Pactions of Persons in relation to their own Heritage. They did also clearly determine what Persons had not the power of testing; and in whose favour Testaments might not be made; and the manner of all Kindes of Testaments, Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Substitutions of Heirs, Legacies, <hi>Fideicommisses,</hi> and the sense of most ordinary Clauses in all these: and also the Succession of the intestat. Which hath made the matter of Succession swel into a mighty bulk, and to make the chief Integral of the Civil Law; wherein to insist here, would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be necessary nor profitable for our purpose: but as in other cases, a short Sum, without Ampliations or Citations, will suffice.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Succession amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> was either by Testament, or from the intestat. The ancient way of testing amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> was either in peace and solemne, which was done in presence of the People, being convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat <hi>callatis comitiis:</hi> or otherways by a simulat Sale, <hi>per aes &amp; libram;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Testator, in presence of five Witnesses <hi>Romans,</hi> did hold a Ballance, and weighed Money therein, and under that form, as it were, sold his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance for the Money, and asked Witnesses. Or otherwayes Testaments
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:109710:341"/>
were made <hi>in precinctu,</hi> when they were standing in Battaile before the Fight, without other Solemnity than three or four Witnesses.</p>
                     <p>This was the ancient form of testing. The matter and power of testing was very absolute, according to Equity: concerning which, this was the Law of the twelve Tables <hi>uti quisque rei suae legasset ita jus esto.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the after-course of the Civil Law, changed both this ancient manner and power of testing, and redacted Testaments into three kindes, Solemne, Nuncupative, and Military.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Solemne Testaments were so called, because they required the most So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities: as <hi>First,</hi> That the Testaments were in writ, the Name of the Heir, at least, being written by the Testator, or one of the Witnesses. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> There behoved to be seven Witnesses, specially required, all present, and subscribing by themselves, or another, and sealing the Testament at the foot thereof: none of which might be Women, Pupills, Servants, Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galls, or furious Persons; neither the Heir himself, or any of his Domesticks: each Subscription bearing. <hi>I Titus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>being called and required to be a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to this Testament, which is contained in this Schedule, have subscribed it with my hand, and sealed it with such a Seal.</hi> Thirdly. The Testator also behoved to subscribe thus, <hi>I Mevius,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>declare this Schedule to be my Testament, and I have tested as is contained therein:</hi> or by another if he could not write, who stood as the eighth Witnesse. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Testament behoved to be made by one continued Act, without interruption of any extraneous act, least by extraneous acts the mind might be diverted, or inconsiderat, in so solemne an Act. So the Testament was closed up, and sealed. And if the Testator opened the Testament, it was presumed he changed his mind. But after his Death, the Witnesses were called together, to acknowledge their Seals and Subscriptions, at the opening thereof. Or otherwayes it was opened by the authority of a Judge, before other honest Witnesses. And if any of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses acknowledged not their Subscriptions, the Testament was held suspect.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A Nuncupative Testament is that which was by Word only, before seven Witnesses qualified as aforesaid. Yet two Witnesses were sufficient in a Father's Testement amongst his Children; and a Woman might be Witness therein. Or in a Testament for pious Uses, five Witnesses did suffice, where there was penurie of Witnesses.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. A Military Testament, was that which was made by the Souldiers in Warre: wherein they had these Priviledges. <hi>First,</hi> when they were <hi>in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctu,</hi> ready to joyn Battaile, any declaration of their mind, by word or writ, though it were written but in the sand, was sufficient. It was also valid, if made during the Expedition, with such Solemnities as can be had for the time: Yet so, that if the Testator lived a year, in which he might make it more Solemn; it became void. Military Testaments have this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Priviledge, that the Testator may institute for a time, and may institute in a part, and so die partly testat, and partly intestate: which is against a Principle of their common Law.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The ancient absolute power of testing, was by the subsequent course of Law, cleared and restrained, not only by the declaratory Laws, finding
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:109710:341"/>
testing, and otheracts invalide, as done by furious Persons out of their <hi>lucid intervalls,</hi> and by Idiots, and by Pupills, who have not the use of reason; or those made by Fraud, or Error in the Substantialls, or by extortion: but more particularly it is limited in these particulars.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. First, <hi>Filii familiâs,</hi> Persons in the power and family of their Fathers, could not test upon their Goods; whether <hi>profectitious</hi> from their Father, or <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious aliunaè;</hi> even though their Father consented: but only on their <hi>bona castrensia,</hi> acquired in Warre; or <hi>quasi casirensia,</hi> as in <hi>militia togata.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. Secondly, Captives with publict enemies, or Persons given in pledge to them; or Persons condemned to capital Punishment, whose goods are con fiscat; or those condemned of Infamy; could not test.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Thirdly, by Testament some Persons can neither be institute nor sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute Heirs, such as the spurious Children of the Defunct: to put a restraint upon such unlawful Procreations. But Children begotten on Concubins, while those were tollerat, could not be institute or substitute, (these being lawful Children) in more then a sixth part of the heretage. Only there could be left to spurious Children, Legacies for their necessary Aliment. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could Persons guilty or condemned of Treason, be institute or substitute Heirs.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Fourthly, power of Testing is restrained in those who have lawful Children: who were necessitat, either to institute their Children their Heirs, or expresly to exheredat or disheirish them, expressing the Cause of so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For if these institute others, and past over their Children in silence, the Testament was void. And if they unjustly exheredated them, they had <hi>Quaerelam inofficiosi testamenti,</hi> to annul the Testament, as done against the natural Dutie of Fathers, without just Cause.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Fiftly, the power of Testing was restrained in favour of lawful Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that the Testator could not by Legacy or <hi>fidei commissum</hi> abate from the Children their Portions natural, due to them by the Law of Nature, oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parents to entertain their Children: which the Law defyned to be the fourth part of the Inheritance, Debts deduced, when there were fewer than four Children; a third part, when four; and a half when more. If there be no Children, this <hi>Legittima</hi> is due to the Parents, Grand Father, and Grand Mother; but not to Brethren, unlesse a base Person be institute. Which Portion natural the Testator could not prohibite the Children to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the Heretage.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Sixthly, the <hi>Falcidian</hi> Law did restrain Legacies, that they might not exceed three fourth parts of the Inheritance: so that there behoved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine one fourth part to the Heir, which therefore was called <hi>portio Falcidia.</hi> And therefore if the Legacies did exceed three Quarters of the free Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Debts being deduced; they were abated proportionally, that the <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidia</hi> might remain to the Heir.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. This <hi>Portio Falcidia</hi> differs from the natural Portion in this, that the Testator could not prohibite the Heir to take the benefit of the Portion na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; but he could effectually prohibite the Heir to take his <hi>Falcidia.</hi> The Reason whereof was, because the <hi>Falcidia</hi> was introduced, to the effect that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:109710:342"/>
the Wills of the Defuncts might be execute: which could not be, if the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies left nothing to the Heir considerable, but trouble, as oft-times it falls out. So that this being a Remedy in favour of the Testator, to make his Will effectual; he might prohibite it: and could not be presumed so irrational as to prohibite it, if he had not good ground to know that his Heirs would enter without it. Or indirectly, if the Testator prohibite the alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Heretage, the Law esteemed it as a prohibition of the <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Falcidia</hi> had no place in Military Testaments, or in Legacies left to Pious Uses, or left to the Relict of the Testator, <hi>nomine dotis.</hi> The reason of these exceptions was in favour of Souldiers, Pious Causes, and Tochers. And if the Heir ommitted to make Inventary, he lost the benefit of his <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidia</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. When the <hi>fiduciary</hi> Succession became in use, whereby Heirs were insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute or substitute, to the use and behoofe of others, to whom they were to restore the Inheritance, or some part thereof, or thing therein; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was called <hi>fideicommissum,</hi> as being committed to the trust and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Heir: the <hi>Senatusconsultum Trebellianum</hi> did introduce the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of a fourth part to the Heir, institute or substitute by these <hi>fidei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commisses,</hi> in the same way that the <hi>Falcidia</hi> was a reservation from Legacies. And therefore this fourth part was called <hi>Trebellianica:</hi> which therefore, hath the same exception with the <hi>Falicidia,</hi> of which in the former <hi>Paragraph.</hi> And this further, if the Heir were forced by Law to enter, or if within a year thereafter, he do not fulfil the Will of the Defunct; he lost the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his <hi>Trebellianica.</hi> And if he had either Legacy or Portion of the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, it was reckoned to him as a part of his <hi>Trebellianica.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="15">15. The use of these <hi>Fideicommissary</hi> Trusts was, when the Testator de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed his Inheritance, or some of his Goods, either for Persons that were not capable to be Heirs, or not fit to manage; as through Pupilarity, prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality, or some other defect; then he institute other Heirs fit for the present ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagment; and desired, or required them by his Testament, to restore the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, or some part of it, to such Persons. And that either simply to a day, or conditionally. And oft times the day of Restitution, was after the Heirs own Death, whereby he had his Liferent or Vsufruct thereof. At first this was wholly left to the trust and faithfulness of the Heir, without any legal Remedy or Compulsion: which afterward were adhibite, with the Reservation of the <hi>Trebellianica,</hi> as hath been shown. But where the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in whose favour the Trust was, were such as could not be Heirs, or suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, as spurious Persons; then those Heirs were not compelled to restore.</p>
                     <p>The essential and chief poynt of a Testament is, the Nomination of an Heir, either by Institution, or Substitution: without which it was not allowed the name of a Testament, but only a Legacy, or at best the name of Codicills, which is called by some an imperfect Testament.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Codicills might be made before five Witnesses, either in writ or nuncupative: and they were ordinarly additions to Testaments. Yea because, if when Testaments, through want of Solemnity, became voyd, the Legacies failled; therefore there used to be adjoyned this Clause, <hi>If this be not valid as a Testament, Let it be valid as a Codicill,</hi> which thence is called <hi>Clausula codicil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="17">
                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:109710:342"/>17. The form of Institution of Heirs, was in plain and short terms, thus; <hi>Titius haeres esto.</hi> These were either institute solly, or joyntly: and that either equally, or indefinitely, which is understood equally; or otherways by certain Portions. No Institution can be conditional, or to a day: or if it be, it is presently effectual. Because the Heritage cannot hing in the air, and belong to none: else it would prove caduciary. Yet in military Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments this Priviledge is indulged, as hath been said.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Substitution is the Nomination of substitute Heirs, who take place failing the institute. There may be as many subordinate Members of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution as the Testator pleaseth. The Institute or prior Substitute, is found to fail, when either he cannot, or will not enter: but if once he enter, the Substitution for ever evanisheth. And if he or his should be extinct who was institute, the Heretage becomes his Patrimony, and no more the first De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct's Heretage: and so falls not to the Substitute, who is Heir of the first Defunct; but to the Heirs of the Institute. It is otherways with us, in Tail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies, or other Substitutions, as hereafter will appear.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Substitution was of two kindes, <hi>vulgar</hi> and <hi>pupillar.</hi> Pupillar is that, whereby Fathers were allowed in their Testament, having named their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being Pupils, to be their Heirs, to substitute Heirs to them: which Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes had not only the Father's Heretage, but the Son's, dying in Pupillarity. Under which is comprehended that which is called <hi>substitutio exemplaris:</hi> whereby Parents having institute their Children, being Idiots, their Heirs; did substitute other Heirs to them, if they entered not, and died Idiots, or Furious. And in military Testaments, the pupillar Substitution is not only effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, if the Testator make his own Will, and institute his Children: but though he only substitute. And though the Children survive their Pupillari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet if they entet not, the Substitution is valid. All other Substitutions are <hi>ordinary,</hi> or <hi>vulgar;</hi> when the Testator institutes Heirs, and substitutes others: but hath only effect as to the Testator's own Goods, if those institute enter not; but not as to the Goods of Heirs institute.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. The matter of next moment to the Institution or Substitution of Heirs, is the leaving of Legacies; which may be left in Testements, or Codicills, and without either in some cases. Any thing may be legat, which is in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct's Goods, alienable; except in so far as is restrained in the <hi>Legittima, Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidia, &amp; Trebellianica:</hi> of which formerly. Yea though the thing legat be not the Testator's, the Heir is obliged to purchase it to the Legatar, or the value of it, if the Testator knew it was another's: for then his mind is followed, to make it effectual; at least by the value. But if the Testator legat any thing, thinking it to be his own, which is not his own; the Legacy is ineffectual For Legacies being Donations, they are undestood to be given, but so far as the Giver hath Right: and therefore there is no Warrandice of them, as to the Testator's Right. But if the Heir deliver any thing, not specially legat, in satisfaction of the Legacy; if that be evicted upon defect of the Heir's Right, he is lyable for Warrandice. As if an Heir were appointed to give in Legacy, a Horse worth such a price, not being in the Heretage, but delivered by the Heir, to satisfie the Legacy; if the Horse be evicted, the Legatar hath War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randice against the Heir: because it is not the Defunct's Right, but the Heir's Right that fails.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="164" facs="tcp:109710:343"/>Legacies, and particular <hi>Fideicommisses,</hi> not being for Restitution of the whole Heretage, or any special Part, or <hi>Quota</hi> thereof; are <hi>equiparat:</hi> as <hi>Fideicommisses</hi> of the Heretage, or a <hi>Quota</hi> thereof are equivalent to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, or Substitution of Heirs. And either Legacies, or <hi>Fideicommisses</hi> may be general, whereby a quantity is left; or special, whereby an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Body is left, as such a Horse, &amp;c. so may they either be left purely, or conditionally, or to a day.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. This is common to all Legacies, that if the Legatar die before the Testator, the Legacy becomes void, and is not transmitted to the Heirs, and Successors of the Legatar. Neither doth the Legacy belong to the Legatar ordinarly, if the Testament wherein it is left be void, for want of the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, (of which formerly;) unless it have the codicillar Clause, or if the Heir do not enter, or if the Codicills in which it is left, or if the Testament, having the codicillar Clause, want the Solemnities requisit to Codicills.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. If the Legacy, or <hi>Fideicommisses</hi> be conditional, the Legatar dying before the existence of the Condition, loseth the Legacy; and doth not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to his Heir, if it be a casual Condition: but if it be a potestative Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition depending upon the power of the Legatar, and not upon accident with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his power; or if left to an uncertain day, which is equivalent to a casual Condition: if so the Condition be in the Legatar's power, (unless he did all diligence to satisfie the same) he loseth the Legacy. But if the Condition fail not through his fault, as being offered and not accepted, or being imped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any third party; the Legacy is thereby transmitted to the Legatar's Heirs, who are only lyable for the interest of the Condition.</p>
                     <p>Legacies <hi>pure</hi> or <hi>to a certain day,</hi> are transmitted by the Death of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stator; especially if the Heir be entered, though the day be not come: <hi>quia cessit dies, sed non venit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="23">23. In the several Cases, by which Legacies are established, and transmis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, the property thereof is in the Person of the Legatar, if it be a special Legacy: but the possession thereof remains in the Heir, against whom the Legatar hath not only a personal Action, for payment or delivery of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy; but hath also a real Action of <hi>vendication,</hi> against him, and all other havers thereof, for delivety of the same. So <hi>fideicommisses,</hi> which are not conditional, are not alienable by the Heir, but are recoverable from every singular Successor.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. Conditions adjected to Legacies, or <hi>fideicommisses,</hi> are of diverse kinds; of which shortly observe; 1. That when Conditions are <hi>copulative,</hi> they must all be joyntly performed: or when diverse Conditions are severally set down in several places of the Testament. But if they be <hi>disjunctive,</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> formance of any of them is sufficient. 2. If the Condition be <hi>divisible,</hi> and performable by more persons; each performing his part, hath access to his Legacy. But if it be imposed upon one person, the performance of a part thereof, doth not give access to a proportionable part of the Legacy: but the Condition must be wholly performed, otherways there is no part of the Legacy due. 3. Conditions impossible <hi>in facto,</hi> as not being lawful, regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are void, and as not adjected. Amongst which that is accounted one, if Marriage be absolutely prohibited: which the <hi>Authenticks</hi> restricted only to
<pb facs="tcp:109710:343"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:109710:344"/>
                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:109710:344"/>
Maids, and found it lawful in the case of Widows, to adject such a Condition, <hi>si Titionubat;</hi> and therefore if the Legater married not to that Person, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy was not due.</p>
                     <p>In Legacies and <hi>fideicommissis,</hi> a false Narrative vitiats not: as when the <hi>efficient Cause,</hi> mentioned therein, was not true. for example; if a Legacy be left, bearing to have been for Services <hi>done,</hi> generally or particularly; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit these were not done, it is valid. But the expression of the <hi>final Cause</hi> implys a condition: and if it be not performed, the Legacy ceaseth, <hi>causâ non sequntâ,</hi> As when Legacies are left for such Uses, Services, or Deeds <hi>to be done.</hi> Legacies being gratuitous, are of the nature of Donations: and therefore are revocked by Ingratitude, <hi>Ipso facto;</hi> not only in reaching the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct, as if Inimity rose betwixt him and the Legatar; but even after his Death, as if he curse him, or endeavour to make him infamous. Yea, those things against the Heir, will be sufficient to take away the Legacy.</p>
                     <p>So much may serve for a Summary of the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, in the matter of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staments. As for the Succession of the Intestat, it being one, without distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of heretable and moveable Rights, we have spoken thereof before, <hi>Title Succession.</hi> We shall therefore only touch on those points which are common, in all Successions, by the <hi>Roman</hi> Law; <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Inventary, Collation</hi> of Goods, and Right of <hi>Accrescence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="25">25. The Inventary of Heretage, was a Repertory of every Particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein: and was contrary to the Rules of the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Law, <hi>l. si dotis nomine,</hi> 33. <hi>ff. soluto matrimonio;</hi> by which there was neither a Duty nor Benefit to the Heir by an Inventary. But the use thereof was introduced by <hi>Justinian</hi> in favour mainly of Heirs, and in some cases of Creditors, and Legatars. Of Heirs, that they might not be lyable for the Defunct's Debts <hi>in solidum,</hi> but <hi>secundim vires inventarij,</hi> according to the value of the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And this much in favour of the Creditors and Legatars, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance might not be imbesled. And therefore the making of the Inventary was appointed to be with great Solemnity, before a Judge, upon Citation of the Creditors, and Legatars, so far as they were certain; and publick Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation for the rest: and before famous Witnesses. And in place of the absent Legatars and Creditors, three persons were to be present, besides the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, of good Fame and Means. The Inventary behoved to be made within 30 dayes, after the Heir knew and could enter to the Heretage; and behov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be compleat within 60. dayes after the beginning thereof. The Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary not being thus made, the Heir was lyable to the Creditors for their whole Debts, and to the Legatars for their Legacies; without deduction of his <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidia.</hi> Neither could the Testator dispense with, or prohibite the making of the Inventary, in prejudice of the Creditors: but he might in prejudice of the Legatars, so as the <hi>Falcidia</hi> would be due, in that case, though the Inventary were not made.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. Collation is the Obligation of the nearest Heirs descending, to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate what the Defunct Parent bestowed upon them, by Donation, or To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, unto the Inheritance: that an equal Proportion or Division might be of the whole, amongst the Co-heirs.</p>
                     <p>The reason of this Collation was, the equality of interest and affection of Parents, to their Children, of the same Degree, and thence their presumed
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:109710:345"/>
Will, that these should enjoy equal benefite by their Parents. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it appeared, not to have been the Parents Will, Collation had no place. As if the thing were bestowed, with express exemption, ot prohibition of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or if it were left as a Legacy, or Donation, <hi>mortis causa:</hi> for thereby the Parents purpose appeared, to prefer that Child to the rest, even after the Parents Death.</p>
                     <p>Collation was competent amongst no other Heirs, than Descendents in the same Degree; and not amongst extraneous Heirs, institute, or substitute; or amongst Ascendents, or collateral Heirs: but only when the Co-heirs were by Testament, or from the Intestat, who are in the same Degree, as being all Children, or all Oyes, &amp;c. But if Children, or Grand-children were institute or substitute together, there was no Collation.</p>
                     <p>Amongst things bestowed upon Children by their Parents, their <hi>peculiar</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions and <hi>Tochers</hi> were comprehended: but not their Entertainment, or Expense of their Education. And therefore though one Child were elder, or longer entertained than the rest, or though more sumptuously; or though educated with more noble Accomplishments, and at a greater Rate, as being bred at Schools, Trades, Exercises, &amp;c. neither the Instruments requisite for these as Books, Cloaths, or the like, came under Collation, or was there any estimate or consideration thereof. The reason is, because Entertainment and Education is presumed to be according to the fitness and capacity of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whereunto a proportion is observed in all Societies and Communions. And therefore the Parents are presumed to have expended upon their Children proportionally, according to the capacity and excellency of their Spirits, and to render them fit to the services of their Generation: which as they have a Benefit, so have with them a large Burthen, and oft-times Hazard. Neither do Donations to Children for any special Service done to the Parents, come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Collarion: because these are not properly Donations, but Remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. The Right of Accrescence, is that whereby the Portion of an Heir, Legatar, or <hi>fideicommissar,</hi> befalleth to another: not by a new and several Succession, but by the first Succession, and as a part thereof. We have litle use of this: and therefore I shall be shorter, in the many and subtile Debates, agitat amongst the Doctors thereupon. For taking clearly up this Right, we must take notice, that Co-heirs by Testament, or Legatars, or <hi>

                        </hi> as to the <hi>matter:</hi> or whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>several,</hi> both as to <hi>words</hi> and <hi>matter.</hi> As if the Testator say, <hi>Titius and Mevius shall be my Heirs:</hi> there the copulative conjunction joyns them in the same Sentence, and they are joynt in the same Inheritance, without expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their distinct Portions; in which the Law interprets them equally insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. The like is, if he leave a Legacy, or <hi>fideicommissum,</hi> in the like terms. But where the Proportion is express, equal, or unequal, thus; Let <hi>Titius and Maevius be my Heirs equally;</hi> or, <hi>let Titius be Heir in one half, and Maevius and Caius in another half:</hi> here <hi>Caius</hi> and <hi>Maevius</hi> are conjunct in <hi>words</hi> and <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> but they are <hi>several</hi> from <hi>Titius,</hi> both as to <hi>words</hi> and <hi>matter.</hi> Or in the first case, <hi>Titius</hi> and <hi>Maevius</hi> are joyned in one <hi>Sentence,</hi> but separat as to the <hi>matter:</hi> because their Portions are severed and exprest. But if the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor say thus; <hi>I leave Titius my dwelling House,</hi> and say after, <hi>I leave Maevius the same dwelling House,</hi> there is no <hi>conjunction</hi> of <hi>words:</hi> because to both <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi>
                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:109710:345"/>
the same thing is left. In all these Cases there may be Substituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: we shall then set down the Right of Accrescence in the several Cases thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> in the Institution or Substitution of Heirs <hi>directly,</hi> there is place for Accrescence, whether the Co-heirs be <hi>conjunct</hi> or <hi>disjunct.</hi> The reason is, because of that principle of the Civil Law, that no man can die partly <hi>Testat</hi> and partly <hi>Intestat,</hi> except in Military Testaments. And therefore if any of the Co-heirs will not, or cannot enter; the Inheritance accresceth necessarly unto the other Co-heir, with its own burthen, whatever it be. Neither can the Heir reject that Portion, for the same reason: and if he enter before the other Heir be excluded, he hath no remedy, and can neither reject the whole nor a part: because he might, and should have seen to the other's Entry, with him, or else he enters on his peril.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any Heretage be ordered to be restored to such persons, severally in distinct Portions, if one of them will not, or cannot accept, that Portion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cresceth not to the other, but returns to the Heir. And so in Legacies, if there be a Substitution to any of the Heirs, the Portion accresceth not: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is place for the Substitute, who becomes Co-heir with the other Institute. This Accrescence is so necessary, that the Testator cannot prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite it, because he cannot die tested, <hi>pro parte.</hi> And therefore <hi>provisio hominis, non tollit provisionem legis,</hi> being as to the necessary Requisits, Essentials, and Solemnities of Law.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This proceedeth where the conjunction is only in <hi>words,</hi> if there be any <hi>disjunct</hi> both in <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>words:</hi> for then the Conjunction makes the Portions of the Conjuncts to accresce each to other, and not to those who are wholly disjunct. As if the Testator say, <hi>Let</hi> Titius <hi>be my Heir in the Half, and let</hi> Seius <hi>and</hi> Mevius <hi>be my Heirs equallie in the other Half:</hi> Here <hi>Seius</hi> and <hi>Mevius</hi> are conjunct in <hi>words</hi> and not in the <hi>matter;</hi> because their Portions are severed, and yet their Portions accresce to other, and not to <hi>Titius,</hi> who is wholly disjunct; and that from the <hi>presumed will</hi> of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct, as having consideratly put them in one sentence for that purpose. But this takes place only in Institution and Substitution of Heirs, that the Testator die not partly testat: but not in Legacies and <hi>Fidei commissis;</hi> for in these the Portion of the Conjuncts only in <hi>words</hi> not being accepted, doth accresce to none, but returneth to the <hi>Heir.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In al, Cases where there is <hi>conjunction</hi> in the <hi>matter,</hi> and not in <hi>words,</hi> there is place to Accrescence. As if the Testator say, <hi>I leave my dwelling House to</hi> Titius, <hi>I desire my Heir to restore the same dwelling House to</hi> Mevius; the Portion of either Party not accepting, accresceth to the other, and returneth not to the Heir. But if the Testator say, <hi>I leave my House to</hi> Titius, <hi>I leave the same House to</hi> Seius and Mevius, either indefinitly, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing their Portions; <hi>Seius</hi> and <hi>Mevius</hi> their Portions accresce each to other, and not to <hi>Titius:</hi> because if they and <hi>Titius</hi> be conjoyned in <hi>matter</hi> only, yet they are also conjoyned in <hi>word;</hi> and so the more Conjunctions prevail, by the <hi>presumed Will</hi> of the Defunct.</p>
                     <p>This kind of Accrescence is called by the Doctors, <hi>jus non decrescendi:</hi> because each party being provided to the whole, which cannot be effectual: therefore <hi>concursu partes faciunt,</hi> and the Deed is made effectual to them in part equally; if the Will of the Defunct appear by the Provision, not to take away the former wholly, as in many Cases it falleth out. And therefore in this Accrescence, if any burthen be adjected, if that Party accept not, his Portion aceresceth to the other, without that burthen: because the other enjoys his own Right, which was total, and becomes now effectual as to the whole: the impediment that retrenched it, being wholly taken off. But in all other Conjunctions, the Portion accresceth with its burthen. And therefore the accrescing Portion, as being special, may be rejected in Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies, and <hi>Fidei commissis:</hi> but it cannot be rejected in Institutions or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, lest the Testator should be intestat in part. But <hi>in jure non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crescendi,</hi> when Portions accresce, amongst those that are conjoyned in the <hi>matter</hi> only; the Accrescence is necessary, and the Portion accrescing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be rejected: because it befalleth by one integral Right, which either must be accepted wholly, or rejected wholly: and therein <hi>approbans non reprobat,</hi> no man can both approve, and disapprove, of the same individual thing.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. The Law and Customs of <hi>Scotland</hi> have reduced the matter of Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Succession in Moveables, much nearer to natural Equity, and made it much shorter and plainer than the <hi>Roman Law.</hi> For <hi>first,</hi> the <hi>Civil Law</hi> did lay the greatest weight, upon the free power of <hi>testing:</hi> which our Law hath so far abridged, that all Contracts, Pactions, and Provisions in relation to the Heretage of Persons living, are valide and ordinary, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts of Marriage &amp;c. And even <hi>pactum corvinum,</hi> in the worst sense, is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide: as when one, being provided by Contract of Marriage to be a Bairn in the House, sells that Portion in the Lifetime of the Contracter. Which was sustained, 6. of <hi>Julie</hi> 1630. Mr. <hi>James Aikenhead,</hi> contra <hi>Bothwel.</hi> So an Obligement to leave a Legacy, was found valide, and to stand as an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable Legacy: yet only to be taken out of the Defunct's part of his free Goods. 13. of <hi>Januarie</hi> 1631. <hi>Houstoune</hi> contra <hi>Houstoune.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="29">29. <hi>Secondly;</hi> Not only may the power of <hi>testing,</hi> be restricted by Pacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but is actually restricted by Law, to extend to no immoveable or heretable Right: which cannot be alienate, or affected upon Death-bed, or, which is equiparat, by Testament, though the Testator were in his <hi>liege pousty,</hi> or perfect Health. And that on good considerations: because Persons are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarly and still presumed to be weak, when affected with Sickness, and so not fit to alienat or affect things of their greatest concernment, as their Lands, Heretage, &amp;c. And because it is the great interest of Persons, to be free of all importunities when they come to their Death-bed. At which time they
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:109710:346"/>
are only capable of their Deads part, which is seldom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> and so they cannot affect their Lands, nor can they further dispose of their Goods, upon the Solicitation of Church-men, which is very powerful in the Popish Church, where Indulgences and Prayers for the Dead, to bring them out of Purgatory, are believed, and cannot but be forcible upon dying Men who then are more concerned for the safety of their Souls, than preservation of their Estates. And every where, the pressing Desires of Wives for themselves, or for such of their Children as they most affect, or of Children, Relations, and Friends, may have great impression upon the Sick for preserving their Peace and Quiet. So there remains nothing testable, but moveable Rights. What Rights are moveable, and what heretable, see in the beginning of the <hi>Title, Rights Real,</hi> which shall not be here repeted. Thence it is, that there is a total Separation of the Succession in heritable Rights, which are only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to Heirs; and in moveable Rights, as to which because they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted to Prelats, and their Officials, as being presumed most careful of Widows and Orphans, and that the Will of Defuncts should be effectual, who did appoint or confirm Persons to execute the Defunct's Will: the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons so appointed, or confirmed, were called Executors, and the whole move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Rights of Defuncts, whether tested on, or from the intested, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in Executory.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. The whole interest of Executory with us, is in the Office of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor; the Division of the Communion of Goods, betwixt Man and Wife, (whereby the Relict hath her Part;) the Saccession of Children, and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of Kin; or Legacies. There is with us, properly, no Institution or Substitution of Heirs. for albeit the Nomination of Executors, be in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functs power, in the first place; and doth resemble the Institution of Heirs, and may receive Substitutions, in the same way; yet is it not properly a Succession, but rather an Offce, which therefore hath a part of the Goods. Executors are Heirs <hi>in mobililus,</hi> and when Heirs only are exprest, Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are comprehended, <hi>quoad mobilia.</hi> If there be Nomination of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, with a material Legacy to another, it is a <hi>fideicommissiry</hi> Succession, to be restored to the universal Legatar. And Executors <hi>dative</hi> have also a <hi>fideicommissary</hi> Succession, which they must restore to the Wife, and nearest of Kin of the Defunct. So must Executors nominat, not being also univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Legatars, and being strangers: retaining only a third of Dead's part to themselves, for executing their Office. The greatest power of Defuncts, either by Testament, or otherwayes, is the power of legating by particular or univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Legacies. The interest of the Wife is not so much a Succession, as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, of that Communion of moveable Rights, which the Law stateth betwixt the Husband and her <hi>stante matrimonio,</hi> and which is dissolved by the Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Marriage: and so she taketh her share of the free Goods by way of Division.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. The Succession in Moveables from the <hi>intestat,</hi> belongeth to the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of Kin; who are the Defunct's whole <hi>Agnats,</hi> male or female, being the Kinsmen of the Defunct's Father's side, of the nearest Degree, without <hi>primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture</hi> or Right of Representation: wherein those joyned to the Defunct by both Bloods, do exclude the <hi>Agnats</hi> by one Blood.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. The Line of Succession in Moveables, is first, the nearest Descendents, male or female, in the same Degree, equally; whether Sons or Daughters, without Right of Representation. So that if the Defunct, the time of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceass
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:109710:347"/>
had two Daughters, though he had an Oye by a Son; the Daughters will exclude the Oye, albeit the Defunct had nothing but Moveables.</p>
                     <p>The next Degree of the nearest of Kin is, Brothers and Sisters german: and failing these, Brothers or Sisters by the Father's side only, or their near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Descendents of the same Degree, without Right of Representation.</p>
                     <p>As to the third Degree of Succession in Moveables, failing Descendents, and Brothers and Sisters, and their Descendents; the Question is, Whether the Father surviving, will exclude his own Brother, or if there be any place for Ascendents, in the Succession of Moveables? Such Cases occur rarely: and I have not observed it debated, or decyded. It is but of late since the like Case hath fallen in the Succession of Heirs, and Heritable Rights: wherein our Custom hath according to the course of the Law of Nature, found the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be Heir to his Son, and not the Father-brother, or any of his Descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; and in that have differed from the Custom of <hi>England.</hi> And there is no reason why, if the Question should occurr, that the like should not be done in Moveables.</p>
                     <p>The next Degree is, the Father's Brethren and Sisters german; which fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Father's Brethren and Sisters by the same Grand-father, and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendents, in the next Degree. In all which both Bloods exclude one Blood. And if there be no <hi>Agnat</hi> or Kinsfolk found, who can instruct their propin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Blood; the Goods become <hi>caduciary,</hi> and confiscat, and belong to the King, as <hi>ultimus haeres;</hi> who, and his Donatar, have the same interest, that the nearest of Kin would have had. <hi>Vide Title, Confiscation,</hi> Section <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus hares.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Children <hi>in familia,</hi> have not only the common Right, as nearest of Kin; but have their <hi>legittime Portion,</hi> called the Bairns part: in which their Father cannot by Testament, Legacy, or Donation <hi>'mortis causâ,</hi> prejudge them; or by any other Deed, on Death-bed.</p>
                     <p>By the Premises it appears that the whole power of Defuncts, as to Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in their Moveables, is to nominate Executors and give Legacies.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. The Nomination of Executors, is properly called a Testament, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions thereto, or Alterations thereof, are Codicils. Legacies may be left, whether there be Testaments or not; and either in the Testament, Codicils, or apart: but all is ambulatory during the Defunct's Life, and may be taken away expresly, or implicitely, by posterior or derogatory Deeds; unless the Defunct be obliged by Contract, <hi>inter vivos,</hi> not to alter the same. In which case Contract and Paction, doth so far over-rule the power of <hi>testing;</hi> that posterior Deeds whether expresly, or implicitely altering, would be ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, like to that Obligement, <hi>to leave a Legacy,</hi> which was found an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Legacy without further Solemnity. <hi>January</hi> 30. 1631. <hi>Houstoun</hi> contra <hi>Houstoun.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="34">34. The effect of Testaments being so small, the Solemnities thereof are no other, than what are requisit to accomplish any other Writ. For two Witnesses suffice, and if the Testament be <hi>holograph,</hi> it is valid. Or if the Testator cannot, or be not able through Sickness, to write, a Testament will be sufficient by a Notar and two Witnesses: notwithstanding the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:109710:347"/>
1579. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. requiring to Writs of importance, two Notars and four Witnesses; which holds not in Testaments, though containing matter of great importance. 18. of <hi>January</hi> 1623. <hi>Bog</hi> contra <hi>Robert Hepburn.</hi> Yea Ministers are authorized as Notars, in the case of Testaments. <hi>Par.</hi> 1584. <hi>cap.</hi> 133. The reason here of is; because Ministers are ordinarly with sick Persons the time of their Death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nuncupative</hi> Testaments are not of force in <hi>Scotland.</hi> For though Legacies left within an hundred pounds, may be <hi>nuncupative,</hi> without Writ; yet the Nomination will not so subsist, nor be respected by the Commissaries. And therefore a verbal Testament, taking away a formal Legacy, subscrived but by initial Letters; was not sustained, though made at Sea, and so in a Case of necessity: and not admitted to be proven by Witnesses in the Ship. <hi>Feb.</hi> 18. 1631. <hi>Houstoun</hi> contra <hi>Houstoun.</hi>

                     <p n="35">35. The effect of Testaments is not greater, though made in <hi>England,</hi> the Testator residing there: and so extends not to an Heretable Sum due in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> left in Legacy by the Testator, being a <hi>Scots-man.

Neither do nuncupative Testaments of <hi>Scots-men,</hi> though residing, <hi>animo remanendi,</hi> abroad, and dying there; have any effect with us: albeit nuncupative Testaments be valid according to the Law and Custom of that Place. For albeit the Custom of the Place, may supply the Solemnity of any Writs, or Evidents, for instructing a Right; as Writs made abroad by Nottaries, and Tabellions, are valid, though not done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which requires two Notars and four Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, in Writs of importance: yet the Custom of those Places cannot consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute any Right of Succession, not allowed by the Law of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And therefore <hi>William Schaw,</hi> Factor and Residenter in <hi>London,</hi> having lived and died there, in the House of one <hi>Mary Lewins,</hi> who had confirmed, in <hi>England,</hi> a nuncupative Testament, whereby he had designed her as Executrix and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatrix; and the nearest of Kin of the said <hi>William,</hi> having confirmed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Executors to him, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the competition being betwixt them: the Lords preferred the Executors confirmed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and had no respect to the nuncupative Testament, as having no effect by the Law of <hi>Scotland.

                     <p n="36">36. The like Solemnities will be sufficient for Codicils and Legacies. A nuncupative Legacy within an hundred pounds, is probable by Witnesses. <hi>November</hi> 24. 1609. <hi>Russel</hi> contra <hi>July</hi> 7. 1629. <hi>Wallace</hi> contra <hi>Mure.</hi> Where a greater Legacy, left by word, restricted to an hundred pounds, was found so probable.</p>
                     <p n="37">37. The power of <hi>Testing</hi> is competent to all Persons, who have the use of Reason, though Minors, having Curators not consenting: Wives cled with Husbands, without their consent; Persons interdicted, without consent of the Interdicters: but not to Pupils, Idiots, furious Persons in their Furiosity: neither to Bastards, not having lawful Issue, or <hi>testamenti factionem,</hi> by the Kings Gift; as in the former Case, <hi>Wallace</hi> contra <hi>Mure.</hi> Vide <hi>Tit.

                     <p n="38">38. Legacies are either particular or universal, general or special. Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Legacies are when the whole Moveables, in so far as is in the Defunct's
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:109710:348"/>
disposal, and not left by particular Legacies, is <hi>legat.</hi> and so it is <hi>legalum per universitatem,</hi> and like to the Succession of an Heir.</p>
                     <p>Special Legacies are, where some Individual is left, as such a Horse, Cloaths, &amp;c. or such a Sum due by such a Person: whereby the <hi>Property</hi> is stated in the Legatar, and at most, but the <hi>Possession</hi> or Custody in the Executor. And therefore the Legatar may pursue for Delivery, or Payment of the special Legacy, against the Havers or Debitors: but he must call the Executor, that his interest may be preserved; least the Debts exhaust even the special Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Upon which consideration, the Lords sustained not a Pursuit upon a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Legacy, leaving a Sum due by such a Person, in such a Bond, pursued against the Debitor; the Executor not being called. <hi>March</hi> 9. 1627. <hi>Forre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> contra <hi>Clerk</hi> And before, the Pursuit against the Debitor, at the Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar's instance, was simply repelled; not being against the Executor. <hi>February</hi> 4. 1623.

                     <p>Legacies may be left, not only in Testaments, or Codicils; but where there is none: or where there is in Contract;, Letters, or Tickets apart; though the Legacies were not in the Confirmation. <hi>December</hi> 1. 1629.

Legacies, and Donations in contemplation of Death, or done on Death bed, albeit as <hi>inter vivos;</hi> yet being of Moveables, as Bonds, Assignations, or Gifts of Money, or Goods on Death-bed: have the like effect, and are only effectual, as to the Defuncts free Goods at his disposal, which is called the Dead's part. And if the whole <hi>Legacies,</hi> exceed Dead's part of the free Geere; regularly they are abated proportionally. Wherein there is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, nor Priviledge granted to Legacies left <hi>ad pias causas:</hi> as for building of a Kirk, delivered by the Defunct long ere he dyed; which suffered pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable Defalcation with the ordinary Legacies, <hi>July</hi> 8. 1630.

Else why should he leave that Legacy more specially, than the rest? Which is more clear in things left in Legacy; as when a Horse, Sword, Cloaths &amp;c. are left; and the other Legacies are not special: there seems no reason, upon failing of the other Legacies, to burthen the special Legacies; abated they cannot be, directly, not being <hi>Quantities</hi> but <hi>Bodies.</hi> The same reason is in Sums specially legat: for though it may appear that the Defunct's reason may be, to leave such a special Debt, to such a Legatar, not as a <hi>

If they exceed the Defunct's part, they suffer all, proportional Abatement, except such as are special Legacies. For if one Thing, or Sum be Specially legat to one Person, and by a posterior Writ, be legat to another; the posterior Legacy takes place, and is a Revocation of the former; and they do not come in together, <hi>concursu partes facere;</hi> as they would do, if left in one Writ, by the <hi>Roman</hi> Law; and each Legatar would have but a Half.

Or whether it be sufficient that the Child be <hi>forisfamiliat,</hi> and provided by the Father, albeit the said Provision be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted expresly <hi>in satisfaction of the Portion natural,</hi> and Bairns part? Or whether none be accompted <hi>forisfamiliat,</hi> to exclude them from the Bairns part; unless they discharge the same, or accept a provision <hi>in satisfaction thereof?</hi> There be probable reasons for all the three parts: but the main Doubt, is upon the last two, Whether Provision be sufficient, as being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, to be given and accepted, in satisfaction of the <hi>Portion natural.</hi> So much the rather that in Contracts of Marriage, Fathers of times use to adject a <hi>Clause,</hi> That the Child Contracted shall be <hi>a Bairn in the House:</hi> which would be superfluous, if the Child would be a Bairn of the House, unless the Bairns part were expresly discharged. And therefore Tochers, and Provisions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither expresly <hi>in satisfaction</hi> of the Bairns part, nor yet with provision, <hi>That that Child shall be a Bairn in the House;</hi> must be holden to be given, and accepted, <hi>in satisfaction of the Portion natural.</hi> Which is confirmed by a Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion observed by <hi>Dury. February</hi> 1. 1622. <hi>Janet Eleis</hi> having pursued the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, af umquhil <hi>Patrick Eleis</hi> her Father, for her share, with the rest of the four Bairns, in the said Patrick's House; and that by a <hi>Clause,</hi> in her Contract of Marriage with <hi>John Smith,</hi> afterwards Provest of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> providing her to be Portioner, of her Fathers free Geer, with the rest of his Bairns, provided the rest were <hi>forisfamiliat,</hi> and provided likeways by their Father. In which Case, the said <hi>Janet</hi> was found to have her Share, albeit two of the Bairns were not married, but only provided. Whereby it appears, that the Lords accounted Provision as <hi>Forisfamiliation.</hi> Yet the contrary opinion is more probable, <hi>viz.</hi> That nothing can take away the Bairns Legit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, unless it be discharged. And that a Presumption, of accepting a Tocher, or Portion, <hi>in satisfaction,</hi> will not be sufficient, unless it bear <hi>in satisfaction of the Portion natural</hi> and Bairns part. 1. Because the <hi>legittime</hi> is so strongly founded, in the Law of Nature, and positive Law, that Presumption or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture cannot take it off. 2. This is more suitable to the Civil Law, which we follow in this Case, whereby the difference betwixt Children, being <hi>eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipat,</hi> or <hi>forisfamiliat,</hi> or <hi>sui</hi> under the paternal power, and in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is taken off as to the Succession and Legittime. And therefore there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced <hi>collatio bonorum,</hi> whereby all that the <hi>emancipat</hi> or <hi>forisfamiliat</hi> received from their Father, must fall in under the Accompt. So their Tochers, Gifts, Provisions &amp;c. are imputed in a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Legittime;</hi> but are never presumed to be the <hi>whole,</hi> unless it were exprest. 3. <hi>Collatio bonorum</hi> is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary with us, by which the Tocher of the married Children comes in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of the Bairns part: which could not take place, if those Tochers were presumed to be <hi>in satisfaction</hi> of the Bairns part, unless the Clause <hi>to be a Bairn in the House,</hi> were expresly added.

Which is so much the more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that oftimes Children are provided to be <hi>Bairns of the House,</hi> after the rest are likewise provided. So that when that Condition is not adjected, the meaning is, that without consideration of the Tocher, or former Provision, the Children by that Clause should have equal share.

                     <p>Hence ariseth another Branch of the former Question, Whether if all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be <hi>forisfamiliat</hi> and provided; but have not discharged their Portion natural, or Bairns part, or accepted the provision in satisfaction thereof: If in that case they will have access to a Portion natural, in prejudice of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lict and Legatars? I say, if they be all provided, because if some be in the Family unmarried and unprovided, the Relict and Legatars will be no more prejudged, if all the Bairns come in, or only some of them, because many, or few, they will have all the Bairns part and no more. The former Case, <hi>Ross</hi> contra <hi>Kelly,</hi> seems to bring in the Children, though all <hi>forisfamiliat,</hi> to a Legittime with the Relict: because there was but one Child, and she marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and tochered. Only it is observed, that her Provision was <hi>in satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her Mother's part:</hi> so that albeit she was married, yet it appears that she was not provided, <hi>ex bonis paternis,</hi> but only <hi>ex bonis maternis.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it remains yet unclear: and there seems much reason that the Wifes inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest being a division of her Communion of Goods, she should not devide with them who are out of the Family and provided, unless they had a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <hi>to be Bairns in the Family.</hi> By the common Practick also, Commissaries divide Executory in two, where there is a Wife, and the whole Children mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and so presumed to be provided.

For the Son of that Sister was found to have his Share, albeit the Office of Executory accresced to the two Sisters surviving, and with the Office, the Third of Dead's part. <hi>Feb.</hi> 11. 1662. The like was found since betwixt Dame <hi>Agnes Maxwel</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Wintoun.</hi> And after full Debate, it hath been deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, that the Jnterest of the nearest of Kin, is only extended to those who are <hi>existent nearest of Kin</hi> the time of the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the Defunct's Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, which is <hi>aditio haereditatis mobilium.</hi> And the Executor is <hi>haeres fidei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commissarius,</hi> who must restore to the Relicts and Bairns, their part of the free Geer, Debts deduced; and to the nearest of Kin, whether Bairns or any other, <hi>in proximo gradu,</hi> the time of Confirmation, the Deads part, the Legacies deduced: reserving to the Executors nominat, if they have no <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> interest, a Third of the Dead's part, unexhausted by Legacies. So that the Executor <hi>adit haereditatem,</hi> not for himself only, but for all Parties hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing interest. Which is suitable to the Entry of Heirs in heritable Rights: and whereby <hi>jus sanguinis,</hi> of the nearest of Kin, is not prejudged; seing immediatly after the Defunct's Death, Edicts may be served, and the nearest of Kin will be confirmed Executor, if a <hi>Nomination</hi> be not produced. And though any of the nearest of Kin, should die before a Confirmation can be expede; it is an <hi>extraordinary contingencie,</hi> which Law regardeth not. And the Act of Parliament 1617. which establisheth the Right of the nearest of Kin, by making Executors comptable to them, presupposeth a Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:109710:352"/>
before the interest of the nearest of Kin be established. But though the Executor die, before the Testament be execute, there must be an Executor <hi>ad non executa,</hi> who will be comptable to those, who were nearest of Kin, the time of the first Confirmation. And if any of them die, before they attain their Share; their Bairns or nearest of Kin will have no Right, till they confirm the Testament of the nearest of Kin deceassed, and give up an Inventary, of what will be due to the Defunct's nearest of Kin, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors of the prior Defunct. Neither will the Share of any Bairn, or nearest of Kin, deceassing without Children, belong to the Surviver <hi>jure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crescendi:</hi> who will not represent them <hi>passivè,</hi> and be lyable to the Debts. And therefore must be confirmed as Executors to them: and thereby have both an <hi>active</hi> and <hi>passive</hi> Title. All which was found. <hi>Feb.</hi> 14. 1677.

By the premisses it is evident how Executory is to be divided, what Dead's part is, and how it may be affected with Legacies, or Deeds of the Defunct in Testament, or on Death-bed. For first, all Persons who have no Wife, or Children <hi>unforisfamiliat,</hi> without Husband, (and Wives, though they have Children) have the whole disposal of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: and may leave Legacies, and Donations of their moveable Estates, and do other Deeds on Death-bed, equivalent to their free Goods: so that Dead's part is the <hi>whole.</hi> But if the Defunct had a Wife, and Children <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forisfamiliat,</hi> then the Executory is <hi>tripartite:</hi> and Dead's part is a Third, the Wife's part is a Third, and the Bairns part a Third. But if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct have a Wife and no Children <hi>unforisfamiliat,</hi> the Executory is <hi>bipartite:</hi> the Dead's part is a Half, and the Wife's part another Half. Or if he have Children <hi>unforisfamiliat,</hi> and no Wife, the Executory is also <hi>bipartite:</hi> and in either Case, his Legacies, or Deeds on Death-bed, may be equivalent to the Half of his free Geer. And if the Commissaries by error or mistake make the Division otherwayes, none are prejudged thereby, who are not <hi>called,</hi> and <hi>compearing:</hi> but may summarly, without Reduction of the <hi>Confirmation,</hi> be admitted to claim their Share. Which was so found. <hi>Feb.</hi> 27. 1627. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net Ross</hi> contra <hi>Marion Kello.</hi>

                     <p>Children have a threefold interest in their Father's Executory. <hi>First,</hi> their Bairns part, wherein their Father cannot prejudge them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in Dead's part, whereby they have Title to the Office of Executory, if the Defunct nominat none.

                        <hi>VITIOUS Intromission</hi> is only a <hi>Passive</hi> Title, making the Intrometter lyable to all the Defunct's Debts, <hi>passive:</hi> but is not an <hi>active</hi> Title, whereby the Intrometter can call and pursue <hi>activè.</hi> For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon there is no ordinary Action com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent at the instance of the Intrometter, against his Complices, for mutual Relief: but the Intrometter paying, must only make use of the Creditor's name to give him a Title, upon the Creditor's Assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; which will necessitat the other Intrometters to satisfie but only <hi>pro rata,</hi> they alledging that it is to the behoose of another Intrometter, whose part at least must be abated.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This is the largest passive Title, extending not only to those who have relation to the Defunct, and have a Title to be his Heir or Successor in move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables; but to any Stranger intrometting without any interest: whereas <hi>gestio pro haerede,</hi> and Successor <hi>titulo lucrativo post contractum debitum,</hi> can be inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to none but apparent Heirs, <hi>qui precipiunt haereditatem.</hi> But not only the Children and nearest of Kin intrometting, are lyable <hi>in solidum</hi> for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct's whole Debts, but any other Person having no legal interest of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession. Which is peculiar to this and no other Nation, and not without ground.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The rise and reason of this passive Title is, because Moveables are more easily abstracted from Creditors of Defuncts, than their Lands, or Profits thereof, which every one will not attain without a Title, at least without being apparent Heir therein. But if Defuncts Moveables might be medled with without Confirmation, or making Inventary upon Oath, and no further hazard than single R eitution; there would never be a Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but both Creditors and Orphans would be highly prejudged by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting and concealling the Moveables of Defuncts. And to remedy this, our Law hath introduced this passive Title, that without Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation or other Title, the Medler shall be lyable <hi>in solidum</hi> to Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Vitious Intromission</hi> is so far extended, that one Intrometter may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veened singly <hi>in solidum,</hi> and his alledging other Intrometters will not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berat him <hi>pro tanto. July</hi> 12. 1628. <hi>Moristoun</hi> contra Laird of <hi>Frendraught.</hi> But where more persons (<hi>viz.</hi> two) were conveened together as Vitious Intrometters, and the Probation instructed that both intrometted; they were not found lyable <hi>in solidum,</hi> but <hi>equallie,</hi> without consideration of the proportion of their Intromission. <hi>November</hi> 16. 1626. <hi>James Chalmers</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra <hi>Marshal</hi> and <hi>White.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Whether Vitious Intromission be competent by Exception, or only by Action, is not yet come the length of a current Custom. But there are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:109710:359"/>
favouring either side. As if any person pursue the Executor Heir or Cautioner of a Defunct, the Question is, Whether they may except, That the Pursuer is Vitious Intrometter with the Defuncts Goods, and thereby is lyable to pay his Debts, and so is Debitor aswell as Creditor, &amp; <hi>confusu ne tollitur obligatio?</hi> It was decided <hi>affirmativè, Hope, Exception. Lindsay</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra <hi>Douglass:</hi> but it was decided <hi>negativè, November</hi> 20. 1630. <hi>Pride</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra <hi>Thomson.</hi> And the Negative seems more favourable, not to extend this burthensom and odious passive Title <hi>ultra <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</hi> And therefore Vitious Intromission may alwayes be purged by Confirmation, before intenting of the Pursuer's Cause. To which it is more consonant that they who alledge Viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Intromission, should not be permitted to <hi>except</hi> but <hi>pursue:</hi> that before the Pursuit the Intrometter may have liberty to purge. It was so found in the Case of an Assigny pursuing, against whom the Debitor pursued alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the Assigny could be in no better case than the Cedent who was Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Intrometter with the Debitor's Moveables, and so was both Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Creditor. <hi>Januarie</hi> 20. 1671. Captain <hi>Ramsay</hi> contra <hi>William Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Vitious Intromission was also sustained generally, without necessity to the Pursuer to condescend on Particulars: seing the Libel bare the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender to be <hi>universal Intrometter</hi> with the Defunct's Moveables, which is the ordinary Stile of this passive Title. In which Case the Defender was found obliged to condescend upon particular Moveables which were the Debitor's, and intrometted with by him by a Title. <hi>Januarie</hi> 20. 1630. <hi>Adam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> contra <hi>Ireland.</hi> But if the Pursuit be against the Defender as <hi>Vitious Intrometter,</hi> he ought to condescend upon the <hi>special</hi> Intromission; unless he refer it to the Defender's Oath, who knows his own Intromission and must either adject a <hi>Quality</hi> where competent, or propone a Defense, to purge the <hi>Vitiositie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. This passive Title being so large, wants not its own <hi>Limitations</hi> and <hi>Exceptions.</hi> As first, it is only effectual to Creditors, and not to Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, or any other Party, who cannot pursue upon this ground, nor for any further than is truely intrometted with, in those Cases where these can pursue Intrometters, as in <hi>special Legacies,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Intromission must be <hi>universal:</hi> not that the Intrometter must medle with <hi>all</hi> the Defunct's Moveables, but must medle <hi>quasi prr universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem,</hi> because Heritage is <hi>per universitatem.</hi> And he that medles with a Flock of Sheep, medles <hi>per universitatem:</hi> yet many of the Flock may be medled with by others, but what remains being still the Flock, he is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said to medle with the Flock. And so Intremission with <hi>one</hi> thing, or some <hi>small</hi> thing will not infer this passive Title, to make the Intrometter lyable. So a Relict was not found lyable <hi>in solidum,</hi> as having intromet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Crop of five Bolls of Corn, eating of four or five Sheep, and detaining in her possession thretty more; not upon the accompt of her being Relict, or of <hi>necessary</hi> Intromission, but for that her Intromission was not <hi>Universal. December</hi> 5. 1623. <hi>Scot</hi> contra <hi>Levingstoun.</hi> But if <hi>universal</hi> Intromis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion be libelled, though the Probation be not so ample, yet if it reach Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of diver Kinds, and these of moment; it was found enough. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuarie</hi> 12. 1623. <hi>Bruce</hi> contra Where fewer Kinds of less value proven, were found sufficient <hi>reo absente.</hi> And Vitious Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission was inserred, by the Son of a Wright's continuing to work with

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> by the Servants of a Coal-heugh continuing to use the Instruments of the Coal-work for some time, without determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether those Instruments were moveable or not: but the Heir was not found Vitious Intrometter thereby. <hi>June</hi> 9. 1680. <hi>William Brain</hi> contra the Earl of <hi>Lothian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. It seems to be on this ground, that it is a legal Desense against Viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Intromission, to alledge, That there are Executors confirmed to the Defunct; whether it be the Intrometter, or any other, though the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metter derive no Right from these Executors, nor had no Warrant of Intromission. Because Executors being Universal Intrometters, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more Universal Intrometters severally: and therefore there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be both Executors, and other Universal Vitious Intrometters. And albeit more persons may be conveened as Vitious Universal Intrometters, yet one or other of them must be understood to be sole Vitious Intrometter; or otherwise that they all joyn in Universal Intromission.</p>
                     <p>Confirmation of Executors was found sufficient to elide Vitious Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, albeit after the Intromission the Intrometter caused a person wholly insolvent be confirmed and find a Cautioner <hi>insolvendo,</hi> and the Intrometter payed the <hi>Quote,</hi> and was at all the Expense. <hi>July</hi> 28. 1620. <hi>Tenent</hi> contra <hi>Tenent.</hi> Spots. <hi>Universal Intrometters. Stevenson</hi> contra <hi>Paterson.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. Some have questioned, Whether Confirmation of Executors Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors could purge Vitious Intromission, seing Creditors do only confirm for their own satisfaction, and not to execute the Defunct's Executory, and so need confirm no more than will satisfied themselves. But I have not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served it repelled, nor is the difference convincing. For albeit Executors Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors confirm to their own behoofe, yet are they universal Intrometters, and must confirm all they know, and so make Inventary: albeit their interest to be Executors, be but <hi>qua Creditors.</hi> And albeit they be not lyable for so exact Diligence as others, it was found relevant to exclude Vitious Intromission, That an Executor Creditor was confirmed. <hi>June</hi> 20. 1629. <hi>Douglass</hi> contra <hi>Touris. January</hi> 20. 1663. <hi>Stevenson</hi> contra <hi>Ker</hi> and others. The matter may be more dubious now, since the late Act of <hi>Sederunt,</hi> whereby Executors Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors are not obliged to confirm all they know, or make faith on the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; but so much as they think may secure their Debts: and therefore other Executors may be confirmed. So that the danger and inconveniency of Viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Intromission remains, and Executors Creditors so confirming, are not Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Intrometters.

Confirmation of Executors regularly, is not relevant to purge vitious Intromission, whether by the Intrometter, or others, in so far as concerns those Creditors, who had used Citation and Diligence against the vitious Intrometters before Confirmation, whose Sentences are drawn back to their Citation: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>si non sint in mora,</hi> and so <hi>est jus iis quaesitum,</hi> at least <hi>inchoatum,</hi> before Confirmation. <hi>Decem.</hi> 12. 1609. <hi>Durtie</hi> contra <hi>Clerk.</hi>

If the Creditor hath used Citation shortly after the Defunct's Death, there being no competent time to confirm, neither any time limited in Law other than year and day, after which the Executor must be comptable to relieve the Heir: therefore unless the Intrometter were meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>praedo</hi> having no interest, as neither being Wife, Bairn, nearest of Kin, or having a Disposition without delivery; it is sufficient to confirm after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting of the Creditor's Cause, being within year and day. In which case the Intrometter confirming will be lyable <hi>secundum vires inventarii,</hi> albeit only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veened as <hi>Intrometter,</hi> not as <hi>Executor:</hi> without necessity of a new Process.
