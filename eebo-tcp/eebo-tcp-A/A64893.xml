            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Captain Generall by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
over all the Forces
in <hi>England,</hi> as was Voted by
both Houses the 12 day of
<hi>Iuly 1642.</hi> protesting to live and dye with
him. And by the first of <hi>August</hi> following,
his Excellency had 10000 Men, which hee
caused to be committed to Officers, and
drawne into Regiments, and so marched
immediatly into the Field.</p>
            <p>The 23 of <hi>October</hi> next after was a very
great Battell fought betweene <hi>Keynton</hi> and
<hi>Edge-hill</hi> by his Excellency and his Army;
and that of the Kings led by his Majesty:
At which time his Excellencies army killed
the Kings Generall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Earle of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> the
Lord <hi>Auboney,</hi> Sir <hi>Edmund Verney,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

Kings Ensignes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:44405:4"/>
His Excellency was in the battell enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
against a great Army, where was the
King in person, and Princes, Dukes, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesses,
Earles, Viscounts, Barons, Knights,
and Gentlemen of all orders, who engaged
themselves against him; yet his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
Army fought most chearfully by the
example of their Generall, whose undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
courage put life into every man.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the Kings Forces being come
up to <hi>Branford</hi> and <hi>Henley</hi> in November,
his Excellency after severall engagements
with them, and assistance comming to him
from the City of <hi>London,</hi> who protested to
live and die with him; he forced the Kings
Army to retreat to <hi>Oxford</hi> with the losse of
above two hundred men.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Aprill, Anno 1643,</hi> his Excellency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
recruted, marched againe into the field
with his Army, and took the Towne and
Garrison of <hi>Redding</hi> from his Majesty, and
after severall defeats given to parties of the
Kings Army hee took the Town of <hi>Ciren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After which his Majesties whole Army
being againe drawne into the field, his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
marched up to them, the Queene
came up to the Kings Army, and a great
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44405:5"/>
party with her to strengthen his Majesties
Army against the Earle of <hi>Essex;</hi> But his
Excellencie fought with them neare <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
where he killed five Lords, and divers
others of quality, the King with the losse of
500 men, retreated to <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> whither
the Queene came to him.</p>
            <p>In <hi>May 1644,</hi> his Excellency desired
the Parliament to have a Committee to
reside with him in the Army, and his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
made preparations to the Field, and
presently besieged <hi>Oxford</hi> where the King
then was, and at the beginning of <hi>Iune</hi> got
away towards the West, the King and the
Prince being gone to <hi>Exeter</hi> with the Lord
<hi>Paulet,</hi> and others; his Excellency having
taken divers Prisoners, drew his Army af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them; the Queen fled over into <hi>France;</hi>
his Excellency tooke in the West divers
persons in severall places, amongst which
many of quality, and divers Garrisons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In</hi> Iune <hi>his Excellency secured</hi> Weymouth,
Taunton-Deane, Wareham, Bavonestable,
Mount Stanford <hi>neare</hi> Plimouth, Plimton,
Saltash, <hi>and</hi> Lanceston.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>Iuly</hi> his Excellency gave a defeat
to <hi>Greenvill</hi> neare <hi>Lestithiell</hi> in <hi>Cornwell,</hi>
and took 100 Prisoners, and killed 300 up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

the place, and then tooke <hi>Tocester</hi> and
<hi>Foy,</hi> and did beat them from <hi>Newbridge,</hi>
still taking more Prisoners daily.</p>
            <p>In <hi>August</hi> his Excellency fell upon the
Cornish Brigade neare <hi>Saltash,</hi> and brake
through their Army, slew many of them
upon the place, tooke 300 Prisoners and 4
Drakes.</p>
            <p>Then the Kings whole Army, <hi>Maurices</hi>
and <hi>Greenvils</hi> were drawn into the field in
Battalia, in number almost 20000 men
neare <hi>Lestithiell,</hi> where his Excellency
daily skirmished with them, killed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
took prisoners Colonell <hi>Champernoone,</hi>
who was sore wounded, and divers more,
many lying 6 and eight in a heap, and upon
desire his Excellency granted them leave
(at a parly) to bury their dead.</p>
            <p>On Saturday the 24 of <hi>August 1644,</hi> his
Excellency appointed Major Gen. <hi>Whitcot,</hi>
and Colonell <hi>Ware</hi> to guard the rear of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stithiell,</hi>
and make a damme to stop provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions

and took prisoners, 1 Colonell, 2 Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,

            <p>In the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
notwithstanding that hee was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred
by the enemy, yet preserved both
himself and his men, forced the enemy from
the Sea-coasts, and got safe to the Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall;
his Horse not above 3000, brake
thorough the Kings Army; and his Foot
not above 6000, though incompassed with

IN the yeare 1643, when the Kingdome

Generall of the Associated Counties, <hi>viz.
Norfolke, Suffolke,</hi> and <hi>Essex;</hi> and first,
in <hi>September 1643,</hi> intelligence comming
to <hi>London,</hi> to the Parliament, that <hi>Linne-Regis,</hi>
a very strong and considerable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime
Town in <hi>Norfolke,</hi> was broken out
into Rebellion against the Parliament;
This most Noble Earle Mustering up his

suffered not his honest <hi>Scottish</hi> soulders

wherein hee took 300 Armes and

            <p>15. And in <hi>December 1645,</hi> this most

            </head>
            <p>1. THis renowned Souldier and brave
Commander, Marshall-Generall
<hi>Skippon,</hi> served with much deserved ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in himselfe and reputation to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country, in the <hi>Belgicke</hi>-Warres, in
the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> under that most renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Prince of <hi>Orange, Grave Maurice</hi> of
<hi>Nassaw</hi> for the space of—yeeres.</p>
            <p>2. After this, returning again into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the Martiall-spirited Sparkes of the
famous Artillery-Garden of the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
City of <hi>London,</hi> to his no little
honour, chose him their pious and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
Gimnasiarchus, or Captain of the said
Artillery-Garden to exercise and instruct
them in the exactest rules of Martiall Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
where he, thus, continued with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44405:29"/>
much honour and love for the space of—
yeeres.</p>
            <p>3. Afterward about the yeere 1642, at
the beginning of our most unhappy Civill-Warres,
the King being, then, in discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
departed from his Parliament, and at
<hi>Yorke;</hi> and there understanding that the
Parliament had set the Militia on foot, for
the safe-guard of the Kingdome, and more
particularly in the City of <hi>London;</hi> and
that the Parliament (at the desire of the
said City) had made this famous and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
old expert Souldier, their Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
of all the City forces, in <hi>May 1642.</hi> He
presently directed a letter to him, to require
and command his personall attendance on
his Majesty at <hi>Yorke,</hi> all excuses being set
apart. But, he most loyally acquainting
the Parliament therewith, was by both
Houses of Parliament inhibited from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and by an Ordinance of Parliament or
three severall Votes for his indempnity, in
both Houses, was cleered from any legall or
disloyall disobedience to the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
therein.</p>
            <p>4. In <hi>November, 1642</hi> this noble and
renowned brave Christian souldier was
made Serjeant Major Generall of all the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44405:29"/>
Parliaments forces for the defence of the
Kingdome, under the most noble and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
Lord Generall <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of
<hi>Essex,</hi> his Excellency deceased.</p>
            <p>5. About <hi>December 1643,</hi> this brave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
with a party of impregnable-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and renowned <hi>Romane</hi>-like <hi>London</hi>
souldiers, and valiant and Victorious <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton</hi>
forces, most couragiously stormed
<hi>Grafton</hi> house in <hi>Northamptonshire</hi> (a place
of very great strength and consequence,
and the Queenes own Joynter) which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
much hard service and many most furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
assaults upon it, they most Victoriously
obtained, and took prisoners therein, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
Sir <hi>Iohn Digby</hi> (a ranke and most
active Papist, and Brother to that arch
Traytor, <hi>George</hi> Lord <hi>Digby)</hi> Colonell Sir
<hi>Edward Longervile,</hi> and 5 Colonels more,
above 300 common souldiers, 600 Armes,
6 peeces of Ordnance, 80 brave horse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
many brave Saddle-horses, with very
many other rich spoyles, which were left
to his Souldiers for their encouragement.</p>
            <p>6. In <hi>September 1644,</hi> the main body of
the Parliaments foot forces being necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tously
left in a noose (as it were) or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> in the remotest part of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44405:30"/>
West of the Kingdome, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in chiefe of this our most renowned
Vertuous and Valiant Commander (of
whom I may not here, especially, forget
that most memorable Adagie, as it were,
that,, Hee liv'd like an Angell, Pray'd like
a Saint, and fought like a Lyon) and being
there reduced to such a straight, as that the
enemy hoped, now, to have made them all
their bloody prey; and which this brave
Commander observing, and that they must
of necessity, either basely yeeld to ignoble
and slavish Captivity, or else fight and die
honourably, which last, he most magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
choosing, so admirably encouraged
all the rest of his souldiers thereunto, both
by his couragious and Christian resolute
speeches and exhortations, and also by his
invincible spirit and personall example;
that after a most fierce and bloody fight,
they forced their own conditions through
the death and wounds of many of their
bloodeist enemies, and in spight of all their
adversaries greatest power and fury, this
most noble Commander most bravely
brought them all off with their lives and
honour preserved, and to the enemies great
losse and shame in the issue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:44405:30"/>
7. And here also, wee may not forget
that most brave piece of service performed
(about <hi>Aprill 1645,)</hi> by this most wise
godly and gallant Commander, in redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and setling the new Moddel'd Army,
in divers Regiments both of horse and foot
upon that great change and alteration of
the former unruly Army (at least in the
opinion of most men) which after a most
excellent speech unto them, and by his most
grave, godly, and discreet managing of
things among them, hee so sweetly setled
and composed as was even to admiration,
and was a great and most gratefull worke
to the Parliament and whole Kingdome, as
things then stood.</p>
            <p>8. And in the most furious and famous
battle at <hi>Nazeby,</hi> in <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the midst of <hi>June 1645,</hi> this most vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and valiant Commander having bin
a most eminent actor and instrument (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
God) of obtaining that most glorious
and Kingdome-Crowning Victory, there
received (among divers other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wounds)
one most deepe and dangerous wound
which was credibly reported to be about 8
inches long in his body on the left side, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his short ribs, by a bullet which had
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44405:31"/>
most dangerously battered his Armour and
broken and beaten a piece of it into his
belly, which lay long there to his great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
pain, so that there was no small fear
of his precious life. And it was credibly
reported, that the King himselfe should say
(in a kind of a consolitary way, to himself)
when he heard of this, <hi>That though he had
lost the Victory at</hi> Nazeby, <hi>yet</hi> Skippon <hi>was
slain.</hi> But praised be God it proved other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            <p>9. After this renowned Commander had
lyen a while at <hi>Northampton</hi> Town, or
thereabout, for the dressing of his wounds,
and it being held fit (by the Parliament,
who took tender care over him) to remove
him thence to <hi>London,</hi> for the more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
cure: This brave Gentleman being
with all easiest conveniencie, put into a
horse litter to be brought to <hi>London,</hi> and
comming to <hi>Islington</hi> a Town a little more
then a mile from <hi>London;</hi> It pleased the
Lord that it should so fall out (to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
setting forth of his Power and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence)
that in the said Town, a great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiffe-Dog,
on a suddain, ran most fiercely
out of a house, fell furiously upon one of
the horses that carryed the Litter, got the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44405:31"/>
horse by the Stones, behind, made the horse,
thereby, fling and fly about, and beat and
shake the Litter up and down, too and fro,
in a most dangerous manner shaking the
good Gentlemans sorely wounded body
thereby, and ready continually to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the Litter and greatly endanger the
noble Gentlemans life; All which while
there being no possible meanes to beat off
the Dog, or make him leave his hold of the
horse, till they ran him through with a
Sword and kill'd him; which as soone as
they could, they did; and so brought this
noble Gentleman to his house in <hi>Barthol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mewes</hi>
the great, where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notwithstanding
all this (the Lord had so admirably ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
him to beare this terrible brunt) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
laid to rest in his bed, Prayers sent up
to God for him in all the Churches in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and speciall care had to the cure of his
wound, by Gods blessing on the industry
and fidelity of the honest and Religious
Chyrurgion Mr. <hi>Trapham,</hi> who at length<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
by Gods mercy got out a great piece of a
rag of his wastcoat, which had been beaten
into his body, by his Armour, through the
force of the bullet, and lay festering in the
wound, but thus got out, in Gods good
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44405:32"/>
time, a perfect c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re was made of it. Thus
it was made manifest to the whole World,
that God had graciously reserved him unto,
yet some more glorious worke for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his great Name, and me good of his
poore Church.</p>
            <p>10. About the midst of <hi>September</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
1645, the brave City of <hi>Bristoll</hi> being
taken from the Royalists, it pleased the
Parliament to reflect on the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
faithfulnesse and high merits of this
renowned Commander, and so to honour
him (as he deserved) as to make him Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Bristoll:</hi> where, also he carryed
himselfe most piously and prudently, both
in point of Religion, and of Martiall disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
to the great honour of God, and good
of the City.</p>
            <p>11. Since which also, the Parliament
most deservedly still eying his prudence,
piety, and fidelity to the State, made choise
of him, with a power of about 3000 horse
and Dragoones to bee a convoy for the
200000. l. to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> for our loyall and
ever to be beloved Brethren of <hi>Scotland;</hi>
And immediately after, chose him Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Newcastle</hi> also, giving him power
to substitute a Deputy-Governour of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44405:32"/>
City of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> and himselfe to be the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
Governour thereof, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>12. And since all this, to adde a yet
more glorious lustre to all these honours,
which God had thus conferr'd upon him;
This noble Commander, being most high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
honoured in the hearts of the people al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
was chosen by them, a most worthy
member of the house of Commons in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
And yet again, now, at last (and
yet, I hope, tis not the last) as if the God
of Heaven intended to make him one of
his speciall and peculiar favourites, he hath
put into the hearts of the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in Parliament, to make choice of
him, to bee their Marshall-Generall of all
their forces for the distressed Kingdom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him with full power to exercise Martiall
