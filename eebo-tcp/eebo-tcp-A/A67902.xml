            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF in this Conjuncture of Affairs, you think I have said <hi>too little,</hi> as things now stand between us and the Dutch, I wish, all my faults were as <hi>capable of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; if <hi>too much,</hi> 'tis out of a partiality I was never found guilty of in relation unto them: it being my project, <hi>To vindicate my Countries Interest</hi> as modestly, as such high provocations, multiplied by the weight of so many Obligations may justly beare. However, I shall be more ready to aske par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb facs="tcp:118269:3"/>
then offend by being too Censorious. And if inclin'd to the same humor, it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible you may be pleased; if otherwaies, I am resolved not to be angry; intending on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to perswade <hi>Peace,</hi> no way so advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously obtained from others, as by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Vnity amongst our selves,</hi> under those God hath placed over us; <hi>Nothing increasing forraign Enemies so much as Domestick feuds,</hi> amongst such as ought to be servants to the <hi>State,</hi> as I am, though never in their Pay.</p>

               <hi>CAESAR</hi> endured without excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation the <hi>Senators</hi> Poniards, as whetted by interest or revenge; but when that of his own Imp <hi>Brutus,</hi> was presented against him he cover'd his face, leaving the World, with no lesse shame then indignation, against so much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall ingratitude. The like might we doe in relation to the <hi>Dutch</hi>; whose part I have been hitherto, so farre ready to take, as to impute the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance they contributed towards the losse of <hi>Rochell,</hi> And the fomenting the Royall party against the Parliament of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118269:4"/>
England, only to the sordidnesse of their <hi>Merchants</hi>; who have not only been known, to sell amunition to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetans,</hi> the blasphemers of their Religion (if they own any by <hi>retaile</hi>) but even to his <hi>Catholike Majesty,</hi> bound in Honour no lesse then interest, to be their enemy in <hi>grosse.</hi> Neither had I ever wished the <hi>charming</hi> of those <hi>Froggs,</hi> but that I see them so ready to become an <hi>Egyptian plague</hi> unto us, by <hi>croaking</hi> against us in our own <hi>Waters.</hi> Yet though most of their <hi>Gentry</hi> were buried in the Cruelty of such as formerly govern'd them, And all markes of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour almost blended amongst them, in those of <hi>Profit,</hi> they shall find so much <hi>civility in me,</hi> as to endeavour ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Bind up, then Inlarge the rupture, their indiscreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath made with this State; to whom, I shall in modesty shew, <hi>how farre they stand obliged,</hi> And offer reasons to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them from these wild courses,</hi> by which they doe no lesse <hi>tickle,</hi> the hearts of their enemies with delight, then <hi>wound,</hi> those with shame and feare, who doe affect them.</p>
            <p>Here then let me crave leave, to addresse my speech to this our Neighbour State, and thus expostulate with them.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>France,</hi> tired with the labour, the striving of her own, <hi>Children</hi> had caused in the <hi>Bowells</hi> of her <hi>Estate,</hi> And child by the cold distrust conceived of your successe, had deserted you in Despayre, you may remember how <hi>England</hi> opened her armes to receive your fugitives, And her purse to pay your Souldiers; so that a foot of ground cannot be called yours, that owes not a third part to the expence, Valour, or Counsell of the English; Of whom such spirits have expired in your defence, as have been thought, at a mean rate, to double the value of what they fought for: Brave <hi>Sidney</hi> falling upon such ground, as his glorious <hi>Mistresse</hi> thought too base to bury him in; Though you offered to purchase that honour, at the price of the richest <hi>Monument,</hi> you were then able to erect.</p>
            <p>Did not the <hi>English</hi> dispute your title to <hi>Ostend,</hi> till they had
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118269:4"/>
no earth left to plead on, The Ground failing them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their valours? Yet whilest fighting there, not only against the flower of the Spanish Army, But the Plague, Hunger and cold Despaire; Their fellowes put you in possession of <hi>Sluce,</hi> beyond your hopes; So as it may be said without Hyperbole, <hi>the Nobility and Gentry,</hi> Q. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth lost, doubled the number, the cruelty of Philip had left you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doe not the Maritim Townes of <hi>Kent, Essex, Suffolke, Norfolke,</hi> &amp;c. abound at this day, with the issue of those <hi>Swarmes,</hi> the sound of their fellowes misery, had driven out of their <hi>Hives</hi>? Have you not had liberty to trade, And to become free <hi>Denizons,</hi> with power to buy Land, and inhabit upon the same termes with the Natives, both in City and Country; no marke of distinction being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in relation either to Honour, Profit, or Iustice?</p>
            <p>The Parliament, have been alwaies so tender of your preservation, whilest you needed it, and Friendship since God hath inabled you to subsist; As their <hi>Speaker</hi> could scarce make an impression upon his Cushion, before the sense of your safety, no lesse then their own Nature and Religion, Inspired them with an earnestnesse to renew or strengthen their <hi>Alliance with you</hi>; not so observeable in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of any Neighbour beside; Doubling, no lesse in their Retaliations, then acceptance, the few markes of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, have dropt from you; Rather then expunging them, with your more frequent injuries; as being more willing to impute your failings to the lesse courtly nature of the soyle and people, Then the want of gratitude and Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in so prudent a State, to a Potent Neighbour; who next to God, may justly be stiled her maker, in dispensing with so many dangers and inconveniences for your sake.</p>
            <p>Can you think so wise a Councell as this Nation was steer'd by, did not apprehend; That though <hi>the making you Free might fortify the Queenes out-workes, it could not but as much dismantle the Royall fort of Monarchy</hi>; By teaching Subjects,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118269:5"/>
they might depose their Prince, and be no loosers by the bargaine? Which (by the way) will render you unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to all Neighbour Monarchs; furnishing their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with a pretence, upon all occasions of advantage; Therefore prudence might tempt you, rather to advance then depresse, the like endeavours in others; observed by your <hi>elder</hi> (I dare not say, Wiser) <hi>Sister, Venice,</hi> In whose proceedings partialities on this side are rarely found. But to returne to what is in this place more materiall.</p>
            <p>Was not the assisting you, an occasion of our <hi>Invasion in Eighty eight,</hi> by a <hi>Navy</hi> held <hi>Invincible</hi> in the <hi>Creed of Rome</hi>; Till the more Canonicall Valour of the English (assisted by the Iowder arguments of Heaven) had cleerly confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Popes</hi> title? The Reason that kept <hi>King Philip</hi> from heading an Army in his own person, was a fear he did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend of being cast in his passage out of <hi>Spaine</hi>; (as his father <hi>Charles</hi> the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> was) upon the <hi>British shore</hi>; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the English more cordiall to <hi>your preservation,</hi> then to suffer him to come and goe on so bloudy an errand.</p>
            <p>And though he did often desire <hi>his Sister of England</hi> to heare (as he pretended) his just defence for his so rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous proceedings; She refused to dispute the truth of your Complaints; presuming it more probable for a stranger to be a Tyrant, then that the naturall Inhabitants should, upon a slighter cause, cast themselves into the no lesse bloody, then scorching flames of a Civill, and uncertaine Warre: Seeming rather to forget the Obligations shee owed him, as a private person, when he was King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, then her Neighbours oppressions; I shall not here draw blood in your faces by application.</p>
            <p>Yet I doe not find any <hi>tumults raised before the gates of your Messengers</hi>; who were then too modest to owne higher ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, then of <hi>poore Petitioners</hi>; casting themselves prostrate at the feet of a no lesse potent tribunall, then you have been admitted to, in the quality of <hi>Embassadors</hi>; An honour you could never have attained, but through the mediation of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118269:5"/>
those who have been so farr from receiving a like Retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; as, to their griefe, they perceived <hi>most of the stormes and Thunders, fell upon this Nation, were first formed in your Region,</hi> by which houses and Churches were demolished, wherein your Ancestors had receaved shelter, and Contribution.</p>
            <p>And instead of opposing our Enemies, and screening us by the power you must owne under God from England, You rendered your selves Arbitraters of our cause; And to which side you did propend, appeares by the titles of Honour your Messengers partiality was branded with by the other Party;<note place="margin">One made a Lord, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Knight at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </note> Besides what a lesse respective. Relator might suppose they carryed home in their Portmantos; Covering under the glorious habit of Embassadours; An ingratitude so ugly, as can not be represented to the world without shame.</p>
            <p>Were not the promises of Neutralitie (extorted from you by our Agents, at the expence of so much trouble, treasure and time) drawn up so ambiguously, as if they had come from jugling <hi>Delphos,</hi> not the deeply engaged <hi>Hague?</hi> whose repute, in relation to a just repayment of former debts, hath been, next her alliance with England, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est security for her future hopes.</p>
            <p>Did not the disaffection of some, transport them so far beyond all extent of prudence, (as to avoid the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing of so much Ingratitude in their owne persons) by conniving at the liberty, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> took, The inestimable Banck at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> was almost surprised; And <hi>Fetters</hi> ready to be formed for them out of the <hi>States Silver</hi>; so as they were in a faire way of loosing their owne Liberty in seeking to impede ours?</p>
            <p>For this branch of the House of <hi>Nassau</hi> was so deeply rooted in this fourth descent, as he began to struggle for more roome, and overshadow the power of the State; And apprehending this Nation too full of Gallantry, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, to let a Servant inslave a people they had redeemed from his Master by their blood, he rendered himselfe, First
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118269:6"/>
our late Kings Sonne in Law, and so our enimy; till Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence had bound him up with the rest of our Opposers; By what mediation we are not inquisitive; our businesse being only to participate of our Neighbours felicities, without arraigning the cause by which they attained them.</p>
            <p>And here I desire leave to mingle my thoughts with some reports made by no strangers in the affaires of those times, to whom it appeared, that Queen <hi>Mary did not at first, Cordially intend the Match with Holland, unlesse the Prince of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range was able to attaine the Regality,</hi> which the Catholike King was so farr from being likely to hinder, That a small acknowledgment would have perswaded him out of his part, long looked upon by that wise Nation, as a trouble to keep: And after she had by the contemplation of this Marriage, assured her selfe not only to receive no opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in her designe, from that corner, but all the assistance his mony and power could afford; she had the young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies consent ready, either to break, or confirme it; who was then under yeares; And to shew <hi>they</hi> feared foule play, in case K. Ch. had prospered, the Princesse was bedded som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing sooner, then stood with ordinary custome, and the Lady <hi>Stanops</hi> protests, who married a Dutchman, and was assigned her Gardionesse.</p>
            <p>And if any consider how unsuitable this was to the <hi>high minde</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Queene</hi> of England; What plenty of <hi>freer</hi> and <hi>richer</hi> Princes resided in <hi>Germany</hi>; And that she never had been put in to their hands, but that <hi>those new breaches, called for new Counsels</hi>; He cannot blame the conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; though as things fell out, <hi>she could not have been sold to a greater advantage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither can it be rejected out of any great difficulty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides in raising a considerable party in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> by one lesse powerfull then the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi>; because <hi>every severall Province,</hi> or chief Town, <hi>hath free Liberty</hi> of <hi>conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or rejecting what propositions they please</hi>; that in a manner

they are <hi>so many free States</hi> independent one of the other; Therefore not likely to combine against England; who yet is as well Able to spare their Alliance, as willing to Imbrace it.</p>
            <p>And that this <hi>Match</hi> sprung rather from the Sinister and clandestine ends, then any palpable affection, The <hi>Queene</hi> carried to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> is more then probable, by the faint reception she formerly gave them upon all occasions, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the Buffoons at Court to gibe their Embassadors, as if they were not able to afford themselves <hi>Cuffs,</hi> out of the masse of <hi>Holland</hi> they sold to others: And upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the severe justice they mett with, in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> for <hi>transporting of Gold,</hi> it might have obliged them rather to have assisted the <hi>Parliament</hi> (whose indulgence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled them to committ the fault) then the <hi>Crowne,</hi> that had so severely punished it.</p>
            <p>Yet you were so farr from managing this Partiality within the ordinary Carere of prudent Princes, (who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a lesse desertion of Fortune then you observed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their assistance from all parties looked upon, but with an unbiass'd aspect; That you adhered to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> after providence had measured out the Land in quiet before us; As if nothing were more <hi>indifferent to you, then who were happy, so England were miserable.</hi> Nay after our good God had broke their Swords, and knapt their Speares in sunder, you let the ribald <hi>Penne</hi> vomit out floods of reproaches, in hope to destroy this <hi>Nation,</hi> who was then in strong labour with peace, amongst a wildernesse of distractions: Forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that nothing could be said to their disparagement, that would not, in an indifferent light, delineate your owne: No <hi>Indecency</hi> being observable, during our proceedings, that is not easily to be matcht with an <hi>Enormity</hi> in Yours.</p>
            <p>So as the <hi>Pope</hi> proved by accident, more our friend, and made better use of reason of State; For finding his faction here was able to return him no more then a bare compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in <hi>Church Ceremonies,</hi> withont the welcome addition

of profit; (The English <hi>Miter,</hi> no lesse then the <hi>Crowne,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to retaine an absolute power to dispose of all dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities both Ecclesiasticall and Temporall) wheel'd about, and was never found by any I could be inform'd from, to foment the adversary with considerable supplyes, though earnestly sollicited both by Letters and Messengers.</p>
            <p>In which the wise Conclave, avoyded both the hornes of this dangerous Dilemma, Either to own so high a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived impiety, as the rejecting the returne of <hi>one</hi> of the mightiest Kingdoms in Christendom, for worldly respects, thought by few, of those who pay them, his due: or by leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Sheep that was lost, a full fruition of his fleeces, to give the other Ninety and nine Catholike Potentates a just occasion to make the like demands: A fatling of more value in that Luxurious Court, then would be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, for the conversion of all the world.</p>
            <p>But to return; I cannot in zeale to the conscience, and duty I owe to the honour of this Nation, but aske who made you so farr our Survayers, as to limit out the extent of Their conveniences, that are found to have laid out them selves to purchase Yours?</p>
            <p>Was ever so high an Intrusion offered, as for a Neighbour to prescribe how another should be regulated in matter of Trade; And what Bottoms are fittest to be imployd? would you not scorne the like Usurpation, though made by your—<hi>France,</hi> or new sworne Allye, <hi>Denmarke,</hi> who for so many yeares, hath ground your faces with a Tole, never yet imposed upon you in our Seas?</p>
            <p>For the proof of whose Propriety, I leave you to learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Selden</hi> in his <hi>Mare Clausum,</hi> &amp; a book entituled <hi>Dominium Maris</hi> &amp;c. lately translated out of <hi>Italian</hi> by an <hi>Honorable Person.</hi> And if you were not unwilling to bribe Our Kings and their Minions so long for your Fishing, why should you be so tetchy now, with such as inquire whether it was worth your cost? and though I was pleased to hear so rich a Towne as <hi>Amsterdam</hi> could be Founded on <hi>Herring-Bones,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:118269:7"/>
the Lord of Hosts is my faithfull witnesse, how afflicted I should be, to see it hazard the reducing into its first prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple by a Warre with England.</p>
            <p>And thus much I understand of your Trade, that the late Kings did not only give you the Fish, but bayts to catch them, loaden by Boats full out of the Thames,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lampries.</hi>
               </note> which they would never have done, had they been as full of Circumspection, as that creature is reported to be of eyes.</p>
            <p>Now this considered, I pray why may not we assume to our selves the Rights of Disposure, and Regulating that which undoubtedly is our owne? and why may not we take the humble stile of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and <hi>Councell of State,</hi> as well as you, That strive with your Maker, who shall be most <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Mighty</hi>?</p>
            <p>If only the <hi>time</hi> of the Change of Government be made Umpier of Precedency, <hi>Geneva</hi> must take the right hand of You; And many poore small Townes in Germany, That freely sent their demands to King <hi>Philip</hi>; When your Messengers scaped hanging hardly, if at all, for only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering your most humble Petitions.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>three things</hi> principally insisted upon, by which the <hi>Vnited Provinces,</hi> pretend to have fixed an Obligation upon <hi>England,</hi> &amp; expung'd their former score; which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse upon an impartiall debate, will rather prove who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chargable, upon their own accompt, then Ours; so farr are they from having given a full satisfaction for all the Love; Cost &amp; blood expended by us in their Preservation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> is, the assistance lent us in 88. which was no more, then the profest Antagonists to the quiet of <hi>Italy,</hi> did freely contribute against the common enemy, in the battell at <hi>Lepanto,</hi> who did there oppose the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> in relation to their respective safeties: Besides it was a true received <hi>Maxim</hi> in the wise Counsell of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and holds so still; <hi>that he that desires to subdue the Vnited Provinces, must first Conquer England, or draw her from their succour</hi>: And
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118269:8"/>
finding the latter unpossible, they fell upon the other, as more feacible.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is, <hi>your Entertainment given to the distressed King and Queen of Bohemia</hi>: which according to the rest of your pretended curtesies unto England, you have strain'd farre higher then the string is able to bear, in its naturall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; Therefore I shall take leave to tune it right in the eares of all impartiall judgements; and after setting open the Cabinet, give men free leave to value the Jewell, which in truth amounts to <hi>no more then giving house-roome to a Vertuous Princesse, undone by your Counsells,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Vnion,</hi> that had most unsuccessefully chosen <hi>Iames</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for their <hi>Head</hi>; who proving totty, They thought to ballast him by Imbarking his <hi>Son in Law</hi> in this desperate designe; especially the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> finding the <hi>twelve years Truce</hi> spent little to their advantage, and knowing the whole weight of <hi>Spaine,</hi> would fall upon them, unlesse they could waken us, whose King was clog'd with too much Fleagme, to harken to the voyce of any thing but ease and pleasure. And I cannot but take notice here of the Spaniards ingratitude, that hath so long deferr'd ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting his Statue in Gold; since upon a strict accompt it may appeare, that the wise Councell of the <hi>Catholike King,</hi> did not contribute so much to his greatnesse, as the Folly and Corruption of <hi>Ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> which is <hi>a Navall Victory obtained in our Sleeve,</hi> A<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1639. (the depth of which designe, remaines yet in the pocket of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and some few confidents in <hi>England</hi>:) I can say but this, that if their errand was Hither, Our King betray'd <hi>Vs</hi>; if to Holland, <hi>You</hi>; for which you were tied in reason, rather to have assisted the <hi>people</hi> that exclaimed against the partiality they observed, then the <hi>King</hi> that owned it; Therefore this cannot be put up on the <hi>Parliaments</hi> accompt.</p>
            <p>For <hi>the businesse of Amboyna</hi> cast into the Ballance (by such as bear you lesse respect) against all things urged in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118269:8"/>
your favour; I am so charitable, as to look upon it as the Cruell, and inconsiderate act of a private person, rather then a true Scheme of the States Motion.</p>
            <p>Not doubting, but upon a serious reflection of your Wisdoms, on <hi>your own Interest,</hi> you will easily returne to a more straight <hi>Alliance with this Nation,</hi> unlesse God in his anger, hath suffered you, to mingle <hi>Lethe</hi> with the rest of your Liquor.</p>
            <p>And since it may seem impossible for you, to subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contracting a streight Alliance, with <hi>England, France,</hi> or <hi>Spaine</hi>; give me leave humbly to propose, which in reason is likeliest to disturbe your Counsells with the least jealousy, from whence may be the easier deduced the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test choyce, not only for conveniency, but safety; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very hard to be securely protected, by those you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cordially trust: which cannot be <hi>Spaine</hi> or <hi>France; one laying claime to what you possesse, the other to what you are ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to obtaine</hi>; whereas <hi>England</hi> stands free from all such pretences; <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> refusing to hold you in grosse, only accepting of <hi>Flushing</hi> and the <hi>Brill,</hi> which <hi>King Iames</hi> was so weary of, as he returned them for a farre lesse summe then they were pawn'd: Neither as a free State, are we likely to imbrace contrary Counsells, because we have more <hi>Marish grounds</hi> already of our own, then we well knew how to dispose of, till some of your Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men came and inhabited them. Besides it were madnesse for those who may live quietly in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to venture fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for an estate in <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is <hi>our</hi> alliance likely to change, if once firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly established, Whereas there is no longer hold with <hi>France,</hi> then whilest the two potent factions of <hi>Protestant</hi> and <hi>Papist</hi> shall subsist; by the clashing of which, you are, no lesse then the Spaniard, able to kindle the fire of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Warre: so as when you have throughly scan'd your alliance with France, you shall find it signify more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118269:9"/>
then Protection: It having been alwaies <hi>the humour of that People, to swagger with their Neighbours for roome, upon the least enjoyment of quiet; being seldome or never willing to serve their Allies, but when they are in the worst case to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this afflicted people were sensible of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that <hi>the most scorching Slavery in all Christendome, lies under the Line of their Kings,</hi> And animated by <hi>our</hi> example and <hi>yours,</hi> should procure their freedome, Yet you would be worsted on that hand too; for after their Liberty at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the conquest of you or your Neighbours, were likeliest to be their next imployment: there being no Peace with them at home, unlesse they be at Warre with other States; Which makes it none of Englands small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est blessings, that they are not able to come hither on horseback.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> are not so sutable to your Nature as the <hi>English,</hi> who look upon <hi>Merchants</hi> as <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> they as <hi>Pedlers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know you are too wise to expect reall friendship from Spaine, or a continuance of the agreement made with <hi>Him,</hi> if you break with <hi>Vs</hi>; It not being likely he should oversee the advantage will be offered him of catching <hi>Gudgeons</hi> in your inland Waters, whilest we are out at Sea scuffling for <hi>Spratts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you be prohibited trading hither; I pray what will you doe with <hi>French Wines, the most staple commodity they have to barter for</hi>? The East countries, being as unable to take them off, by reason of cold, as you to consume them in <hi>Brent Wine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Monarchs neither doe, nor can look upon you, under a milder aspect then <hi>Traytors,</hi> without a tacit consent, of the like power resident in their People to explode them, as conscious of giving the same cause; Whereas <hi>England</hi> cannot but esteem you in a more honourable Relation:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118269:9"/>
For though you, like the <hi>Diall of Ahaz,</hi> recoyled so many degrees back in the Sphere of Policy, It is naturally more proper for the hand of power in a Free State, to be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an inclination towards a Common-wealth, then a Monarchy.</p>
            <p>Though the advantage that may accrue to you from an <hi>English confederacy,</hi> is made apparent from by-gon expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, yet if you consider how honourable it would be to <hi>Spaine,</hi> who hath long endeavoured it; And conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to <hi>France,</hi> in regard of her clayme to <hi>Artoys</hi> and <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault,</hi> to convert you into a Colony, you would not be so intent upon <hi>Profit, esteemed by all prudent Nations inferior to safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>: Therefore let your <hi>pretences</hi> be what you will, The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments you made through the remisnesse of our Kings, and corruption of their Councell, are the <hi>Silver Smiths,</hi> that doe really raise all these clamours; it being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwaies unpossible, that Monarchy should be such a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> in your eyes.</p>
            <p>Your Alliance with <hi>Denmarke,</hi> is likelier to adde num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber then weight to your Frindship; being liable to be whisled off or on, according to the inclination of his <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall Majesty,</hi> so twisted in Marriages with the Catholick King, That the difficulty is as great to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Interests, as Consanguinity: Besides <hi>those Eastern Countries</hi> have ever been looked upon, not only as a <hi>store-house wherein God hords up the miseries of Winter,</hi> But also the cruell Plagues of <hi>Incursions</hi>; apparent in the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,</hi> whose barbarous hands, assisted Time, in the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of such Monuments in Italy, as she alone had not been able to demolish.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:118269:10"/>To conclude with a few Queries.</p>

                  <item>6<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> Whether a breach between us, may not conjure up a third party of <hi>Pirats,</hi> formidable to us both, <hi>Dunkirke</hi> being in so wavering a condition and fit to make an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers</hi> of, &amp;c.</item>

resolved from the great assistance, England hath given you, and the small dammage she hath (through the mercy of God) received from yours, through out the whole Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our Warre?</item>

                  <item>Lastly, Whether the World may not afford Us and You sufficient Trade without intrusion; or in case our Heards<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men should foolishly differ, is not <hi>Abrahams</hi> answer ready, are we not Brethren, in Language, Nature, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?</item>

            <p>If you adde to this the <hi>Parallel</hi> of the causes, of your and our taking Armes; you shall find <hi>your</hi> King a stranger by Birth, wilfull by nature, and apt to be led away by the seldome Auspicious counsell of Church-men.

               <hi>There</hi> a Woman made an ingredient in the <hi>Court; Here</hi> the Regent of our <hi>Councels. Yours</hi> the wisest King in his time, in all things but thinking himselfe so; <hi>Ours</hi> no lesse prudent, had he but known it. <hi>Yours</hi> happy in all, but the losse of you; <hi>Ours</hi> successefull in nothing, but his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from Spaine. <hi>Yours</hi> inscrutable to all, but tried <hi>friends; Ours</hi> patent to none, but such as deserved the name of <hi>Enemies.
