            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Good Counſell, to the Petitioners for Presbyterian Government, That they may declare their Faith before they build their Church.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Saints of God being ſeparated from Idolatry, and joyned together in the fellowſhip of the Goſpel, have ever enjoyed commiſſion from Chriſt to practiſe all the parts of Gods true Religion, and alſo to keep the Ordinances of God from contempt or profanation amongſt themſelves. And this power they have from God though with perſecution, now, in this time of Parliament. Perſecution, I ſay, not from the Parliament, (further then they neglect to preſerve their peace according to the Law of God) but perſecution, as it aroſe from the Pope, and Biſhops in former time primarily; ſo would it do now from their ſons, who call themſelves Divines, yea, even in the height of it, if they might have their wils, as appeareth by their late Petition, for which there was a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick calling out for hands.</p>
            <p>Well was it with the Kings of Iſrael when they took the counſell of Gods true Prophets though few in number, but ſuch a Clergy which is naturally addicted to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution cannot be a bleſſing to any Parliament or Nation, as appeareth by the Scripture. And therefore my deſire is, that the Parliament may ſubmit to God for direction and counſell, even to beware of men, eſpecially of falſe Prophets, or any evill workers whatever they be; And that all perſons fearing God, in the City of <hi>London,</hi> or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, may bleſſe God, for fulfilling his promiſes unto them, that <hi>their eyes enjoy their Teachers,</hi> though in an <hi>upper roome,</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> met. But for the <hi>City of Londons Ministery</hi> (which is ſo much commended in the Petition) I think their readineſſe is, as the reſt of that generation in the countreys of the Land: even to find out where their <hi>maintenance</hi> lieth; And ſo far are they from keeping Gods Ordinances from pollution and contempt, that [to enjoy their pay] they will walk contrary to a known rule, and expreſſe command; <hi>Caſt not holy things unto dogs:</hi> yet theſe men (I ſay) rather then they will want their patrimony, they will conſtrain all men to partake of the Ordinances of God.</p>
            <p>They bewail that <hi>the children ſhould come ſo neer to the birth, and that there is no ſtrength to bring forth:</hi> But I think the children are ſufficiently brought forth unto them. If their means be eſtabliſhed upon them, by the Parliament (as I am informed it is for a certain time:) for I know no other Children they mean, but two: <hi>viz:</hi> MAINTENANCE and POWER: The one they have as <hi>Saul had the fat cattell, contrary to Gods commandment:</hi> The other they ſhall never have: for <hi>God will fight againſt ſuch as fight for them,</hi> as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears at this day: for they by uſurped power ever ſhed the blood of the <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and now God is making inquiſition for the blood which hath been ſpilt, and the more fiercely they go on to build up a <hi>Babel</hi> with blood; the more ſpeedily will God come down to ſee their wickednes and to confound them.</p>
            <p>And though they ſay it is in <hi>fervour of ſpirit, for the houſe of</hi> their <hi>God,</hi> and although the Parliament may <hi>bear</hi> with them, at their entreaty, yet God will (in his own time) deal with ſinners.</p>
            <p>They further complain, that there are damnable errors broached amongſt them, (that is to ſay, amongſt the <hi>Presbyterians;)</hi> for amongſt the people of God none can ſo ſoon deliver any point of <hi>falſe doctrine</hi> but he ſhall be ſeverely dealt with according to the rule of <hi>Chriſt;)</hi> but the <hi>Presbyters</hi> practiſe is to preach what they liſt <hi>without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll,</hi> therefore errors may be broached by them <hi>privilegio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they ſay, <hi>divers are fallen off within theſe few yeers.</hi> But me thinks they do not ſpeak pertinently, for men cannot be ſaid to fall off which were never on, or from a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was never ſetled, and they themſelves ſay, their <hi>Government is not yet eſtabliſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe that fly out from amongſt them, ſeparating themſelves from them, and incorporate themſelves into ſeparated Aſſemblies, are not (as they ſay they be) ſuch as hold <hi>damnable hereſies,</hi> but ſuch abide ſtill amongſt the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> themſelves; and therefore the Lords people are conſtrained (by the power of the Word of truth) to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelves from ſuch perſons, that are (retained in the Church of <hi>England)</hi> godleſſe in their lives, and blaſphemous in their judgements, yet ſuch perſons notſtithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding are (in matters of worſhip) one with the whole body of the Land; and theſe be the veſſels that the houſes of their Gods are yet filled withall. But it is not ſo with thoſe that ſeparate themſelves from them: for they admit not in their ſocieties any that hold blaſphemous <hi>errors,</hi> neither do they <hi>ſet</hi> up <hi>illeterate perſons among them for their Paſtors,</hi> as the Presbyterians unjuſtly accuſe them. True it is, they <hi>manage their meetings with boldneſſe,</hi> becauſe they have ſome ground to beleeve that the <hi>Parliament</hi> will not ſuffer them to be wronged, for performing the <hi>true worſhip,</hi> to the <hi>true God,</hi> in a peaceable manner, under their protection (as alſo correction in caſe they ſhould walk as the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> in their Petition have falſly accuſed them, ſaying they <hi>manage their meetings with inſolencie,</hi> which is an unjuſt accuſation; And <hi>in contempt of all Authority,</hi> which is alſo untrue: <hi>To the diſturbance of the City:</hi> which is another falſhood: <hi>Every one doing that which is right in his own eyes:</hi> which is an unjuſt affirmation as the reſt) for they order their walkings according to the rule of Gods Word: But theſe Petitioners accuſe not onely the people, but alſo the Parliament, for they ſay <hi>every one doth that which is right in his own eyes, and there is no controll or courſe to reclaim them:</hi> whereby it is evident, they render the <hi>Parliament</hi> very infirm, or careleſſe. And the people of God plead not any ſuch pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to be <hi>without controll:</hi> but alwayes ſubmitted themſelves in duty to the Magiſtrates power, which is ſet up by God, as well <hi>for the puniſhment of evill doers, as for the praiſe of thoſe that do well.</hi> Therefore all theſe Petitioners inferences againſt the people of God be ſlanders. And the Religion of God doth not <hi>breed diviſion,</hi> either <hi>in Kingdom, City,</hi> or <hi>family</hi> in any civill reſpect: for Religion teacheth men ſubmiſſion to their duty. (But this hath been a falſe accuſation of Mr. <hi>T. E.</hi> long ago, which hath been diſproved at large.) Religion (I ſay) breeds no difference then what was from the beginning, the wicked envying the godly, that their ſacrifices are accepted, and theirs rejected, and thats the emnity which Chriſt hath put between the two ſeeds, and it ſhall be as Chriſt ſaith, five in a houſe, two againſt three, and three againſt two. But the cauſe is envy, and not Religion. And whereas theſe Presbyterians affirm in their Petition that the <hi>Separates ſet up illeterate men to be their Paſtors,</hi> let that come to the triall, for we deſire not to be led by blind guides; Therefore I could wiſh it might pleaſe the Parliament to examine the gifts of ſuch whom theſe call <hi>illiterate</hi> (that ſo it may appear how reaſonable we are) either by diſputation between the Presbyters and them: or by proving them, to give the ſence of any Scripture which they ſhall appoint; and by this it ſhall appear whether theſe Presbyterians are true men: for there is never a Miniſter of the Seperation that feareth to ſet his foot againſt any Presbyter whatſoever he be, to diſpute the caſe concerning the <hi>matter, miniſtery, worſhip,</hi> or <hi>government of the Church,</hi> or any principle of Faith which it ſhall pleaſe the <hi>Parliament</hi> to call upon them for the managing of, that ſo it may appear unto all men who are beſt informed in the mind and will of God, and by this it will alſo appear who are the <hi>Orthodoxall Preachers,</hi> and who are the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of <hi>new Goſpels,</hi> and conſequently who be the <hi>ſetters of diviſion;</hi> and who they be upon whom their ſcandalous concluſions fall.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>Tolerations of all Religions</hi> I cannot conceive to be proper; for there is but one true Religion, and that is it which hath Gods Word for their rule.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>breaking Sabbaths,</hi> we know the Chriſtian Sabbath now under the Goſpel is the firſt day of the week (commonly called Sonday) or the Lords day, which we judge our ſelves bound in conſcience to ſet apart for the worſhip and ſervice of God by the Rules of Scripture both Law and Goſpel; and are alſo free to ſubmit to the <hi>Magiſtrates command</hi> to humble our ſelves before God in caſe of eminent danger, and to give him <hi>publick thanks</hi> for all eminent deliverances, the Magiſtrates command being grounded upon the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Therfore the Presbyterians ſlandring the people of God, will make their reformation the more difficult; for <hi>no man ever ſet himſelf up honeſtly, by accuſing of others falſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as touching our <hi>Brethren the Scots,</hi> we honour them for their parts, and ſhall remain thankfull unto God for them, or for any help we have received from them; yet we can never ſubmit our conſciences to be captivated, or made ſubject to mens wils: for God onely hath power in that caſe. Yet I ſpeak freely (for my part) I ſhall not be offended at whatever lawfull Government the Parliament in their wiſdom ſhall ſet up in the Nation for the preaching of the Goſpel, to bring thoſe thouſands, and millions of people, (who yet lie in ignorance) to the knowledge of God, and obedience of the faith, that ſo they may become fit matter, even <hi>living ſtones to be built to God a ſpirituall houſe:</hi> for <hi>there can be no true reformation in a State of generall Apoſtaſie, but by ſeperating the precious from the vile;</hi> and not to impoſe the worſhip of God on a people that are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, for that will bring a curſe rather then a bleſſing; Therefore the truly godly ought to ariſe and be doing, and God hath promiſed to be with them, and they are not to neglect to worſhip God for want of the command of Authority, as is the manner of many.</p>
            <p>Moreover, theſe take notice that <hi>God hath rewarded the beginnings of the Parliaments Reformation;</hi> And truly all Chriſtians ought to obſerve the ſame; for God uſeth to reward all thoſe that do his will. And I hope God will ſtill be mercifull to them if Juſtice be executed by them. And it is to be deſired that the wicked may be brought to condigne puniſhment, and the innocent ſet free who have lain in priſon a long time for worſhipping the true God after the true manner, as Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> hath, who is therefore in priſon at Weſtminſter; and others who alſo ſuffer in the like caſe, ſuch out-breakings of envy (I am ſure) procure no mercy but judgement.</p>
            <p>Now that the Parliament may <hi>haſten to ſet up Chriſts true diſcipline which he hath left to his Church;</hi> that is and ought to be the deſire of all Chriſtians. But that <hi>the modell</hi> (ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Petition) is it, ſtands the Presbyterians upon to prove. And therefore (in my judgement) it were better for them to make their confeſſion of faith and catechiſe firſt, according to the rule of Gods Word, and then ſhape their Church according to that, rather then ſhape their Church according to the modell, and their faith according to their Church. <q>Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thy ſelf in the field: and afterwards build thine houſe.</q>
