         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that you may the better doe, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
in briefe, beginning from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the plot to take the Caſtle and City of Dublin,
which ſhould have beene the 23. of October, 1641. upon
which day the Rebels came to Maſter <hi>Arthur Champions</hi>
houſe, ſome 60. miles from Dublin, where one of his own
tenants came <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o him very early in the morning, deſiring
to ſpeake with him about ſome ſerious buſineſſe as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
onely to betray him; when hee had drawne him
without the walls of his houſe, (for he had a very ſtrong
houſe, and well fitted for defence, had he knowne of their
divelliſh treachery) preſently there came a company
with two rogues which were pinioned as theeves, for
ſtealing of his cattell; Maſter <hi>Champion</hi> bid them that
brought them, to carry them before the next Iuſtice, for
he would not meddle with them; whereupon theſe rebels
ſet them looſe, and fell upon the good man, ſtabbed him
with their Skeanes to death preſently, before hee could
give the leaſt warning to thoſe in his houſe. His brother
<pb facs="tcp:48351:3"/>
ſeeing many people there, went to ſee what the matter
was, he was ſerved in the ſame manner, and a third like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe:
and then the Rebels went into his houſe, and killed
two more: his wife, and her ſiſter, and her brother in law,
with two others that were in the houſe, they tooke and
keepe priſoners to this day, taking poſſeſſion of all they
had, both within the houſe and without. She was downe
upon her knees to beg a ſheet to put her husband in for
his buriall, and another Gentleman which came but over
night, with ſome other friends, in love to viſit him, and
the next morning loſt their lives. And this they have done
to many in thoſe parts, robbing all the Engliſh Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
ſtripping them ſtarke naked, and ſo turning them
out to the fields and mountaines, in the froſt and ſnow,
whereof many hundreds are periſhed to death. They
ſpare none, Miniſters nor people, of what ſort ſoever, they
are ſo maliciouſly bent againſt us and our profeſſion, that
they will not ſpare our Miniſters bookes, but burne and
teare them in pieces. They deſtroy our Engliſh breed of
cattell and ſheepe in deteſtation of us, although one of
ours is better then foure of theirs; and they have vowed
to root out the name of the Engliſh out of this Kingdome,
and thus they goe on from the beginning almoſt all this
Kingdome over. And if the Lord in mercy prevent them
not, it is like to bee ſo, for wee heare daily new riſing of
them in other places, which at firſt were quiet; as the
County of Wicklow, all the pale are out, not withſtanding
their proteſtation in the Parliament there laſt meeting,
which was ſince this rebellion begunn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and Queenes County rob and ſpoyle all. The good Lady
the Lady <hi>Offalia,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Digby's</hi> children and your
brother, are beſieged in the Caſtle of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, having rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
them and all thereabouts without the Caſtle. Theſe
Rebels have turned all the Proteſtants out of Kilkeny,
onely with the clothes on their backes by the Lord <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garat,</hi>
and keepe the Counteſſe of Ormond priſoner. This
Lord promiſed them a convoy to Waterford, which went
<pb facs="tcp:48351:3"/>
with them ſome 8. miles out of towne, and then left them,
and a company of rogues met them, and ſtripped them.
When theſe poore people came to Waterford, hoping for
ſuccour, the towne would not ſuffer them to come in, but
keepe them ſtarving without the towne; all the favour
they ſhewed them, they threw them ſome bread over the
wall, ſo that you may ſee how Waterford ſtands affected.
Theſe Rebels have great advantage of us, for they have
their ſpyes daily with us, that nothing is ſaid or done but
they have notice preſently ſent to them; but we can have
none to informe us of any particulars, for they meet with
our ſpies, and hang them up with the reſt of any Engliſh
they meet with; and for that purpoſe have ſet up gallows
5. miles diſtant one from another. At the firſt they ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Scots, telling them their Commiſſion was onely
to root out the Engliſh, but now they rob and kill the
Scots, not ſparing any. One hundred and twenty they
ſtript ſtarke naked, and drave them upon a bridge, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them into the water, drowned thoſe which could not
ſwimme, and thoſe which could ſwimme they knocked
in the head when they came to land. Their cruell mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering

Your brother writ unto me, that a Rebell in thoſe parts
tooke an infant out of the mothers armes, and caſt it into
the fire before her face; but the juſt iudgement of God
fell upon him, before hee went from the ſame place hee
brake his necke.</p>
            <p>The laſt weeke a Miniſter which came to this City,
left ſome goods with a ſuppoſed friend, ſent for them, the
goods could not be delivered, unleſſe he or his wife came
for them; he would not go; ſhe went, and when ſhe came
where the goods were, they hanged her for her paines.</p>
            <p>They rob cloſe to this City; Beggatrath, Cullen wood,
Ramynes, Phenix, Aſhtowne, Newtowne, Fingleſe,
Sauntry, Drumconran, Clantarffe, Hoth, all which border
upon our City. Sir <hi>Charles Coote,</hi> our noble and brave go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
