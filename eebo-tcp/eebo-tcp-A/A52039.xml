            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

unto you the good hand of God
with us in the Worke we are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in, our Commissioners
have most indefatigably followed
their businesse night and day, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
scarcely allowed themfelves
time to eate or sleepe, and have
had to doe with the Convention of States, and Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of Divines, (both which we found happily sitting
at the time of comming) the gravest and wisest that
we have seene, and who we thinke are more sensible
of our condition than we are our selves, the leading
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99413:3"/>
men both of the Convention and Assembly, and (as
farre as we can understand) even the whole body of
the Nation looking upon it as the cause of Christ, and
that they cannot but be ruined if we perish; we are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and confidently perswaded they are generally resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to live and die with us in this quarrell against the
Popish and Episcopall Faction, and for the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Religion according to the word; we know
multitudes are prejudiced against them as if we might
expect no helpe from them but for their owne ends,
but if you dare give any credit to our faithfulnesse and
most diligent inquisition and observation; (having op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of conversing with the holyest of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
their Ministers that are in the Kingdome) let us
prevaile with you to beate downe all such unworthy
thoughts and jealousies of them, they are guided by
God in this worke, &amp; we are perswaded will bring glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Christ and requitall of all our former love to
them. Some select men have debated with us of the
most ready way to stirre up their people to come in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
and they suggested and made it apparent that the
joyning in a Covenant to be subscribed would take
them all, and a forme was agreed upon, which when
you see, you will easily discerne, hath beene drawne
up with that warinesse as to expresse their desires as
well as ours, that there might be no bogling at it. And
when our Commissioners and the Commissioners of
the Convention and Assembly had on Wednesday at
night agreed upon the forme, it was the next day
brought into the Generall Assembly, where we were
present, and eye witnesses of what was done, where
as a good introduction to it, the Letter from our Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99413:3"/>
was first read, and entertained with great accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(the Moderator solemnely professed that it deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
oft to be read amongst them) &amp; then the businesses
of the Covenant was propounded, and the forme read
twice over. There were present betweene twenty and
thirty of their prime Nobility, we thinke neer a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Noble men and Divines spoke to the businesse
before it was Voted, no man speaking against it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Kings Commissioner, who was answered and
dealt with, with that wisedome, freedome, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
both by Nobles and Divines as your heart
can thinke, though he professed that as a private man
he liked it, and said after the Voting he heard a joyfull
sound. In fine it was Voted and agreed to be entered
into (for substance, for it was by the Moderator declared
it was the substance intended and not expressions or
words) assoone as they heard their Brethren in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
agree upon it; we say their brethen, not limiting it
to the Parliament, which possibly may not be fitting.
And when you have agreed it (as we hope you will)
we are perswaded the body of the Kingdome of
<hi>Scotland</hi> will live and die with you, and we doubt
not but they will be preparing speedily upon expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of the Covenants passing amongst you. We
scarce ever saw so much of Christ for us as this day
in the Assemblies carrying of this businesse, such
weeping, such rejoycing, such resolution, such pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
expressions, as we confesse hath much refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our hearts, before extremely sadded with ill newes
from our deare Countrey; And hath put us in good
hope that this Nation (who set about this businesse
as becommeth the worke of God and the saving of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99413:4"/>
Kingdomes) shall be the meanes of lifting up of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> We are perswaded that
the most dejected and sad heart amongst you would
have the same thoughts we are now possessed with,
if they were with us; we thinke twenty thousand
of them will come to your helpe rather then faile.
And againe we say we hope you will quickly see a
good Army with you; yea, something done before,
or as soone as these Letters come at you: continue
with all earnestnesse as you were wont in seeking
God, and be not discouraged, or suffer your spirits to
languish; surely the arme of the Lord in this assistance
extends it selfe towards you, In the Mount the Lord
will be seene. Some of these reverend and godly
Ministers are comming to our Assembly; we shall
not neede to intreate you to give them the right
hand of fellowship, nor will we relate in what a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
respectfull way we have beene received by them
both in publike and private. We forbeare to write
any more because this Bearer will acquaint you with
our affaires, (and distribute our respects amongst you)
and his hast alloweth us no more time, but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
you to the grace of God, and subscribe our
selves.</p>
