            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>BEnevolent Reader, I do here present this small work, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it may produce good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. Certainly it hath assai'd before time to thrust it selfe into the world, but that it found so kind friends, who considering the unworthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, were pleased to suppresse it, and keep it prisoner in the Jail of their own houses. Howbeit now it is adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red abro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>; for I have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, so far as I could, to prune and lop off the former errours, that it may be the more plausible. I have also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned it with a new weed, to wit, of a Dialogue, or Questions and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, that so my Book may even learn to stoop to the weakest capacities. If i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> shall be thought to come in a new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, may you please to look into the

world, you may see abundance in this habit, our common Catechismes wear this gown; yea, Mr. <hi>St. Egerton</hi> of the <hi>Black Fryers</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the same treatises of Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> into this form. For my part, I hold it more easie then the former tract, neither greatly prejudiciall to the Authour.</p>
                  <p>This adorned, I have given this my second sonne full liberty to be a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, banishing my first and worst la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours from the view (so far as I can) of all men. For seeing it would not, when I would, I hold it not fit, that now it should be published. Touching that work, it flowed so inconsiderately from my penne, and slipped so rashly out of my hand, that it escaped not without many defaults, imperfections, obscurities and blemishes: that with the Egyptian Grashopper, it will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consume some part, but utterly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let this last work then, kind Reader, find favour in thine eyes: if that win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bird should be seen, it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear like a Cuckow at <hi>Christmas,</hi> or
<pb facs="tcp:31741:3"/>
like the Owle, which is the admiration of other birds. I will only now shew thee the causes producing this last work, and the use thereof, and so leave it to thy discreet judgement. The cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are manifold, first to stoppe the springing of that <hi>Abortive</hi> fore-spoken of, that so it might not thrive to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit of it's parent Secondly, that the gratuity and thankfulnesse to my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle aforesaid, might not to be buried in oblivion; for <hi>Tritum est perire, quod fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis ingrato.</hi> Thirdly, for the benefit, as I said, of the simpliest capacity. And finally, for the zeal I bear to mine own Countrey, being willing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous, that not onely men, but even women should exercise themselves in the studie of the sacred Arts.</p>
                  <p>If any shall demand what benefit shall redound hereby? or what may be the use hereof? I answer, it will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail greatly, not onely for Civil, and Moral discourse, but also for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of all Errors, either in Manners or Doctrine, for saith <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>

It seemeth to consist chiefly in disputing, but I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my self most in silence and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Well friend, thou mayst have great benefit by this Science, even in that likewise: an example of which, word for word, I have here produced out of Mr. <hi>Egertons</hi> Treatie aforesaid, that so thou mightest know how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thy self by this science, even in thy Meditation.</p>
                  <p>What thing is this, O my soul, that doth so besot thee? or what manner of thing may it be, wherewith thou art so delighted, or rather bewitched? And how doth the Holy Ghost in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture define it, and set it forth? who sinners but they that rebel against God, and against his holy will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in his Word? And what other thing is sin, but a breach and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of the Law of God, 1 <hi>Iohn,</hi> 3.4. A turning out of the way of life, as the phrase of the Old Testament doth import; and a swerving from the
<pb facs="tcp:31741:4"/>
right mark and end, as the word useth in the New Testament to signifie, <hi>viz.</hi> The glory of God, and thine own salvation.</p>
                  <p>This cursed thing called sin, is not of one sort or kind; it is as a Monster of many heads, and (as it were) a beast of many Horns.</p>
                  <p>It is both original, bred and born with us; and actuall springing out of us from that venomous root of our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Corruption.</p>

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is pardonable by the Free Grace and Mercie of God, to them that truely believe and repent; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is utterly unpardonable, and never to be forgiven, being such, that it is impossible that the Committers thereof should be renewed by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Math.</hi> 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. Sometimes
<pb facs="tcp:31741:5"/>
it rusheth mediately, and directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God; and sometimes it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more properly to the hurt of our neighbour.</p>
                  <p>But who is able to reckon up all the Branches of this most bitter and veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Tree; wherefore (to look more nearly unto it) whence proceedeth this d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>adly poyson? what may be the cause whereof it cometh? and the Fountain from whence it springeth? Surely, my Soul, it is even thy self: thou art the Root that bringeth forth all this bitterness; thou art the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from whence all this deadly Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome doth arise. For every man is tempted to sin, and he is drawn away of his own Concupiscence, and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
                  <p>Beware, therefore, O rebellious Soul! that thou lay not the blame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord; neither make him the Author of thy sin: For thou, O God, as thou canst not be tempted to evil they self, so thou temptest no man to commit sin, being a thing which thou so strictly forbiddest to all, and so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely threatnest in whomsoever it is found; and for which thou so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously
<pb facs="tcp:31741:5"/>
plaguest the wicked, and so sharply correctest thine own Children, <hi>Iames</hi> 1,13,14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 7,8. Thou, O Lord, art holiness it self, and the Fountain thereof; And there is none eternally, and unchangeably good, but thee alone, <hi>Math.</hi> 19. Thou madest man good at the beginning, but he sought many inventions, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. So all the imaginations and thoughts of his heart became onely evil conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, or every day, Sabbath and all, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5.</p>
                  <p>True it is indeed, That the Divel that old Dragon, using the subtil Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent for his instrument, did offer the first occasion of sinning, whereby he became an external cause of sin, and is called a Mutherer from the beginning, and the Author and Father of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.44. Yet man had power to have resisted him if he would, which he not doing, became the true and proper efficient cause of Corrupting himself, and all his posterity; who likewise, by means of the poyson de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from his Loyns, became also the proper and immediate causes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>

And who can bring (as the <hi>Wiseman</hi> saith) a clean thing out of filthiness? surely there is not one, but onely he who is holiness it self, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.4.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:31741:71"/>
any mean: I grant, that they are, except they be deliverers and conservers of the Roman Common-wealth, more then villans, more then homicides, more then parricides: if truely it be cruelty, rather to be a father to the country, then a murtherer of ones self: Thou art a wise and considerate man, what sayest thou? if they be parricides, why were they honoured of thee, and called to this order by the Roman People? why was <hi>Marcus Brutus</hi> by thy means freed from the law, if he were absent more then ten days from the city? why did <hi>Apolinares</hi> receive <hi>Marcus Brutus</hi> with incredible honour? why was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces given to <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Brutus?</hi> why were there Questors added? why were the numbers of Legates increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and this done by thee? they are not therefore homicides.

                     <p>WE see that all men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are able in some sort to <hi>accuse</hi> and <hi>excuse</hi>: some by <hi>chance</hi>; but some by <hi>method.</hi> This <hi>method</hi> may
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:31741:81"/>
be discovered: and to discover <hi>Method</hi> is al one with teaching an <hi>Art.</hi> If this <hi>Art</hi> consisted in Criminations only, and the skill to stirre up the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to <hi>Anger, Envy, Feare, Pity,</hi> or other <hi>affections</hi>; a <hi>Rhetorician</hi> in well ordered Common wealths and States, where it is forbidden to digress from the cause in hearing, could have nothing at all to say. For all these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions of the Judge are beside the question. And that which the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is to shew, and the Judge to give sentence on, is this only: <hi>'Tis so</hi>: or <hi>not so.</hi> The rest hath been decided already by the Law-maker; who jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of universals, and future things, could not be corrupted. Besides, 'tis an absurd thing, for a man to make croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the ruler he means to use.</p>
                     <p>It consisteth therfore chiefly in <hi>Proofes</hi>; which are <hi>Inferences</hi>: and all <hi>Inferences</hi> being <hi>Sllyogismes,</hi> a <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician,</hi> if he would observe the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a plain <hi>Syllogisme</hi> and an <hi>Enthymeme,</hi> (which is a <hi>Rhetoricall Syllogisme,</hi>) would make the best <hi>Rhetorician.</hi> For all <hi>Syllogismes</hi> and <hi>Inferences</hi> belong properly to <hi>Logick</hi>;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:31741:81"/>
Whether they inferre truth or probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: and because without this <hi>Art</hi> it would often come to pass, that evill men by the advantage of naturall abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, would carry an evil cause against a good; it brings with it at least this profit, that making the pleaders even in skill, it leaves the oddes only in the merit of the cause. Besides, ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly those that are Judges, are neither patient, nor capable of long <hi>Scienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall proofes,</hi> drawne from the <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> through many <hi>Syllogismes</hi>; and therefore had need to be instructed by the <hi>Rhetoricall,</hi> and shorter way. Lastly, it were ridiculous, to be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of being vanquished in exercises of the body, and not to be ashamed of being inferiour in the vertue of wel expressing the mind.</p>

                     <p>BEcause <hi>Hortation</hi> and <hi>Dehortation</hi> concern the Common-wealth, and are drawn from the <hi>Elements</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evill</hi>; as we have spoken of them already in the <hi>Abstract,</hi> so we must speak of them also in the <hi>Concrete</hi>; that is, of what is <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evill</hi> to each sort of Common-wealth in speciall.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Government</hi> of a Common-wealth, is either <hi>Democracy,</hi> or <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,</hi> or <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> or <hi>Monarchy.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Democracy</hi> is that, wherein all men with equall right, are preferred to the highest Magistracy by Lot.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aristocracy</hi> is that wherein the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Magistrate is chosen out of those, that had the best education, according to what the Lawes prescribe for best.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Oligarchy</hi> is that, where the highest Magistrate is chosen for wealth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Monarchy</hi> is that, wherein one man hath the Government of all; which <hi>Government,</hi> if he limit it by Law, is called <hi>Kingdom</hi>; if by his own will, <hi>Tyranny.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:31741:91"/>The end of <hi>Democracy,</hi> or the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Government, is <hi>Liberty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The end of <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> is <hi>the riches of those that govern.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The end of <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> is <hi>good Laws,</hi> and <hi>good ordering of the City.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The end of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or <hi>Kings,</hi> is <hi>the safety of the People, and conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own authority.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Good</hi> therefore, in each sort of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> is that which conduceth to these their ends.</p>
                     <p>And because <hi>beliefe</hi> is not gotten only by <hi>proofes,</hi> but also from <hi>manners</hi>; the <hi>manners</hi> of each sort of Commonwealth ought to be well understood by him that undertaketh to perswade, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade in matter of State. Their <hi>manners</hi> may be known by their <hi>designs</hi>; &amp; their <hi>designs</hi> by their <hi>ends</hi>; and their <hi>ends</hi> by what we see them take <hi>pleasure</hi> in.

                     <p>Besides, in a <hi>Demonstrative Oration,</hi> the Orator must shew, that he whom he prayseth, did what he prayseth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constrainedly, and willingly.</p>

                        <hi>To Magnifie,</hi> and <hi>to Praise,</hi> differ in themselves, as <hi>Felicity</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi> For <hi>Praise</hi> declares a mans <hi>Vertue</hi>; and <hi>Magnifying</hi> declares his Felicity.</p>

                        <hi>Praise</hi> is a kind of inverted <hi>Precept.</hi> For to say, <hi>Do it because 'tis good,</hi> is a <hi>Precept.</hi> But to say, <hi>He is good because he did it, is Praise.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An Orator in <hi>Praising</hi> must also use the formes of <hi>Amplification</hi>; such as these:
<list>
                           <item>He was the first that did it.</item>
                           <item>The onely man that did it.</item>

                           <item>He did it with disadvantage of Time.</item>
                           <item>He did it with little help.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>He was the cause, that the Law or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Rewards and Honors for such Actions.</p>
                     <p>Further, he that will <hi>praise</hi> a Man, must compare him with others; and his actions with the actions of others; especially with such as are renowned.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Amplification</hi> is more proper to a <hi>Demonstrative Oration</hi> then to any other. For here the Actions are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd; and the Orators part is only this, to contribute unto them Magnitude and Luster.</p>

                     <p>OPposite in a manner to <hi>Pity</hi> in good men, is <hi>Indignation,</hi> which is grief for the prosperity of a man unworthy.</p>
                     <p>With <hi>Indignation</hi> there is alwayes joyned a joy for the prosperity of a man worthy, as <hi>Pity</hi> is always with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in the adversity of them that deserve it.</p>

                     <p>They are slaves to Gain.</p>
                     <p>And live more by reason then Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome; because reason leads to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, as Custome to that which is Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable.</p>

                     <p>The third, that an <hi>Objection</hi> is no <hi>EnthymemE,</hi> is apparent by this, that an <hi>Objection</hi> is no more but an <hi>Opinion, Example,</hi> or other <hi>Instance,</hi> produced to make appear, that the Adversaries Argument does not conclude.</p>
                     <p>Thus much of <hi>Examples, Sentences, Enthymemes,</hi> and generally of all things that belong to <hi>Argumentation</hi>; from what <hi>Places</hi> they may be drawn, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>For <hi>Tragedians</hi> were the first that invented such <hi>Action,</hi> and that but of late; and it consisteth in governing well the <hi>Magnitude, Tone,</hi> and <hi>Measure</hi> of the <hi>Voice</hi>; a thing less subject to

                     <p>And yet there have been Rules deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered concerning it, as far forth as serve for <hi>Poetry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Oratoricall Action</hi> has not been hitherto reduced to <hi>Art.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Orators</hi> in the beginning, when they saw that the <hi>Poets</hi> in barren and faigned Arguments, nevertheless at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained great Reputation; supposing it had proceeded from the choice, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of words, fell into a Stile, by imitation of them, approaching to Verse, and made choice of words.</p>
                     <p>But when the <hi>Poets</hi> changed their St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Seeing therefore <hi>Pronuntiation,</hi> or <hi>Action</hi> are in some degree necessary al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for an <hi>Orator,</hi> the Precepts thereof are to be fetcht from the <hi>Art of Poetry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>[In the mean time this may be one generall Rule. If the <hi>Words; Tone, Greatness</hi> of the Voice, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture</hi> of the body and Countenance,

                     <p>THere be two sorts of <hi>Stiles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The one <hi>continued</hi> or to be <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended at once</hi>; the other <hi>divided,</hi> or <hi>distinguished</hi> by Periods.</p>
                     <p>The first sort was in use with anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Writers; but is now out of date.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="256" facs="tcp:31741:140"/>An example of this <hi>Stile</hi> is in the History of <hi>Herodotus</hi>; wherein there is no Period till the end of the whole History.</p>
                     <p>In the other kind of <hi>Stile,</hi> that is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished by Periods, a <hi>period</hi> is such a Part as is perfect in it selfe; and has such length, as may easily be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by the understanding.</p>
                     <p>This later kind is pleasant; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer unpleasant, because this appeares finite, the other infinite: in this the Hearer has alwayes somewhat set out, and terminated to him; in the other he fore-sees no end, and has nothing finished to him: this may easily be committed to memory, because of the measure and cadence (which is the cause that verses be easily remembred;) the other not.</p>
                     <p>Every Sentence ought to end with the <hi>period,</hi> and nothing to be interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Period</hi> is either <hi>simple,</hi> or <hi>divided</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Parts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Simple</hi> is that which is <hi>Indivisible</hi>; as, <hi>I wonder you fear not their ends, whose actions you imitate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>Period divided,</hi> is that which not
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:31741:140"/>
only has perfection and length conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for respiration, but also <hi>Parts.</hi> As, <hi>I wonder you are not afraid of their ends, seeing you imitate their actions:</hi> where in these words, <hi>I wonder you are not afraid of their ends,</hi> is one <hi>Colon,</hi> or <hi>Part</hi>; and in these, <hi>Seeing you imitate their actions,</hi> another: and both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make the Period.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>parts,</hi> or <hi>members,</hi> and <hi>peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods</hi> of speech ought neither to be <hi>too long,</hi> nor <hi>too short.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Too long</hi> are they, which are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced beyond the expectation of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Too short,</hi> are they that end before he expects it.</p>
                     <p>Those that be <hi>too long,</hi> leave the Hearer behind, like him that walking, goes beyond the usuall end of the walk, and thereby out-goes him that walkes with him.</p>
                     <p>They that be <hi>too short,</hi> make the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer stumble; for when he looks farre before him, the end stops him before he be aware.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>period</hi> that is <hi>divided</hi> into Parts, is either <hi>divided only</hi>; or has also an <hi>Opposition</hi> of the <hi>parts</hi> one to another.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Divided onely</hi> is such as this; <hi>This the Senate knowes; the Consull sees; and yet the man lives.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>Period</hi> with <hi>Opposition</hi> of <hi>Parts,</hi> called also <hi>Antithesis,</hi> and the parts <hi>Antitheta,</hi> is when <hi>contrary parts</hi> are put together; or also joyned by a third.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Contrary parts</hi> are put together, as here, <hi>The one has obtained Glory, the other Riches; both by my benefit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Antitheta</hi> are therefore acceptable; because not only the <hi>parts</hi> appear the better for the <hi>opposition</hi>; but also for that they carry with them a certain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of that kind of <hi>Enthymeme,</hi> which leads to <hi>Impossibility.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parts,</hi> or <hi>Members</hi> of a <hi>Period,</hi> are said to be <hi>equall,</hi> when they have alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or almost equall Number of Syllables.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parts,</hi> or <hi>Members</hi> of a <hi>period,</hi> are said to be <hi>like,</hi> when they <hi>begin,</hi> or <hi>end</hi> alike: and the more <hi>Similitudes,</hi> and the greater <hi>equality</hi> there is of Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables, the more gracefull is the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod.</p>

                     <p>FOrasmuch as there is nothing more delightfull to a man, then to finde that he apprehends and learns easily; it necessarily follows, that those <hi>Words</hi> are most <hi>gratefull</hi> to the Eare, that make a man seem to see before his eyes the thing signified.</p>
                     <p>And therefore <hi>forrain Words</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant, because <hi>Obscure</hi>; and <hi>Plain Words,</hi> because <hi>too Manifest,</hi> making us learn nothing new: but <hi>Metaphors</hi> please; for they beget in us by the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> or by some <hi>common</hi> thing to that with another, a kind of <hi>Science</hi>: as when an <hi>Old Man</hi> is called <hi>Stubble</hi>; a man suddainly learns that he growes up, flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth, and withers like Grass, being put in mind of it by the qualities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to <hi>Stubble,</hi> and to <hi>Old Men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That which a <hi>Metaphor</hi> does, a <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude</hi> does the same; but with less <hi>grace,</hi> because with more <hi>prolixity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="260" facs="tcp:31741:142"/>Such <hi>Enthymemes</hi> are the most <hi>grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> which neither are presently very Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, nor yet very hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; but are comprehended, while they are uttering, or presently after, though not understood before.</p>
                     <p>The things that make a speech <hi>grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> are these; <hi>Antitheta, Metaphors,</hi> and <hi>Animation.</hi>

                     <p>Of <hi>Metaphors</hi> the most <hi>graceful</hi> is that which is drawn from <hi>Proportion.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Animation</hi> is that expression which makes us seem to see the thing before

                        <hi>PRoofs</hi> are to be applied to something Controverted.</p>
                     <p>The Controversie in <hi>Iudiciall Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> is, <hi>Whether it has been don; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it has been hurtfull; whether the matter be so great, and whether it be Iust, or no.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In a question of <hi>Fact,</hi> one of the Parties of necessity is faulty (for ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the <hi>Fact</hi> is no excuse) and therefore the <hi>Fact</hi> is chiefly to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Demonstratives,</hi> the <hi>Fact</hi> for the most part is supposed: but the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>profit</hi> of the <hi>Fact</hi> are to be <hi>proved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Deliberatives,</hi> the question is, Whether the thing be <hi>like to be, or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be so Great</hi>; or whether it be <hi>Iust</hi>; or whether it be <hi>profitable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Besides the application of the <hi>proofe</hi> to the question, a man ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, whether his Adversary have ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:31741:150"/>
in any point without the Cause. For 'tis a signe he does the same in the Cause.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>proofes</hi> themselves are either <hi>Examples,</hi> or <hi>Enthymemes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>Deliberative Oration,</hi> because 'tis of things to come, requireth rather <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,</hi> then <hi>Enthymemes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But a <hi>Iudiciall Oration,</hi> being of things past, which have a necessity in them, and may be concluded <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistically,</hi> requireth rather <hi>Enthymemes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Enthymemes</hi> ought not to come too thick together: for they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Nor ought a man endeavour to <hi>prove</hi> every thing by <hi>Enthymeme,</hi> lest like some <hi>Philosophers,</hi> he collect what is <hi>known,</hi> from what is <hi>lesse known.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor ought a man to use <hi>Enthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memes,</hi> when he would move the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to some affection: For seeing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers motions do mutually destroy or weaken one another, he will lose ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Enthymeme,</hi> or the <hi>affection</hi> that he would move.</p>
                     <p>For the same reason, a man ought not to use <hi>Enthymemes</hi> when he would expresse <hi>Manners.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>Deliberative Oration</hi> is more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult then a <hi>Iudiciall,</hi> because 'tis of the <hi>future,</hi> whereas a <hi>Iudiciall</hi> is of that which is <hi>past,</hi> and that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently may be known; and because it has <hi>principles,</hi> namely the <hi>Law</hi>; and it is easier to <hi>prove</hi> from <hi>principles,</hi> then without.</p>
                     <p>Besides, a <hi>Deliberative Oration</hi> wants those helps of <hi>turning to the Adversary,</hi> of <hi>speaking of himself</hi>; of <hi>raising passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He therefore that wants matter in a <hi>Deliberative Oration,</hi> let him bring in some <hi>person</hi> to <hi>praise</hi> or <hi>dispraise.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in <hi>Demonstratives</hi> he that has nothing to say in <hi>commendation</hi> or <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation</hi> of the <hi>principall party,</hi> let him <hi>praise</hi> or <hi>dispraise</hi> some body else, as his <hi>Father,</hi> or <hi>Kinsman,</hi> or the very <hi>vertues</hi> or <hi>vices</hi> themselves.</p>
                     <p>He that wants <hi>not proofes,</hi> let him not only <hi>prove</hi> strongly, but also insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate his <hi>Mannerss</hi>: but he that has no <hi>proofe,</hi> let him nevertheles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It is either,

                           <item>1. The fine manner of words, called a Trope, or,</item>

                     <p>This changing of words was first found out by necessity, for the want of words; afterward confirmed by Delight, because such words are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and gracious to the ear. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this change of signification must be shame fa'cd, and, as it were, maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it may seem rather to be led by the hand to another signification, to be driven by force unto the same: yet somtimes this fine manner of <hi>Speech</hi> swerveth from this perfection, and then it is,</p>

                           <item>2. The excess of this fineness, call'd <hi>Hyperbole.</hi>

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:31741:155"/>
yet it doth not, without some fineness of Speech, utter thus much, <hi>That one seek not a righteousness beyond the Law of God; and that when none can live without all sin, yet that they take heed that sin bear not Dominion over them</hi>: As, <hi>My tears are my meat day and night. Those that hateme are mo in number, than the hairs of my head.</hi> Both which do utter by an expresse of Speech, a great sorrow, and a great number of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p>The abuse of Speech, is, when the change of speech is hard, strange, and unwonted, as in the first example.</p>
                     <p>The excess of speech is, when the change of signification is very high and loftie, as in the second Example, and <hi>Ps.</hi> 6.7.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>This Trope is perceived, either by the contrariety of the Matter, or the Manner of utterance, or both: so <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> said to the Prophets of <hi>Baal, Crie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>Examples of the second sort, as these: So <hi>Israel is put for those of Iuda sometimes:</hi> So <hi>Nations for the Heathen: A Minister of Christ, for an Apostle of Christ,</hi> Rom. 1. <hi>A Minister put for a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributer,</hi> Rom. 12.</p>

                     <p>So sometimes less is spoken, and yet more is understood; which is called

Diminution, or <hi>Meiosis</hi>: As <hi>Iames</hi> saith, to him <hi>that knoweth how to do wel, and doth not, it is sin</hi>: That is, a great sin.

Likewise the denial by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison: so <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Receive my words, and not silver:</hi> That is, my words rather than silver: so <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I was sent to Preach, and not to Baptise:</hi> That is, not so much to Baptise, as to Preach.</p>

because we have no worthy examples in our English tongue, we judge the larg handling of them should be more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then necessary.</p>
                     <p>The measure of sounds belonging to Orators is that which, as it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, so it differeth altogether from rime and verse, and is very changeable with it selfe.

                     <p>In the Beginning of the Sentence little care is to be had, in the midle least of all, and in the end chiefest regard is to be had, because the fall of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is most marked, and therefore lest it fall out to be harsh and unplesant both to the minde and eare, there must be most variety and change.</p>
                     <p>Now this change must not be above six syllables from the end, and that must be set downe in feet of two syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables.</p>

                     <p>GArnishing of the frame of speech in a sentence, is a garnishing of the shape of speech, or a figure; which for the forcible moving of affections, doth after a sort beautifie the sense and very meaning of a sentence. Because it hath in it a certain manly majesty, which far surpasseth the soft delicacy or dainties of the former figures.</p>

                     <p>The garnishing of speech alone,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:31741:163"/>
is when as the sentence is garnished without speech had to other. And it is either in regard of the <hi>Matter</hi>; or of the <hi>Person.</hi>

                     <p>A crying out or <hi>Exclamation</hi> is the first, which is set forth by a word of calling out: Sometimes of wonder, As, Rom. 8. <hi>O the depth of the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God</hi>!

                     <p>A <hi>keeping of silence</hi> or <hi>Aposiopesis</hi> is, when the course of the sentence bygon is so stayed, as thereby some patt of the sentence not being uttered, may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.

                     <p>To the second, he would answer, that the proposition or first part, is not according to the rule of righteousnesse, because the proper subject and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct are not joyned together: which

                     <p>Unto the third he would answer, that the assumption is not necessarily true, because if the word <hi>Body</hi> be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken properly, it is not then true that is set down: but if it be taken figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, it is true, and therfore would bid him make the assumption neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily true, and then say, Christ faith in proper words, <hi>It is my body</hi>; and then it is false.</p>

                     <p>And they be either those that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred To a Syllogism.; or To <hi>Method.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And they again are <hi>Generall,</hi> and <hi>Speciall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Generall which are referred to the generall properties of a Syllogisme.</p>
                     <p>It is either when all the parts are <hi>Denied</hi>; or are <hi>Particular.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All parts denied: As,

                           <l>No Pope is a Divell.</l>
                           <l>No man is a Divell.</l>

                     <p>Therefore.</p>
                     <p>And this must be answered, that it

is not according to the definition of a Negative syllogisme, which must have alwayes one affirmative.</p>
                     <p>All particular: As,
<q>
                           <l>Some unlawfull thing must be suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as namely that which cannot be taken away.</l>

                           <l>Therefore the stews must be suffered.</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>This is answered by the definition of a speciall syllogism, which is that hath one part generall.</p>
                     <p>The speciall are those which are <hi>Simple,</hi> or <hi>Compound.</hi>

                     </list>
                     <p>More plain is when the assumption is denied, or the question is not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: As,

                           <l>Every Apostle may preach abroad:</l>
                           <l>Some Apostle is not a Pope,</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>Some Pope may not preach abroad.</l>

                     <p>Also.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>Every Pope is a Lord:</l>
                        <l>Some Pope may give an universall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</l>
                        <l>Therefore every Lord may give an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal licence.</l>

                        <hi>Less plain</hi> hath one fallcy in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon when the proposition is speciall: As,
<q>
                           <l>Some player is a rogue:</l>
                           <l>Every vagabond is rogue,</l>
                           <l>Therefore, every player is a vagabond.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Also,
<q>
                           <l>Some player is a rogue:</l>
                           <l>Every vagabond is a player.</l>
                           <l>Therefore every player is a Rogue.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fallacie of the first kind is when all the parts be affirmative: As,
<q>
                           <l>All Pauls Bishops were ordained for unity.</l>
                           <l>All Arch-Bishops be ordained for u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</l>
                           <l>Therefore, all Arch-Bishops are Pauls Bishops.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fallacie of the second kind is when the assumption is denied: As,
<q>
                           <l>Every puritane is a Christian.</l>
                           <l>No L. Bishop is a puritane.</l>
                           <l>Therefore, No L. Bishop is a Christian.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hitherto of the fallacies referred to a simple Syllogism.</p>
                     <p>Now follow those which are refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a compound, which are those which are referred either To the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexive,</hi> or To the <hi>disjoyned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the first sort one is when the first

                        </gap>o likewise: As,

                           <l>If any man have two benefices, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <l>He may not escape unpunished at the Bishops hands.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>The second part is affirmed, that the first may be so also. As,
<q>
                           <l>If every ignorant minister were put out of the Church, and a Preacher in his place, we should have good order:</l>

                           </l>
                           <l>Every ignorant minister is put out of the Church; and a Preacher in his place.</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>Of those referred to the disjoyned, the first is, when all the parts of the disjunction or proposition are not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed: As,
<q>
                           <l>Every ignorant minister is to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, or not.</l>
                           <l>But he is not.</l>
                           <l>Therefore he is.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second kind is when the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the copulative negative axiome is denied, that the fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t may be so; As,

                           <l>A non-resident, is either a faithfull, or unfaithfull Minister.</l>
                           <l>But he is unfaithfull, Ergo, &amp;c.</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>And thus much of the fallacies in a Syllogisme.</p>
                     <p>The fallacie in Method is when, to deceive withall, the end is set in the beginning, the speciall before the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, good order be gone, confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: And finally, when darknesse, length and hardnesse is laboured af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
