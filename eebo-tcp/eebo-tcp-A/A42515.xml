            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Book of <hi>Numbers,</hi> beſides a Muſter-Roll of the ſeveral Tribes and Families of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which it affords us in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part (and from whence it hath its Name) preſents us alſo with a Journal of the Motions of that mighty Hoſt, or an
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95420:3"/>
Hiſtory of the moſt remarkable Paſſages of their Forty years Travel through the Wilderneſs towards <hi>Canaan.</hi> And in the Courſe of this Hiſtory ſets before our Eyes a wonderful Scene of miraculous Providences on the one hand, and as ſtrange and frequent Inſtances of human Folly and Frailty on the other. On Gods part, a diſplay of infinite Power, Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Patience: And on the part of the People, prodigious Infidelity, Stubborneſs, Peeviſhneſs, and Ingratitude. God Almighty had ſeen their Affliction in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and had heard their Groanings, and by a powerful Hand had reſcued them from an horrible Slavery under an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relenting Tyrant; and by the gentle Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was leading them into poſſeſſion of the good Land he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them. But they inſtead of Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for ſo great a Deliverance, are perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually quarrelling with his Inſtruments or his Methods, or tempting and affronting his Divine Majeſty; and which was moſt Ingrateful of all, are continually upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with the remembrance of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95420:3"/>
good Things they had forgone in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In particular, ſometimes they want Water, and then all Gods Miracles of Power and Providence are forgotten; There is no help, <hi>but they muſt all be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed in the Wilderneſs.</hi> Another time they want Bread, and then God and <hi>Moſes</hi> are Noſed with <hi>Egypt</hi> again, <hi>Were there no Graves in</hi> Egypt, <hi>but we muſt be brought hither to be Starved?</hi> Well, God gives them Bread to the full, <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> Bread from Heaven, Angels-Bread: But this will not ſerve the turn neither, they muſt have Fleſh too, and that not ſo much for neceſſity, as <hi>Capriciouſly</hi> to try Gods Power: <hi>Can God prepare a Table alſo in the Wilderneſs?</hi> If not, they are preſently for <hi>Egypt</hi> again: So in the Text, <hi>the mixt Multitude fell a Luſting, and the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>wept, and ſaid, Who ſhall give us Fleſh to Eat? We remember the Cucombers, and Melons, and Onions, and Garlick,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In which paſſage of the Scripture, I obſerve theſe Four things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The peculiar circumſtances of this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95420:4"/>
Mutiny or Murmuring.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Beginners or Ringleaders of this Diſorder.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The quick and general Infection of this Miſchief.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Gods Reſentment of their Carriage. Which when I have opened, it will be eaſie to make Application of all to our own Caſe.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) I begin with the Firſt, <hi>The Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Aggravations of this Murmuring;</hi> and amongſt them theſe Four are moſt remarkable, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, The Time of it.</hi> It was now but about a Year and two Months (as Divines compute) from their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and yet ſo quickly could they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their own Sufferings and Gods Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; And nothing runs in their Thoughts, but the Fiſh, the Onions, and Garlick, &amp;c. which they had there: A ſtrange Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Inconſtancy of Mind this! Had it been an Age or two after, one would not have ſo much wondered, that when Time (which effaces all things) had worn out the Remembrance of their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95420:4"/>
Hardſhips, their other Entertainments there might have been reflected on with ſome guſt and delight; but ſo quickly to forget God and themſelves too, argued them to be a true <hi>Mobile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And, Secondly, their Wantonneſs and Curioſity,</hi> was no leſs remarkable, than their Levity and Inconſtancy. They had Bread to the full, which might very well have ſatisfied them in a Wilderneſs; and eſpecially when they were going to <hi>Canaan,</hi> a Land flowing with Milk and Hony, they might well have diſpenſed with ſome tolerable Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Way; tolerable Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might ſerve the turn in a Wilderneſs. But they had not only Bread enough, but deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Bread, <hi>Manna;</hi> however that will not do, they muſt have Fleſh too; they made a piſh at <hi>Manna; Nothing but this</hi> Manna, ſay they.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, There was Inſolence,</hi> as well as Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs and Curioſity in the caſe; it was Fleſh they deſired, not ſo much for their Hunger, as for their Luſt. They muſt have their will, or elſe to <hi>Egypt</hi> again; and it was more their deſign to tempt God, than to be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95420:5"/>
gratified themſelves. They muſt preſcribe to God what Miracles he ſhall do for them; they muſt have arbitrary Proofs of his Omnipotency, <hi>Can God prepare a Table in the Wilderneſs?</hi> If he will not work Miracles, what and when they think good, they will follow him no further, but to <hi>Egypt</hi> again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly, There was a prophane Spirit</hi> in all this, a plain contempt of God and Religion. God had aſſerted them to be his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; had newly given them Laws, which it would have been both their Wiſdom and Happineſs to walk in. He intended to keep them a while in the Wilderneſs, to difuſe them from the Superſtitions of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to train them by degrees into the Habits and Cuſtoms of the True Religion; and then ſhortly to place them in their own Land, under their own Laws and Princes, and far from any temptation of Apoſtaſie from him and them; but they meditated a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe, they were indifferent as to this buſineſs of God and Religion; they would run the venture and hazard of Idolatry, and defiling their Conſciences with the Follies of <hi>Egypt,</hi> rather than want the <hi>Onions</hi> and <hi>Garlick.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95420:5"/>
So we ſee a long time after this, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Time, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>They talk to go down to</hi> Egypt, <hi>and have not inquired at my Mouth; their Princes were at</hi> Zoan, <hi>and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors came to</hi> Hanes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> q. d. <hi>They were negotiating a Peace between Me and the Gods of</hi> Egypt; <hi>they were contriving a</hi> Concordat <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the true Religion and Idolatry; they would not ſtick out upon point of Religion, ſo they might accommodate their Secular ends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much for Matter of Fact it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>In the ſecond place,</hi> I obſerve in the Text, the Beginners or Ring-leaders of this Sedition, <hi>A mixed Multitude: Who</hi> they were we may gueſs by <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 38. when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came up out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>A mixed Multitude came along with them;</hi> that is, ſuch as were not of the Race of the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor of any one Nation, Tribe or Family; but a <hi>Colluvies</hi> of ſeveral Nations, or perhaps a Baſtard brood, part <hi>Jew</hi> and part <hi>Egyptian,</hi> but of no certain Principles; ſuch as had their God and Religion to chuſe, and had only the fancy to follow the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in this great and famous Expedition, in hopes to mend their own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:95420:6"/>
This <hi>Vulgus,</hi> this Rabble begins the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny (as they are always wont to do) and ſuch are dangerous Incendiaries in all Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties; they have not only no Honour, nor Principles, nor Conſcience; but no Prudence, no Modeſty, no Reſtraint; there is no Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to take hold of them by, to govern and manage them. Of theſe the Hiſtorian ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>Ineſt omni populo malignum quiddam &amp; querulum in Imperantes;</hi> the Populacy, or Rabble, is always a tumultuous ungoverned Beaſt. They are of no Value, of no Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, nor Capacity, but to do Miſchief; <hi>Ignavus quiſquis ſeditioſus;</hi> theſe are uſually the firſt in at every thing, and firſt out; that firſt diſhonour a good Enterprize by Abetting it, and then betray it by Revolting from it.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I obſerve in the Text, the quick and general ſpreading and infection of this ſeditious Murmuring Humor; the <hi>mixed Multitude fell a Luſting,</hi> and preſently all <hi>Iſrael</hi> put Finger in the Eye, and weep for the Entertainments of <hi>Egypt;</hi> like Fire, though it begin in a little contemptible Spark, it quickly diffuſes it ſelf, and bears
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95420:6"/>
down all before it; I ſets all in a combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Example,</hi> eſpecially of Evil, is too taking amongſt the generality of Mankind, <hi>Peco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ritu ſequimur antecedentium gregem, non qua eundem eſt, ſed qua itur;</hi> as <hi>Cato</hi> obſerves of Sheep; It is eaſier to drive a multitude of them, than a few; get but ſome to go, and all the reſt will follow.</p>
            <p>It is very unreaſonable in it ſelf, and therefore may ſeem ſtrange, that evil Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſhould be more prevalent than good; but Experience leaves us without doubt, that ſo it is for Matter of Fact, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the caſe of Mutiny or Sedition. Whilſt there are (as there ever will be) a teachy, querulous, diſcontented People, ſo long there will never want ſome Pretence or other for Diſturbance. Publick Affairs can never be conducted with that Even-hand, but there will be ſome Grievance or other to ſuch over-tender and captious People; and the Paſſionate repreſenting of theſe will expoſe the Authority, even of <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, and weaken the Hearts and Hands of well-meaning People. But,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:95420:7"/>
               <hi>Fourthly, and Laſtly,</hi> I obſerve Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of this matter, v. 1. of this chapter; <hi>And when the People complained, it diſpleaſed the Lord; and the Lord heard it, and his Anger was kindled; and the Fire of the Lord burnt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and Conſumed them that were in the uttermoſt part of the Camp.</hi> And again, v. 33. of this Chapter, though God gratified their Humor; yet, <hi>while the Fleſh was between their Teeth, e're it was chawed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled againſt the People, and he ſmote them with a very great Plague:</hi> and beyond all this, in Chap. 14. v. 23. he takes up a reſolution, and ſolemnly Swears, <hi>That not a Man of theſe, that had thus provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him by their Murmurings, ſhould enter into the good Land he had Sworn unto their Fathers, to give them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thus,</hi> I have, (as much as was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to my purpoſe) open'd the Letter or Hiſtory of my Text; <hi>Let us</hi> now ſee how far this will concern our ſelves. And I doubt, it will be found a very eaſy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to draw a Parallel, in the Sin and Folly of this preſent Generation; and I pray God, We be not in ſome meaſure parallel in the Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:95420:7"/>
               <hi>It cannot</hi> be denied, that we have lately had a ſignal Deliverance from a Slavery, little inferiour to that of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and though there hath not appeared altogether ſo much of Miracles in the effecting it, yet there have been moſt ſignal Inſtances of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Hand in bringing it about, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in infatuating the Councils, cowing the Spirits, baffling the Powers, and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all the Forces that were ready to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct our Deliverance.</p>
            <p>And now, that we eſcaped the Houſe of Bondage, and come into ſome ſtraits in our Paſſage through the Wilderneſs, towards a ſtate of Reſt and Settlement, we fall a Murmuring, and a thouſand little Scruples and Jealouſies run in our Heads, which were never thought of (or thought ſcorn of) before; yet now are able to make us wiſh, we had never ſet out from <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some</hi> are affirighted with the Difficulties before us, and dream of <hi>Gyants and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kims,</hi> as if the Promiſed Land was to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without conflict; or, as if the God that Miraculouſly delivered us out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was not able to carry us through to <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:95420:8"/>
               <hi>Some</hi> falſe Spies miſrepreſent the good Land, as if it was not worth the contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for; and that our Religion, Laws and Liberties, would not quit the coſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some</hi> ſuſpect Religion and Reformation it ſelf, as if it would be too ſtrict for them; and therefore their Mouths water after the Onions and Garlick they left behind them. <hi>Others</hi> complain of the Intermiſſion of Trade; ſome of the Taxes and Burdens.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>One ſort</hi> Murmurs, That they are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to their Mind, and that others are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced above their Merits. <hi>Another ſort</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, That their Party is not incouraged e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and that ſome other Party, hath too much of the Publick Countenance; and all theſe look towards <hi>Egypt</hi> again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> to inflame this Reckoning, we want not a mixed Multitude amongſt us: From Abroad, French Agents and Popiſh Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; at Home, all Diſcontented perſons, that love to fiſh in troubled Waters, and thoſe whoſe Guilt renders them Jealous of a Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement; all half Proteſtants and Papiſts in Maſquerade, as alſo Men of no Religion, but whoſe Intereſt is all the Conſcience they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95420:8"/>
have; and together with theſe, ſome, who though perhaps they cannot digeſt down-right Popery, yet the <hi>Manna</hi> of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is too thin a Diet for their groſs Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs; but Onions and Garlick, a good hautguſt of Superſtition will reliſh well with them: All theſe begin the Murmuring, and are ready to ſet the Multitude agog for <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole Matter, the Parallel is but too eaſy and obvious, between our condition and that of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Now therefore it is time to take care, that it go on no further, leſt we match them in the Miſchief and Puniſhment, as we ſeem to have done in the Folly.</p>
            <p>In order to the prevention of which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Calamity, I have a few Things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Occaſion, to offer to the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all true Engliſh Men, Lovers of their Country, and of the Proteſtant Religion: And though I know, I now ſhall be heard by few of thoſe that are concern'd in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and perhaps by none of thoſe that have moſt need of it; yet I will make uſe of this Opportunity, to deliver my ſelf with all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95420:9"/>
in the caſe, to the intent, that you that hear me, may Report it to others of your Acquaintance; and by that means (and the Bleſſing of God upon it) ſome check may be given to that Murmuring Spirit, that is begun amongſt us.</p>
            <p>The ſum of what I have to ſay, will be comprized in theſe three Particulars:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That we will be intreated to reflect back a little, and to conſider what our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was before we came into this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and fell under the preſent Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Diſcontent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That we will alſo look Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially about us, and view our preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to the end that we may make the better Judgment; Whether even now in the general, and for the main, we have not thoſe Advantages which may countervail the objected Straits and Inconveniences?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That we will look forward, and conſider as diſcreet Men, what is likely to be the effect of our Murmuring, and of thinking of returning back to <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will not, I preſume, ſeem ſtrange to you, (who know me well) that I ſhould
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95420:9"/>
(at this time eſpecially) make uſe of this Freedom, ſince I am perſwaded your own Thoughts and Experience of me, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit me from all ſuſpicion of Partiality to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any Perſon or Party of Men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, in regard you are in ſome meaſure aware, That as I have neither been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally diſobliged by the former Times or Government; ſo neither have I been (nor am I capable of being) bribed or biaſſed by any Obligation from the preſent.</p>
            <p>Therefore with the ſincerity and good-Will of an <hi>Engliſh Man</hi> towards his Native Country, and as a reſolv'd Proteſtant for the Honour or Intereſt of that Excellent Religion, I go on with my Intentions. And,</p>
            <p>Firſt, I earneſtly beſeech all my Brethren and Country men, That before they ſuffer themſelves to be tempted to murmur and repine at the Preſent ſtate of things, they will reflect upon the Condition of our Affairs before this Revolution, and what it was likely to have come to, had it not pleaſed the Divine Providence to interrupt the courſe of Things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:95420:10"/>
And the Time is not ſo long ſince, but that we may eaſily remember We were Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable enough; nor were the Deſigns ſo obſcure, or the Methods ſo intricate, but we might eaſily foreſee, that we ſhould quickly have been intolerably Unhappy, at that rate of Proceeding.</p>
            <p>Do we not know, That all our Laws (contrived by the Wiſdom, and defended by the Proweſs of our Anceſtors) were all cut off at one Blow by a <hi>Diſpenſing Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were not all, or at leaſt moſt of the <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> in <hi>England</hi> (the Glory and Enſign of Honour to all the Cities and Great Societies of the Nation) confirmed by all former Princes, owned by the Laws, and eſtabliſh'd by Ancient Cuſtom, damned and diſſolved at once?</p>
            <p>Was not the ſacred Right of Property invaded, and Freeholds taken away (not only from Private Perſons, but from the Nobleſt Societies) without form or colour of Law?</p>
            <p>Were not all our Lives at Mercy, and had we not ſeveral dreadful Inſtances of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt Men violently hurried out of the World, <gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page missing〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:95420:10"/>
And whether even our Lives themſelves were not held at Mercy, one would be tempted ſhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuſpect, who reflected upon the dreadful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſeveral Eminent Perſons hurried out of the World, ſome one way, and ſome another.</p>
            <p>In a word, Were not Parliaments (the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative of our Conſtitution, and redreſs of our Grievances) either diſuſed, as inconſiſtent with the Deſigns in hand; or endeavoured to be corrupted, fore-ſtalled, or the freedom of chuſing them deſigned by new and unheard of Methods, to be for ever deſtroyed?</p>
            <p>Theſe things are too freſh in our Memories to need Repetition, too plain to be denied, and too great in themſelves to be aggravated; but,
<q>Haec olim meminiſſe juvabit—.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And as for that great Affair of Religion (dearer to all true <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> than their very Lives) the proſpect thereof was in thoſe Times very melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, when a Deſign was not only form'd, but begun to be put in execution, of laying a <hi>Yoke</hi> upon our Necks, which neither we nor our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers were able to bear. And in purſuance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, not only mercenary Pens were employed to expoſe and ridicule <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi> in general; but Care was taken to blow up, inflame and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the Diviſions amongſt <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> partly by odious Names of diſtinction, and partly by exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating their Minds one againſt another, as that in concluſion all of them might be deſtroyed with the leſs pity or ſcandal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:95420:11"/>
It is true, the Church of <hi>England</hi> was all this while complemented, but never the ſecurer from deſtruction: Witneſs the Impriſoning, and ſevere treatment of 7 excellent Biſhops at once, for but daring to underſtand the Project, and humbly interpoſing their Advice; and the ſuſpending ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excellent Perſon of that Order, only for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too good a Man for ſo bad times: Witneſs alſo the ſcorn caſt upon the whole Body of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, in impoſing a Declaration, to be read by them in all their Churches; wherein (according to the mannerly Expreſſion of that time) <hi>They ſhould</hi> (not only) <hi>have been compell'd to eat their own Dung;</hi> but in truth, to be <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> and to have cut their own Throats.</p>
            <p>To ſay no more therefore, our Condition was not unlike that of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> We were vexed, oppreſſed, undermined, weakned, treated as Slaves; and to aſſure and perpetuate our Slavery, foreign Forces were brought in, and more were intended to be brought in, to Nail our Ears to the Door-Poſts for ever.</p>
            <p>Or, if all this be not ſufficient to make us ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the Condition we were then in, or going into, let us look upon the State of <hi>France,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Poor <hi>Proteſtants</hi> there; for that was deſigned to be a Pattern and Precedent for Us.</p>
            <p>By All which together (the Particulars whereof I have rather intimated than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented) we ſee our Ill ſtate then, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95420:11"/>
that we had good cauſe to get out of <hi>Egypt</hi> as ſoon as we could, whatever befel us in the Wilderneſs. Which leads me to the Second thing I deſigned to ſpeak to, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That we will be intreated impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially to conſider, Whether our preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is not more tolerable, than that we have eſcaped? and, Whether we have any juſt Provocation from the preſent Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, to Murmur and meditate a Revolt? It is true, we are yet but in a Wilderneſs, and there in want of many things; and we are beſet with many difficulties and dangers, and perhaps too, have a long Journey (to <hi>Canaan)</hi> to a compleat Settlement; and eſpecially there is the more likelyhood of that, if we be Peeviſh, and obſtruct the Way to our own Happineſs. However, take Things as they are, and at worſt we may have many things to oblige us to be thankful for our preſent Condition, and none to make us repent of the Change.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, we have a KING and a QUEEN, both of our own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; a Felicity we have not for many years had experience of, and for want of which,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95420:12"/>
the State of Proteſtantiſm hath been flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuating and uncertain, and could never make any good progreſs: A Prince and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs we have now, whoſe Intereſt conſpires with their Education and Choice; and who abandon themſelves, if they grow cold, or indifferent in the Proteſtant Religion. Now of what Conſequence this One thing is, if we had not learnt by our former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, common Prudence would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us; ſince it cannot be expected, but that a Prince of another Religion, if he have any Zeal for it, will be ſure ſecretly to undermine that which is Rival to his own Perſuaſion, if he have not the Power or the Courage openly to aſſault and ſuppreſs it: Whereas now (by the Bleſſing of GOD) we have that comfortable Prophecy accompliſh'd of a King and Queen, <hi>Nurſing Father and Mother to this Church:</hi> We enjoy our Religion with all the Accommodations of it as fully, and as ſecurely as our Hearts can wiſh; and not only ſo, but <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> lifts up its Head; and all <hi>Prophaneſs</hi> which grew Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant heretofore, is in a great meaſure put
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95420:12"/>
out of Countenance: Nor ought it to trouble us, that ſome Men (whoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſuaſions in Religion we are not well ſatisfied with) ſhould enjoy ſome ſhare of Advantage by this Revolution, ſince it is not only what we Vowed to God, and promiſed to them in our Adverſity; but is that which cannot be denied them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with our own Safety.</p>
            <p>Then for our Laws, They have recovered their juſt Vigour and Authority, great Care being taken, to provide excellent Judges and Magiſtrates for the Execution of them; and ſo our Lives, and all our Rights and Properties are as ſecure as can be expected under any human Conſtitution: And to all this, We are under a Government ſo eaſie and gentle, that we have nothing to object, unleſs it be that it is ſo very benign, that it encourages ſome evil-Natur'd Men, to preſume and to contemn it.</p>
            <p>It is true, notwithſtanding all this, that there are at preſent great Burdens and Taxes upon us; but as they are no other than what are abſolutely neceſſary for our Preſervation, nor other than are volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95420:13"/>
aſſented to by our ſelves, being no otherwiſe impoſed than by our Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives in Parliament; ſo it is greatly to be hoped (by the Bleſſing of GOD) they will not continue long upon us. So that upon the whole, our preſent Condition is very tolerable <hi>for a Wilderneſs,</hi> and we have no cauſe to murmur, or to talk of returning back to <hi>Egypt.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly and Laſtly,</hi> Let us (before we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge our ſelves in a diſcontented, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining Humor) forecaſt with our ſelves, what are likely to be the effects and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of Murmuring, and they can be no better, nor other, than ſuch as theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Foraſmuch as this Womaniſh hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of Murmuring and Complaining is both too weak in it ſelf, and alſo comes too late to reverſe the ſtate of Affairs; it can effect nothing, but miſchief to the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers themſelves; We are (GOD be thanked) ſo far out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that ſome Mens Fancy and Humor will not be able to carry us back thither again. The King in Poſſeſſion is too ſenſible of his own
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95420:13"/>
Strength, and of the Hearts of his People, to be Murmured out of his Throne: The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Great Men are too far engaged to think of returning: The Body of the People have too quick a Senſe of the Liberty and Advantages they have under this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be induced to forego All for a Notion, or a Complement, or to ſave the Longing of ſome Sickly People.</p>
            <p>So that this way will attain, no End, mend no Matter, eaſe no Burden, diſcharge no Tax; but contrary wiſe, increaſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Burdens of the Nation. Beſides, that at this rate we are Conſtant to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; unworthy of Deliverance; ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God and Man; falſe to our ſelves, and to our real intereſt; <hi>Et quid fruſtra tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes eſſe volumus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> But ſuppoſe the contagion of this Murmuring Humor ſhould take through the Nation, (which God forbid) why then, as Relapſes are ſaid to be more fatal than the Diſeaſes themſelves; ſo would our Condition be more miſerable than ever: We ſhall then return to <hi>Egypt</hi> with a Vengeance, not only to the Onions
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95420:14"/>
and Garlick, (which perhaps we could fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) I mean, not only to the Idolatries, and ſuperſtitions, and Follies; but to the Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kilns and Iron Furnaces; nay, to the Plague of Lice and Caterpillars; to Darkneſs that may be felt; to abſolute ſlavery of Body and Mind: In a word, to all the diſmal Effects of <hi>French</hi> Inſolence, and <hi>Popiſh</hi> Revenge.</p>
            <p>Nor will it help us, or make any diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in our Caſe, to pretend, That we were the firſt that mentioned a Retreat, and that talked of going back again; that we boggled at the Deſign, and were not throughly ſatisfied with the Revolution; but why did you hearken to <hi>Moſes</hi> at all? why did you break off your Fetters? and wherefore did you once look towards <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an?</hi> Thus we ſhall periſh with ſhame and confuſion to our ſelves, without pity from Spectators, and with ſcorn from our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Nor will the Miſchiefs end there neither; but the Effects of it will reach over all the Proteſtant World, and deſtroy all the Meaſures taken for the preſervation
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95420:14"/>
of that excellent Religion: Foraſmuch as all of that denomination, not only in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and in the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> but <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, France,</hi> &amp;c. are Imbarqu'd in the ſame Bottom with us, and conſequently muſt ſink or ſwim as we do. All their Eyes are upon us; next under God, they depend upon Us, as the principal ſupport of that Profeſſion: If we fail them, they are all loſt; if we ſtand to it, they will take heart, and (by the Bleſſing of God) recover ſuch Head, as probably never to be ſuppreſt again.</p>
            <p>And now is the Opportunity of making our utmoſt Effort in Conjunction, ſince we can never (without Miracles) hope for ſuch an happy Juncture again, as now God hath preſented us with, when all the Popiſh Princes are ſo deeply ingaged in a War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>France;</hi> and ſeem well contented, that we ſhould aſſert our own Intereſts, whilſt in ſo doing we aſſiſt them in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Great <hi>Leviathan,</hi> who is otherwiſe ready to ſwallow up both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:95420:15"/>
Wherefore then, when ſuch a Prize is put into our Hands, ſhould we not have the Hearts to make uſe of it? Why ſhould we complain of Little things, and take Pet at Punctilio's; and ſoften our Spirits, and make feeble our Hands, by Murmuring and Repining; and ſo abandon both our Selves, our Brethren and Friends in ſuch an Opportunity?</p>
            <p>To all which add in the Fourth and Laſt place, Let us conſider the Example before us in the Text, and be really afraid (as there is great Reaſon for it,) leſt if we indulge this Murmuring Humor) GOD ſhould reſolve that none of us <hi>ſhall enter into his Reſt;</hi> I mean, That we ſhall never ſee thoſe happy and glorious Times of Religion, which Good Men expect in theſe latter Days, according to the Predictions of Holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>No queſtion of it, <hi>Antichriſt</hi> muſt down, and the true Spirit of the Goſpel ſhall be advanced gloriouſly before the End of the World. This ſhall as certainly come to paſs, as it was certain the Poſterity of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould poſſeſs the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:95420:15"/>
But, if we for our parts be Faint-hearted, and Peeviſh and Unbelieving, God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſhall be accompliſh'd; but we ſhall have no ſhare, nor comfort in it.</p>
            <p>To conclude therefore, Let us ſtand ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in our Minds; <hi>Rubiconem tranſiiſtis,</hi> you have left <hi>Egypt,</hi> meditate not a Revolt thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again; we are Imbarqu'd, and muſt go on or periſh. Put on the Spirits of <hi>Engliſh Men,</hi> and the Zeal of <hi>True Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants;</hi> ſtick not in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve for <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Give me leave to preſs this upon you, as the Apoſtle doth on the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> in the firſt Epiſtle, Chap. 10. he begins thus; <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I would not have you ignorant, that all our Fathers were under the Cloud, and paſſed through the Sea; and were all baptized unto</hi> Moſes <hi>in the Cloud and in the Sea, and did all eat the ſame Spiritual Meat: But with many of them GOD was not well pleaſed, for they were overthrown in the Wilderneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then Ver. 6. <hi>Now theſe things were our Examples, to the intent that we ſhould not Luſt after Evil things, as they alſo Luſted; neither be ye Idolaters, as were ſome of them; neither let</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:95420:16"/>
               <hi>us commit Fornication, as ſome of them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; neither let us tempt Chriſt, as ſome of them alſo tempted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Ver. 10. <hi>Neither let us Murmur, as ſome of them alſo Murmured, and were deſtroyed of the Deſtroyer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, Ver. 11. <hi>Now all theſe things hapned to them for Enſamples, and they are Written for our Admonition, upon whom the Ends of the World are come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>God give us all Hearts (in this our Day) to mind the Things of our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Temporal Peace.</hi> Amen.</p>
