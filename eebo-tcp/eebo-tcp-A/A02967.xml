            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ſo ſoone as the auctors of theſe newe troubles had made ſome ſhewe of the purpoſed effects of their bad mindes toward your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it pleaſed your Maieſtie in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to impart vnto mee that opinion which iuſtly your ſelfe had conceiued of their entents, which was, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding whatſoeuer their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, your ſelfe were not ignoraunt how they practiſed againſt your perſon and Crowne, alſo that they ſought to grow mightie by your decay and detriment, as men that purpoſed the totall ruine and vtter ſubuertion of your eſtate.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13924:4"/>
Theſe my Lord, were the very effect of the wordes of your Letters wherewith your Maieſtie vouchſafed to honor me, as acknowledging the vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of my hap with yours, expreſſely adding, that they endeuoured my ouerthrowe together with yours. Myne, I ſay, my Lorde, the which, depending vpon you as it doth, thei can hardly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe without yours. In reſpect hereof it pleaſed your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie alſo to commaunde your Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, general Liutenants, Baylifes, Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, and all other your Officers to withſtande them as Rebelles and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbers of the Common quiet. Your Maieſties declarations alſo were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon ſent vnto all your Courts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and in the ſame ratefied, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were pronounced Traytors, whereof haue enſued ſundrie ſolemne decrees, and vpon the ſayd decrees di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers executions of great importaunce in many partes of this Realme, which remaine as preſidents as well of their rebellion and conſpiracie againſt your eſtate, as alſo of that iudgement which

            <p>All this notwithſtanding, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed your Maieſtie according to your naturall clemencie, to thinke good by gentle meanes to reduce them to their dueties, and therevpon vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing to honor me with your Letters, you therein commaunded me with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience to ſuffer all, whereby your ſelfe might haue the better leyſure to enter into conſideration of them and their purpoſes, to the ende to giue to your Subiects to vnderſtande how farre the very cauſes of their deuiſes did differ from their publiſhed pretences: allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that although your ſelfe were not ignoraunt thereof, yet that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to open the ſame to your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whom vnder the fayned ſhewe of Religion, they ſought to withdraw fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their dueties.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13924:5"/>
according to your wiſedome and equitie you are not ignoraunt by how iuſt occaſions I haue alwaies bene prouoked and my pacience mooued, eſpecially ſeeing my ſelfe chalenged as partie by your Maieſties enemies, who openly haue declared that they ſought only my ouerthrowe, ſo that although I plainly found my ſelf to be the ſcope of their attempts and enterpriſes, yet in reſpect of that reuerence which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore I haue endeuoured to ſhewe to your commaundements I durſt not once ſtirre againſt them, no notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding I dayly beheld them marching before my face, yea almoſt within my reach, in Armes againſt your Maieſtie, in ſtomacke againſt my ſelfe, euermore atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pting againſt either ſome Townes within my gouernment, either ſome of my houſes, or els againſt my owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and yet occaſion ſo fitly ſeruing I might neither doe your Maieſtie any ſeruice requiſite, or my ſelfe bee reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged according as reaſon &amp; nature did require. Your onely will my Lord, haue
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13924:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I accepted for reaſon, and your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement for lawe: My nature and duetie haue I ſtrained and forced, yea almoſt my reputation and credite vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your precepts, and that the rather my Lord in reſpect that your Maieſtie ſtill honoring mee with your Letters, did in the ſame promiſe to be as mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of my intereſt as of your owne: as alſo that you would not graunt or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcend vnto any thing that might bee preiudiciall to your Edict of peace, which you purpoſed to be irreuocable, yea and that in and according to the ſame you would protect and defend all your Subiects indifferently: all which promiſes your Maieſty haue from time to time reiterated in all your Letters, which beeing of your owne handwri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting I do reſerue, as alſo you haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the ſame to the Lords of <hi>Cleruant</hi> and <hi>Chaſſincourt,</hi> with other my agents reſiant about your perſon, as alſo haue the Queene your Mother as well by word of mouth as by Letters.</p>
            <p>When therefore my Lord I heard it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:13924:6"/>
reported that your Maieſtie had on the ſuddeine concluded peace with thoſe that haue rebelled againſt your ſeruice, vpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition: that your edict be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: your loyall ſubiectes baniſhed: the conſpirators armed: yea armed with your forces and authoritie againſt your moſt obedient and faithfull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes: euen againſt my ſelfe, who haue that honour to bee of your Maieſties blood, and allyed vnto you, who euer ſince I ſuppoſed my ſelfe to haue any place in your good fauour and liking, could neuer bee found to haue depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therefro, except by too much pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, ſufferance, and duetifull obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this I ſay came to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I leaue it to your Maieſties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration to thinke in what perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie I might remayne, either wherein I might repoſe any further hope, except in diſpayre.</p>
            <p>In that declaration which on my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe was exhibited vnto your Maieſty, I haue motioned the moſt equall and reaſonable conditions that might bee

To be briefe, I haue
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13924:7"/>
beyond all ſhew of reaſon, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all naturall ſence, yeelding to whatſoeuer your Maieſties commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts proceeded farther then duetie could binde, and, notwithſtanding the inequalitie of our degrees and callings, haue ſtooped and become equall with my inferiors, to the end with my blood to redeeme ſo many miſchifes.

            <p>If therefore my miſhappe bee ſuch (which I wil not yet beleeue) that your Maieſtie haue proceeded ſo farre, as notwithſtanding all theſe my concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſubmiſsions, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude ſuch a treatie, and thereby to infringe your Edictes, and to arme your Rebelles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your eſtate, againſt your blood, yea and againſt your parſon, I can not but hartely lament and bewaile your Maieſties condition, eſpecially ſeeing your highneſſe through contempt of my faithful ſeruice, forced to vtter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of your eſtate, togither with

the conſideration of the calamities of your realme, the end whereof we are in vaine to looke or hope for, except in the totall ruyne of the ſame: For that all the world doth knowe by twentie yeres proofe and more, that their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is a vaine attempt, and their buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a manifeſt ſubuerſion.</p>
            <p>In the meane tyme I will comfort my ſelfe in my innocencie, integritie and affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to your Maieſtie and your eſtate: alſo in that it hath not beene long of me, that with my owne perill I haue not preuented this ſhipwarcke: but aboue all, I will ground my conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation vpon the Lord God, the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of my ſinceritie and loyaltie, who in this neceſsitie will not forſake mee, but rather will encreaſe my courage &amp; multiply my meanes againſt all my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, who are yours.</p>
            <p>And my Lord, I beſeech hym to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire you with good counſayle, and in all your affayres to aſsiſt you with his ſtrength. Alſo that he wil vouchſafe me his grace during lyfe, to yeeld vnto you
