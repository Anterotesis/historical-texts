            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Man would wonder (O yee Londoners) to ſee how amidſt your greateſt dangers you are leaſt circumſpect and active in prevention thereof: you thinke you haue done well enough, and plaid the parts of good Common-wealths men, if you can hinder the Kings Forces from doing execution upon you; and never think upon them with any reſpect to your ſelves, till they advance within few miles of your walls, that in the meane time while they are abſent from you, they are plotting and contriving all wayes that poſſible can be to endamage you, and worke you into ſuch a condition, that when they come next at you, they may the eaſier make themſelves Maſters of your Citie. When they have gained to their Party all the Weſterne and Northerne Counties, and diſarmed or cut off all thoſe your friends that ſtand out againſt them (as you perceive they reſolve to doe, and are like enough to effect unleſſe you interpoſe) they will by that meanes not onely ſubdue halfe part of <hi>England,</hi> but thereby likewiſe halfe conquer <hi>London</hi> it ſelfe: for as the Countries are not like to hold out, if the Kings Forces poſſeſſe themſelves of <hi>London;</hi> ſo neither can <hi>London</hi> hold out if proviſions be cut off from comming thither. To me you ſeeme to beare your ſelves as if you had no warre in your Land, or as if you thought the <hi>Cavahers</hi> and deſperate Royſters intended no evill towards you, or that the Deſigne of making you ſlaves were therefore laid downe, becauſe 'tis found ſo eaſie a matter to compaſſe, and you are ſo eaſie to admit it. What doe you think of the condition you now are in? Or, doe you not thinke of it at all? Verily, a man might ſweare you did not, you are ſo ſecure and quiet; ſo buſie about your trading, You ſee it is otherwiſe with the King and his Friends, you ſee how active they are, that they ſet themſelves wholly to this worke, you ſee that every weeke produces ſome notable exploit they have enterpriz'd to their reall advantage, beſides what private ſuccours and ſupplies each houre affords, inſomuch that they have made themſelves in a ſhort time, by their Policie and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious induſtry of a weake and contemptible Party, a ſtrong power and overawing army of Traitors: when in the meane time you by your ſlackneſſe and drowzy managing of your Affaires are much waſted, have loſt much of your ſtrength, and are like to loſe more, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you looke better about you then you have done heretofore: Your eyes are altogether upon the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and you doe well; but can the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſight for you? They are your Counſell and directors; but 'tis you the People that are the ſtrength and power of the Kingdome: neither is it to be hoped that the Kings Forces ſhall ever be vanquiſhed by Words and Writings; it muſt be your Swords and valiant proweſſe that muſt ſubdue them. Why, what would you have us doe you will ſay? Or, what can you doe more then you have done? You have contributed freely out of your Eſtates; and you have likewiſe ſent away your ſervants to the Wartes; I applaud you for it: but let me withall tell you, that if you doe no more as the caſe ſtands, you have done as much as nothing, for all this will not availe you; for you ſee that the nature of the Country is ſuch that the King can avoid your Souldiers, and chooſe whether ever he will ſight, but when he is ſure to conquer, where his Enemies are weake and unprovided, or that our ſouldiers come on upon many diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; ſo that unleſſe your courage and reſolution be the greater, and yee ſet your ſelves more cloſely to your buſineſſe, yee ſhall be ſure to have this Warre laſt long enongh, ſince his intereſt depends upon the prolongation thereof, whereby he finds his Party to be increaſed, and you impoveriſhed and thereby unable to ſſue out ſupplies to oppoſe your enemies: and ſo wearied with the Charge, many of you will be willing to make peace; which (the King being ſtrong) muſt be expected to be upon ſuch conditions as ſhall leave the way eaſie to make you perfect Slaves, and himſelfe abſolute. Well, you will ſay, what then muſt be done? Verily, I think 'tis to no purpoſe to tell you; for you are ſo heavy a People, that you make nothing of good Counſell; you are onely well-aflected; but you want abilities to deale with your cunning Adverſaries, and all becauſe you cannot find in your hearts to ſet about it: there is little difference in men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides cuſtome and exerciſe in buſineſſes, which principally makes one excell another: you doe not ſet your ſelves to contrive waies to circumvent them in their Policies, and to meet them halfe way; you are behind hand ſtill, as your Army is with the Kings: You ſpend your time about telling and asking of newes; and O how you are taken with ſome forged Report of Sir <hi>Ralph Hoptons</hi> overthrow, or the Lord of <hi>Newcastles</hi> being driven into <hi>York?</hi> of ſo much money taken in one place, ſo much Armcur, and ſo many Horſes in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? and your Enemies, ſince they find ſo ſmall matters will content you, buſie your heads, and keepe you from riſing as one man, they will be ſure to furniſh you. You are meere News-mongers, and when you have any, Oh how you flutter about to tell it, becauſe you would be thought to know ſomewhat, as if the Warres were in <hi>Sweth-land</hi> or the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and not in your owne Countrey, and ready to deſtroy you, as it hath done many of your friends already. And when you have a little victory, how you amplifie it! Then your Bells muſt ting, and Boneſires be made, when perhaps the loſſe was equall, and the Victory doubtfull, and you are little neerer a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of your Warres then you were before: you are moſt unmanly in your behaviours; when if the King overthrowes you or your Friends, as at <hi>Ciſſeter,</hi> the buſineſſe is concealed; your Friends conceale it, becauſe by declaring it they thinke you would be dejected, and your Enemies conceale it, leſt by hearing thereof you be juſtly enraged and provoked to revenge: they are glad to keep your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger downe, and Iull your courages aſleep, leaſt by awakening thereof it devoure them: you are ſo farre from caſting about to ſuccour and relieve your Friends abroad; that you neglect your ſelves, and are not yet Maſters of your owne Citie, that place deſign'd for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence to the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> hard ſervices and dangerous hazards they now run; the hopes of pillaging thereof makes their labours and wounds pleaſant to them, and ſweetens all difficulties and dangers they now undergoe in the Kings Service. Doe you looke for advice? it will be good that you make it appeare that you haue firſt ſhook off that Lethargie that ha's poſſeſt you, for till then you are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of advice: if I thought you were a wake I would adviſe you to doe what? to ſtop your eares againſt the Syren inchantments of ſuch as you may be ſure (by your former ſufferings, and ſorcing you to theſe preſent ſhifts and 02 extremities) wiſh you not well; and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen your eares to ſuch your Brethren who hazard themſelves and their Fortunes in your behalfe, who have liv'd amongſt you, and of whoſe faith and ſound affection you have had ſo much experience: follow their advice, I am a ſtranger to you, and thinke not much if they ſhall put you upon what for the preſent ſhall be irkſome to you, your ſickneſſe is ſo deſperate that 'twill be well if rough and chargeable meanes can cure you. Onely let me tell you thus much, that 'tis not your faſting and repenting that God requires at your hands, ſo much as doing juſtice upon the wicked brood in the Land, whoſe proſeſſion in former times hath beene to oppreſſe you, and is now to deſtroy you. God is not wanting to you; neither can you make him more willing to aſſiſt you, then he hath already beene; he hath given you underſtanding to diſcerne your Afflictions and Afflictors, and power likewiſe to free your ſelves from both: but 'tis you that are wanting to your ſelves, you want courage and endeavours; you have ſtrength to help your ſelves given you by God, and yet you lie ſtill and cry God help us. Well according as I heare you beare your ſelves hereaſter, and either amend, continue in the ſame ſleepy ſtate, or grow worſe; you ſhall receive further from me: For this time farewell.</p>
