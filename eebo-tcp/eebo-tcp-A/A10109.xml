            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>But leaue wee theſe ſpéeches till ſome better conuenient time, and goe wée to the Emperour, who will be moſt ioyfull hearing theſe news. So mounting on horſe backe with the Ambaſſadors, they rode to the Pallace, where gratious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement was commanded them by the Emperour. And in this time <hi>Pinedo</hi> made knowen to the Prince <hi>Arnedes,</hi> how he paſt into <hi>Fraunce</hi> to finde <hi>Recinde,</hi> whome now hee came to acquaint with the death of his Brother, and how all the Barrons and people of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> would willingly accept him for their Lord and King.</p>
               <p>Of theſe tidinges was the <hi>Frenchman</hi> not a little glad, that his Coſin <hi>Recinde</hi> (whome hee loued as himſelfe) was heire to the Scepter of <hi>Caſtile:</hi> But yet was hee as ſorie on the other ſide, becauſe he could heare no report of him, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perſwading <hi>Pinedo,</hi> that hee hoped of his ſhort returne, in that the Tourney at his mariage would be a meane there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which was publiſhed through all the parts of the Empire, he thought it néedleſſe anie further to purſue his ſearch.</p>

Tell me I pray you, wherefore did yée ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale your ſelfe, knowing how happie I would haue thought my ſelfe, to haue vnderſtood of you with out thee ſayning:</p>
               <p>My Gratious Lord replyed <hi>Arnedes,</hi> moſt humblie I in treate yee, vſe no ſuch wordes on my behalfe, becauſe I know my ſelfe vnworthie of them, much leſſe of the honour I haue receiued in your Countrie, which a better man than I can no way deſerue. But neuer could any quiet enter my thoughts, till I beheld the Maginficence of your Court, and that to my poore power I might do you ſeruice: poore and ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in truth is it in reſpect of my good will, which is equall with the moſt affectionate ſeruant you haue, among whom I deſire your Grace to repute mee, as the man whome no one ſhall out-goe in zeale and deuotion of minde. And a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenaunce of heauen haue I accounted it, that no occaſion hitherto woulde happen, whereby I might liuelie expreſſe the true affection imprinted in my heart.</p>
               <p>It ſuffiſeth (anſwered the Emperour) what alreadie you haue done, proofe enough to giue you the reputation of one of the beſt Knightes in the worlde. And as for me, if I be not depriued of the fauour (conſidering the loue I beare yee) I ſhal euermore continue my former opinion, and repute my ſelfe happie in making alliance with you, when you ſhall thinke expedient to yeeld thereto.</p>

                  <hi>Arnedes,</hi> who ſaw the paſſage open, whereby his ſoule might ſooneſt be conducted to reſt, and by him likewiſe that had the onely key thereof: was marueilouſly ouercome with thy, when taking the Emperour by the hand, to kiſſe it in ſigne of thankes, he ſaid.

and day by day to confirme the indiſſoluble bend, wherein I am euerlaſtingly wrapped by this extraordinarie fauour. Notwithſtanding, if my vnſayned affection, to remaine your obedient ſeruant, or dutifull Sonne if you pleaſe, may ſtand for an earneſt pennie: Then intreat I you to accept thereof as I preſent it, to the end I may hereafter be ſo readie in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunce, as now I am in heart.

               <p>The Emperour beeing maruellous glad to heare him vſe ſuch honeſt ſpeeches, gathered very well with what ſhaft hee was wounded, &amp; that the matter now opened by conference, was but only to ſeeke a ſpeedie balme or medecine for the hurt receiued.

intreated one requeſt: The Emperour very willingly made him graunt thereof, as the like, hee did to diuers others, who this day demaunded his gratious fauour, ſeeing him ſo boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull in honour of this feaſt.</p>
               <p>My Lord (ſaide <hi>Primaleon)</hi> the requeſt which at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant I deſire your Grace not to denie mée, is, that I may be armed Knight by your hande in this armour, on the day of the feaſte for the nuptialls of <hi>Philocriſta</hi> my ſiſter, for to make the ſame the more magnificent, I hope to prouide a Tourney worthy the view of your Maieſtie, wherto I beſéech you graunt me licence of ſafe conduct for all Knights whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, becauſe I intend to haue it publiſhed in diuers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               <p>This had I graunted (quoth the Emperour) with all my hart, albeit thou hadſt not bound mee thereto by promiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are the thinges that highly pleaſe me, and very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable is it to ſée ſuch ſolempnities at mariages, eſpecially of ſuch a Princeſſe as thy Siſter is.

The like requeſt made <hi>Arnaſin</hi> ſonne to Duke <hi>Ptolome,</hi> who was equall with them in youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of yeares, wherwith <hi>Primaleon</hi> was not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
               <p>Immediatly were Heralds of armes diſpatched into diuers Regions, to publiſhe the Tourney, and the day purpoſed for the beginning of the ſportes, which ſhoulde continue during the feaſt, with Court royall openly kept, at the mariage of the Princeſſe <hi>Philocriſta:</hi> aſſuring all knights that pleaſed to ſhew themſelues there, to bee entertained with honour euerie way equall to deſert.

the firſt woord: in which mute paſſions, they rather reſembled the two beautifull ſtarres <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> than humaine creatures poſſeſſed of life and moouing, whereuppon <hi>Melicia</hi> ſmiling, thus ſpake to them.</p>
               <p>Ah that mine eyes were ſo happie, that they coulde now behold him, for whom my heart indures moſt paſſionate mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirdome, I would not ſhow ſuch puſillanimitie as you doe, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming as though you ſcantly knewe each other: why then doo you not giue ſome recreation to your affectionate ſoules, but ſtand thus as dead bodies depriued of life? Madame, (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Prince) meruaile not to ſee mee ſilent and diſpoſſeſſed of ſpeech, in that loue by nature ſealed vp my lippes, for ſeeing vs in greater content with the thing more conformable to our deſires, hee tooke the benefit of ſpeaking from vs, leaſt the one ſhould not pleaſe our eares ſo well as the other doth our harts. Moreouer, I haue till this houre ſo extreamely deſired that, which now I am perſwaded is altogether mine, as I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer enioy any quiet in minde, (ſo yrkſome is the thought of time to me) till I may ſee the Crowne of <hi>Fraunce</hi> on the head of faire <hi>Philocriſta.</hi> As for you Madam, be you certaine, if my Coſin <hi>Recinde</hi> as yet liueth, one day to rule the Realme of <hi>Caſtile:</hi> for ſo perfectly doth he loue you, as his returne hether will not be long to conclude this affaire, which for my part, I would be glad to haſten, in regarde of the deſire I haue to ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you both to my power.</p>
               <p>At theſe words <hi>Melicia</hi> began ſomwhat modeſtly to bluſh, neuertheleſſe being prudent and well aduiſed, ſhee cunningly diſſembled this youthful feminine ſhame, ſaying. My Lord, the Prince <hi>Recinde</hi> is of ſuch a vertuous and gentle nature, and ſo well his valour and proweſſe knowen where he trauaileth, as each one ought to reioyce at his good fortune: eſpecially my ſelfe, beyond all other that loue and honor him, if it be ſo, that hee beares me ſuch good will as you ſpeake of.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſpeeches of <hi>Melicia</hi> ſo imboldned <hi>Arnedes,</hi> that now he beganne ſomewhat to cheare vp himſelfe, and entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to further conference with his Lady, taking of her the firſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3083:10"/>
of their loue, which were many daintie kiſſes, ſoft touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſuch like, yet ſo honeſt and comely diſcharged, as it was no ſcandall or offence to the beholders, but rather moued them to wiſh, that they would longer continue this agreeable and pleaſing behauiour.</p>
               <p>Now the Emperour amongſt thoſe that were of greateſt regarde there preſent, highly eſteemed and honored his ſonne <hi>Palmendos,</hi> in that the cheefeſt ioy and pleaſure of this feaſte proceeded from him: heeruppon he remembred the ſealed booke which he ſent him, with ſo many other precious thinges from the Iſle of <hi>Delphos,</hi> as in the tenth Chapter of <hi>Palmendos</hi> hath beene declared.</p>
               <p>To make knowen therfore to the french Lords the magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie and vertues of his ſonne <hi>Palmendos,</hi> hee commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the rich &amp; exquiſite chaire (wherin the Idol ſat) to be bright before him, and the booke likewiſe, which hee had cauſed to be kept in his treaſurie, amongſt matters of greateſt account.</p>
               <p>To open the booke hee made proofe againe by many of his Knights, but there was none could come néere it, which hee perceiuing, deliuered it to <hi>Palmendos</hi> ſaying. My ſonne, make ſome little proofe of this booke, for if you bring not this labour to end, I am aſſured wee may ſet our hearts at quiet, for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or beholding any thing theerin contained. <hi>Palmendos</hi> turning aſide his head, and making a lowly reuerence to the Emperour, tooke the booke from foorth the hands of a Knight that endeuored to open it, and with ſuch eaſe did he open it, as if the ſame had neuer been cloſed before: heerat the Emperour was exceeding ioyfull, and turning towardes the Noblemen of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> he could not containe, but néedes muſt expreſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them a moſt euident ſigne of fatherly affection to <hi>Palmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos.</hi> Then taking the booke, he turned ouer the leaues from one end to an other, finding no matter or diſcourſe written therin: only he beheld the figures of two Emperours painted in the midſt therof, the one attyred after the greekiſh manner, holding a ſheeld vppon his arme, wherein was the blazon and diſcription of the armes of the Empyre: the other was armed

               <p>If the Emperour were highly pleaſed with <hi>Palmendos</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the booke no doubte, but hee greatlye marueiled what ſiniſter preſage theſe figures deliuered by their ſhew &amp; faſhion, wherefore he ſaid aloud, that theſe did ſignifie migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty matters: hereupon all the Lordes and Knights approched nere him to ſee the figures, and paſſing the booke from hande to hand, they all could coniecture nothing but matter of aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. But as each one deliuered his opinion, according to ſuch reaſon as beſt ſéemed vnto them: there entred the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace a young Gentleman in verie rich habilliments, carrying it Sheeld, and one of the verie beſt Swords for Armes, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Vulcan</hi> God of the Forgers could deuiſe to make by his diuine Arte: and being come before the Emperour, he ſet his knee to the ground, ſpeaking in this manner.</p>
               <p>Sir, the Knight of the encloſed Ile, ſent me directly to this Court, to kiſſe your hand on his behalfe, béeing the man who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he loueth, honoureth and eſtéemeth, more than any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon this day liuing vnder the celeſtiall Spheres: Albeit as yet hee neuer ſaw yee, neyther knowes yée, but onelye by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme of your manhood and generoſitie, which hath ſo farre commended yée, and gotten ſuch conqueſt ouer him, as hee cannot by his Magicke Arts, Necromancie, Cabaliſt and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Philoſophie, (wherein he may well bee named the ſecond <hi>Zoroasbres,)</hi> foreſée any thing, that may turne to your griefe or diſcontent of mind: but he imagineth himſelfe bound to let yee know thereof. Wherefore, that yée may wade no further in the depth of doubtfull opinions, which the two figures in this enchaunted booke may cumber your thoughts withall: he tells yée by me, that as yée behold here theſe Images, euen ſo (one day) ſhall the Empire of Gréece, and the glorie of her good Knightes, be abated and deſtroyed by the enemies of our fayth. So that for the ſinnes and iniquities of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3083:11"/>
God will ſuffer betwéene the Gréekes and Turkes mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall diuorce a hatred, which ſhall end by a moſt bloodie diſcomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereto you and your Son <hi>Palmendos</hi> haue alreadie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen beginning. Neuertheleſſe, this raine and decadence ſhall not happen in your time, neyther of him or your poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, becauſe all their liues (euen to the laſt day) ſhall bee moſt glorious and triumphall, not any of your enemies erecting one Trophe ouer them: therefore receiue no griefe at this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall iudgment, conſidering we can no way eſcape the ineui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table deſtenie, whereto God hath appoynted vs.</p>
               <p>I ſée well then (replyed the Emperour in great heauſnes) that man ſhall not haue anie one intire pleaſure in this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life.</p>
               <p>Ah ſoueraigne directer of all thinges, moſt deuoutly I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat thee, that thou wilt for euer imprint within my ſoule, the true caracters of thy holy catholike faith, to the end I may both liue &amp; die thereafter, without any other deſire, than to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh thy moſt bleſſed will. And albeit that <hi>Greece</hi> (in my time) ſhall not receiue this wound, yet muſt it néeds mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilouſly offend and diſpleaſe me, that ſo good people (by a falſe and miſcreant Dog) ſhould be ſo outraged.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, ſéeing I can no other way redéeme it, I ſweare and proteſt before yée all, hereafter to be a cruell and capital enemie to theſe harbarous and vnbeléeuing helhounds, making them dearely to buy before hand, the infelicity deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to this moane-worthie countrie. And euen ſo it came to paſſe, in that both he, and <hi>Palmendos</hi> in his Kingdome of <hi>Theſſalie,</hi> did great and infinite dammages to the Turkes, for euer after there was continually open warres betweene thoſe Nations,</p>
               <p>But the Emperour then ſomewhat mittygating hys choller, with a more pleaſing countenance and milder tearms, thus ſpake to them about him.</p>
               <p>Wherefore ſhould I offend my ſelfe wyth ſuch things as we ſhall neuer behold? I pray yée (for all this) let vs not leaue the fruition of ſuch pleaſures, as God hath ſent vs at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3083:12"/>
for ſéeing it is hys will, that happy ſucceſſe ſhall betyde the affayres of my time, and they that follow of my poſterity likewiſe: I haue no reaſon to paſſionate my ſelfe, but rather to repute me the moſt happy Prince, that thys day inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth betweene the two Poles.</p>
               <p>Therfore I pray you (quoth hée to the Meſſenger) on my behalfe, thank the Lord of the encloſed Iſle your Maiſter, for putting mée out of thoſe doubtfull imaginations, ſtriuing to vnderſtand what theſe two figures ſhoulde ſignifie: aſſuring him withall, that he hath no friend in this world, who can make more account of his goodwill than I doo, nor ſhall hee finde any iot leſſe in me towards him, when pleaſeth him to make any triall therof: ſo breaking off, the Gentleman went a little lower toward <hi>Primaleon,</hi> who likewiſe was there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, &amp; thus ſpake to him: Happy &amp; fortunate Prince, the Lord of the encloſed Iſle my maſter, who louer you as himſelf, hath ſent yée this good ſword and rich ſhield, the two beſt and moſt exquiſite weapons, that at this day are to be found in all the world, and them hee thinks méete for ſo valiaunt a Knight as you will prooue, aduertiſing you, that the clouen rock, being thus ſeparated, as you may beholde héere figured in this ſhield: ſignifieth the partialitie and little looue betwene you and her, who in after time ſhall make one ſole heart of twaine: ſo that on the day of this riciprocation hapning betwéene you, this impregnable rock ſhall then remaine intyre &amp; cloſed againe, and without any impeach, to teſtifie your reconciliation.</p>
               <p>Tell your Maſter from me (anſwered <hi>Primaleon,</hi> as one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed to heare ſuch ſpéeches,) that as it hath pleaſed him to ſend me this fayre preſent, which I ſhal wel &amp; carefully hope for his ſake: ſo wold I haue him comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d me any thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I may do him pleaſure, when he ſhall aduertiſe me, as the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that may command my vttermoſt, &amp; whom I highly thank for his curteſis, albeit I cannot but remaine in penſiuenes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> I vnderſtand more clearly the matters you haue told mée.</p>
               <p>The time will come (replyed the yong Gentleman,) when you ſhall knowe them ſufficiently, although at this inſtant

they ſéeme ſo hard and obſcure to yée: and then ſhall ye recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the ſeruice, which now yée receiue from my Maiſter.</p>
               <p>Then commaunded <hi>Primaleon,</hi> that one ſhould fetch a rich preſent for the Lord of the encloſed Iſle, in requitall of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Armes he ſent him, and another in like manner for the Gentleman that brought them: which immediatly was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed in euery reſpect, when the youth (with great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence taking his leaue) returned preſently towarde the Iſle, leauing all the Court meruayling at the newes before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed.</p>
               <p>The Emperour and his Barrons long looked on the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, each one commending the artificiall workemanſhip of them, &amp; meruayling what the ſtrange ſeperation of the rocke ſhould meane, being thus foretold, that one day it ſhould ioyn together againe, which made the Emperour deliuer theſe wordes before all there preſent. I am perſwaded wee ſhall behold great matters of importance, when this halfe deuided Rock ſhall knit together againe: So that as ſéemes to mee my Sonne (ſpeaking to <hi>Primaleon)</hi> for thée are reſerued ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aduentures, which none but thou canſt effectually finiſhe: Wherein I pray God to bee thy directer, enduing thée with ſuch ſtrength and hardines, as thou mayeſt honorably make an end of them.</p>
               <p>So doe I deuoutlie pray my ſelfe (anſwered <hi>Primaleon)</hi> els ſhall I repute all my life verie careleſlie beſtowed, and I vnworthie to come in companie of ſo great perſonages, if I ſhuld not reſemble (in ſome good part or other) the noble Lord that begot me: and that I may attaine thereto, it is neceſſarie I ſhould paſſe through many perillous tranayles, knowing that without excéeding endeuour, it is impoſſible to reach ſuch honour, as doth for euer make men to be eſtéemed. For this may ſerue me as a moſt worthie crample, yea and an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mirrour of all vertues, proceeding from your excellencie ſo great a preſident, as not onely hath ſweetly conquered the loue of your ſubiects, but gayning likewiſe a priueledge of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie ones good will, hath beſide conſtrayned the enemie and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3083:13"/>
moſt barbarous Nations, to admire and honour yée for al per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, being the cheefeſt peece of workemanſhippe that euer Nature made.</p>
               <p>Theſe gentle and gratious ſpeeches of the Prince <hi>Primale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> made the Emperour his Father ſo pleaſed as poſſiblie might be, hearing from him ſuch honeſt commendations, yet collourably ayming at a third perſon, as thence forth he repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him verſe magnanimous, and remembring <hi>Achilles, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, Themiſtocles,</hi> and other ſuch valiant Champions, which <hi>Greece</hi> in former time had brought forth, he began to conceiue ſome hope, that one day he ſhould ſee him go beyond all other of his time. Whereupon hee gaue commandement, that the weapons ſent from the Lorde of the encloſed Iſle, ſhould be verie charilie layde vp, and for this cauſe, if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde in any place <hi>Primaleon</hi> would not be knowen, he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himſelfe the knight of the clouen rocke. From that time all the whole day, there paſſed no other ſpeeches among them, but of the meruaylous knowledge of this great Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, the Emperour entring into ſo good opinion of him, as he could neuer forget that the Empire of <hi>Greece</hi> ſhould be ſackt by the Turkes, which was a continuall griefe to his heart: yet would hee not outwardly deliuer any ſhow thereof, but with Princely ieſtures ſhadowing them ſtill, ſeemed as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant as euer be was before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primaleon</hi> likewiſe on the other ſide was very penſiue, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring alſo to know her name, who already by the very words of the yong Gentleman, had inflamed his thoughts with the heauenlie fire of <hi>Venus:</hi> for till this houre hee had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of amourous paſſions, but now his heart was ſo liuely touched therewith, as there they had taken a perpetual dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, as yee ſhall perceiue by the following diſcourſe of the Hiſtorie.</p>
               <p>But now he fell to make prouiſion with the other knights, giuing order that all thinges might bee readie againſt the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph day, which was appointed for the Nuptialles of his Siſter. And for the more magnificent gracing thereof, the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3083:13"/>
Emperour grently deſired, to ſee the king his Father and the Queene his Mother there preſent, which made him ſend a peſt in this behalfe to requeſt them. The like did hee to the king of <hi>Sparta</hi> and <hi>Ariſmena</hi> his Aunt, whome hee had not ſeene ſince their eſpouſalls: hee ſent for King <hi>Friſoll</hi> alſo, with the reſidue of his chiefeſt friendes, that they would honour him with their preſence at his Daughters wedding, becauſe ſoone after ſhe was to depart for <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Horſeman which the Emperour ſent for <hi>Macedon,</hi> found king <hi>Florendos</hi> in exceeding pleaſure, in that hee had married <hi>Belcar</hi> with <hi>Alderina,</hi> Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and as yet the feaſt endured, where <hi>Recinde</hi> was enforced to abide, at the earneſt intreatie of <hi>Belcar,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed afterward to accompanie him to <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> So that when the Poſte arriued there, they were prouiding to ſet forward on the way.</p>
               <p>Now were the king and Quéene not a little ioyfull, when they vnderſtood that <hi>Palmendos</hi> was their Nephew, &amp; <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locriſta</hi> ſhould marrie with ſo great a Prince, as was the ſon to the king of <hi>Fraunce:</hi> Hereupon they concluded, not to fruſtrate the Emperours deſire, which hee had to ſee them at this ſolemnitie. Then the meſſenger recounted to them, how <hi>Arnedes</hi> had remayned vnknowen in the Court, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny intent to make him ſelfe knowen, untill the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Fraunce</hi> arriued there. With whome (quoth hee) there came a knight of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that enquired after <hi>Recinde</hi> Son to the <hi>Caſtile</hi> king: becauſe his eldeſt brother being deceaſſed, the Subiectes of the Realme deſire him for their king.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Recinde</hi> hearing theſe newes, beeing vnable longer to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, deliuered forth meruaylous ſorrowe for the death of his Brother, ſaying that hee more deſired his life, than all the Kingdomes in the world.</p>
               <p>Sundrie other mournefull ſpéeches hee procéeded in, when the king and <hi>Balcar</hi> (wundring that two ſuch knights had ſo long concealed themſelues) reioyſed not a little, thinking themſelues happie, that they had done ſuch honors to <hi>Recin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de:</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:3083:14"/>
with whome they vſed many reaſons and ſweet perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to comfort and put him from his ſorrowfull dumpes.</p>
               <p>The meſſenger being likewiſe glad, becauſe hee had found the end of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Knights perigrination, thus ſpake.</p>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Recinde,</hi> ceaſe theſe teares, which ſerue to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for recouering the thing that is out of all hope of men, but rather to hinder the <hi>Caſtillians,</hi> who deſire ſhortly to ſee yee as their Lorde and King Soueraigne: For which (me thinkes) ye haue greater occaſion to thanke God, than thus to torment your ſelfe againſt all reaſon, conſidering that the Scepter of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> is one of the moſt rich and honourable in all <hi>Europe.</hi> And if yee meane ſhortly to ſee the Prince <hi>Arne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who is not a little penſiue for your cauſe of heauines: yee will procure great ioy both in him and the whole Court of the Emperour, becauſe each one doth wiſh your preſence there, eſpecially vpon ſo good occaſion as is now offered.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Recinde</hi> heard the Gentleman vſe ſuch ſpéeches, he began to remember himſelfe, that nowe hee was to deliuer ſome Heroicall ſpectacle, for better attayning his Lady <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia,</hi> whome, by the ſad and certaine newes of his Brothers death, he thought the ſooner to recouer as his owne. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he determined to make one in this Tourney, and as hee reſolued on this honourable purpoſe, many ſecret diſcourſes combatted with his ſpirite, which he generally imparting to <hi>Belcar,</hi> receiued this anſwere from him.</p>
               <p>My Lord and Brother, although I durſt not enterpriſe to goe ſo ſoone to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> yet would I gladly beare you companie, as well to grateſte yée herein, as any thing els I am able to deuiſe, becauſe you are the man, to whom I would haue my neareſt thoughtes knowen throughout my whole life, with this aſſurance beſide, that yée ſhall not find any man leſſe ſparing of him ſelfe, in ſuch matters as may be déemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to yée.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seigneur Belcar,</hi> anſwered <hi>Recinde,</hi> I may well ſay, that if Fortune heretofore hath ſlenderly fauored mee, entertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

me often with verie rigorous tearmes, yet might it bée interpreted but as a preſage of vnſpeakeable content in <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> proſperitie: for the ioy I take in being of ſo good account with you, ſurmounteth all the miſhaps that haue befallen mee.</p>
               <p>So knitting vp theſe courteous entercourſes, they purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take order for their voyage, each one according to his owne beſt contriuing, deſiring the King not to make ouer much haſte, becauſe they minded to trauaile together: For <hi>Belcar, Recinde</hi> and <hi>Tirendos</hi> required to go thither before, meaning to perfourme ſome matter at honour and worthie commendation, in the ſight of the Emperour, who had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſeene anye deedes of <hi>Belcar</hi> and <hi>Tirendos,</hi> whereto King <hi>Florendos</hi> agréed verie willingly, who notwithſtanding hee was aboue thréeſcore yéeres old, yet was hee neuertheleſſe of ſtrong nature, able to endure the paine of trauaile.</p>
               <p>Nowe when hee had appointed euerie thing in equipage, with a goodly companie, he ſet on towarde <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whither the Duke of <hi>Pontus</hi> could not come ſo ſoone as hee, for certaine buſineſſe of importaunce that had befallen him, to the great griefe of the Princeſſe <hi>Alderina,</hi> that ſhee ſhould ſo long be abſent from her deare ſpouſe <hi>Belcar.</hi> So leaue we them voyaging as time fauoured, to ſpeake of ſuch things as happened in the Emperours Court in meane while.</p>

Notwithſtanding, during his cure, the Abbeſſe who was Daughter of a great Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, faire, young, and comely, knowing that hee did not boudge from the Emperours Court, cam often times to viſite him; inſomuch, that this continuall viſitation ingendred ſome ſparkes of amorous paſſion: the which by little &amp; little kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in them both in ſuch ſort, that it could not bee long diſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; but <hi>Lecefin</hi> was conſtrained (by the way which ſéemed moſt commodious vnto him) to diſcouer vnto his Lady the ſeruitude into which her loue had reduced him, praying her to haue regard to the infirmitie which he felt in hart, farre more corroſwe than that of his outward griefes.</p>

ſhould peraduenture endure to ſit a little on horſe backe, albeté he had broght him but into a very bad taking. Then <hi>Rifarano</hi> this Squire diſarmed him, and wrapping vp his wounds as well as they could, they conducted him vnto the next Cittle from thence, where they committed him into a Chirurgians hands, who aſſured them of ſpeedie recouerie.</p>
               <p>Whereof <hi>Rifarano</hi> was full glad, but more it chaſed him, when each one recounting their fortunes paſt to one another, vnderſtood the outrage offered by <hi>Ledefin</hi> to the Prince <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedes.</hi> He reprehended and rebuked him greatly therefore, ſaying, theſe were not parts be ſéeming knights extracted of ſo high Parentage: and that hee reputed it a great indiſcretion in him; a Moore, to loue <hi>Philocriſta</hi> beeing a Chriſtian, and of a Law contrarie to his.</p>
               <p>Moreouer he blamed much his great impudencie towards the Gentlewoman, whoſe huſband bee ſlew: requeſting him in the end verie amiably, he would vſe no more thoſe trickes of youth, too farre diſtant from the vertuous honeſty of an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious and generous heart.</p>

               <p>Gratious Lord replied the Countie, as long as my ſoule ſhall dwell in his paſſible bodie, I will alwaies endeuour in all places to manifeſt the praiſe of her merite, according to the ſmall puiſſance that it hath pleaſed God to giue me, whollie vowed, yea fatally deſtinated to her ſeruice: &amp; when my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhall not anſwere my hart, which in this reſpect is mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnable: I ſhal augment onely but the number of theſe, who cannot bring their driftes about, thanking you in all moſt humble affection, of the fauour which you ſhewed me, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing me ſuch licence in your houſe.</p>
               <p>After theſe ſpeeches and manie other which they had toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Countie retired himſelfe into his lodging: whereas ſoone as he was come, he commaunded that on the morrowe they ſhould plant in the place before the Pallace an incloſure which ſhould haue in Diameter and circomference of the Center vnto the ends foure and twentie ſethome in latitude, and eight and thirtie in longitude: which was done with high railes in ſo ſufficient proportion, that ſixe Knights might eaſily fight together afront, beſides hee would haue a doore made hard by, where he gaue order to ſet vp a Tent, a Bedde, a Kitchin with Offices, &amp; al which was neceſſarie for ſo ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous a recreation.

               <p>It were a thing almoſt miraculous, replied the Earle, if with ſo great reaſon as I haue to make good mine enterpriſe, I ſhould be vanquiſhed by the firſt aſſailant.

               <p>The Ducheſſe perſeuering in theſe her curteous Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, the Damoſell beganne to cut her off thus: Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, it is nowe time to bring into ſome harbour the two Barkes ſo toſſed with the amorous ſtorme and tempeſt: So that to preache is not nowe required in this place, rather let the Pilots thereof alone to doe the deuoire of their office.</p>
               <p>By this meanes <hi>Tirendos</hi> hauing well vnderſtoode the watch worde, ſet vp the Maſt with one hande, and lifted vp the Sayles with the other, then laying downe his Armes of ſteele required in mortall battells, hee helped himſelfe with thoſe which are more eſteemed betweene two Courtaines, couching himſelfe neere the Ducheſſe ſide: where tooke ſome end the anguiſh of two Louers, who remayned in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, vntill they thought it high time to giue order for the reſt of their Nauigation, a Chamber was appointed for the Knight in a ſecret corner.</p>
               <p>There hee ſoiourned nine or tenne dayes in the greateſt pleaſure and contentment, that as yet hee euer taſted in his life, for the Ducheſſe who loued him as dearelye as her own life, was faire and gratious in perfection: in ſuch ſorte that the departure and diſcontinuing of this felicitie, and pleaſure, was a moſt grieuous thing to both theſe vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of Loue.</p>
               <p>For fearing leſt at length this ſecrete miſterie would bee

               <p>But <hi>Tyrendos</hi> in taking leaue of his Lady, promiſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly to ſée her againe, which comforted her a little: and afterward in going out of the Garden, hee was met by <hi>Dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> who louing the Ladie as you haue before vnderſtood, could by no meanes reſt or ſléepe, but walking all night long about her lodging to bee within ſent of his Paramour, in meane while to allay (as he thought) the reſtles fit of his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning feuer.</p>
               <p>Hee ſéeing <hi>Tyrendos</hi> ſally foorth of the Orchard, was vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the gall, as euerie one who hath taſted the bitter fruite of iealouſſe may preſume: inſomuch that to knowe who hee might be, he drew neare, raging, and grumming betwéene his teeth theſe wordes: Ah, a curſed death maiſt thou die who commeſt nowe from the place, the iſſue from whence hath wounded &amp; peirced my heart in twaine: wiſh that he would haue laide hande on his choller to ſtay him: but <hi>Tyrendos</hi> who had at the inſtant ſet hand to his ſworde reached him a blow vpon his coxcombe, which cleft him downe to the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, continuing his purpoſe thus: Now ſhal the martyrdome end, which hath hetherto tormented thée for her, whoſe ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſole thou waſt vnworthie to kiſſe.</p>
               <p>Then making haſt to the place where <hi>Velican</hi> attended him, hee mounted ſtrait, and without any other company but this Knight, who would neuer leaue him, went directlye to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where they arriued in good time for the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
               <p>On the morrow morning was <hi>Dirdan</hi> found dead hard at the Garden dore, whereat was great murmuring, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſaying hee was ſlaine for loue of the Ducheſſe, which brought her into ſome ſuſpition of her honour.</p>

The Knight thanked her curteouſly for this good affection; and if hee were very glad on the one ſide, hee found himſelfe farre more penſiue, counting with himſelfe what was to be done, to conduct ſo tiggleſome an enterpriſe to an iſſue: The which being vnderſtood by <hi>Gridonia,</hi> ſhe reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as the Louer who could haue béene willing to haue comit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the condition of this vengeance, to the end to haſten ſooner the conſummation of her marriage; neuertheleſſe, ſhe would not gaineſay or ſtriue againſt that which her Mother and Grandmother had reſolued therein.</p>

               <p>It was now the ſixt day of <hi>Primaleons</hi> Iouſts, when the <hi>Polonian</hi> vnderſtoode by all men that he did maruelous Actes of Chiualry, behauing himſelfe like a <hi>Hector</hi> in middeſt of the field: which was a cooling to him, fearing leaſt he ſhould not at his eaſe haue his will of him. Yet hee encouraged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and prayed his fifteene confederates to bende their eyes and heart only vpon <hi>Primaleon,</hi> caring not a ruſh for the reſt, and that hee would doo the like to ſet him quickly packing out of this world: in ſuch ſort that this night he would not go to the Pallace for feare leſt the inchaunted Byrde ſhould reueale by ſome token the plot of his treaſon; the nature of that creature being well knowne thorough out all the Countries and Frontiers of the Empire.</p>

On the morrow arming himſelfe with a rich and prowde Harneſſe, hee entred with fiftéene Knights within the field, beeing ſhewed vnto <hi>Primaleon</hi> by the deuiſe of his Armes; whom hee knewe otherwiſe before hee had béene long within the Barriers by his great Proweſſe: For ſo ſoone as the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions and Trumpets had founded the Alarme hee began to doo ſtrange and maruelous déeds of Armes.</p>

               <p>Then began <hi>Primaleon</hi> ſo fell a fight, ſkirmiſhing on the right hand and on the left, that <hi>Perrequin</hi> could no longer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this braue, but taking a Launce without euer ſpeaking worde, ran with all his force at his backe behinde, ſo that hee made him looſe his ſtirrops, and piercing his Armour, ſcrateht his fleſh a little.</p>

And albeit, that I doo not repute my ſelfe at this preſent very rich in earthly riches, hauing as yet my father liuing, yet may I well vaunt to bee in bart and good will to ſerue and defende you from your enemies, a man more forward than any other Prince of Europe: For this occaſion I pray you graunt mee in marriage your Daughter <hi>Gridonia,</hi> whome I ſhall bée able to vpholde in her honours better than any other Knight that at this day liueth.</p>
               <p>Faire Knight replyed then the Ducheſſe, to giue you my Daughter to wife could I well be content, if by any meanes it might bée, knowing very well the illuſtrious bloude from whence you deſcende: Notwithſtanding ſhée hath ſworne neuer to marry with any but with him, who for the Iewels of her marriage, ſhall firſt preſent her with the head of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleon</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> ſonne to the <hi>Conſtantino Politane</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</p>

               <p>Madame anſwered hée, that is not ſufficient to vrge this euill act vpon him, becauſe the Knight who entereth into a Tourney is as the man that playeth at Dice, who before hée ſit himſelfe downe to play, muſt make account that hée may ſometimes looſe and ſometimes winne: Euen ſo the true Knight ſhould appeare within the Liſts in hazard to leaue his life there behinde him, as ſoone as to bring it away with him againe.</p>

               <p>After theſe ſpeeches they beganne a terrible ſkirmiſh, in the which albeit the Prince charged his enemie with many fell: ſtrange knockes, for the ardent zeale hee had to finiſh this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture; his aduerſarie neuertheleſſe hauing in his hande the beſt ſword which was to be founde in the circute of the earth, deliuered fewe blowes but made the maile of his harneſſe or ſhield vpon his arme flie in péeces: By reaſon whereof Prince <hi>Edward</hi> ſeeing his life ineuident perrill (knowing not well what to doe) reſolued to put this Battaile in hazard: ſo that couring himſelfe as well as he could with his buckler, he cared not to endure two or thrée blowes of his enemie to come to gripes. Which he did when the Knight which founde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a little wearie, hauing not ſtrength enough to holdeing with him, was conſtrained to fall with him to the grounde: where it fell out ſo well on the Engliſh Knightes ſide that he was vppermoſt; Notwithſtanding béeing out of breath, hee could hardlie winde himſelfe from his aduerſarie.

Hee preſently working by his Art of Negromancie, made vs both remaine as deade at the very inſtant: and beeing in this traunce ſodainely tranſported into this place, hee encloſed vs faſt within the Sepulcher, with this inſtance of wordes; yee combat to diſhonour mee and my Daughter, well continue hardly your battell, till a Knight of your race may by his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous courage come to part you.</p>
               <p>When he had thus ſaid, he vaniſhed from our preſence, and we remained there in a wonderfull rage, ſtriking one at an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as you haue ſeene euen vnto this preſent, ſo that wee know not how long this deadly quarrel and mallice betweene vs hath laſted: and the extreameſt point of the diſaſter vnto which this ſorcetie did binde vs was in that wee could not dye by any of thoſe ſtabbes and woundes which wee receaued one of another.</p>
               <p>Maruelous thinges are thoſe which you tell mée quoth tho Prince, and know that it is nowe a long time ſince the Duke inchaunted you heere, becauſe Prince <hi>I dward</hi> of whome yée ſpeake, was my great Grandfather: Neuertheleſſe, let vs depart out of this place to goe a while ſome whether elſe to refreſh vs all three together: And as he ſet his ſoote vpon the threſhold of the doore of this Chamber, he ſpied an old woman which thus be ſpake him.</p>

In like manner is the ſhield which you haue there wonne moſt woonderfull and moſt rare, for that you ſhall ſée the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of all your life pourtrayed out moſt liuely therein: the which not withſtanding you ſhall neuer knew but by lapſe of time, following the deſteny, whereunto God ſubmitted you euen from your birth day: ſo that hauing now accompliſhed that which was by great learning foreſéene &amp; directed in this aduenture you may goe hence, when it ſhall ſéme good vnto you: And for that the two Knights who goe with you, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long time remayne in this world: counſaile and admoniſh them to remember the mercie of God, who by his diuine grace hath giuen you power to deliuer them from the miſery and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity wherein they haue remayned this hundred yeares laſt paſt.</p>
               <p>The old woman hauing ſpoken thus much vaniſhed away, whereat the Prince was amazeo, when making far greater account of the ſworde and ſhield than he did before, hee depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out at the doore with his companions: And ſéeing no more the Pallace wherein hee had ſought with the Knight of the Caue, nor the Armes which were giuen him at the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, his admiration was much more redoubled: Yet as hee came backe hee founde the way to be verie darke and obſcure, which as hee came was as cleare &amp; light ſome, as at the mouth of the hole; where being arriued they got out eaſily without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſturbance, and from thence forth was it for euer ſhut vp, the Pallace reſolued into ſmooke, and all the enchauntments thereof vndone and brought to finall end.</p>
               <p>Afterwards walking together towardes the Gardengate, there met them the Abbeſſe and her Nunnes, who entertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Prince with ioy and the greateſt gratulation that might bee, maruelling much at the two companions whome hee brought with him: which cauſed the Abbeſſe to demande who they were, and who had giuen him the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But this Duke had onely one ſonne and one Daughter which was his eldeſt, excelling farre in beauty all others of that country, for which cauſe, hir father loued her a great deals the dearer: ſo that more carefully to haue her nuctured in all feminine ciuility, hee cauſed her to bee brought vp in the houſe of a ſiſter of his being a widdow, a moſt prudent Lady, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well aduized and verye well ſeene in the Arte of Magicke and ſecret Philoſophie, a Profeſſion very peculiar to the moſt part of their familie.</p>

               <p>My louing Niece, take you no care (replied the Lady) but haue a little patience that all things may be done in theſe due time.

               <p>Beeing put in this aſſurance of ſauegard by his guide, hée went on fayre and ſoftly his pace by that falſe gate (before which the two brethren long ſince fell together by the eares) euen till hee came within the Chamber of <hi>Rene:</hi> where as ſeene as they were entred, quickly was the doore well barred: Whereupon by fortune Prince Edward called to minde that which appeared vnto him in the wood, and moreoner that which the old woman foretold him touching the vertue of his ſword.</p>

               <p>Prince Edward, in truth I was out of hope with my ſelfe, that the heauens would fauour me ſo much, as to make theſe mine eles beholde you, which haue ſhed ſo many teares to deplore my future calamitie; if it pleaſe not you to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour mée: Whereby my hart hath béene by an impatient deſire prouoked to rage and exclaime againſt fortune, which hauing blowne your renowne vnto mine eares, would fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate my ſight of ſo rare a creature.</p>

Notwithſtanding, nowe my lucke is ſo proſperous, as to make me the happieſt Damſell of all Europe, ſeeing the paine you take to viſit mee, I perceiue well that not without great reaſon it hath made mee altogether the ſlaue and captiue of your loue.</p>
               <p>The Knight greatly maruaſling no leſſe at the ſinguler beauty of this Damſell, than to heare her vſe ſuch eloquent and cunning tearmes; tooke her by the hande to lift her from the grounde, and to ſeate her in her chaire againe, néere vnto which, the Damſell who was the meſſenger before, hauing already ſet another, the infant cauſed the Prince to ſit downe hard by her ſide, reentring the former talke with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>Faire Lorde, knowe yee I am Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Borſa,</hi> one of your moſt faithfull vaſſals, who hearing the brute of your generous actions, on euery ſide publiſhed round about vs, began ſo extreamely to loue you, that I forgot the very zeale which I bare vnto my ſelfe: Whereof ſhall bee a good teſtemony the extreame paſſions which you ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand doo daily debilitate my life that dependeth onely but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon your humanity: the which I hope to ſée ſo pittifull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, that it ſhall haue compaſſion of the grieuous an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes, which without intermiſſion doo martyr mee with more painefull torment than that which king <hi>Phalaris</hi> cauſed <hi>Perillus</hi> to endure within the braſen Bull, which he himſelfe inuented for the cruell torturing of others: And you may well thinke faire Prince, I could not in any other Knight of baſe condition haue knowne howe to ground ſo much hope as I haue nowe in you, and therefore I pray you to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the reaſon and carriage of all good and ſounde iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Madame, replied the Prince, I could not imagine the mean to exempt from you the recognizance wherein I find my ſelfe bounden to you, conſidering the good will, which of your grace you beare me without any merit of my part: Neuertheleſſe, if death doo not preuent the affection which I haue to ſhewe

you howe it is not to an vngratefull perſon, or one of ſmall power to whom you addreſſe your ſelfe, I will vſe ſuch muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence and liberalitie towards you and your father, that you ſhall haue chiefeſt cauſe of any liuing in this kingdome to giue me thankes.</p>
               <p>And beléeue mee (ſwéete Ladie) if I had knowne your will (ſetting apart all mine owne affaires) I had come vnto you to doo you all the ſeruice I could poſſibly haue deuiſed; yet not with intent to obtaine of you any thing which might ſtaine your honour, or abaſe that vertue which I ſée ſhining in you, as doth <hi>Virgo</hi> the maiden ſigne in the Zodiacke of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens: Forſomuch as thereunto could he neuer conſent who ſhall thinke himſelfe all his life time to be your loyall and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſeruant. Thus much I ſay, becauſe I may not haue you in marriage to be my wife, my hart béeing vowed in another place.</p>
               <p>Albeit, to aſſure you of my ſincere and true deuotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, there is nothing ſo difficult or harde to bee accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, which it ſhall pleaſe you to commaund me, but I will erecute moſt willingly, in the beſt ſort which I may or ſhall be able to deuiſe.</p>
               <p>Iudge yée whether the Ladie were perplered and greatly troubled in her minde or no, hearing the reſolution of the Knight (whoſe minde was onely fixed and eſtabliſhed on <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia)</hi> for ſo much as her very ſpéech which ſhée loſt for a while, ſhewed euidently a moſt true and perfect token of her ſufferance.</p>
               <p>Which her Aunt perceiuing, who in the meane time em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed her beſt ſkill to bring her in grace with the Prince, was ſore difended to ſee her in ſuch a ſwowne.</p>
               <p>Knowing alſo that ſhe laboured in vaine, by reaſon of the ſword which he got in the Caue, ſhee came into the Chamber where they were together ſaying.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> ſo fauourable are the heauens vnto you, that they will happily conduct you to the ende of all your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, except of that one which you haue ſo liuelie now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed

               <p>That cannot I do by mine own conſent quoth the Prince, hauing alreadie ſurrendred the conqueſt of my libertie into a place, whence when I would, I cannot well call it vacke at my pleaſure: Wherefore I beſéeche you of all fauour make me vnderſtand ſo much as I perceaue you knowe, and withall who ſhall be that ſo fortunate Knight who ſhall go before mee in the fruition of the Princeſſe <hi>Gridonia,</hi> Nay ſeeing you haue no pittie (replyed the Inchauntres) of this faire Lady whome you ſée almoſt breathleſſe in your preſence, I am not purpoſed to tell you things wherein you may take delight, but rather not to drownd my ſelfe in ſorrowes ſéeing you before mine eies, I wil preſently depart out of this Chamber: with that ſhee went her wayes, leauing the poore lauer in a Sea of teares, continuing her exclamations with lamentable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Of this newes was the Prince very ioyfull, eſpecially hearing him ſay ſhe deſcended of ſo illuſtrious and noble place, for the hope hee had to ſende her for a preſent to <hi>Gridonia;</hi> in ſuch ſort that cauſing her to bee put in good comfort by the Marriner his Interpretour, hee commaunded him to abuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize her how ſhe was in the power of a knight, who vpon his life would not permit the leaſt diſhonour in the worlde to bee

               <p>Prince Edward afterwardes hauing vnderſtoode by the More the interpretation which the Infant had accompanied with ſo heauy a ſigh, he would take the charge of her himſelfe, ſaying to the Maſter of the ſhippe, that of all the booty they had taken, he demanded nothing els for his ſhare but this Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell.

               <p>Syr replyed the Merchant, you haue already done me more grace, than I ſhall euer bee able hereafter to deſerue at your hands; which may well aſſure you, I ſhall neuer dare diſcloſe you, ſeeing the great care and dilligence you your ſelfe vſe, not to bee deſcried of any whatſoeuer; and whereas there is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beſide in this veſſell who knowe you as well as I doo, I will make them all come before you to the ende they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe not to make knowne your name, but when and to whom you ſhall pleaſe.</p>
               <p>So it fell out when they arriued afterward with great gladneſſe at <hi>Arriace,</hi> which was the place of the birth and dwelling of the chiefe Merchant who was owner of the ſhip: Being a Cittie verie ſtrong and of good defence ſituate in the Kingdome of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> on the one ſide confining with the Countries of the Soloan of <hi>Nicea.</hi> There came they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Hauen, and for the Merchant was rich and had a faire lodging, hee tooke the Knight with him into his houſe: who would néedes bring along <hi>Zerphira</hi> with him, leading hir by the arme, where they were Honourably entertained by the

               <p>Whereuppon it fortuned that ſhee ſent incontinent for the principall Merchant to come to her Caſtell, who arriued there ſoone after with two handmaides of <hi>Zerphira,</hi> which fell to his ſhare, whereof he made a preſent vnto her, and declared vnto her as much as yon haue read before: wherewith thee had her minde ſo troubled, that ſhe loſt almoſt both her ſence, and reaſon, and therefore ſhe prayed him to moue the Knight
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:3083:93"/>
to haue ſome compaſſion of her woefull diſtreſſe. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon he proteſting vnto her of a troth the great curteſie and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſnes of Prince Edward, ſhee made no farther enquirie; but beeing accompanied with the Marchant &amp; with ſome one of her Damſels, ſhe went preſently to him, and falling downe proſtrate before him thus ſhe began.</p>
               <p>Braue Knight, if the affliction of any poore deſolate wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow hath euer found place of pittie in your noble minde, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you moſt humbly you will now vouchſafe to regard mée in the neceſſitie wherein I am. And after ſhee had vnfolded the whole matter vnto him, the Prince made her this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</p>
               <p>Madame I am verie ſorie and ſore diſpleaſed at your ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and cauſe of melancholie; on the other ſide I am verie glad that ſo good an occaſion doth offer it ſelfe now, to make you knowe the deſire I haue had euer ſince mine Infancie, to helpe and ſuccour to my ſmall power all Ladies, who would employ mee, and eſpecially thoſe who feele themſelues oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and deſtitute of aids and counſell. And for this cauſe will I willingly preſent my ſelfe before your King, making him to vnderſtand, that corrupting the inuiolable lawes of Iuſtice, he doth you wrong and great iniuſtice, to take your Cittie away from you by force and authoritie. And if there be anie Knight in his Court will maintaine the contrarie, I hope by the helpe of God to make him confeſſe it by force of Armes.</p>
               <p>Thus much hee ſaid for that he knew before howe <hi>Belcar</hi> one of King <hi>Friſols</hi> Sonnes was lately married with <hi>Alde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> the Duke of <hi>Pontus</hi> Daughter, and brought away his wife into <hi>Hungarie,</hi> whereupon that occaſion they held great feaſtes and Tournies: ſo that growing vppon this quarrell in this contention with him or with the Prince <hi>Dutreus,</hi> and killing him in ſingle combat he hoped to do acceptable ſeruice to his Ladie <hi>Gridonia,</hi> being this houſe néere allied to that of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ladie thanking him for this honeſt and curteous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:3083:93"/>
tolde him that if it pleaſed him to bare her companie, ſhee feared nothing, and that leauing her Sonne vnder good &amp; ſure garde, ſhee purpoſed to depart verie ſoone with ſome number of Knights for her ſafer conduct. Whereunto the Knight an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that he was readie at any time when ſo euer ſhe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And therefore ſhee cauſed good order to bee taken for all thinges which might be needfull in this voyage, deſiring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her departure, to get into her poſſeſſion for the Knightes ſake the Damſels of <hi>Zerphira,</hi> which remayned ſtill in the Marchants hands, paying for euery one of them a reaſonable ranſome according to their eſtate.</p>
               <p>All that night was Prince Edward very ſad, for hee could not reſolue with himſelfe, whether he ſhould firſt goe to <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia</hi> to preſent vnto her the Infant <hi>Zerphira,</hi> or whether he ſhould paſſe vnto <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to end the Combat with <hi>Primaleon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In fine after many reſolutions he concluded that with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which he put in execution very early on the morrow mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; for hee came to requeſt the Marchant his Hoaſt that it would pleaſe him to commaund a ſonne of his called <hi>Diazan</hi> to goe doo an errand for him as farre as the <hi>Clouen-Rocke,</hi> wherein he was more willingly obayed, than hee coulde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund; then went he ſtrait to the Infants chamber, whome he told that he would ſend her to an excellent Lady who wold honour her, and vſe her with all humanity, and hee beſought her to bee willing to goe, hoping to come to viſit her there ere long, and to bring her ſuch newes, which ſhould giue her no occaſion to repent her going thither.</p>
               <p>The yong Princeſſe albeit this offer went néere her heart, anſwered him neuertheleſſe in this manner: In good faith it is great reaſon ſir, that as your priſoner and captiue I ſhould obay your requeſtes without any contradiction, eſpecially knowing they deriue from the ſincere and honeſt amity which it pleaſeth you to beare me, albeit I am ſure I ſhall neuer be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to merite it on my behalfe; neuertheleſſe I beſeech you to cauſe my Damſels to be called hether, vnto whome if it pleaſe

you I will ſpeake ſome few words before my departure; moſt willingly will I cauſe it to bee done replyed the Knight: So hee cauſed them to come into her Chamber forthwith, where theſe young Damſels ſéeing their Miſtres in ſtrange manner to hate her owne life in deploring and bewayling her infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate diſaſter, they began altogether to make ſuch a ſtrange and pittifull complaint, that the Knight was conſtrayned to ſeparate them, and ſoone after to ſend away <hi>Diazan</hi> with the Infant <hi>Zerphira</hi> towards the Caſtell of the <hi>Clouen-Rocke,</hi> to preſent her to the Princeſſe <hi>Gridonia</hi> from a Knight vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, with a letter whoſe tenour followed in theſe words.</p>

               <p>So hee procéeded to declare the Embaſſage which Prince <hi>Edward</hi> gaue him incharge to deliuer by worde of mouth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the letter which he had already giuen into her hand, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him in valour and curteſie aboue all the Knights to whom the fower Elements had euer lent any influence of harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call conſtitution: And told her moreouer, how he cauſed him ſelf to be called the Knight of the Dogge; by reaſon of a very great and fayre Dogge that he carried along with him, which was of ſo good knowledge, that hee ayded and ſuccoured him greatly in his neceſſities.</p>
               <p>Squire my friend, replyed the Princeſſe <hi>Gridonia,</hi> I make no doubt but that the Knight of the Dogge is both magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimious and of great Proweſſe, ſéeing that without knowing me, hee hath had this remembrance of me; wherein I pray the Lord God to giue me the fauour, that according to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, I may returne him his due guerdon and rewards, and giue him ſo much power and ſtrength, as by his happy victory he may chace from my hart the languiſhing and bitter ſorrow

which hath ceazed it a long time. And for a teſtimony of the loue and duety I too owe him reciprocally, I take and accept this Infant (his preſent) in the place and ſteede of a ſiſter and a good friend; and ſo will I loue and honour her, as if wee were both iſſued out of one wombe.</p>
               <p>For this acceptation and curteſie did <hi>Diazan</hi> thanke her moſt humbly, in kiſſing her hand; then did hee interprete to the Infant what ſhe ſaid, whereat <hi>Zerphira</hi> bowing her ſelfe very low, did giue her alſo thankes for her part: and then did <hi>Gridonia</hi> take her by the hand to make her ſit downe by her, praying her to be of good cheare, and to deuiſe what paſtime ſhee pleaſed; all which <hi>Diazan</hi> expounded vnto her as well as he could.</p>
               <p>Then ſhee who perceiued ſo much honour was done vnto her in eating and drinking alwaies with <hi>Gridonia,</hi> which made her greatly comfort her ſelfe, and droue away all yrke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomnes of the place, but not that ſhe could in any wiſe altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forget her aduerſe and ſiniſter fortune: Neuertheleſſe, ſhe neuer ſhewed any euident token thereof, but very wiſely diſſembled it, whereat <hi>Gridonia</hi> maruelled not a little, but much more at her great riches and iewels which ſhée carryed about with her.</p>

               <p>Sir, it hath pleaſed you to cauſe notice to be giuen me to appeare before your royall Maieſtie, to the end that vnder the coulour of fortification and aſſurance of your kingdome, you may diſpoſſeſſe me of my towne of <hi>Arriace,</hi> becauſe it is ſituate vpon the frontiere confining vpon the <hi>Moores</hi> your enemies, from whom yée ſuppoſe putting therein ſure guarde and good garriſon, to ſhut vp all paſſage that way, &amp; to cut off the hoſtile
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:3083:96"/>
inuaſion, which they might other wiſe make into your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties dominions; wherein I maruell much that you addreſſe your ſelfe to me, being but a poore widow, rather than to any other of your vaſſalls, to vſe ſuch rigour &amp; extremitie towards them: conſidering if you alledge that my ſonne is too yong to kéepe quarter, and to hold ſo dangerous a paſſage. I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you, this reaſon ſéemeth not ſufficient to execute iniuſtice towards him, but rather ought you as his King &amp; ſoueraigue Lord, to take him into your protection and ſafegarde. Nor can you finde iuſtly any fault, that my citty is not well guarded and fortefited, ſéeing I ordinarily kéepe in pay a great number of Knights and Souldiers, who do not neglect their duty and diligence, aſwell in placing Sentinels and Scouts both by day and night, within and without my walles, as likewiſe in maintaining all other things which are requiſite for a frontire towne: beſides euery one may preſume, that in looſing of it I ſhould moſt of all be endammaged, as being depriued of the principall cittie of my domaine, which I will not exchange for any other which you ſhall offer me in recompence to haue it. This is the matter I am come to let you vnderſtand, hoping to finde ſome pitty and compaſſion in a Prince ſo full of cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie as you are, otherwiſe I would neuer haue preſumed to haue béen ſo bolde to appeare before your preſence, aſſuring my ſelfe if you cauſe the charters of your Royaltie to be exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie looked ouer, you ſhall finde it appertaineth not to you by any vaſſellage, but hath alwaies beene the chiefe citie belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the whole ſtocke of mine anceſtors.</p>
               <p>The king hauing giuen good eare to the ſpéeche of the Lady, perceiued the Knight whome ſhe brought thether came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her in a good and iuſt combate, if ſhe ſhould ſtand in néede: and foraſmuch as he knew the braue and valiant Knights by their countenance, this ſéemed vnto him a very reſolute and ſufficient man to maintaine her quarrell, which was not grounded of her part vpon any light occaſion: by reaſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he ſome what repented himſelfe, in that he had cauſed her to be ſummoned vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that buſineſſe, albeit to ſée what the Knight
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:3083:97"/>
would ſay, be made her this anſwer. Lady, it néedeth not too many words to you, determine you to render into my hands ſpeedily your towne, or elſe I will ſend to ſurprize it by force, and will giue you no other recompence, but that peraduenture which your Sonne hath inherited from his father, which is to be a diſloyall traitor to his King.</p>
               <p>O immortall God, then exclaimed the Lady, what is that which theſe mine eares haue now heard: Surely ſir you may do and ſay of vs your pleaſure, becauſe you are our Prince and liege Soueraigne: but if I were as good a Knight as I am a woman, I would make good againſt the hardieſt Knight of your Court, that my deceaſed huſband neuer committed any treaſon in his life. Moreouer, if my Sonne be wrongfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of the citie, which by hereditary ſucceſſion appertaineth vnto him, we ſhall haue force, and not iuſtice offered vnto vs. I will do iuſtice, and that which I ought to do, replyed he: and I will ſée who will contradict me therein. Then Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> who had hetherto remained ſilent without any worde ſpeaking, aduanced himſelfe towards the King, ſaying: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſufficiently maruell of you, O King of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> hauing heard heretofore the renown of your valiant and maruellous feates of armes, blowne abroade into the world with perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall fame and praiſe, that yée will now vpon ſo ſmall an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion obſcure and dim it.</p>
               <p>For vnderſtanding well the diſcourſe of this affaire, it ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me that rather vpon ſome malice and grudge which you may haue conceiued againſt this Lady, than otherwiſe vpon any iuſt and apparant reaſon you will put her from her owne good. In ſo much that I muſt of fauour intreat you, that you will not ſuffer your ſelfe to be caried away with enuy, nor be blinded by couetouſneſſe, ſéeing ſhe will ſweare vnto you, to be for euer hereafter your loyall vaſſaile, as heretofore ſhe hath euer béene, and to keepe ſo ſtrong a guarde within <hi>Arriace,</hi> that you ſhall not néede to trouble your ſelfe, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine content in aſſurance of all tranquillitie and peace, ſo that if you refuſe this reaſonable condition which ſhe offereth
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:3083:97"/>
you, I ſhall be conſtrained to ſay you do her wrong, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to make it good by ſingle combate againſt whomſoeuer would maintaine the contrary. <hi>Belcar</hi> who was of great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, ſtanding then vp with many other Lords who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, anſwered him as it were in chollar. Knight, you come very preſumptuous and arrogant into this place, not reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in what manner yee ſpeake before a King, whome I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you geſſe hath no children néere him. who dare quallifie your pride: you ſhall not be denied the combate if you ſo faine deſire it; and the Lady ſhall ſuſtaine more dammage in this her comming with you in her company (for your ſake) than ſhe ſhall get profit.</p>
               <p>I know not who you are (replyed the Prince) who giue ſo diſcurteous language vnto Gentlemen being ſtrangers; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom ye ought to hearken attentiuely in their demaunds. Indéede I heard before I came into this Country, that the King was both valiant and actiue in feats of Armes, whome his ſonnes did ſecond and imitate very néere. Nor was I ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant he had many other braue Knights in his Court, which notwithſtanding could not debarre me from vndertaking wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly the protection and defence of this Lady; ſo that if yée will vpon her quarrell enter the combat with me, I am ready to goe into the field, vpon condition, if you be by me vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, the King ſhall neuer lay further claime to the Lady, nor to none of hers for the Citty of <hi>Arriace.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Belcar</hi> accepted with a very good will the battell vppon the ſame condition, and gaue him to vnderſtande who hee was. Whereat the Knight of the Dogge was moſt glad: For all this, the King would not hazard his ſonne to perrill of death, but commaunding him to ſit downe againe in his place, tolde them he would in no wiſe accord vnto this battell; becauſe hee was already reſolued to doo that which the Ladyes Knight had entreated him too, remembring himſelfe what occurrences he had paſſed in ſeeking ſtrange aduentures: So that <hi>Belcar</hi> hauing ſeated himſelfe againe, in a great chafe, the King tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelfe towardes Prince <hi>Edward</hi> with this language.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:3083:98"/>
Gentleman, for your ſake haue I releaſed the towne of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riace</hi> vnto this Lady, conditionally ſhe ſhall ſweare to kéepe it ſafe with ſufficient gartiſons of Soldiours able to defend it; that neither ſhée nor her ſonne ſhall hereafter bee rebels to my Crowne, and that you ſhall doo one pleaſure for mee beſide.</p>
               <p>Moſt willing will I employ my ſelfe in whatſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe you to commaund me (replyed the Prince) ſo it bee not to reueale my name, otherwiſe reputing the grace and fauour that you haue ſhewed to this Lady, as if I had receiued it my ſelfe. Then directing his ſpéech to the Lady bee willed her to kiſſe the Kings hand; the Amſtants who ſaw how ſecrete hée kept himſelfe, not bowing to doo the like, they preſhmed hée was ſome Knight deſcended of high Parentage. In the meane time, <hi>Belcar</hi> and the <hi>Engliſhman</hi> were in ſome conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the Quéene who tooke pitty of the Lady of <hi>Arriaces</hi> teares, beſought the King not to procure the death of her ſonne by this mean; ſo that for many reſpects he gaue the Lady her content, who ſware ſolenmely vnto him to obſerue all that hée propounded to her faithfully: and to ſende him alſo her ſonne vnto his houſe, to be brought vp to ſerue his Maieſty. King <hi>Friſol</hi> requeſted the Knight to ſoiourne in his Court vntill the next ſunday, to ſhewe him ſome Chiualries in a Tourney which ſhould be held there; whereunto he anſwered he would willingly abide with him, albeit he had great affayres to doo in another place. And hereupon the King commaunding they ſhould goe to diſarme him in ſome good chamber of the Caſtel, the Knight thanked him greatly for that curteſie, excuſing himſelfe that he would not leane the Lady of <hi>Arriace.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the King commaunded his Harbingers to ſée them very well lodged without his Pallace.</p>

Wherefore reputing himſelfe a hardy Knight, bée
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:3083:98"/>
determined to lay an ambuſh for Prince <hi>Edward</hi> to take him away by violence as you ſhall vnderſtand. But the Lady be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very ioyfull woman to ſée her buſineſſe haue ſo happy iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, would not depart vntil the Tourney were finiſhed; which her Knight alſo purpoſed to attend; who in the meane time was fore offended with himſelf that he combatted not <hi>Belcar,</hi> becauſe that ſlaying him in battell, hee thought to doo great pleaſure to <hi>Gridonia,</hi> who hated mortally the partakers and louers of the Emperour of her capitall enemy.</p>
               <p>But the King and all the Lords there preſent, had no other talke but of him; ſo that <hi>Belcar</hi> who felt himſelfe ſome what diſpleaſed hearing all the praiſe powred vpon him, ſaide thus much in all their hearings; The houre approcheth when we ſhall ſee what hee can doo: Notwithſtanding I maruell much of you my Lorde (looking vppon his father) that you ſuffer your ſelfe ſo ſoone to be ouercome with wordes. I haue done it ſonne (replyed the King) to preuent the perill of your life, hauing no better right on my ſide, and let mee heare no more, for good Knights ought to be honoured and maintained by Princes.</p>
               <p>After this commaundement this pleacame no more in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but euery one prouided to make himſelfe braue againſt the Tourney, attending with an incredible deſire to ſir howe the Knight of the Dogge would be haue himſelfe. Sunday being once come, the King went accompanied with his Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, and the Quéene attended by her Ladies to the Scaffold, and preſently the place of the Iouſts was opened, where wer about two thouſand Knights, what on one ſide and other, and the Duke of <hi>Borſa</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Oregua</hi> helde vppon the Courtiers ſide, being both very valiant Champions.

(ſuppoſing ſome one or other of the Kings Sonnes would be within the liſts) he came thether accompanied with the xx. Knights of the Ladies: ſo that ſeeing the courtiers at the point of carying away the victory, he purpoſed to reléeue the féebler ſide: and daſhing Spurres to his Horſe, before he brake his Launce, he laide many a Knight along; then ſetting hand to his ſword he did maruelous things: By this means knew him many Courtiers, who came to prooue themſelues againſt him. Amongſt others, the Earle of <hi>Oregua</hi> comming very neere him lent him two ſound blowes with his Mace: for which he ſuſteined ſodaine reuenge by one blow which Prince <hi>Edward</hi> croſſed him ouer his Helmet, wherwith being ſore hurt he fell to the ground.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, I perceiue now that which my heart did preſage vnto me, of the proweſſe of the Knight of the Dog, to be true: things which euery one may iudge aſwel as I, by his honorable ſeats of armes which do aduance him far aboue all thoſe of the whole troope. And as he vttered theſe ſpéeches, behold <hi>Belcar</hi> and his brother <hi>Ditreus</hi> who enter the liſts vnknowne, and for they ſaid they would not be ſéene in the Tourney that day, to the end to auoid aſmuch as might be, the clamor of the vulgar ſorte aſſoone as the Nobility were placed vpon the Scaffolds, they went ſecretly to arme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, to thruſt in among the crowd, as being no better than ſimple Knights onely: where being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued, <hi>Belcar</hi> ran his Launce cowched with great fury againſt the Knight of the Dog; who ſeeing him come with ſuch a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, attended him couered with his ſhield: whereupon he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued one liuely attaint, wherewith had it not bin for the band of the Armer or, who fatally tempered it, Prince <hi>Edward</hi> had bin in danger of his life. Then began they to charge one another with inuincible courage, neuertheleſſe their conflict continued not long: becauſe the Engliſhman who excelled <hi>Belcar</hi> in chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualry, féeling himſelfe ſomwhat mooued, lighted ſo fell a knock vpon his Helmet, that he cleft it a two, and wounded him déep in his head; ſo that he was conſtrained to fall aſtonied to the ground. When the Prince of <hi>Hungarie</hi> ſaw his brother <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi>

Afterward with the aid of the moſt valianteſt on his ſide, he bruſht his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries in ſuch ſort, that he made them all diſcampe to ſaue themſelues: and ſeeing himſelfe victorious, being very weary and ouer trauelled, he retired himſelfe into his lodging, where he was by the Lady and her Knights diſarmed, and his wound carefully looked vnto. Meane while the King, who knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his ſonnes diſafter, ſhewed himſelfe to be very ioyfull to ſee that which he preſumed of the Knight of the Dog to be in effect moſt true: and ſuppoſed thereby he had done very well not to graunt his ſonne <hi>Belcar</hi> the combate againſt him: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles being arriued at the Pallace, and finding them both in ſo ill pickle, he changed his ſodaine ioy into ſorrow, ſaying: Alas!

               <p>The Engliſh Prince, vnderſtanding how <hi>Ditreus</hi> and his brother were wonderfull ill at eaſe, through the wounds which they receiued of his hand, was the gladdeſt man in the world, for the reſpect which you haue heard before: and conſidering how it was not very good to ſoiourne any longer in this court, requeſted the Lady to take her leaue of the King, and that it would pleaſe him to pardon him if he abode no longer there: which ſhe did moſt willingly, not without great enquiry of the King to know who her Knight might be, wherein the good Ladie being not able to ſatisfie him any otherwiſe, but that a Merchant of <hi>Arriace</hi> had taken him into his ſhip in England as a paſſenger: He tooke her conge honeſtly of him to returne

But it tell out to the contrary, for they went out againe all thrée one after another, as quietly as if they had béen brought vp in one houſe together all their life time: ſo that the Prince no leſſe aſtoniſhed with this new accident: than deſirous to ſée the end which would follow thereof, went foorth of the Shéepecoate for the ſame purpoſe; and beholding the thrée beaſts run very louingly and quietly into the wood together, he ſaid.

Then the Damſel thanked him moſt humbly, and taking him by the hand, lead him to ſitdowne by her in a Chaire, where the two yongmen diſarmed him: then brought they him out victuals to breake his faſt, and (after he had well eaten and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied his hunger) they prayed him to lay downe his head vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a rich pillow, which they laid for him vpon the ſide of a ſent, there to repoſe himſelfe, which he did willingly, being very weary with the trauell which he had endured the night before,

Mine aduiſe being to goe aſſoone as may bee towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where the great affection I haue to ſee the aduenture which is reſerued for me, makes me thinke euery houre a yeare. Then the young men bowing themſelues very low, &amp; doing their obeyſance to the Knight, thus beſpake him. Noble Prince, ſince that by fatall deſtiny it falleth to your good hap to reléeue vs out of this miſery, we hope alſo our valour will bee ſomething more aduantage to vs, in receiuing the order of Knighthood from your hand, the which I humbly kiſſe at this preſent, quoth the Elder called <hi>Moſderin,</hi> in token of the perpetuall ſeruice which yée ſhall alwayes finde at my hands: the like did the yonger named <hi>Bellager.</hi> Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> embracing them both, was very glad to ſée <hi>Claudius</hi> hir Page there alſo, to the end he might make more ſpéede away: ſo comming forth of the Caue, he mounted the Infant behinde himſelfe, and <hi>Moſderin</hi> vpon <hi>Clandius</hi> horſe, and his Page behinde him (for <hi>Bellager</hi> would go on foote) they began faire and ſoftly to ſet forward thorow a Forreſt. And becauſe they could not that euening reach the Sea-coaſt, they reſted within a wood in a very thick place all couered and beſet with trées full of leaues and gréene boughes, where the Knight could not ſleep one winke, ſo much was his minde troubled with thinking of <hi>Maiortes,</hi> whom the Damſell had tolde him to be a man, and of the other things which <hi>Oſmaquin</hi> had propheſted of him, which did all iumpe right with the imagination of his dreame: wherein his thoughts were ſtill occupyed vntill it was day, when they remounted on horſe back, &amp; marching along the ſea coaſt, they came at laſt vnto a little créeke lying betwéene two Rocks, where they found the Frigot at an Anckor, whereinto they went all aboard to Ship themſelues.</p>
               <p>In this veſſell were two little Chambers either of them garniſhed with a fine bed, and with whatſoeuer prouiſion was requiſite for ſuch a voyage: therein was alſo found two rich Armours varniſhed blacke, with two very fayre ſwordes for the young Gentlemen which <hi>Oſmaquin</hi> had layd in that place before he dyed, together with all the treaſure of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan

their father, foreknowing well by meanes of his Art, what would enſue after their fathers deceaſe. So ſoone as the young men ſyied theſe Armours, they beſought Prince Coward to Arme them Knights before they ſet ſayie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he moſt willingly condeſcended; and cauſing them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſſe the Armours, he buckled on the ſpurres vnto them both, and gyrded both theyr ſwords vnto theyr ſides, giuing them the gentle accolado with theſe kinde ſpéeches; I pray God to make you as good Knights as your aſpect and phiſtognomie doth prognoſticate, that the proweſſe and valour which ſhall héereafter apparantly procéede from you, may deface the want of this act not accompliſhed according to the ceremonies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in the honour of Chiualrie.</p>
               <p>When they had thus receiued the order of Knighthood, they hoyſedſailes, and without euer ſetting eye of any other ſhip, they rowed ſo long, that within a while they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the maine Sea: where the Infant <hi>Olymba</hi> was ſo glad, ſéeing her two Brethren Knighted, that ſhe could not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie her ſelf in her dilligent attendance vpon Prince <hi>Edward.</hi> So that ſayling with a proſperous and a calme ſea, they came to ſurge within the coaſt of <hi>Thrace,</hi> whence Prince <hi>Edwarde</hi> diſcrying <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> a great way off, his heart began to riſe, not knowing what fortune would befall him in that Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <p>And for that he would not directly put into an Hauen, they Anckored in a little gulfe about fiue miles off, where neuer any Ships vſed to ride: and yet thether haunted ſome poore Fiſhermen, whoſe dwelling was not farre of.</p>
               <p>As they were all gotten a ſhore: My friends, quoth Prince <hi>Edward</hi> to the young Gentlemen, I muſt of neceſſitie go into <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> where I hope to haue the combate granted me againſt <hi>Primaleon</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> ſonne to the Emperour <hi>Palmerin,</hi> for indeed for no other cauſe am I come into theſe climates: wherein if God ſo much ſauour me, that I may eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape with my life, I promiſe you to be héere againe quickly, to aide you with all my power: and if peraduenture I die, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

               <p>Then <hi>Bellager</hi> interrupting this her ſpéeche, requeſted the Knight he would not for any thing in the world abandon him, whereby he might not ſée the ende of this combat; ſo that hee muſt néedes goe along, and <hi>Moſderin,</hi> who would faine haue made the ſame voyage, was faine to keepe his ſiſter company: where we will leaue them to bring the two Knights vnto the Citty of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
