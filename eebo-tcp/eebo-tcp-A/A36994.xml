            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>May it Please Your Grace,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN first my Propitious or Malignant Stars influenc'd the little Genius I now pretend to in Poetry, the Incouragement I had from your Noble Grandfather (whose Extraordinary Iudgment in the Beauties of that Art, as well as Generous Candour in Excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Errours of it, render'd him best capable of being a Patron ingag'd me to Launch my ill ballass'd Bark into an Ocean where most of our Tribe too late find themselves
<pb facs="tcp:61609:3"/>
becalm'd with uncertain Applause, or else wrack'd in the storm of ill-natur'd Criticism. Yet had that Illustrious Hero's Commands such an August Prerogative over me, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Fame sufficiently Establish'd in his Applause, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful enough I ventur'd on, 'till his never to be forgotten loss to all in General, made me too sadly deplore my own in particular.</p>
            <p>How Charming a thing is Dignity, when adorn'd with the glittering Crown of Sence, and the humble Robe of Humility: The Great <hi>Ormond</hi> was blest with both, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and not only a true Iudge and Generous Patron of Arts and Sciences, but modestly familiar with Virtue, tho' in Rags; never slighting the poor Scholar for his Thread-bare Coat, nor pleas'd with the vain outside of an Embroyder'd Fopp, whose inside he knew to be unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd.</p>
            <p>I infer this, as lamenting the ill fortune of Poets, that are not bless'd with a Friendly Party, or a Iudicious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, whose allow'd Vnderstanding, as well as generous good Nature can defend their Works from Malicious Censurers; the Time's Vices will bear no Reflection, and let the <hi>Play</hi> be never so just to the Rules, if a <hi>Rott me Spark</hi> finds himself hit, or Madam <hi>La Pupsey</hi> takes the hint that her dear <hi>Lap-Dog</hi> is expos'd, the Labour it self is like to be the Poet's only Reward: Modest Reproof is taken for absurd Abuse, and honest Satyr for Dogmatick Slaunder.</p>
            <p>And though <hi>Horace,</hi> reflecting upon such as are blind to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

tell'em, <hi>Stultus, &amp; Improbus, hic Amor est dignusque notari.</hi> Yet had he liv'd in this Age, and in some Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Piece had dar'd to Expose a <hi>Maenius,</hi> &amp;c. without a <hi>Maecenas</hi> to Protect it, his Merit tho' never so Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or Fancy or Stile were it never so pure, would all be too weak to defend it against the Critical Party, that found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Concern'd.</p>
            <p>This, I must humbly inform your Grace, I mean as to the General state of Satyrical Poets, without any reflection upon my own; the ensuing Scenes being design'd for diversion, and more proper to oblige an Audience to smile than frown; and tho' some perhaps, being affected with ill Humours, might pick out something to dislike, they generously agreed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage my Profit; and those that found themselves pleas'd, I thank my Stars, still far exceeded the others in number.</p>
            <p>Having at last so well acquitted it self on the Stage (tho' the thronging, imperfect Action, and worse than all, the faulty length, which I will never be guilty of again, render'd it little Diversion the first day) I confess, I could not stifle my Ambition of defiring this honour of your Graces Patronage, and as I have already always found a true <hi>Maecenas</hi> in your Illustrious Family: You, by a free and easie grant of so great a favour, an endearing sweetness in Behaviour, and graceful Condescension, have so added to my heap of Obligations, that I am dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

yet I can see no reason but that this Excellence should be valu'd; for the end of Comedy, being for Pleasure, as well as Instruction; that certainly which contributes most to the first, without prejudice to the latter, must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged an accomplishment not to be slighted. For the several neat turns of a Play keep the minds of the Auditory employ'd with expectation, hope, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, which all end in satisfaction, at the conclusion or unravelling of the Plot. But let the Moral or Instructive part be never so well writ, the Language ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so fine, yet if the Action goes on without any Plot to divert us, we see through all at first sight, and grow weary before the Play is half done, for it gratifies none of our Passions, without which there can be no pleasure.</p>
