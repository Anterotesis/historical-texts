            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable JAMES, Lord <hi>Drummond.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>DID I think that the Present I here make Your Lordship needed any Man's <hi>Patronage</hi> to set it off, I should, instead of doing You an <hi>Honour, disparage</hi> Your good Judgment by such an Address. TRUTH is of <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Kind of Mettal than that Rich Oar which Avaricious Worldlings dig out of the Bowels of the Earth. Her Worth is wholly <hi>Intrinsick;</hi> nor can she owe any part of Her <hi>Valuableness</hi> to the <hi>Face</hi> of a <hi>Heroe,</hi> or a <hi>Caesar,</hi> stampt upon her to make her more <hi>Current</hi> and <hi>Authentick;</hi> and it would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue she <hi>wanted</hi> Worth, should she <hi>beg</hi> it. 'Tis her Prerogative never to go <hi>out of her self:</hi> Nor does this <hi>Restrain</hi> or <hi>Imprison,</hi> but <hi>Enlarge</hi> her. The whole <hi>Vast Extent</hi> of BEING is her <hi>Ordinary</hi> Purlew, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Precincts of her far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stretcht Jurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb facs="tcp:110692:3"/>
Tho' her Steps are <hi>Steady</hi> and <hi>Wary,</hi> yet she ranges over <hi>All Nature.</hi> Her Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sined Progress takes it's <hi>Rise,</hi> and <hi>starts</hi> from Principles: <hi>Sciences</hi> are her <hi>Stages;</hi> whence she makes <hi>Excursions</hi> into Endless and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berless <hi>Conclusions.</hi> Nor does she <hi>content</hi> her self, much less <hi>affect,</hi> to walk on <hi>even Ground:</hi> The Paths she treads are all <hi>up-hill,</hi> and she knows no <hi>Resting-place</hi> in her long <hi>Ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Journey, till she settles her self in the <hi>Clear Contemplation</hi> of the FIRST BEING.</p>
            <p>These Considerations will make it seem very Improper for a Man who <hi>professes</hi> to regard nothing but the <hi>Promoting</hi> of TRUTH, to Preface his Book with a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory;</hi> which, in the Common Opinion of the World, makes a Show of courting a <hi>Patronage,</hi> I do once more assure Your Lordship this was not <hi>my Aim:</hi> For no Man can patronize <hi>Errour,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> needs no Man's good Word or Authority to <hi>abet</hi> her. Not all the Power of <hi>Alexanders,</hi> or <hi>Caesars,</hi> can make a <hi>Bad</hi> Proof <hi>conclude,</hi> nor hinder the Consequence of a True <hi>Demonstration.</hi> Arguments grounded on <hi>Evident Principles</hi> are of such a <hi>Stiff</hi> and <hi>Sullen</hi> Nature, that they can neither <hi>how</hi> out of <hi>Respect,</hi> nor <hi>fawn</hi> out of <hi>Complement,</hi> nor <hi>shake</hi> out of <hi>Awe</hi> or <hi>Fear.</hi> Since then Applications of
<pb facs="tcp:110692:3"/>
this Nature can no Ways advantage my <hi>Cause;</hi> what Excuse can I make to the World why I am so <hi>Inconsistent</hi> with my Profession; or, why I would needs do such a needless thing as to <hi>Particularize</hi> to Your self what I had intended for the <hi>Common</hi> Good of all my Learned Readers?</p>
            <p>'Tis <hi>Natural,</hi> my Lord, for us all, when we apprehend some sinister Imputation, to lay the Blame on others; and 'tis <hi>Honest</hi> too, when those Others are really the <hi>Cause</hi> or <hi>Occasion</hi> of our incurring that <hi>Censure.</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me then, my Lord, if, to save my self <hi>Harmless,</hi> I lay the <hi>Good Fault</hi> at <hi>Your</hi> door; and openly declare, that 'tis none but <hi>Your self</hi> who has made me Guilty of this <hi>odd Singularity.</hi> Had there been nothing in Your Lordship <hi>above the Common,</hi> the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> should have taken my Book <hi>among</hi> them without any <hi>Restriction.</hi> Had there been no <hi>Particular</hi> Qualification in Your Lordship, which <hi>Distinguisht</hi> and <hi>Signaliz'd</hi> You; my Indifferency had yet remain'd <hi>Undetermin'd.</hi> This <hi>Specialty</hi> in Your Lordship, if I can with Truth make out, and <hi>prove</hi> to the World, and (under Favour) to Your own face too, and that 'tis of such a Nature as became Me to take Notice of it; my Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit is acquitted, and Your Lordship must answer for it. I believe Your Lordship is
<pb facs="tcp:110692:4"/>
not aware Your self what this <hi>Distinctive Mark</hi> is, which could oblige a Man in my Station to <hi>single</hi> You out thus from Your <hi>Peers.</hi> I will take leave then to make my Approaches to the telling the World what <hi>it is,</hi> by acquainting them first what it <hi>is not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were my Talent <hi>Heraldry,</hi> I would then blazon in the best colours the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Your Noble Family; how it came first into <hi>Scotland</hi> with St. <hi>Margaret</hi> the then Queen. I would lay open the <hi>Royal Alliances</hi> of it by the Marriage of the Lady <hi>Annabel Drummond</hi> with <hi>Robert</hi> the Third, King of <hi>Scots;</hi> how from Her, by the Mother's Side, descended the Family of the <hi>STUARTS;</hi> who, in a long Succession, Raign'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and afterwards in <hi>England</hi> too. By which means some of the Royal Blood of those Great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs was deriv'd from that of the <hi>DRUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONDS;</hi> and, by consequence, is Ally'd to that which circulates now in Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's Veins. Were I skill'd in such matters, I could with Truth declare how far your Lordship <hi>outstript</hi> all your Equalls in those Exercises in which Noble Gentlemen use to be train'd up; to that Degree of <hi>Skill</hi> and <hi>Vigour,</hi> that, whereas You came thither as a <hi>Learner,</hi> You arriv'd, in a short time, to the pitch of a <hi>Master.</hi> I could add, were
<pb facs="tcp:110692:4"/>
my Profession <hi>Souldiery,</hi> what <hi>Bravoure</hi> Your Lordship shew'd in War, even in the <hi>Bud</hi> of your Youth; and how You durst even then look Danger in the <hi>Face</hi> with an Undaunted Courage. I could recount your <hi>Travells</hi> thro' the most polite Nations of <hi>Europe, culling</hi> out of each all that's <hi>Commendable,</hi> and conduces to <hi>accomplish</hi> a Personage of your Rank; and leaving <hi>behind you</hi> whatever was <hi>Unworthy</hi> and <hi>Misbecoming.</hi> I could, out of a fair Experience, dilate upon your Noble and Civil Deportment; which <hi>claims</hi> at once a <hi>High Respect,</hi> and <hi>wins</hi> the <hi>Love</hi> of all that Converse with you, &amp; Know You: How the native <hi>Sweetness</hi> of your Genius secures you from <hi>having</hi> any Enemies, and the <hi>Greatness</hi> of your Mind from <hi>fearing</hi> them. Lastly, how your <hi>Friendly Affability,</hi> and <hi>Unpreten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Courtesy,</hi> is neither <hi>deprest</hi> by <hi>mean Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descensions;</hi> nor rais'd above its <hi>just Level</hi> by the least <hi>Disrespectful Height:</hi> Which make up a Mixture so <hi>Charming,</hi> that 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to know you, and not pay you the double Duties of <hi>Esteem</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All these are very great Embellishments to your High Extraction, and make a great <hi>Esclat</hi> in the Eye of the Generality of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Persons. But, what are all these to <hi>Mee,</hi> whose sole Addiction is to pursue Truth, and to bend the whole Intention of my Mind to
<pb facs="tcp:110692:5"/>
promote that <hi>Best,</hi> and, in comparison, <hi>only</hi> valuable End, Tho' the Lustre of <hi>these</hi> do <hi>burnish</hi> Honour, and is so Conspicuous and <hi>Bright</hi> in you, that it casts a <hi>shadow</hi> on others of your Quality and Age; yet <hi>these</hi> were not my <hi>Chief</hi> Motive why I give this Book a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reference to your Lordship. No, my Ld. there is <hi>another</hi> piece of your Character left yet untoucht, which, in my Esteem, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells <hi>all these;</hi> which is, that you are <hi>a Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Sincere Lover of Truth.</hi> 'Tis <hi>This,</hi> 'tis <hi>This,</hi> my Ld. which gives you a just Title and Appropriation to this Present of mine: 'Tis <hi>This,</hi> that can best satisfy the <hi>World</hi> (as it does <hi>mee</hi>) that your Thoughts are <hi>Truly Great,</hi> and not detain'd in Insignificant Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, as too many of your Rank are; nor, consequently, are your Affections plac'd on <hi>Low</hi> and Contemptible Objects. 'Tis <hi>This</hi> that <hi>double-guilds</hi> Your other Heroical Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and sets you on the <hi>Highest Pinnacle</hi> of Honour.</p>
            <p>There is nothing which more shocks a true-bred Gentleman, than a <hi>Ly,</hi> tho' it be but in <hi>puntilio</hi>'s of ordinary Conversation. But how exceedingly does a Hearty Lover of Truth <hi>refine</hi> upon this Common Genius of a Man of Honour. Such a Person bids Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the <hi>whole Tribe</hi> of <hi>Errours,</hi> which are <hi>Lies</hi> in their several wayes. A <hi>Falshood</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:110692:5"/>
               <hi>Natural</hi> Philosophy gives the Ly to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> A <hi>Falshood</hi> or Paralogism in <hi>Logick</hi> gives the <hi>Ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to <hi>Human Reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which is the true Nature of <hi>all Mankind.</hi> A Falshood in <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> gives the Ly to the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Being;</hi> that is, to the <hi>whole Creation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and to the <hi>First Being,</hi> who by his <hi>Flat</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablisht those Natures. You have not yet, my Ld. taken the Full Dimensions of the <hi>Grandeur,</hi> to which this High Title, [<hi>A Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Truth</hi>] has rais'd you. You may please to reflect that this Mistress whom You affect and <hi>court,</hi> is very neerly Ally'd to <hi>Heaven</hi> by the <hi>Father's</hi> side; and if You <hi>espouse</hi> her, (for You may be sure of her chast <hi>Consent,</hi> if You sincerely <hi>affect</hi> her) You dignity and ennoble your Extraction by a Relation trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendently <hi>above</hi> what <hi>Sublunary</hi> Marriages could have given it.</p>
            <p>'Tis then, to one of those Greatest of Men, or rather one of those <hi>Paragons</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> that is, to <hi>a Sincere Lover of TRUTH,</hi> I dedicate my Book. I doubt not but I might have found diverse of those whom the Populace of Scribblers call <hi>Patrons</hi> or <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coenasses,</hi> who, out of a vain Consideration <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f being <hi>Prais'd</hi> in <hi>Print,</hi> would have grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accepted it; had I been willing out of a Mercenary Humour, to <hi>prostitute</hi> TRUTH to <hi>Unqualify'd</hi> Persons. But how would it

have <hi>sham'd</hi> my <hi>Choice,</hi> and brought my Prudence and Sincerity into Question, to make a Present of <hi>Pearls</hi> to those whose Thoughts are digging in the Dunghil of Worldly Riches; and value the <hi>Barly-corns</hi> of their Opulent Estates, above the best <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament</hi> of their Mind, <hi>Knowledge.</hi> Such Gifts to those <hi>Little-Great</hi> Men had been as Improper as to present an Atheist with a <hi>Prayer-book,</hi> who would out of Exteriour Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, or some other Respect, seem to accept it kindly; but afterward burn the Book and laugh at the Writer.</p>
            <p>Yet, all this while, I do not pretend to lay any Obligation at all on your Lordship by this Dedication; for, had this Book been publish'd <hi>without it,</hi> You would presently have made it <hi>your own</hi> by <hi>Perusing</hi> it. To do which intelligently both your own <hi>Natural Genius,</hi> and your running thorow the Course of your Studies, in Learned Company, with such <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause,</hi> has more effectually enabled You, than it would some of our old <hi>School<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>term-Doctors.</hi> Such Maturity of Judgment in such Youthful and Green Years. would easily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able your Vigorous Understanding to take in and digest the most Elevated Conceptions.

               <hi>I.</hi> MANY are the High <hi>Encomiums</hi> and <hi>Glorious Titles</hi> which have been given to METAPHYSICKS by those who teach and profess it. They call Her <hi>The Queen of Sciences.</hi> They tell us that, in regard all other Knowledges do depend for their <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Evidence,</hi> on her Sublime Maxims, she is not meerly to be called, in a <hi>Common</hi> Appellation with the rest, <hi>Scientia,</hi> a <hi>Science;</hi> but <hi>Sapientia,</hi> or <hi>Wisdom;</hi> which carries a kind of Majesty in its Notion above <hi>other</hi> Endowments of our <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</hi> They pretend that she does not only <hi>Demonstrate,</hi> which every Petty Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Science must, under Penalty of forfeiting her Name and Dignity; but moreover, that she demonstrates <hi>ex Altissimis Causis,</hi> by the
<pb facs="tcp:110692:9"/>
               <hi>Highest Mediums</hi> or Reasons: In a Word, they make her the <hi>Soveraign</hi> of all other Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and give her the Prerogative of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intending over the rest; of Assigning to each of them their Province; of Distributing to each of them their proper <hi>Function,</hi> and the <hi>Matter</hi> on which they are to work; and of Enabling them, by her <hi>Supreme</hi> Direction and Influence, to Perform what she Enjoyns them; and much more to that purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>II.</hi> I do not at all wonder that Learned Men have adorn'd <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> with these and such like Singular Commendations: They are no more but her <hi>Just Due.</hi> What I admire at is, how, these things being <hi>True,</hi> and she being of so Transcendent a Dignity, it comes to pass that she is strangely <hi>sunk</hi> into such an <hi>Undervalue</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> in the World, that no Body seems to <hi>regard</hi> her. If her <hi>Influence</hi> be so <hi>Universal,</hi> and her Evidence so <hi>Clear,</hi> who would not strive in the first place to cultivate his Mind with such an Unparallell'd Perfection? Why are not Schools and Chairs erected in all Learned Societies meerly to teach Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks, and large Endowments settled to <hi>Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi> the <hi>Professors</hi> of it? And yet we hear no News of any such. Certainly, it she does, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, carry such a <hi>high hand</hi> over <hi>all other</hi> sorts of Knowledge, a great Metaphysician should be lookt upon as a <hi>Monster</hi> of Learning; at
<pb facs="tcp:110692:9"/>
least such an Extraordinary Person, that all Mankind would most highly caress and value him; whereas tho' Beggery be the Badge of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry; yet a Metaphysician is in such a mean Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, that, had he no better Livelihood, he might sue to be Subcizer to a Poetaster, and be glad to feed on his Scraps. Whence we may conclude that there is something very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss in the business; and that either the <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of Metaphysicks have not done her the Right she deserves; or else that, thro' the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Mob of Half-witted Readers, a <hi>General Outery</hi> is made against her; whence Men have taken a Toy at her, and made, a wrong Apprehension of her as Insipid, Dry, Steril and Insignificant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III.</hi> There is no doubt but <hi>Scepticism</hi> also has been a great <hi>Enemy,</hi> as <hi>to all other</hi> Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, so more especially to <hi>Metaphysicks;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she is the most able to shame and confute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the pretence that there is no <hi>Certainty</hi> or <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Fancy,</hi> which being of a contrary Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, has a natural Antipathy against her, is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother</hi> Adversary of hers; and that a <hi>most powerful</hi> one; for it is able to bring into the Field a vast Rabble of Nimble-tongu'd Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, arm'd <hi>cap-a-pie</hi> with Flouts, Iests and Drollery, which of late have (I know not how<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:110692:10"/>
the Generality. It may be fear'd too, that Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous School-term-men, whose Productions have been onely Wordish Digladiations and <hi>fencing</hi> with Distinctions, without any farther Effect, have given, to many, occasion to think that Metaphysicks is nothing but a Mysterious kind of Talk, to make an Exteriour show of Learning, and appear <hi>Extraordinary;</hi> and that to write Metaphysicks, is to no more purpose than 'tis to plant a Nursery of Bryars to enlarge a Wilderness. For these Men speak as high of Metaphysicks as any: Whence, Men reflecting that these Large Promises vanish into Smoak, and that neither Principles are layd, nor any Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Demonstrations or Conclusions drawn thence which are found to be Influential to other Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; it is natural for Men to revenge the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of their High Expectations, by exposing those Authors, and disgracing Metaphysicks it self, as <hi>Chicanerie,</hi> and altogether Fruitless<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; unable to make good what the Professors of it did, in such Big Words, pretend. But, leaving those Persons to answer for their own Faults, let us see what more Indifferent Men have objected against Metaphysicks, and what Reasons they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for their Aversion from her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IV.</hi> First then 'tis objected that <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks</hi> is an <hi>Abstruse</hi> and <hi>Crabbed</hi> kind of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and scarce Intelligible without <hi>Revelation;</hi> so that a Man may break his Teeth with cracking
<pb facs="tcp:110692:10"/>
the <hi>Shell;</hi> and, when he has done, he will find never a <hi>Kernel.</hi> Secondly, that it is <hi>Aiery, Superficial,</hi> and meerly <hi>Wordish;</hi> and not handsomely worded neither, but scurvily <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</hi> Thirdly, that it was never yet seen how it influenc'd any other Sciences at all; as is Pretended. Lastly, that it has no Influence at all upon Men's Manners, nor conduces, in the least, to make them <hi>live better.</hi> These are the Faults generally imputed to Metaphysicks, which we will consider in their Order. Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing first that I have Reason to hope that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>V.</hi> The first Objection is so perfectly Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, that the Direct Contrary is most Evident. The Object of <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> is our most Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Notions, of <hi>Ens</hi> or <hi>Being:</hi> Which an easy Reflexion will tell us, are, of all others, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Considerations we may make of it, that 'tis impossible to frame <hi>any one</hi> Distinct Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Notion of it. <hi>Homo,</hi> has fewer; whence it is <hi>more Clear,</hi> so that we are now able to frame a <hi>Definition</hi> of it, which we could not of the <hi>Individuum:</hi> Yet, because it comprehends in it the Natures or Notions of Animal, Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, Mixt, Body and Ens; 'tis still very <hi>Confus'd,</hi> and therefore <hi>less</hi> Clearly Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Animal</hi> is <hi>less Confus'd,</hi> because it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains fewer Superiour-notions or Natures in it. <hi>Vegetative</hi> is still <hi>less Confus'd</hi> than Animal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the same reason. <hi>Mixt</hi> is <hi>less Confus'd</hi> than <hi>Vegetable; Body</hi> than <hi>Mixt.</hi> And lastly, <hi>Ens</hi> is the <hi>least Confus'd</hi> of any of the Other; and, therefore the <hi>Clearest</hi> of any o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>all:</hi> Whence all the <hi>Composition,</hi> and, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <hi>Confusion</hi> it has, is that it confound in it the Notions of its own Metaphysical Parts which its Definition [viz. <hi>That which is Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to bee</hi>] gives us; which contains onely the Notions of the <hi>Power,</hi> and of the <hi>Act</hi> (viz. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence,</hi>) to which it is a Power: The Sense<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>VI.</hi> Still it will be objected that such Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted Words as [<hi>Power</hi>] and [<hi>Act</hi>] <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> of Abstracted Universal Conceptions, because (<hi>as</hi> they are <hi>such</hi>) they never enter'd into our <hi>Senses,</hi> nor have any Being but in our <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</hi> But, why are not those Notions or Conceptions of [<hi>Power</hi>] and [<hi>Act</hi>] Easy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Whence, were I to begin to
<pb facs="tcp:110692:12"/>
teach a Philosophy-School, I should think it best to take <hi>this</hi> Method; <hi>viz.</hi> that, after my Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers had perfectly learnt the Doctrine of the Ten Predicaments so as to distinguish exactly our Natural Notions, got knowledge of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Laws of <hi>Predicating,</hi> and how to <hi>place</hi> the <hi>Terms</hi> best in order to <hi>conclude evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> I should begin with teaching <hi>Metaphysicks:</hi> Not at all doubting but that any Man of a good Natural Mother-wit, would perfectly comprehend it; and, thence, become excellently dispos'd to demonstrate <hi>a priori,</hi> which is the most Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Best way to attain <hi>True Science;</hi> and to <hi>branch</hi> out his Knowledge of Principles to an incomparably greater Number of Particular Conclusions than he could by Demonstrating <hi>a posteriori.</hi> Besides, all Inferiour Objects would far more easily, and connaturally, open themselves to his <hi>View,</hi> after he had once taken a Distant Sight of them from the <hi>higher Ground</hi> of their Causes and Principles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VII.</hi> The Second Objection is grounded on a Gross misunderstanding of the main Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental of all True Philosophy; which I most religiously observe in all my Discourses; and which, if neglected or not well attended to, brings every thing into Wrangle and Confusion; which is, that all our <hi>Abstracted Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> (without which we cannot possibly Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, nor consequently Discourse of any thing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly

and Clearly) are of the <hi>Things themselves</hi> consider'd according to <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Respect.</hi> This is the Basis of all the Aristot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lian Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; however there be too Few that exactly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend or hold to it. For example. That Great Man, when he was Distinguishing all our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Notions into Ten several Heads, call'd the Second<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eduplication, for the Thing <hi>as</hi> it is Big, or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd, would <hi>Confound Substance</hi> and each of those Accidents, into one Compound Notion; which being quite contrary to his Intention, which was to <hi>distinguish</hi> them, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that he took those words, as we take our <hi>Abstract</hi> words <hi>Quantitas,</hi> &amp; <hi>Qualitas,</hi> in a meer Formal Sense, for the Thing <hi>quatenus Quanta,</hi> and <hi>Quatenus Qualis</hi> or <hi>Qualify'd;</hi> which word [<hi>Quatenus</hi>] cuts off that precise Consideration or Notion from any other; which done, their <hi>Perfect Distinction</hi> is Evident. The Objecter then, may please to reflect that we (following the same Method) do mean, by all those <hi>Abstract</hi> Words, the very <hi>Thing it self,</hi> Consider'd or Conceiv'd according to <hi>such</hi> a precise <hi>Respect,</hi> and <hi>no other:</hi> So that, when we speak of Power, Act, Essence, Existence, <hi>Ens, Suppositum,</hi> Person, Bigness, Quality, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<pb facs="tcp:110692:13"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we mean still the Thing, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded according to such a <hi>Formal</hi> Consideration; nor can we, with any Sense mean any thing else. Whence we, building all our Discourses on our Natural Notions, each of which is the <hi>Thing it self</hi> Conceiv'd <hi>thus</hi> and <hi>not otherwise,</hi> do by consequence, ground all our Philosophy on the <hi>Things themselves;</hi> which being <hi>Establisht</hi> in their <hi>Essences</hi> by GOD'S Creative Wisedom, must be acknowledg'd to be the most Solid Ground imaginable. Wherefore there can be no show of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in objecting to us that our Discourses, thus Grounded, are <hi>Aiery</hi> or <hi>Superficial;</hi> whereas it is an Unanswerable Objection against those who build their Philosophy on <hi>Ideas;</hi> which they confess not to be the <hi>Things,</hi> but <hi>Distinct from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To give an Instance what Mistakes arise when Writers do not exactly Distinguish their <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted</hi> Notions, it would not be much a miss to take notice of the famous Controversie between the late Bp. of <hi>Worster</hi> and Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> which might have been prevented, had this Method of Distinguishing our Conceptions been accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observ'd. The former of these being worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sollicitous, lest the Mystery of the B. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (which he was then Explicating) should receive any Prejudice, did <hi>check</hi> at Mr. <hi>Lockes</hi> denying he had any <hi>Clear Idea</hi> of <hi>Substance.</hi> Now, had Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> declar'd himself to take
<pb facs="tcp:110692:13"/>
the Word [<hi>Substance</hi>] to signifie the Abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Notion or Conception he had of the <hi>Thing,</hi> as it is Distinct from that of the Modes or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, or declar'd it to signifie the Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Thing as it is <hi>Capable of Existing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap> it had been not <hi>Injurious</hi> but <hi>Serviceable</hi> to the Explication of that Mystery:) But he, having in his Eye the words of some Scholas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, who fail'd of thus Distinguishing it; and, besides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did not explain it Literally, but call'd it in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical Expression, <hi>Supporter of the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> had good reason to say that such a Notion of Substance, no <hi>farther</hi> nor <hi>better</hi> explicated, was very <hi>Obscure;</hi> especially, if they made it a kind of <hi>Entity</hi> supporting other <hi>feebler</hi> Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as some of them did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IX.</hi> Now, to supply their defect, and give the <hi>Literal</hi> Meaning of that <hi>Metaphorical</hi> Word [<hi>Supporting,</hi>] the onely good Sense can be made of it is clearly This. The Proper and Precise Notion of <hi>Substance</hi> as 'tis Distinguish from <hi>all other</hi> Abstracted or Inadequate Notions we make of a <hi>Thing</hi> or <hi>Individuum,</hi> is This, that it is <hi>Capable of Existing;</hi> which, as 'tis <hi>thus</hi> Conceiv'd, is its <hi>Definition:</hi> Whereas, let us Define <hi>Quantity, Quality, Relation,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb facs="tcp:110692:14"/>
We find that they do not at all <hi>imply</hi> in their Notion, that is, in the precise Signification of those Words, any <hi>Capacity of Being</hi> at all, as did the Other most expresly; but of <hi>Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> or <hi>Determining,</hi> after their several Ways, the Thing which is <hi>Capable of Being;</hi> because in our Mind we must first conceive the Thing Capable to <hi>Bee,</hi> ere we can conceive it Capable to be <hi>Modify'd.</hi> Since then we see Accidents <hi>are,</hi> and yet out of their own precise Notion are not <hi>Capable to bee,</hi> they must be conceiv'd to <hi>Bee,</hi> by Virtue of the Notion of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> which is of its <hi>own</hi> Notion, (or as sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd by <hi>that</hi> Word) <hi>Capable of Being;</hi> whence they are said, by a Metaphorical Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to be <hi>Supported</hi> in Being by <hi>Substance.</hi> Which also is the true Sense of those Sayings [<hi>Accidentis Essentia est Inhaerentia; Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentis Existentia est Inexistentia</hi>] and such like; which sutes with the Natural Notions of <hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>Accidents</hi> both, if Bad Art does not make Disagreement between them. Whence 'tis to be noted, that this <hi>Supporting</hi> here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, must signifie the Priority and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence one Notion has to the other in our Minds, or, (which is the same) which the Thing <hi>as thus Conceiv'd,</hi> has to the same Thing as <hi>otherwise Conceiv'd;</hi> there being a Natural <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Priority</hi> of one Notion to Another <hi>in our Mind;</hi> and, consequently, a <hi>Dependence</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:110692:14"/>
on one another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for to think there is a Priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Dependence on one another <hi>in re,</hi> as two Things in Nature, of which one is Stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the other <hi>Feebler,</hi> (which I doubt too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, led by the Sound of Words, imagin) is most ridiculous Nonsence. <hi>Unity,</hi> or <hi>indivision within its self</hi> is the Property of every <hi>Ens,</hi> or Individual Thing; and therefore it remains, <hi>as in its self, <hi>One</hi>
               </hi> or <hi>Undivided,</hi> till our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding comes to divide it, after its Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, into more Formal, or (as we call them) Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical Parts, by her Abstractive Way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it by Inadequate Notions.</p>
            <p>For Answer to the Third Objection, I refer my Reader to the Close of my <hi>last Reflexion</hi> in <hi>Solid Philosophy Asserted;</hi> where this Objection is Clear'd even to the Weakest Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>X.</hi> Lastly, as to the pretended <hi>Uselesness</hi> of <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> I cannot but admire at the short Speculation of those who object it. Is it of <hi>no Use</hi> to settle all the First <hi>Principles</hi> of our Understanding, without which (as I have Demonstrated in my <hi>Non<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ultra</hi>) we could know nothing? Is it of <hi>no Use</hi> to acquaint us with the <hi>Essences of all Beings,</hi> whence proceed all the Common sorts of their several Operations; And to give us, amongst the rest, the Essence of <hi>Man,</hi> and, consequently, shew what Actions are <hi>becoming</hi> or <hi>misbecoming</hi> a Being of such a
<pb facs="tcp:110692:15"/>
Nature? Is it to <hi>no Use</hi> or Purpose to Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the <hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> a Tenet upon which <hi>all Religion</hi> depends; How it will fare with her when she is <hi>Separated</hi> from the Body; or What <hi>Dispositions</hi> in her when the Man dies will make her <hi>Eternally Happy,</hi> or <hi>most Miserable?</hi> Is it of <hi>no Use</hi> to Christian Life, or the Good of our Neighbour, to stand up for God's Honour, and preserve others from the damnable Tenet of Atheism, by Demonstrating that there is a Great <hi>GOD</hi> who governs the World; who is All-powerful, and Infinitely Iust, Good, Merciful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is it of <hi>no Use</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate the Existence, Essence and Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Angels;</hi> and <hi>how,</hi> by their Means, and the Virtue of other Second Causes, <hi>GOD</hi>'s Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom administers the World in the Best and most Providential manner; and that, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Things are not Govern'd by <hi>Chance,</hi> nor by the <hi>Stoical <hi>Fatality?</hi>
               </hi> Lastly, is it of <hi>no Use</hi> to explicate the Mystery of the most <hi>B. Trinity</hi> (and other Articles of Christian Faith,) so clearly, as to show they are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Agreeable to our Natural Notions, and to all the Maxims of <hi>True Reason;</hi> which wipes off the Scandal with which Atheists, Deists, and Anti-trinitatians bespatter them, as Perfect Contradictions, and meer <hi>Nonsense;</hi> on the Verity of which Tenets (as will be shown) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend all the most Effectual motives to <hi>Raise</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:110692:15"/>
Mankind to Heaven, and <hi>dispose</hi> them for <hi>Eternal Happiness;</hi> in Explicating and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending which Fundamental Articles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> has the Chief Hand? Certainly, if these things be of <hi>no Use,</hi> it may certainly be concluded, that no part of Knowledge (<hi>Theology</hi> excepted, which also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, in great part, on <hi>Metaphysicks</hi>) is <hi>Useful.</hi> But, these Objectors discourse as if there were <hi>no Use</hi> at all to be made of any Science or Art whatever, but of Handicrafts, Agriculture, and such like: As if they had forgot there was any such Thing as <hi>Virtue, Truth, Religion, Faith, Soul, Salvation,</hi> or even <hi>GOD</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that deserves to be heeded or regarded. To obviate this Calumny, I have added <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> at the End of each Chapter; to show (as the Matter would bear) how Applicable and Useful the foregoing <hi>Speculations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> are to the Improvement of our Mind in <hi>Virtue.</hi> And I hope, I may, without Immodesty, say thus much for my <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> that there never was yet any Speculative Piece written, that makes <hi>Reason</hi> more Subservient to <hi>Faith,</hi> nor Philosophy more serviceable to True Divinity than it does. I wish the Example may propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XI.</hi> But, let us suppose that all this which is plainly shewn to the Reader's Eye, were False; and that there were no other Good in the Study of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

physicks, but the <hi>Enriching</hi> our Minds with Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of <hi>High</hi> &amp; <hi>Solid Truths;</hi> would not this Alone be sufficient to make every Considerate Man apply his Thoughts to that <hi>Noblest Science,</hi> even tho' it had no <hi>farther</hi> Effects, nor any <hi>Exteriour Use</hi> to be made of it? What is there of <hi>more Use</hi> than the <hi>Mathematicks?</hi> And yet <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> tells us in the Life of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> that Plato <hi>was offended with those who did cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and disgrace</hi> (as he judged) <hi>the Noble and Excellent Science of Geometry, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it descend to the contriving Engines, in which the Base and Vile Handy-work of Man was to be Employ'd:</hi> And <hi>that</hi> Archimedes <hi>himself esteem'd all his Inventions of Engines but Vile, Beggerly and Dross, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Speculative Productions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations in that Science.</hi> So much were those <hi>Great Souls,</hi> tho' Heathens, enamour'd with the naked Beauty of TRUTH, for it's <hi>own Sake:</hi> So much did they value the Interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Natural Perfection of their Mind, above the Prospect or <hi>Intuitus</hi> of any <hi>External Use</hi> of it, or <hi>Profit</hi> accruing by it; which yet is so Unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latable to our <hi>Sceptical</hi> Age, I could wish those Noble and Learned Gentlemen, our Modern Virtuoso's, would seriously consider this Temper of those Heroes of Learning in the former World, and think it worthy their Imitation. What excellent Speculative Productions, to the
<pb facs="tcp:110692:16"/>
vast Advancement and Progress of <hi>True Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> would so many Great wits make in a short time, did they please to think fit to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their Thoughts in following and carrying on the way of <hi>Demonstration.</hi> To do which, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can more powerfully invite them than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect that in so many Years Applying themselves to the way of Induction, they have not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to establish so much as <hi>One Universal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> in Natural Philosophy, or to gain the Knowledge of <hi>any one</hi> Scientifical Conclusion: The Impossibility of which by the way of <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> has been shewn more at large towards the End of the Preface to my <hi>Method to Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>

               <hi>XII.</hi> Having thus Defended <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> against the Calumnies thrown upon her, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to inform my Reader of my Conduct <hi>hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto</hi> in pursuing the Advancement of TRUTH, the only End I aym'd at. After I had publish't my <hi>METHOD to Science,</hi> I discover'd that the Chief <hi>Remora</hi> which had <hi>kept back</hi> Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men in our last Century, from attaining <hi>True Science,</hi> was the Doctrine or <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Ideas;</hi> which some very Ingenious Men had taken great pains to <hi>set up</hi> and improve. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd that, That <hi>Way</hi> had two Especial Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons; <hi>Cartesius</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Locke</hi> here in <hi>England:</hi> Both of them were Men of Excellent Parts; so that it seemd
<pb facs="tcp:110692:17"/>
hard to determin which of them had the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in <hi>Wit.</hi> But, as for their Productions in Philosophy, if I may be allow'd to judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> did in very many particulars, make far greater <hi>Advancements</hi> towards <hi>Science,</hi> and in many things arriv'd at it. Whereas the <hi>whole Fabrick</hi> of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesian</hi> Hypothesis is <hi>Aiery</hi> and <hi>Fantastick;</hi> yet so dextrously <hi>Propos'd,</hi> and so prettily <hi>Compacted within it self</hi> (for I cannot at all Commend it for having <hi>any</hi> Connexion <hi>with Principles</hi>) that it <hi>decoyes</hi> his Readers, who do not reflect that <hi>nothing is to be held True which</hi> Evident Principles <hi>do not warrant,</hi> into a kind of <hi>Complaisant</hi> Assent to his Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine: Much after the same manner as our <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is <hi>lull'd,</hi> and our <hi>Passions</hi> are <hi>carry'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,</hi> with Reading a <hi>Romance;</hi> so that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come at unawares highly Concern'd; 'till, our Reason Awaking out of that <hi>Pleasing Dream</hi> of our Fancy, our Deliberate Iudgment <hi>recovers</hi> it self; and we come to reflect, that it is not a <hi>True History,</hi> but a meer <hi>Fiction</hi> contriv'd to amuze our Imagination.</p>

Shortly after, as if they meant to <hi>split</hi> an <hi>Indivisible,</hi> or to <hi>nick</hi> the <hi>Middle</hi> between two Contradictions, they explicate their Ideas to be [<hi>quasi res] as if it were the Thing;</hi> whereas one should rather think that, if they be <hi>not the Thing,</hi> they are <hi>as if it were Nothing.</hi> Afterwards they assure us they are <hi>Ipsissima Mentis Operatio,</hi> the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Operation</hi> or Action of the Mind. Now, this is neither the <hi>Thing,</hi> which is the <hi>Object</hi> of our Understanding, (if it knows <hi>any Thing</hi>) as they sometimes grant; nor what <hi>stands for</hi> the Object, nor so much <hi>as if it were</hi> the Object; but is <hi>relatively Contradistinct</hi> or <hi>Opposit</hi> to the Object; for the [<hi>Operation</hi>] and [<hi>that on which it Operates</hi>] are most clearly such.

The <hi>latter</hi> Words tell us <hi>what it is not;</hi> and, lest we might hapto understand the <hi>former</hi> which should tell us distinctly <hi>what it is,</hi> they quibble in it, and make it <hi>ambiguous.</hi> The Obvious sense of <hi>Representare</hi> is to <hi>Resemble;</hi> but they have found out an <hi>odd</hi> Sense it <hi>may</hi> (as a Term of <hi>Art</hi>) have in <hi>some</hi> Occasions, and to amuze us, they pretend it <hi>must</hi> have it <hi>here;</hi> which is, <hi>presentem sistere;</hi> that is, to <hi>put</hi> or <hi>set</hi> the Thing <hi>Present</hi> to the Mind.

               <hi>B. 1. Ch. 1.

Indeed, had the Sense of those Words he mentions, been the self - same, and the Word it self <hi>Univocal,</hi> it had been Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent which Word he had pitcht upon, since they had the same Signification: But when the <hi>Meanings</hi> of some of them is as vastly and widely Different as the two first Species of Ens, [<hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>] are; in that case to declare his own Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency which Word we would use, and leave it to our Choyce in <hi>which</hi> of those Senses we would understand him; does leave the Readers in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, and utterly in <hi>the Dark,</hi> what an <hi>Idea</hi> is; and, besides, exposes him to a possible Mistake of his Mind every step he takes while he peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses his Book. For a <hi>Phantasm,</hi> which is the Proper Object of the <hi>Fancy,</hi> is meerly Material, Corporeal, and Common to <hi>Brutes</hi> as well asto <hi>Mankind:</hi> And <hi>Notions</hi> which are the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:110692:23"/>
of <hi>Cognition,</hi> must he <hi>above Matter,</hi> and of an <hi>Intellectual</hi> or <hi>Spiritual</hi> Nature. Wherefore the Confounding thus the Sense of those two Words, hazards to lead the Author and his Readers to confound <hi>Corporeal</hi> &amp; <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Natures: Which diverse complain of in this Gentleman; and my self, tho' I much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his Person, and highly esteem his Excellent Parts, cannot but think this is one of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Desiderata</hi> in his Ingenious Book. Besides, a [<hi>Phantasm</hi>] is not that about which the <hi>Mind is employ'd,</hi> (as <hi>Notions</hi> are;) it being the Proper Object of that Faculty call'd the <hi>Fancy</hi> or <hi>Imagination.</hi> And this is that I fear which occasions much Unevenness in his Discourses. Sometimes he builds on <hi>Notions</hi> or <hi>Spiritual</hi> Conceptions, taken from Natural Objects, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do; and then his Productions are very <hi>Solid</hi> and <hi>Judicious;</hi> sometimes again, he grounds his Discourses on <hi>Roving</hi> Conceits sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested by Witty <hi>Fancy;</hi> and then they are Aiery and Superficial, and impossible to be Reduc'd to any Solid Principle. When he does the one, when the other, is noted in my <hi>Reflexions</hi> on the several parts of his <hi>Essay.</hi> To shew this by an Instance; it has been remark't by my self, as it has been also by others, that, in His Excellent Demonstration of a First Being, no Man can discourse more <hi>Clearly</hi> or more <hi>Solidly:</hi> But then, withall, 'tis observable that while he
<pb facs="tcp:110692:23"/>
does this, he lays aside his <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Ideas,</hi> and argues in the same manner as one would do who had never heard of them; or as those would go to work who <hi>oppose</hi> them.</p>

therefore, to find out the Essence of this New Entity, and what it consisted in. In this Quest the Cartesians gave me no Light at all, as has been shown; but Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> lent me some Assistance, while he <hi>constantly</hi> charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters them to be <hi>Similitudes.</hi> Now a <hi>Thing</hi> whose <hi>Essence</hi> it is to be a <hi>Similitude</hi> is a <hi>Monstrous Chimera.</hi> For the Notion of <hi>Thing</hi> or <hi>Entity</hi> belongs formally to <hi>Substance,</hi> and has a <hi>Positive</hi> or Absolute Sense; and <hi>Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude</hi> or <hi>Likeness</hi> belongs to <hi>Relation;</hi> which makes the Heads, or Notions of <hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>Relation</hi> to be <hi>Essentially</hi> and <hi>Formally</hi> the self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> same. A <hi>Thing</hi> may indeed be Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Another, or <hi>like</hi> it; but then the <hi>Thing</hi> to which the <hi>Mode</hi> of <hi>Relation</hi> supervenes, must be of its own Nature <hi>Positive,</hi> for the <hi>Relation</hi> cannot be with any Sense conceiv'd to be what's <hi>Related.</hi> So that this Notion of an <hi>Idea</hi> seem'd to me to be a meer <hi>Hirco-Ceruus,</hi> a <hi>Positive</hi> (or <hi>Unrelative) Relative:</hi> A <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> which is a <hi>Relation,</hi> and a <hi>Relation</hi> which is a <hi>Substance;</hi> or at once, That <hi>which is Related,</hi> and That <hi>by which</hi> 'tis Related.

               <hi>XX.</hi> I was as much at a loss, to know what these Ideas which they put to be <hi>Similitudes,</hi> were good for, or to <hi>what Use</hi> they serv'd. When we have once the <hi>Materials</hi> of Knowledge into
<pb facs="tcp:110692:24"/>
our Mind, our Soul, by her <hi>Reflexion,</hi> can work upon them and order them well enough. Wherefore, all the Kindness they can do us, is to give us the <hi>First Notices</hi> of the Thing: But this they cannot do; because the <hi>Thing it self</hi> must be in our Mind, or else we cannot know that they are even <hi>Similitudes;</hi> since we cannot see they are Like a Thing, till we know what the <hi>Thing it self</hi> is, to which they are Like. Otherwise we shall fall into that pretious Nonsense of <hi>Bayes,</hi> the Conceited Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etaster, in the <hi>Rehearsal. [I Gad,</hi> says he, <hi>I have an Excellent Similitude, if I knew but what to apply it to.</hi>] Nor can there be <hi>worse Sense,</hi> than to say, [<hi>'Tis Like, indeed, but I know not to what 'tis like.</hi>] Whence is concluded, that we must have the <hi>Thing</hi> it self in our Knowledge, <hi>before</hi> we can know what's either <hi>Like</hi> it, or <hi>Unlike</hi> it. And if the <hi>Thing it self,</hi> (as being the <hi>Original</hi>) be in our Knowledge <hi>First,</hi> what need we any <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas</hi> to make us <hi>know</hi> it, since to be <hi>in a Knowing Power is to be Known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>XXI.</hi> I am sure <hi>Similitudes</hi> are of <hi>no use</hi> in <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> tho' they serve to good purpose in <hi>Mathematicks;</hi> for when we come to Universal Notions, such as are Act, Power, Essence, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence and such like, those Proper &amp; Express Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes disappear; and the Ideists must either bid farewell to their <hi>Ideas</hi> or Resemblances,
<pb facs="tcp:110692:25"/>
(which will be very Uncomfortable to them;) or they will find themselves at a great loss. For example; I would ask them what kind of Thing is this Pourtraiture or <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Existence?</hi> Has it <hi>Being,</hi> or has it <hi>none:</hi> If <hi>none,</hi> 'tis <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</hi> If it be such a <hi>Thing</hi> as has Being in it, it cannot be known without <hi>Another Idea;</hi> nor That, without <hi>Another Idea,</hi> and so Endlesly. If it be such a Thing as can be in the Mind, and known there <hi>without</hi> any <hi>Idea</hi> of it; why may not <hi>Other</hi> Things be there too, and known by <hi>themselves,</hi> or <hi>without</hi> any <hi>Idea</hi> as well as <hi>it?</hi> What even Answer is given, I am confident it will be <hi>precarious</hi> &amp; alledg'd <hi>gratis.</hi> Again, is the Essence or Nature of this Idea of <hi>Existence</hi> such that it is <hi>Essentially Existent,</hi> or not? If the Former, 'tis a GOD; whose sole Peroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive it is to be <hi>Essential Existence:</hi> If the Later, then 'its Nature is onely <hi>Potential</hi> to <hi>Existence,</hi> and not <hi>Actual Existence;</hi> and then how should that which is onely <hi>Potential</hi> to Existence, or onely a <hi>Power to Bee,</hi> be a <hi>Resemblance or</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of <hi>Existence</hi> it self, that is, of <hi>Actual Being?</hi> Many such Exceptions might be brought against such Ideas which are onely <hi>Similitudes</hi> of Things in our Minds, and not the Things <hi>themselves.</hi> Now in our way, how impossible is it to oppose any such Difficulties? We conceive the Thing <hi>Inadequately,</hi> and make many <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted</hi> Notions of it; and amongst the rest,
<pb facs="tcp:110692:25"/>
since the Thing does <hi>Exist,</hi> we abstract or cut off <hi>This</hi> from other Notions of it, by considering it precisely according to This Respect; and thence we come to have in our Mind the true Notion or Nature of <hi>Existence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>XXII.</hi> And, hence it comes that, since a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst our Natural Abstracted Notions which we have from Bodies (with which onely we converse) either by Direct Impressions or Obvious Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there are <hi>some</hi> that are <hi>very Imperfect, Potential,</hi> and clogg'd with <hi>Matter;</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> that are more Universal, and <hi>Defaecated</hi> from Matter, such as are Act, Ens, Essence, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istent, Subsistent, Person, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Those who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon the way of <hi>Abstracted Notions</hi> of the <hi>Thing,</hi> can, by discoursing upon those Notions of the <hi>Later</hi> sort, not onely demonstrate those Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which are of a <hi>Superiour</hi> Nature, to which such Notions, stript of their Imperfections, do <hi>agree;</hi> as we have done in our Metaphysicks: but, moreover, they become hence enabled to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of Christian Faith, and shew their <hi>Conformity</hi> to our Natural Notions, as we have shewn, in our <hi>Appendix,</hi> that High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Mystery of the B. <hi>Trinity</hi> is; which makes the Principles of Nature (and <hi>Art</hi> too) bear a kind of <hi>Secondary</hi> Testimony to their <hi>Truth.</hi> Now, I would gladly know what Assistance the Way of <hi>Ideas</hi> can afford us in such a case; <hi>Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes</hi> of Angels, and of <hi>GOD,</hi> and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:110692:26"/>
of all <hi>Spiritual</hi> Natures, would be strange Language, and the applying them to <hi>such</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects would look very Extravagant. 'Tis this Way then, I much fear, which has given occasion to many, either to <hi>deny</hi> Spiritual Natures, as do the <hi>Atheists;</hi> or else to apply the worst of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Attributes to them. Rather, indeed, I may complain, that a right Understanding of Spiritual Nature is so stifled and depraved; that, if care be not taken, it will quickly be <hi>lost</hi> to Mankind: 'Tis a strange step to it, or rather the utmost Attempt of quite destroying and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing it out of Men's Minds, when we see it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly maintain'd that GOD himself is <hi>Spatium reale,</hi> which is the Notion of <hi>Quantity.</hi> For which reason I have exerted my self in my Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicks to demonstrate &amp; explicate the Nature of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> &amp; even to <hi>force</hi> the right Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, in despite of the Reluctancy of <hi>Fancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>XXIII.</hi> In a word, since <hi>Ideas</hi> are both <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible,</hi> and altogether <hi>Useless,</hi> &amp; (I fear) <hi>ill Use</hi> is made of them, contrary to the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Authors; it seems but fitting that the <hi>Way of Ideas</hi> should be <hi>lay'd aside;</hi> nay, that the very <hi>Word [Idea]</hi> which has got such a <hi>Vogue,</hi> should be no longer <hi>heard of;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less a good reason may be given why we should <hi>use such Words</hi> as <hi>no Man understands.</hi>

                     <item>11. Hence, all pretence of GOD's Voluntary <hi>Annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> one thing to another, is <hi>Groundless</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philosophical.</hi>
                     </item>

                        <pb facs="tcp:110692:31"/>17. Hence, <hi>Probability</hi> perfects no Man.</item>

                  <hi>Thing</hi> in Nature.

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the ESSENCES of <hi>Bodies</hi> in in Common; and of the First or <hi>Simple</hi> Bodies in particular.</head>
               <p>1. EVERY Notion that is not <hi>Abstract</hi> but <hi>Concrete,</hi> must have some <hi>Form,</hi> or Formal Cause by which it is <hi>constituted</hi> such. This is Self-evident; for<note place="margin">All <hi>Concrete</hi> Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous include some <hi>Form</hi> that consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes them <hi>such.</hi>
                  </note> we call that a <hi>Concrete</hi> Notion, which is compounded of the Subject which <hi>has</hi> such a Form in it, and the Form which <hi>is had</hi> by it; and which, by being <hi>in it,</hi> makes and denominates it to be <hi>This Kind</hi> of Concrete in particular.</p>
               <p>2. Wherefore the Notion of <hi>Ens,</hi> it being not an Abstract but a <hi>Concrete,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by it's <hi>ESSENCE,</hi> as it's<note place="margin">The Form of <hi>Ens</hi> is <hi>Essence.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Form,</hi> or Formal Cause, which makes it to be an <hi>Ens</hi> or <hi>Thing.</hi> For, since the word [<hi>Essence</hi>] imports somewhat that belongs intrinsically to <hi>Being;</hi> and yet is not the Notion of <hi>Actual Being,</hi> or <hi>Existence</hi> in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; consequently, it can only signifie a <hi>Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Being,</hi> or the Form of that which is <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Being;</hi> that is, (by Ch. 1. §. 5.) of <hi>Ens.</hi> Wherefore, as that which is <hi>White</hi> is <hi>made For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally</hi> such by having that Mode, or Accidental Act, in it call'd <hi>Whiteness;</hi> and that which <hi>is</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:110692:62"/>
                  <hi>Round</hi> becomes <hi>Formally</hi> such by having <hi>Rotundity</hi> in it; so every <hi>Ens</hi> or <hi>Thing</hi> is formally consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted such, by having that Formality in it call'd <hi>ESSENCE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The Essences of those Things call'd <hi>Pure Acts</hi> or <hi>Spirits,</hi> consists in their <hi>Actual Knowledge.</hi> For, since, being <hi>Pure</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Essences of <hi>Pure Acts</hi> consists in <hi>Actual Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Acts,</hi> they have no <hi>Power <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> Matter</hi> in them; their Essence cannot consist in a <hi>Power</hi> to have what is <hi>Natural</hi> to them, as <hi>Knowledge</hi> is; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Essences must consist in <hi>Actual Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of what is <hi>due</hi> to their Natures to know. Again, if their Essences did consist only in a <hi>Power</hi> to Know; it being evident, that whatever is reduced from the State of Potentiality, or <hi>Power,</hi> to that of Actuality or <hi>Act,</hi> is intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally <hi>Chang'd;</hi> and all Change or Mutability pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Matter, (as is prov'd, Ch. I. §. 19.) and <hi>Pure Acts</hi> are therefore call'd <hi>Pure,</hi> because they have none of that Power call'd <hi>Matter</hi> in them; it follows necessarily, that the Essence of all <hi>Intelligences</hi> or <hi>Intellectual Things,</hi> can only consist in <hi>Actual Knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Notwithstanding that Actual Knowledge is Essential to <hi>Pure Acts,</hi> this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders<note place="margin">Yet they are <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential</hi> to the Act of <hi>Existence.</hi>
                  </note> not but that they have a Potentiality to that <hi>First</hi> sort of Act call'd <hi>Existence,</hi> which, (as is shown; Ch. 1. §. 3. and 4.) is <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential</hi> to all Creatures. For, since to <hi>Know</hi> is to have the Thing in it <hi>intellectually;</hi> and the Notion of <hi>Ens</hi> or <hi>Thing</hi> (speaking of Created Things) abstracts from <hi>Existence;</hi> it follows that the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of those Things to which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:110692:62"/>
Existence is <hi>Accidental,</hi> consists with the <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>Existence;</hi> especially, since all Knowledge, even of the Existence of other Things, (as will be shown, Ch. 6.) consists in <hi>being</hi> those Things <hi>as Other,</hi> or as <hi>Distinct from</hi> the Knower. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tho' Angels, by Actual Knowledge, are those <hi>other</hi> Things with their Existences intellectually; yet they being in them <hi>as Others,</hi> they are still left <hi>Indifferent</hi> in their <hi>proper</hi> Natures to <hi>exist</hi> or <hi>not exist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. The Essence of <hi>Body,</hi> or of such an <hi>Ens</hi> as consists of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> is<note place="margin">The Essence of <hi>Body</hi> is <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">

                  </note> chiefly taken from it's Proper <hi>Act,</hi> or it's <hi>Form.</hi> For, since what distinguishes a Thing from, all others, does, consequently make it <hi>This,</hi> and <hi>no Other;</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> being of it self perfectly <hi>Indeterminate,</hi> cannot distinguish or <hi>determine</hi> a Thing to be of <hi>this Kind,</hi> much less to be <hi>this Individuum;</hi> it follows, that the Essence of all Bodies, and consequently of <hi>Body in Common,</hi> is chiefly taken from the <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6.

To pursue the Thread of my Discourse: When Two very Minute Bodies, of different Natures, of which<note place="margin">How <hi>First-Mixt</hi> Bodies may be conceiv'd to be made.</note> one is <hi>Rare,</hi> the other <hi>Dense,</hi> do cling together; which, by being of the smallest size, are not easie to be divided or separated from one another by others, they being <hi>too big</hi> to come between their parts, and so <hi>divide</hi> them; they may be reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably conceiv'd to constitute a <hi>First-Mixt</hi> Body. For, since, by their <hi>constant Adhesion,</hi> they do not Act or Operate as <hi>Two,</hi> but <hi>Conjoyntly,</hi> or as <hi>One;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> follows that they have a <hi>peculiar</hi> Modify'd Operation of their own, distinct from that which other of those Elements had produced in case it had existed <hi>alone.</hi> Wherefore, since every Part <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> Nature is then a <hi>Distinct Thing,</hi> when it has a <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ct Operation;</hi> 'tis consequent, that <hi>these</hi> were <hi>at first,</hi> or in the <hi>beginning, Distinct</hi> Entities; which kind of Things we call <hi>Mixt</hi> or <hi>Compounded;</hi> and, this being the <hi>Simplest</hi> or <hi>Least</hi> sort of Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>First-Mixt</hi> Bodies.</p>
               <p>3. Wherefore the <hi>Essential Form</hi> of those First-Mixt-Bodies, was the Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">The <hi>Essential Form</hi> of <hi>First-Mixt</hi> Bodies.</note> of those two Primary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Rarity</hi> and <hi>Density;</hi> since 'tis evident, that the having those <hi>Two</hi> in it, does distinguish them from <hi>Simple</hi> Bodies or <hi>Elements</hi> which have but <hi>One</hi> of them; that is, (at that time,) distinguisht them from <hi>all others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Therefore the <hi>Essence</hi> or <hi>Total Form</hi> of those <hi>First-Mixt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And their <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
                  </note> Bodies consists of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Act;</hi> or in this, that they have <hi>Matter</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:110692:72"/>
in them, Determin'd by such a <hi>Form; viz.</hi> by the <hi>Complexion</hi> of those two Accidents.</p>
               <p>5. The next Sort of <hi>Mixt</hi> Bodies, is, That they have <hi>Three,</hi> or <hi>All,</hi> of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in them. For, all Proper<note place="margin">The <hi>Second</hi> sort of Mixt Bodies.</note> and Intrinsecal Differences being nothing but <hi>more</hi> and <hi>less;</hi> and the Elements, having each of them, a <hi>Distinct De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> of Rarity or Density in them; It follows, that <hi>these</hi> are evidently <hi>more-Mixt</hi> than the <hi>others</hi> were, which had but only <hi>Two</hi> Elements, and <hi>their</hi> Particular Degrees of Rarity and Density, in their Composition. Whence, 'tis easie, by what's discourst here, §. 4. and 5. to discover in what their <hi>Essential</hi> (or Partial) <hi>Form,</hi> and their <hi>Essence,</hi> which is their <hi>Total Form,</hi> consists.</p>
               <p>6. The Next or <hi>Third</hi> Sort of <hi>Mixt</hi> Bodies, (if it be not in some sort the same) is, when the Compound possesses<note place="margin">The <hi>Third</hi> sort of Mixts.</note> with some <hi>Stability</hi> and Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, an incomparably <hi>greater</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of <hi>some one</hi> of those Elements above the rest. For 'tis manifest, that there are in Nature many sorts of those Things which we call Fire, Air, Earth and Water; in all which, some <hi>One</hi> of those particular Elements does so much <hi>abound,</hi> that we cannot well discern, at first Sight, any Mixture of the <hi>others;</hi> tho' 'tis Evident to our Reflex Thoughts there <hi>is;</hi> and even to our <hi>Sight,</hi> when Art comes to separate them; tho' our Rude and First Impressions make us commonly give them their <hi>Name</hi> from the exceedingly-<hi>Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> Element.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:110692:72"/>7. The Next or <hi>Fourth</hi> sort of Mixts, which, perhaps, are (in proper Speech) the First Sort of <hi>Demixt</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compounded</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Fourth</hi> sort of Mixts.</note> Bodias, is, when they have <hi>More</hi> or <hi>Fewer</hi> of the <hi>former</hi> Sorts of Mixts variously united in them; whose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

And, their Essence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in this, that their Matter is Determin'd by the Complexion of those Mixt Accidents; which giving them, as Constant Agents, the power of Operating <hi>thus;</hi> or, after a Distinct Manner from the former; do, by consequence, <hi>principally concur to</hi> make them Distinct Parts of Nature; that is, Distinct <hi>Things,</hi> or <hi>Bodies.</hi> I say, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, for 'tis to be observ'd, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>11. Of this last sort of Demixts, are all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, Gems, Coral, Clay, Marl, all the several sorts of Earths,<note place="margin">Of the several sorts of <hi>Demixts.</hi>

Wherefore, those Individual Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which have a Power in them to <hi>concoct</hi> their Proper Juice or Sap, and so make it <hi>fit Aliment</hi> for them, which is the <hi>Preserving</hi> themselves from <hi>Withering</hi> or <hi>Decay;</hi> must be ordain'd, in the <hi>first</hi> place, or primarily, to perform this Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>BY this time, my Soul, we have rais'd our selves by immediate Steps, from the <hi>Material</hi> World, our <hi>Underling</hi> and <hi>God's Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool,</hi>

Nor can we think we have err'd in that Noble and Necessary Quest: There have been no Meandrian Turnings and Windings in our <hi>Rational Progress,</hi> which is the Way we have taken. We started first from the Simplest and (as we may say) <hi>Embryo-Notions</hi> of POWER and ACT, which belong to every <hi>Created Being.</hi> We proceeded next to that sort of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Act,</hi> which compounds the Changeable Nature of BODY. We went on to take a view of the Essences of the most <hi>Uncompounded</hi> Bodies, and those of their Simpler <hi>Mixts</hi> and <hi>Demixts,</hi> till we arriv'd at those most <hi>Compounded</hi> ones which are <hi>Organical;</hi> such as are Vegetables and <hi>Animals;</hi> divers Parts of which <hi>seem</hi> to have distinct Natures and Operations of their own: But they only <hi>seem</hi> to have them; for <hi>out of the Compound,</hi> they can perform no such Operations at all; because those Parts being only <hi>Potential,</hi> or <hi>in Power to be Things,</hi> they are hence, of themselves, not <hi>Actually</hi> Things, nor capable of <hi>Being;</hi> nor consequently, of <hi>Acting.</hi> So that 'tis the <hi>Compound</hi> only that <hi>Acts</hi> according to <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Part,</hi> which is <hi>somewhat</hi> of it; because it only <hi>Is,</hi> or <hi>is in Act.</hi> Lastly, We have shewn the Establishment of the <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:110692:100"/>
which constitute the Superiour and Inferiour <hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>Things;</hi> and, especially this Ultimate Determination of it by such a Complexion of Accidents as is Incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable to any other, and <hi>constitutes</hi> and <hi>fixes</hi> the Essence of the Individuums, as is shown, §. 9. is absolutely Necessary for all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Things; as rendring them <hi>Apt</hi> or <hi>Fit to exist,</hi> which is the Main Work of Nature, and the only Means to continue the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Creatures.

               <p>14. <hi>Corollary</hi> IV. This Complexion of Accidents being Incommunicable to any other Individuum, and withal<note place="margin">This Complexion of Accidents can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be <hi>eradica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> while the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuum <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues.</hi>

                  <hi>Essential</hi> to it, can never be <hi>Eradicated</hi> while the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound continues. This is in a manner <hi>Self-Evident.</hi> For, this Complexion being the <hi>ES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENTIAL Form</hi> which <hi>constitutes</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound; it follows, that the Compound must remain <hi>Constituted,</hi> or <hi>continue,</hi> while
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:110692:100"/>
that which makes it such is in it; in the same manner as <hi>Rotundity</hi> being the <hi>Formal</hi> Cause why a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thing is <hi>Round,</hi> that thing must <hi>continue</hi> to be Round while Rotundity is in it.</p>
               <p>15. <hi>Corollary</hi> V. This Complexion of Accidents gives <hi>each</hi> Individuum, and sometimes the whole <hi>Species,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And gives the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound a Different <hi>Genius</hi> and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Propensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  </note> a Different <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension.</hi> Thus every single Man has from his Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, some peculiarity of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, Genius, Humour, or Inclination, distinct from that of all others; which tho' Art, Education, Reflexion and Circumstances may <hi>alter,</hi> for the better or the worse; yet nothing can so totally efface or extinguish it, but the <hi>Root</hi> of that peculiar Propension will stick fast <hi>rivetted</hi> in his Selfish Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. Thus Original Sin is transfus'd from <hi>Adam,</hi> and engrafted in the primigenial Constitution of each of his Descendents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> [<hi>In peccatis concepit me mater mea,</hi> Psal. 50.] inclining Men more or less to this or that sort of Sin, according as their Individual Temperature determines their Propension. And, tho' God's All-powerful Grace and careful Christian Discipline may restrain it's promptitude from breaking out into Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Outward Actions; yet no Man but feels it too deeply rooted in his Nature to be ever extirpated; so that even the greatest Saints may with grief cry out, <hi>Quis me li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berabit a corpore mortis hujus?</hi> Thus, every Individual Seed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho' it be of the same Kind,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:110692:101"/>
has a peculiar Temperament and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of its own; which tho' we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not discern while we view it <hi>in little;</hi> yet in evidently discovers it self in the Individual Shrub or Tree which springs from it, when <hi>grown up;</hi> in which we may <hi>then</hi> observe thousands of Diversities from other Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duums of the same kind; tho' they be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>same Soyl,</hi> water'd by the <hi>same Rain,</hi> and equally quicken'd and warm'd by the <hi>same Sun:</hi> A certain Argument that all those Varieties amongst such Vegetables, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded intrinsecally in the <hi>Primordial</hi> and <hi>Individual</hi> Constitution and Temperament of <hi>each</hi> of those single Seeds, and did spring thence <hi>Originally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>16. From what's said above 'tis evidently De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated, that there can be no show of Reason, why <hi>Existence</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Existence</hi> can with no shew of Reason be pretended to be the Principle of <hi>Individuation.</hi>
                  </note> should be the <hi>Principle of Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duation.</hi> For, since what's <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> cannot exist; That only which is an <hi>Ens,</hi> or (which is the same) an <hi>Individuum,</hi> can be capable of Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence. Wherefore, there must be conceived <hi>First,</hi> (in Priority of Nature) an <hi>Ens,</hi> Thing or Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duum constituted, e're we can conceive there can be any Subject fit to receive Existence; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently Existence, which presupposes the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduum <hi>Constituted,</hi> cannot be the Principle that <hi>Constitutes</hi> it. Again, since nothing that is <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to more</hi> Individuals (v. g. A Man or Horse is <hi>Common</hi>) cannot exist, but only what is Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That,</hi> (v. g. <hi>This</hi> Individual Man or <hi>this</hi> Horse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) 'tis most evident that the

Matter must be made or Determin'd to be <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That;</hi> that is, it must be constituted such an <hi>Individuum,</hi> ere it can possibly be <hi>Capable to exist.</hi> Wherefore, <hi>Existence</hi> is <hi>Subsequent</hi> to the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the <hi>Individuum,</hi> and, so, cannot be the <hi>Principle</hi> by which it is <hi>constituted.</hi> Lastly, the <hi>Power</hi> does <hi>ex naturâ rei</hi> antecede the <hi>Act;</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it would follow, that <hi>That is which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be;</hi> which is against an Identical Proposition, and a manifest Contradiction. Whence, seeing (as was lately shown) only Individuums, which are <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That</hi> in particular, <hi>can bee,</hi> or have a <hi>Power to bee;</hi> they must first be suppos'd to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd by Natural Causes, ere <hi>Existence,</hi> which is their <hi>Proper Act</hi> can <hi>supervene,</hi> or put them in the state or condition of being Actually, or <hi>Extra causas.</hi> The Literal meaning of which Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical phrase, consonantly to the Doctrine now delivered, is this; that while that Action, call'd the <hi>Determination</hi> of the Potentiality and Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of the Matter, was yet on foot and not compleated or brought to Perfection, the Ens or Individuum was not <hi>as yet</hi> otherwise than <hi>in fieri,</hi> (as the Schools call it) or yet <hi>a doing</hi> or making; that is, <hi>within the Power</hi> of those De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining Causes; but, as soon as that Action is brought to <hi>perfection,</hi> there results thence, as the Ultimate <hi>Terminus</hi> or <hi>End</hi> of that Determination, an <hi>Individuum,</hi> capable to be put <hi>extra Causas,</hi> or put out of Subjection or Dependence on those Natural <hi>Efficients;</hi> which now had done working, having perform'd all that belong'd to them to do. At which very instant the never-failing Goodness of the First Being, gives actually to the Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duum, thus render'd <hi>Capable of Being,</hi> that most

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:110692:104"/>
peculiar to it self, as 'tis Distinct from all other Indiviuums. But the difficulty is how we can ever come to know <hi>That;</hi> those Individuating Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions of the Accidents being so many, and mingled with such a peculiar, accurate and singular Niceness, that, 'tis impossible we should ever come to Know or Comprehend them <hi>exactly</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly.</hi> But, I hope this Difficulty that seems at first sight so Insuperable, will upon Examination appear to be none at all. To clear it then, I lay these few Positions.</p>
               <p>19. First, We may observe, and plain Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will inform our ordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, that (speaking of <hi>Mixts</hi>)<note place="margin">The <hi>First</hi> Rule how to know <hi>this.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>no</hi> Individual of <hi>any Kind,</hi> when it ceases to be, or, is Corrupted, is Chang'd into Another Individuum of the <hi>same Kind,</hi> V. g. No Individual Stone, Tree, Horse, or Man, is thus Chang'd meerly into Another Individual Stone, Tree, Horse or Man: For, were this so, then, indeed, the Difficulty would be Insoluble.</p>
               <p>20. Secondly, Hence follows immediately, that the Individual Nature is never Chang'd <hi>alone,</hi> but the <hi>Specifical</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Second</hi> Rule.</note> Nature always, and oft-times the <hi>Generical</hi> too, is Chang'd <hi>likewise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>21. Thirdly, That 'tis very easie to know the difference between the Primary Operations of such Bodies as<note place="margin">The <hi>Third</hi> Rule.</note> differ <hi>Specifically</hi> or <hi>Generically,</hi> (as is shown above, Ch. 2. and 3.) and thence to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern when the Species or Genus, and, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the Individuum is Chang'd. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why the Change of those <hi>Former,</hi> induces a
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:110692:104"/>
Change in this <hi>Later,</hi> is, Because all the <hi>Superiour</hi> Notions are <hi>Essential</hi> to the <hi>Individuum;</hi> as Logic demonstrates, and Common Sense informs us <hi>Peter</hi> cannot be <hi>This Man,</hi> unless he be a <hi>Man;</hi> nor can <hi>Man</hi> be <hi>this</hi> sort of Animal, (which is Essential to it, or rather part of it's very Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) unless he be an <hi>Animal;</hi> nor can <hi>Animal</hi> be <hi>This</hi> sort of Living Thing, unless it be <hi>Living,</hi> &amp;c. Whence follows, that whenever the <hi>Individuum</hi> is render'd Incapable of performing the Primary Operation of it's <hi>Species</hi> or <hi>Genus</hi> under which it is rankt, the Individuality is <hi>a fortiori</hi> perisht and Chang'd. For, every Individuum is nothing but <hi>One</hi> of that Kind, or Higher Notion, under which 'tis comprehended: And, how can it be said to be <hi>One of that Kind,</hi> when <hi>that Kind it self</hi> (as far as concerns <hi>it</hi>) is Chang'd and Gone!</p>
               <p>22. Hence, neither the Specifick Nature, nor the Individuation of Vegetables or Animals is lost, when a Branch<note place="margin">Hence every Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Division of the <hi>Matter</hi> in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Things, changes not the Individuation.</note> or a Limb is cut off; provided that Mixture and Organization of Parts be not destroy'd which enables them to <hi>Digest</hi> the Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Juice or Aliment, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to <hi>preserve the Compound,</hi> which is it's Primary Operation.</p>
               <p>23. Hence the Individuality of Man, as Man, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ot Chang'd, whatever Limbs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:110692:105"/>24. Hence the Individuality of a <hi>Simple</hi> Body or Element (if there be any such <hi>now</hi>) would be alter'd, if the Degree of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity<note place="margin">When the Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duation is lost in Simple Bodies.</note> and Density be so notably chang'd, that a vastly different Operation follows from it; and that the Subject which is thought to succeed, does enjoy that Degree, not meerly successively, or <hi>in transitu,</hi> but with some kind of <hi>Constancy,</hi> or for some time; so that it will not be immediately reduced to it's former state by Natural Causes. For, in this case, that Degree alters the <hi>Species</hi> it self of the <hi>Simple Body,</hi> (as is shown, Ch. 2. §. 21.) and, consequently, the <hi>Individuation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>25. Hence the Individuality of <hi>First-Mixt</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies is lost, when they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd into <hi>Simple</hi> Bodies; because<note place="margin">When in <hi>First-Mixt</hi> Bodies.</note> this changes the <hi>Specifick</hi> Nature of a Mixt. <hi>See</hi> Ch: 3. §. 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>26. Hence, <hi>Demixts</hi> are Individually Chang'd when the Proportion of the First-Mixts is alter'd to a high Degree,<note place="margin">When in <hi>Demixts.</hi>
                  </note> and continues so with some Constancy. <hi>See</hi> Ch. 3. §. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>27. Simple Division, if perfectly such, takes away the Individual Unity in <hi>Homogeneous</hi> Bodies. For, since<note place="margin">When in <hi>Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous</hi> Bodies.</note> to <hi>Divide</hi> is to make <hi>more of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:110692:105"/>
takes away the <hi>Individual Unity.</hi> Again, since neither part of the Divided Body is by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision annihilated; each of them, after Division <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>28. Yet meer Division does not necessarily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Divided</hi> Individuum, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially, if it be very <hi>Heterogeneous</hi>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:110692:115"/>
we must have Diverse Conceptions of those <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> themselves: that is, we can find somewhat in such Operations that is <hi>Proper</hi> or Peculiar to <hi>One</hi> of those Natures, and <hi>not Proper</hi> or Peculiar to the <hi>Other.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>3. If we can find by Evident Reflexion, that there is somewhat in the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which Man has according<note place="margin">That we must exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, whether there be anything in Man, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his <hi>Soul,</hi> which is above Quantity or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> his <hi>Soul</hi> that is <hi>above</hi> the Nature of <hi>Matter;</hi> or, above <hi>Quantity,</hi> which is the Common Affection of all <hi>Corporeal</hi> Nature; and, therefore, that is <hi>Indivisible,</hi> or (which is the same) <hi>Indissoluble</hi> or <hi>Incorruptible;</hi> it must follow demonstratively, that then, that Part of Man call'd his <hi>Soul,</hi> is Immaterial, Incorruptible, or <hi>Immortal.</hi> In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Demonstrate which, we proceed with our Preliminaries.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Preliminary</hi> III. There are <hi>Three</hi> Distinct O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of Man according to his Soul, as 'tis <hi>Intellective</hi> or<note place="margin">That there are Three Distinct Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Man</hi> as he is <hi>Intellective.</hi>

                  <hi>Knowing;</hi> viz. <hi>Simple Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Iudging,</hi> and <hi>Discoursing.</hi> This I think, is granted by all, and is easily prov'd. For, we must first, <hi>Lay hold</hi> of that which we are to <hi>work upon;</hi> or <hi>take into</hi> out Mind that of which we are to <hi>Iudge</hi> or <hi>Discourse,</hi> (that is, have a <hi>Notion</hi> of it); for, otherwise, we should <hi>Iudge</hi> and <hi>Discourse</hi> of <hi>we know not what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Wherefore that Operation call'd <hi>Simple Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or the <hi>having</hi> the Notion of the Thing <hi>in</hi> our Mind, is clearly <hi>Antecedent</hi> to the other Two;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:110692:115"/>
and, consequently, <hi>Distinct</hi> from them. Again, [<hi>Discoursing</hi>] does clearly presuppose some <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> already had, and Assented to, ere we can <hi>Deduce</hi> any thing out of them by <hi>Discourse;</hi> since we must necessarily <hi>Iudge</hi> our Premisses <hi>True,</hi> ere we can hope to <hi>derive</hi> their Truth to <hi>another</hi> Proposition, or <hi>Deduce</hi> any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of them by our Reason; which manifests a perfect Distinction between the Operations of <hi>Discoursing</hi> and <hi>Iudging.</hi> 'Tis therefore Evident, that there are Three Distinct Operations of Man according to that Part call'd the <hi>Soul,</hi> as 'tis <hi>Intellective</hi> or <hi>Knowing;</hi> call'd <hi>Simple Apprehension, Iudging</hi> and <hi>Discoursing.</hi>

               <p>5. <hi>Preliminary</hi> IV. The Notion of (Created) <hi>Ens</hi> or <hi>Thing</hi> Abstracts from, or is <hi>Indifferent</hi> to <hi>Existence</hi> and <hi>Non-Existence;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Notion of <hi>[Ens]</hi> or <hi>[Thing]</hi> is Indifferent to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual <hi>Being,</hi> or <hi>Not-Being.</hi>

The <hi>Form</hi> cannot be in the <hi>Subject,</hi> but it must make it For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally of his <hi>own</hi> Nature: V. g.<note place="margin">Every <hi>Form</hi> that is in any Subject, must denominate it to be <hi>formally</hi> such as it self is.</note> 
                  <hi>Rotundity</hi> cannot be in any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but it must make it <hi>Round;</hi> Nor can any Quantity or Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, v. g. the Quantity of a <hi>Yard,</hi> or <hi>Whiteness,</hi> be in a Thing, but they must make it <hi>a Yard long,</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> as the Nature of that Quantity and Colour is. This is Self-evident; for to be <hi>a Yard long</hi> or <hi>White,</hi> is to have such a <hi>Length</hi> or <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Colour</hi> in it. Nor, for the same reason can any particular <hi>Nature</hi> be in any Thing, but it must make that Thing be of <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. <hi>Preliminary</hi> VI. A <hi>Notion</hi> or <hi>Conception</hi> may either be consider'd <hi>Subjectively;</hi> as it is an <hi>Operation</hi> of the Mind,<note place="margin">A <hi>Notion</hi> may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be consider'd <hi>Subjectively,</hi> or <hi>Objectively.</hi>

For, an <hi>Operation</hi> of a <hi>Knowing</hi> Power cannot <hi>be,</hi> but there must be something <hi>Known;</hi> nor can a Thing be <hi>known</hi> without an <hi>Actual Knowledge</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Preliminary</hi> VII. Whatever is <hi>Known</hi> by the Soul, or is the <hi>Object</hi> of our Knowledge, must either <hi>it self</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Every Object of our Knowledge must either be the Thing <hi>it self,</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in the Mind, or something that is <hi>like it.</hi>
                  </note> be in the Soul, or else some <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude</hi> or Representation of it. This also is in a manner Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident. For, in case neither <hi>It self,</hi> nor any thing <hi>Like it</hi> be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:110692:116"/>
                  <hi>there</hi> when we know it, 'tis Impossible to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any reason why our Knowledge should be of <hi>It</hi> rather than of <hi>Another</hi> thing Distinct from i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; which must necessarily <hi>confound</hi> all our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges whatever. Again, since the <hi>Power</hi> of Knowing is of it self <hi>Indifferent</hi> to the Knowing <hi>This</hi> or <hi>Another;</hi> 'tis Impossible to conceive how this <hi>Indifferent Power</hi> should be Determin'd to Know <hi>This</hi> rather than <hi>Another,</hi> unless either <hi>This</hi> Object be <hi>it self</hi> in that Knowing Power, that is, in the <hi>Mind;</hi> or something that <hi>Resembles</hi> or Represents it.</p>
               <p>9. <hi>Preliminary</hi> VIII. <hi>Notions</hi> taken <hi>Objectively,</hi> are the <hi>Things themselves,</hi> existing in our Mind intellectually, and<note place="margin">That Notions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drrstood <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively,</hi> are the Things <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> as in the Mind; and not meer <hi>Similitudes</hi> of them; Prov'd <hi>unanswerably.</hi>
                  </note> not the <hi>Similitude,</hi> or Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them only. This may be presum'd to be an <hi>Establisht Maxim,</hi> having been prov'd by so many Demonstrations in my Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Preliminary in <hi>Solid Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy Asserted,</hi> none of which have been hitherto Answer'd by the modern <hi>Ideists,</hi> tho' nothing more nearly concern'd them. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, I shall add this farther Proof of it. <hi>Words</hi> are meant to express <hi>that</hi> which is <hi>in</hi> our Mind; that is, to express our <hi>Conceptions</hi> or <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> taken <hi>Objectively,</hi> which therefore (thus taken) are the <hi>Thing meant.</hi> But that which is <hi>meant</hi> by the Words, <hi>is the Thing it self;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which is <hi>in</hi> our Notion, or the <hi>Object</hi> of it, is the <hi>Thing it self.</hi> To prove the <hi>Minor,</hi> let us put this Proposition, [There is a <hi>Similitude of the Thing it self in our Mind;</hi>] and then reflect, that since we understand what's <hi>meant</hi> by <hi>all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:110692:117"/>
words, we have a Notion of each of those Words in our Minds. Hence I argue; Therefore there is in our Notion not only what's meant by the word <hi>Similitude</hi>], but also what's meant by the words, [<hi>the thing it self;</hi>] for those words are <hi>Parts</hi> of the Proposition. But what is <hi>meant</hi> by the words [<hi>the Thing it self</hi>] cannot be any other but the <hi>very Thing</hi> conceived by us; therefore <hi>the very Thing</hi> is in our Notion or Conception when we intelligently speak that Proposition. This is farther enforced, because in this Proposition, what's meant by the words [<hi>the Thing it self</hi>] is Relatively <hi>Oppos'd</hi> to the <hi>Similitude</hi> or <hi>Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Thing, as is evident to every Reflecter: Therefore, what's meant by the words [<hi>the Thing it self</hi>] cannot possibly be the <hi>same</hi> that is meant by the word [<hi>Similitude</hi>], which is formally <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite</hi> to it. Whence those who <hi>deny</hi> the Thing is in our Minds, do at the same time unawares, <hi>confess</hi> it <hi>is there;</hi> since they put what's meant by [<hi>Thing it self,</hi>] over and above what's meant by the word [<hi>Similitude</hi>] to be there. Nor were these words [<hi>The Thing it self</hi>] ever us'd by Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, (especially when they speak Dogmatically) to signifie <hi>A Similitude of the Thing.</hi> Lastly, If we have only <hi>Similitudes</hi> of what's meant by our Words; then since, (as they will have it) the Words [<hi>Thing it self</hi>] signifie only a <hi>Similitude</hi> of the <hi>Thing;</hi> by the same reason, the Word [<hi>Similitude</hi>], which is found also in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, must mean a <hi>Similitude of a Similitude;</hi> of which who can make any Sense?</p>

Hence we may collect, that that Saying, [<hi>Every</hi> Like <hi>is not the</hi> Same], is only True when the<note place="margin">In what Sense, <hi>[E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very [Like] is not the Same,]</hi> is verify'd.</note> Things are not <hi>perfectly Alike,</hi> but are <hi>Unlike</hi> to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one another in some <hi>Other</hi> Respect or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration; and that it cannot be meant that they are not the <hi>Same</hi> under <hi>that</hi> Respect in which they are <hi>perfectly Alike;</hi> this being, as was shown, contrary to the Sentiment and Language of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:110692:118"/>
Now, 'tis impossible, that being (as is granted) <hi>Alike,</hi> they should not be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Alike</hi> when we speak of them (as we here do) according to some <hi>One precise</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect; Every Respect or Notion we have being <hi>Indivisible,</hi> and shut up concisely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it's own Bounds; so that it cannot admit any <hi>Unlikeness</hi> in <hi>Another</hi> Respect, every <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate</hi> Notion (as ours are) being but <hi>one single Respect</hi> of the Thing. Wherefore the Meaning of that Saying is generally this, that it does not follow they are the same <hi>Thing,</hi> or the same according to the Notion of <hi>Thing,</hi> because they are Alike according to the Respect or Notion of some <hi>Mode</hi> or <hi>Accident,</hi> which is <hi>not</hi> the Notion of <hi>Thing,</hi> but <hi>Another;</hi> which we easily grant without the least prejudice to our Argument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which proceeds upon <hi>Likeness</hi> in <hi>such</hi> a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:110692:119"/>
that Part <hi>Distinctly,</hi> as the Peculiar Object of our Inadequate Conception of it. In the same manner, as when we see or touch <hi>One part</hi> of a Man, v. g. his Face or Hand, we truly say we see or touch <hi>that Man,</hi> or <hi>Him;</hi> which words signifie the <hi>Whole Man.</hi> For, since the word [<hi>Part</hi>] must mean a Part of <hi>Something,</hi> that is of the <hi>Whole</hi> to which it relates; [<hi>A Part of the Whole,</hi>] signifies the same as [<hi>The Whole in Part.</hi>] Again, since (as was demonstrated, Ch. 1. §. 27.) there are no <hi>Actual Parts</hi> in any Compound what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and, therefore, all Operations of our <hi>Minds,</hi> as well as all Actions and Passions in Nature, are of the <hi>Suppositum,</hi> or Subject, and exercis'd upon <hi>other Suppositums,</hi> or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, when we <hi>know</hi> them: Hence, to know <hi>some Part</hi> of the Thing is to Know the <hi>Whole</hi> Thing <hi>Materially,</hi> tho' it be only <hi>one</hi> Part of it <hi>Formally, Expressly,</hi> and <hi>Distinctly.</hi> Whence is seen how <hi>Solid</hi> our Way of Philosophizing is; being entirely built on the <hi>Thing it self,</hi> whose Essence is Establisht by the <hi>First Being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and not on any Fantastick <hi>Similitude</hi> of it, Elicited by our Soul, or coyn'd by our Fancy.</p>
               <p>13. It were not amiss for the more perfect Satisfaction of every Reader, who is even of an ordinary Capacity<note place="margin">A Third Unanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Proof, that the <hi>Thing it self</hi> must be in our Mind when we <hi>know</hi> it.</note> to <hi>borrow</hi> here one of those De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations from my Second Preliminary aforesaid, it being at once Clearly <hi>Convictive</hi> and very <hi>Easie.</hi> 'Tis this, [We can never know the Thing certainly by a Resemblance

The <hi>Thing it self</hi> then must be in our Mind, to be <hi>there</hi> Compar'd with the <hi>Resemblance</hi> of it; or otherwise, the <hi>Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance</hi> or Similitude can never be known to be <hi>

               </p>
               <p>I am to expect it will be apprehended and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that I much wrong my Cause by putting so much stress upon the Thing's being <hi>really</hi> in the Understanding as an Object, it being so <hi>hard</hi> to be <hi>conceiv'd,</hi> or unlikely to be <hi>granted</hi> but by a very few. To which I Answer:</p>
               <p>14. First, That this Tenet is the <hi>Basis</hi> of all Philosophy in the World that is <hi>Solid,</hi> and that, besides my many<note place="margin">The Author's Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why he builds upon this Thesis, that the <hi>Thing it self</hi> is in the Soul when she <hi>knows</hi> it.</note> Demonstrations in the place late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cited, and some <hi>here</hi> also, which evince it, innumerable others may be added to make good that <hi>Thesis;</hi> divers of which may perhaps occur hereafter. The Reasons why many Witty Men are so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd against this Tenet, are chiefly <hi>Three.</hi>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:110692:120"/>
First, Because they do not distinguish between those different Questions [<hi>An est</hi>], and [<hi>Quid</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> [<hi>Quomodo est.</hi>] And thence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot comprehend<note place="margin">The Reasons why some others are backward to As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to it.</note> what the <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>Spiritual O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration</hi> is, or conceive <hi>How</hi> this is done; they will needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it is <hi>not done</hi> at all, or <hi>cannot be done.</hi> But how void of Common Reason this Inference is, is obvious to every Ordinary Reflecter. When we see a Thing a-far off, we know, <hi>that it is,</hi> tho' we know not yet <hi>What is is.</hi> The Rudest Vulgar knows <hi>That there are</hi> Sun, Moon, and Stars; but they are utterly Ignorant <hi>What they are.</hi> Again, We All of us know most certainly, that the Loadstone attracts Iron; and that we move our Hands and Feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but very <hi>Few</hi> of these All do perfectly comprehend <hi>How</hi> this is done. Now, 'tis only the [<hi>An est</hi>] of the Things being in our Mind, or [<hi>That it is there</hi>] which is in Question here; for 'tis <hi>only this</hi> which we strive to evince, and not the [<hi>Quid est</hi>] of that Spiritual Operation, or <hi>How</hi> this is perform'd; which perhaps is beyond any Man's Skill in this State. The Second Reason is, Because they do not distinguish between the Indivisible or <hi>Spiritual Manner</hi> of Existing which Things have <hi>in the Soul</hi> and the <hi>Proper Manner</hi> of Existing they have <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> themselves,</hi> as they are <hi>out of it:</hi> Whereas, (by §. 5.) what's meant by the word [Thing], or the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, <hi>abstracts</hi> from <hi>both,</hi> is <hi>Indifferent</hi> to <hi>both,</hi> and consequently, <hi>can have both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> or <hi>either</hi> of them. And, 'tis also Evident hence, that 'tis granted by all who hold a First Being, that the Essences of all things, (and amongst them, of Bodies) and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:110692:120"/>
consequently those <hi>Things themselves,</hi> were, and are in the Divine Intellect after a <hi>Spiritual Manner;</hi> and yet they exist <hi>in themselves</hi> after a Manner quite <hi>Different</hi> from the Other. Whence, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only asserted by us, that they <hi>are</hi> in our Mind after a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Manner, their Objection is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded on their <hi>Confounding</hi> those two <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> of Being, which are most Vastly, and indeed Contradictorily <hi>Different.</hi> Nor have they any way to confute our Assertion but by Producing some Metaphysical Arguments to evince that <hi>Things</hi> cannot possibly have <hi>two such Manners</hi> of Being; which we are confident they can never do. On the contrary, we cannot but judge we have Unanswerably Demonstrated our Affirmative, that they <hi>can have</hi> such Different Manners of Existing, and <hi>Actually have</hi> them. The Third Reason of their Dissatisfaction is, That such Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecters do not guide their Thoughts by regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Connexion of Terms</hi> in Propositions or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses; in which, and by which only, Truth is Clearly and Certainly to be found; but by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomary. Impressions on the Fancy, begetting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s Phantasms there; which being taken from <hi>Material</hi> or <hi>Corporeal</hi> Objects, must needs be very Unsutable to <hi>Spiritual Operations;</hi> nor, consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can they any more enable us to judge of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Natures, unassisted by Reflexion and <hi>Reason</hi> connecting our Notions, than a Blind Man is able to judge of Colours. Let then these Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen correct their Thoughts as to these Three Faults, and they will quickly see what a puzzle they will be at to frame any Objection against this <hi>Thesis</hi> that will hang together; and, on the other side, what a struggle it will cost them to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:110692:121"/>
                  <hi>solve,</hi> with any show of Reason, the Connexion of the Terms which gives force to those Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations that pretend to evince this Great and most important Truth.</p>
               <p>15. My Second Answer to those who dislike my making use of, and relying upon,<note place="margin">Notwithstanding, the Immortality of the Soul may be Evinced, tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Knowledge must necessarily be perform'd by <hi>one</hi> of those ways or by the <hi>other,</hi> it will far more conduce to the Evincing this Main and Fundamental Point, by showing that my Demonstrations <hi>do conclude,</hi> which soever of these Hypotheses my Readers hap to embrace.

what can there be in <hi>Matter</hi> that can <hi>resemble</hi> a <hi>Yard,</hi> after the manner we find in Material or Corporeal things, unless it self be, some way or other, a <hi>Yard Long.</hi> It must be some sort of <hi>Quantity</hi> that can do this; for otherwise it is quite <hi>Different</hi> from it, and so can <hi>no way resemble</hi> it; and, if it be some <hi>Quantity,</hi> and yet it self be not a <hi>Yard Long,</hi> it must necessarily be either <hi>more</hi> than a Yard, or <hi>less</hi> than a Yard: And how can that which is <hi>more than a Yard</hi> or <hi>less than a Yard,</hi> represent this precise and distinct Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of a <hi>Yard;</hi> which would not be <hi>it self,</hi> were it never so little either <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> than it is.

I remember I prest this Demonstration in the year 1658. against a very Civil and Ingenious Gentleman, who was a Scholar of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s; he reply'd, that the least Quantity imaginable might represent the greatest; instancing in the <hi>Scale of Miles</hi> in <hi>Maps.</hi> I answer'd, that 'ere we can say, [This very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Quantity shall stand for a very Great one,] or, <hi>This Inch shall stand for Five or Ten Miles,</hi> we must have the exact and full Notions of <hi>Inch</hi> and <hi>Mile,</hi> in our Minds <hi>antecedently;</hi> otherwise we could never proportion them; nor could we even understand what <hi>The Scale of Miles</hi> meant, if we had not in our Understanding what is meant by the word [<hi>Mile,</hi>] that is, a <hi>Real Mile;</hi> for, (as is here prov'd) even the <hi>Similitudes</hi> of a Mile must be such.

the other. And, let it be noted, that this Union is not made, as <hi>Universal</hi> Notions are, by <hi>Abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> or our leaving out the <hi>Particular</hi> Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions belonging to the <hi>Species</hi> or Inferiour No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and only taking in one <hi>Common</hi> Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration found in them all, there being a fair <hi>Ground</hi> in Nature to consider them on that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion; But this Colligation of many into <hi>One Number</hi> is a kind of <hi>Union</hi> of those <hi>whole Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duums</hi> in despite of the <hi>multitude</hi> of their Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities; and a Reducing those Things which are ultimately Determin'd, Distinct and stand aloof from one another, as they are in Material Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to a <hi>Close Unity;</hi> compacted so <hi>Indivisibly</hi> and <hi>Indissolubly,</hi> that the least part added or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, that Unity is specifically <hi>alter'd,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently becomes <hi>another</hi> kind of Number. Lastly, which makes this Point yet more Evident; We can have a Material Resemblance in our <hi>Fancy</hi> of Four, Five, or some small number of Natural Things; and have in our Heads a kind of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi> of them (as it were) standing <hi>all on a Row.</hi> But 'tis impossible for us to have such a Lively, and exactly-Just <hi>Picture</hi> of a Hundred, a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, a Million, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so as to see clearly there is not <hi>one</hi> more or less; and yet we experience that we can have <hi>most Clear, Distinct,</hi> and <hi>Exact Notions</hi> of These, as well as we can have of Two or Three; Nor do we look upon those Great Numbers by the Eye of our Understanding, as a <hi>Confused Heap</hi> or <hi>Multitude,</hi> as it happens when we see a great Croud of Men standing together; but with a clear and perfect Discernment that they are <hi>just so many,</hi> not <hi>one</hi> more or less; and this as easily as we can know Four or Five.

Since then, in the way of <hi>Matter,</hi> nothing can resemble a Thousand but a <hi>Thousand,</hi> (for the Resembler must be <hi>some</hi> sort of Number, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it is not at all <hi>Like</hi> it; and, neither <hi>One more</hi> nor <hi>less;</hi> that it is must it self be a <hi>Thousand</hi>) it follows, that the Distinct and Exact Notions we have of very great Numbers, is <hi>Immaterial;</hi> and, consequently, the Soul, their Subject, is <hi>such</hi> also.</p>

Whatever it be, it must be some other <hi>Sensible Quality;</hi> for, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, it would be <hi>utterly Unlike</hi> it; and the same would happen, were it a Sensible Quality belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to some <hi>other</hi> Sense than that of the <hi>Touch,</hi> v. g. were it <hi>Whiteness</hi> or <hi>Fragrancy,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Smell.</hi> 'Tis Evident then, that nothing but Dryness it self can represent Dryness <hi>materially.</hi> Wherefore, it must either be said, that Dryness it self is in the Soul Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially,

We have Notions in our Minds of Indivisibles, of Negations, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, of Non-Ens, of Chimera's, of Chrystal Mountains, a Golden Earth, and innumerable such, which we can frame to our selves at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. We are most Certain, all these are in our Minds, as <hi>Objects</hi> of our Simple Apprehensions because we know, and have <hi>in us</hi> the <hi>Meanings</hi> of those Words which signifie them; as also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we can, by our <hi>Iudgment, admit</hi> some of them as <hi>Possible,</hi> and <hi>reject</hi> others as <hi>Impossible;</hi> which we could not do, unless we had the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

Therefore this Distinct Being they have in our <hi>Mind,</hi> as Objects of our Simple Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, is most incontestably <hi>Immaterial;</hi> and therefore their Subject, the <hi>Soul,</hi> is <hi>such</hi> also.</p>
               <p>To clear the Meaning of some Words we have us'd, and to meet with some Objections, I thought fit to subjoyn these following Notes.</p>
               <p>26. <hi>Note</hi> I. I fear that when we say, the Soul is of an <hi>Indivisible</hi> Nature, some Readers who are not well vers'd in Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks, should be apt to apprehend<note place="margin">How some do mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake the Nature of the <hi>Indivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> attributed to the Soul.</note> that we take the word [<hi>Indivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>] in a <hi>Mathematical</hi> Sense, and mean she is Indivisible as a <hi>Point</hi> is; or so little, that there is not Space enough for the least possible Divider to come between the Parts of it, and, so Divide it: And hence they may imagine it Inconceiveable, that all these several Notions or Natures of things which are in our Knowledge, and so many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Operations should all be Compriz'd and Transacted in so narrow a room as is a <hi>Point,</hi> or a <hi>Quantitative Indivisible.</hi> But the thing is <hi>quite otherwise.</hi> Those kind of Indivisibles, call'd
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:110692:136"/>
                  <hi>Points,</hi> and such like, have no <hi>Positive</hi> Being in Nature; but, because we must conceive a Finite Line, whose every Part (it being some Quantity) is <hi>Divisible,</hi> has an <hi>End;</hi> hence, this <hi>End,</hi> or (as we may call it) <hi>No-fartherness</hi> of Quantity is <hi>no Quantity,</hi> and therefore (Quantity being Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility) it is <hi>not Quantitative,</hi> nor <hi>Divisible,</hi> but <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible.</hi> Now, those <hi>Ends</hi> or <hi>Not-Beings</hi> of Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity we call <hi>Points</hi> or <hi>Surfaces,</hi> according to the Respective Quantities which they are conceiv'd to <hi>terminate.</hi> So likewise <hi>Continuative</hi> Indivisibles, which some do imagine in Quantity, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them to be in the <hi>midst</hi> of all Quantitative Beings, can mean no more in any good Sense, but that, let us divide any Continu'd Quantity where we please; the <hi>Parts,</hi> when Divided, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming so many <hi>Wholes,</hi> will, for the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, be each of them <hi>Terminated,</hi> as that <hi>Greater Whole</hi> was; Whence some conceit, that <hi>these</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult, as it were, from that Division; only they change their Office, and are become <hi>Terminative</hi> now, whereas they were before <hi>Continuative;</hi> and that they were <hi>potentially</hi> in that Former Whole before, and are only of late <hi>Discluded.</hi> For, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we call this sort of Quantity <hi>Continu'd,</hi> it being the Genius of such Mis-Speculaters, whenever they are at a plunge, to invent some New Entity to do the Job, they cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how Quantitative Parts should <hi>cohere,</hi> but by this Cement of <hi>Continuative</hi> Indivisibles.

And this Tormenting Grief is enhanced by the Intenseness and Vehemency of her Acts, when she is a Pure Spirit; with which the greatest and most violent Grief in this life bears no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.

               <p>28.

                  <hi>perfect</hi> Deliberation, of which the Man dies <hi>Unrepentant,</hi> will make the Soul miscarry eternally; such as are Self-Murther, being kill'd in a Duel for a <hi>Puntilio,</hi> and such like.</p>
               <p>30. It may be said, that the Knowledge of <hi>all</hi> Truths will rectifie and alter the Soul as soon as she is separated,<note place="margin">That the State of Separation does not alter the <hi>First Affection</hi> of Souls, farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated.</note> in regard that she sees <hi>then</hi> clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Vileness</hi> and <hi>Perniciousness</hi> of placing her Affection on a wrong Last End. 'Tis Answer'd: First, That the Soul, as soon as Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:110692:158"/>
knows all Truths only <hi>Speculatively;</hi> but that the Practical Judgments or Affections which had prepossest her, (as has been prov'd, §. 17.) do more sway with her than all her Speculative Knowledge; which her <hi>Choice</hi> did not <hi>give</hi> her, but <hi>Nature forced</hi> into her. Secondly, There could be no Cause which was Competent to alter her: Not her <hi>Separation;</hi> For the whole Effect of that Action is to <hi>Divide</hi> the Potential Parts of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound; that is, to take from them the State of Potentiality, and make them (if they can exist separate) <hi>Actual Wholes;</hi> Actual Parts, as it has been demonstrated, being Impossible. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Death,</hi> being only the <hi>Separation</hi> of the Soul and Body, terminates it's Agency in making them Two of One, and has no Influence upon <hi>changing</hi> them. Nor does their State of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or their remaining or becoming Separate, alter their Natures or their Modes; for this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the Soul's existing now <hi>A Pure Act;</hi> which has nothing to do with taking away what she had; but only, taking her as it found her, to <hi>elevate</hi> her, such as she was, and, consequently, those Knowledges and Affections she actually had, to a higher Perfection in the Line of <hi>Ens,</hi> or to give her to <hi>exist</hi> after a Nobler manner than she did formerly. Lastly, Were this so, the Order of the World would be quite perverted; for, in that case, the Wickedest Livers would have equal Priviledge and Benefit in the next world, as the greatest Saints; since, each of them, (as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppos'd to our question) knowing all things as soon as Separated, their Wickedness would be corrected, and effaced; which takes away all the dread of <hi>Hell,</hi> evacuates all the Motives to good
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:110692:158"/>
Life, and even destroys the Notion of <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice, Punishment</hi> and <hi>Reward;</hi> and, consequently, GOD's Attribute of Justice.</p>
               <p>31. <hi>Corollary</hi> XII. Hence is seen, that Sin does not consist meerly in the<note place="margin">Hence Sin does not formally <hi>consist</hi> in the Falsity of the Practical Iudgment or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; but, in the Disproportion and Inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it:</note> 
                  <hi>Falshood</hi> of our <hi>Speculative</hi> Judgments, but in the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion</hi> of our <hi>Practical</hi> Judgments or <hi>Affections</hi> for a Temporary Good, <hi>above</hi> the Degree of Affection it has for Eternal Goods. For, it may be a <hi>Truth,</hi> that the Objects of Sin were Agreeable to the Man in this Mortal State, especially taking him as thus circumstanced, which made him <hi>apply</hi> his Thoughts <hi>only</hi> to them; and by that means he came to <hi>conceit</hi> strongly the Good he found in them; and so by oft-repeated Acts he came to beget in his Soul (Unatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Unapply'd to other Goods which were incomparably Greater) <hi>vast Practical Iudgments,</hi> impelling him to act for them, and pursue them; or, which is the same, by a long Converse with them, he got a strong Addiction to them, and most ardent Affection for them: But the reason why he came to fall into such Pernicious Sin, was because he did not to the same degree ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his Thoughts to <hi>Eternal</hi> Goods, nor so carefully and studiously consider the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Excellency of <hi>them,</hi> as he did the <hi>Trifling</hi> Good of the <hi>others.</hi> Which had he done, (as he ought) it would have bred in him such solidly-grounded and <hi>strong Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:110692:159"/>
and Affections for <hi>Heaven,</hi> that it would have <hi>corrected</hi> (either wholly or to a high degree) the Affections to Creatures. The <hi>Falshood</hi> then which may have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd the Practical Judgments of a Sinful Soul, will be corrected in the State of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; because she knows then all Created Truths; and Truth and Falshood, (they being Contradictions, and therefore oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the Notion of Being, the only Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Understanding) cannot consist together in an Intellectual Substance; but the <hi>Predominancy</hi> or <hi>over-proportion</hi> of the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Judgment or <hi>Affection</hi> to Creatures; (whether it proceed from Falshood, or, as it does generally, and perhaps always from a more frequent and more hearty <hi>Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Soul to Creatures,) does, and must, <hi>ever</hi> remain in her; and withall the consequent Sad Effects mention'd, in case the Man dies with those Bad prevalent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>Unretracted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>32. Hence all those Knowledges, whether Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical, Moral, Mathematical, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical, Theological, or of<note place="margin">From the former Principles it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that all those several Kinds of <hi>Knowledges</hi> we had <hi>here,</hi> will be Elevated to an Unmeasurable Excess in the State of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> what kind soever they be, in which the Man had particularly cultivated his Soul here, will, in the State of Separation, be Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to a very Deep, or Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable <hi>Penetration</hi> of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of those Sciences in the State of Separation; whence a peculiar Accidental Satisfaction is, by the Design of Nature, apt to accrue to

the First and Immediate Effect produced by <hi>GOD</hi> is <hi>Existence,</hi> it being the most perfect of any thing found in Creatures.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whatever <hi>less perfect</hi> Effect is produced by <hi>GOD,</hi> (as <hi>Motion</hi> is) it must either have been caus'd by him, because it is necessarily <hi>concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant</hi> to Existence, or else necessarily <hi>consequent</hi> to it: But <hi>Motion</hi> is neither necessarily Concomitant nor Consequent to Existence: For, let us put diverse Bodies to be Created <hi>in Rest,</hi> (as they must be in the First Instant they were Created, ere Motion began) they would have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that Case, <hi>all</hi> that is <hi>requisite</hi> to Existence; nor would <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> follow meerly upon their being put to <hi>Exist.</hi> Therefore, some <hi>other</hi> Cause is requisite to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the <hi>First Motion</hi> of Bodies. Which since it can neither be a <hi>Body,</hi> as is granted, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in a manner Self-evident; nor <hi>GOD,</hi> as was now proved; nor a <hi>Separated Soul,</hi> for this <hi>presupposes</hi> the Motion of <hi>Bodies</hi> to her Being; it must be some <hi>other</hi> Cause distinct from all these: But no <hi>other</hi> Cause is imaginable or possible to be assign'd, but some Creature which is a <hi>Pure Act,</hi> or an <hi>Angel.</hi> Therefore, as certain as it is, that there <hi>is Motion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> so certain it is that <hi>Angels</hi> are. Nay, so impossible it is, that Motion can be Concomitant to the First Existence of Bodies,

               <p>5. This is farther Demonstrated from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Causality, by this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. No Effect can proceed<note place="margin">As is also Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated from the Nature of all <hi>Causality.</hi>

               <p>6. Every <hi>more perfect Ens</hi> contains or includes in it the Nature of the <hi>less per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> Thus, (as was said) the<note place="margin">Every <hi>more</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Ens</hi> includes in it the Nature of the <hi>less</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</note> Nature of a <hi>Mixt</hi> or <hi>Compound</hi> Body (having <hi>diverse</hi> Elements in it; and therefore having <hi>more</hi> of the Nature of <hi>Body</hi> than a <hi>Simple</hi> Body, or any <hi>one</hi> Element has) includes in it the Nature or Essence of a <hi>Simple</hi> Body. Thus, and for the same reason, a <hi>Vegetative</hi> Mixt, has <hi>more</hi> of the Nature of a Mixt in it, than a <hi>meerly-Mixt,</hi> such as are Pebbles, Clay, Gold, or such like.

So that to deny the force of this Demonstration, or the Truth it demonstrates, is the same Folly as to deny, that what has <hi>more</hi> in it of <hi>any Kind</hi> does not contain in it what's <hi>Less</hi> of the <hi>same</hi> Kind; or that, what's a <hi>Whole</hi> (in respect of the other) <hi>is not more than a Part of it,</hi> or, (which is the same) that a <hi>Whole</hi> does not <hi>contain</hi> or <hi>include</hi> it's <hi>Parts.</hi> And that they include them <hi>Essentsally,</hi> is most Evident to all Logicians, and granted by

               </p>
               <p>7. Wherefore, for the same Reason, Every <hi>Pure Act, Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Angel,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in it self, one way or<note place="margin">And therefore <hi>Pure Acts</hi> contain in them the Nature of <hi>Body.</hi>

The Later, by <hi>Notions,</hi> caus'd at first by Impressions on the Senses, and improv'd into <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>Discourses.</hi> The Former, by Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, not <hi>Acquir'd,</hi> but <hi>Innate.</hi> The First and Immediate Objects of both of them is <hi>Themselves</hi> or their own Essence: Whence a <hi>Soul,</hi> in regard it's <hi>Body</hi> (and, consequently, the Determination of the Degree of Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality it had) <hi>grew,</hi> as it were, out of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Causes; knows all things, as <hi>first</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with <hi>her self, then</hi> with one another in the well-linkt Chain of those Causes; in which there can be no Flaw or Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But an Angel knows all Things, by Transcending from one <hi>Ens</hi> or one <hi>Degree</hi> of Entity to another, and this <hi>Intuitively;</hi> that is, an Angel by knowing it self, knows what place it bears in the <hi>Order</hi> of Angels or Spirits: And, since it could not know it's own particular pitch or Individuality, but by knowing how <hi>high</hi> or <hi>low</hi> it is in the <hi>Order</hi> of Angelical Beings; nor could <hi>this</hi> be known but by knowing the <hi>whole</hi> Order, because in an Order which is contriv'd after the <hi>best</hi> manner, each part is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in exact Symmetry to the rest: Hence, the Knowledge of that <hi>whole</hi> Order, and consequently of each part of it, or each

Entity in the whole Creation, is <hi>Due</hi> to it's Nature; and, therefore is <hi>given</hi> it. As for the Knowledge of Corporeal Nature, 'tis <hi>below</hi> them both, and therefore both of them <hi>comprehends</hi> it <hi>Knowingly,</hi> as is deduced above. Lastly, The Soul gains her Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by <hi>Abstract</hi> or Inadequate <hi>Notions,</hi> and by <hi>Discourse;</hi> whereas an Angel knows at once the <hi>Whole</hi> Entities, and all that belongs to them; and this, not by <hi>Discourse</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flex</hi> Thoughts; but by a <hi>Direct,</hi> Penetrative and Comprehensive <hi>Intuition.</hi>

Unparallel, that <hi>our Science</hi> is employ'd about <hi>Abstract</hi> Notions of the Thing; that is, about the Thing consider'd in such an <hi>Abstracted</hi> or <hi>Common Respect,</hi> without descending to the <hi>Under-Kinds</hi> or to the <hi>Individuums</hi> under it; whereas, the Intuitive Knowledge of an Angel, as not being made by way of Abstract or <hi>Inadequate</hi> Conceptions, comprehends <hi>in one Act,</hi> or <hi>at once,</hi> the Individualities of all those Things, (from which <hi>We</hi> abstract one <hi>Common</hi> Notion) and <hi>all</hi> that <hi>belongs</hi> to them. Whence, when we said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Generical Notion, common to all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, is to be <hi>Cognoscitive,</hi> it is to be understood of an <hi>Intuitive</hi> Cognoscitiveness, or such a one as we have describ'd above; by which they are distinguisht from the Inferiour or <hi>Narrower De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> of Knowingness peculiar to the Soul in <hi>this</hi> State; and even, in some respect, as she is found in her State of <hi>Separation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>18. The same is evinced by Reason. For, since the <hi>Object</hi> speci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>19. <hi>Corollary</hi> VII. That which gives greater force to this Doctrine, is the Consonancy it has to the<note place="margin">How Consonant this is to those Passages of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which speak of such Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Angels.</note> Sacred Scripture: Where, (<hi>Daniel,</hi> Ch. 10.) we read of the Angel of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Persia,</hi> withstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that particular Angel (in likelihood <hi>Gabriel</hi>) who presided over the <hi>Iews;</hi> till <hi>Michael,</hi> who was Higher in Dignity than the former, being Chief Patron and Defender of the Jewish Church <hi>then,</hi> as he is held to be of the <hi>Christian</hi> Church <hi>now,</hi> over-power'd his Inclination by his more Soveraign Influence. Where also we read of the Angel who was <hi>Prince</hi> or Super-intendent over the <hi>Greeks;</hi> divers of which sort, if not all, were <hi>Archangels:</hi> Whereas 'tis generally held, and is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to Reason, That the Angel-Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of Particular or <hi>Individual</hi> Persons are of the Lowest, and <hi>least-Cognoscitive,</hi> Quire of <hi>meer Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far concerning the Essence and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Operations of Angels; We proceed now to their External Operation, or their Action upon <hi>other</hi> Things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:110692:175"/>20. An Angel cannot operate upon another Angel, so as to make it <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise</hi> than it was. For, since that<note place="margin">An Angel cannot operate upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angel so as to <hi>change</hi> it.</note> Operation must work some <hi>new Effect</hi> in it; and this requires some <hi>Passive</hi> Principle, in the Subject, rendring it <hi>Mutable,</hi> which Principle we call <hi>Matter:</hi> And Angels, they being <hi>Pure Acts,</hi> have not that sort of <hi>Power</hi> call'd <hi>Matter</hi> in them; it follows, that an Angel cannot thus operate upon <hi>another</hi> Angel; nor, for the same reason, upon a <hi>Soul,</hi> while 'tis Separate.</p>
               <p>21. Wherefore, all <hi>such</hi> External Operation of an Angel can be only upon <hi>Bodies.</hi> For, since an Angel can neither<note place="margin">Wherefore, all it's External Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so as to work a <hi>Change</hi> in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing, can only be upon <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>22. An Angel <hi>can operate</hi> upon <hi>Material</hi> Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles, or on <hi>Body.</hi> For, since the Being of an Angel is <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi>

and there can want no <hi>Application</hi> of such an Agent to such a Patient, because an Angel has the Natures or Essences, nay, the Existences of Bodies, and all that can belong to them, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately <hi>joyn'd</hi> to their Understanding by <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of them: 'Tis Evident that there are all the Requisites imaginable put for their Operating upon Body, and producing some Effect in it, which was <hi>not</hi> in it <hi>before;</hi> that is, of <hi>Changing</hi> it.

Thus <hi>Gabriel,</hi> the Archangel, was the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger of the Incarnation. Nor can it be doubted but the Head of those Angels which gave the Law on Mount <hi>Sina,</hi> as is written, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 38. and <hi>v.</hi> 53. was of the same Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Nor that those Intelligences which
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:110692:178"/>
give and continue Motion to the Matter of <hi>ours,</hi> and of all the <hi>other, Suns,</hi> (if that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion may be allow'd which holds all the Fixed Stars to be so many <hi>Corpora per se lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia,</hi> or so many <hi>Suns</hi>) are all of them of the same high Excellency; since upon that Motion, given by them, every single Action of all the Bodies throughout the vast Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which those Luminaries do enlighten and influence, does wholly depend.</p>
               <p>29. From the <hi>Unchangeable</hi> Nature of a <hi>Pure Act,</hi> or an Angel, which we have Demonstrated above, 'tis<note place="margin">The Lower Angels receiv'd Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Light from the Superiour in the same Instant they were <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
                  </note> evidently Deduced, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Intellectual Light the <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi> Angels, did (as was most Requisit and Fit) receive from the <hi>Superiour</hi> ones, was imparted to them <hi>as soon as they were,</hi> or was <hi>Co-aeve</hi> to their <hi>Being.</hi> This is evident from the Immutability of a Pure Spirit, and needs no farther Proof; since, if they had any thing <hi>a-new,</hi> they must have been <hi>Chang'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>30. 'Tis likewise Evident, That, since every Angel did comprehend all Material Nature, and consequently, every least cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of it; they did from<note place="margin">In what manner the Good Angels perform the Will of their Maker without New In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions.</note> the very Creation, (as far as was on <hi>their</hi> part) stand over <hi>Ready</hi> and <hi>Bent</hi> with their <hi>Will</hi> to act upon Matter, in such precise junctures, and in that very man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in which, and according to which, they knew they were by the Divine Appointment, to exert their Active Power; without needing any

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Resistance</hi> of one Angel to another, and such like Expressions, neither ought, nor need, be so interpreted as to a gue their <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> of what they were to do, <hi>Defeat</hi> of their <hi>Intentions,</hi> or <hi>Opposition</hi> to one anothers <hi>Will;</hi> but in the plain obvious Sense, as when we use to say, [I had gone about such a Business, but that such Causes made me see it was <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable,</hi> or <hi>imprudent</hi> to attempt it; or, I could not come till it had done Raining.] So that it was a <hi>Natural</hi> Opposition, (as it were) and not a <hi>Moral</hi> on; which is between the Good Angels. For Example: The Angel of the Princ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of <hi>Persia</hi> had a desire to do the <hi>Persians</hi> all the good he could, (it being his Province and Duty) which was to keep the <hi>Iews there</hi> still; by which means the <hi>Persians</hi> might better learn the Knowledge of the true GOD. And the Angel of the <hi>Iews</hi> desir'd to deliver them from Captivity, that so they might serve GOD and observe the Law better in their own Country. These were the particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of each of them, all other Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations being Abstracted or set aside. GOD had prefixt a determinate time of their Deliverance, and of comforting <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Interim. Both of them knew GOD's Will and submitted to it. Yet the Angel of <hi>Persia</hi> acting for his Province, and detaining the <hi>Iews</hi> till the prefixt time came, was the reason why the Jewish Angel could not, till that time came, act for their Deliverance: Whereas, had there been another state of things,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:110692:179"/>
and had not <hi>he</hi> obviated the particular propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Jewish Angel, he had <hi>sooner</hi> assisted them, and come to <hi>Daniel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>31. From the Nature and Genius of Good and Bad Angels, and from this consideration, that <hi>GOD</hi>'s Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom<note place="margin">That GOD makes use of Holy Angels to procure our <hi>Good;</hi> and of Bad ones to <hi>afflict</hi> and <hi>punish</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as His Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wisdom sees Fitting.</note> makes use of the properest Instruments to perform his Will, we may conclude, that, as he orders the <hi>Good</hi> Angels to <hi>protect,</hi> guide and inspire <hi>Pious</hi> Souls, and procure their <hi>Good;</hi> so he sends, and orders, <hi>Bad</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Spirits, his Executioners, to inflict Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments on Misdeservers; to do which, their inveterate Malice to Mankind gives them most eager Propensions.

But 'tis, because we see them <hi>at distance</hi> thro' the Dull Optick of our <hi>Natural Speculation;</hi> not <hi>neer at hand,</hi> nor clad in those <hi>Majestick</hi> Resemblances, which they put on when they were to represent the great King of Glory, whose Embassadors they were.</p>
                  <p>Our Reason has ascertain'd us that there <hi>may</hi> and <hi>must be</hi> such Things as <hi>Pure Acts</hi> or <hi>ANGELS:</hi> That being in the Climax of Entities, <hi>Superiour</hi> to <hi>Bodies;</hi> they do, therefore, <hi>Include</hi> and <hi>Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend</hi> in themselves, after <hi>their</hi> manner, (that is, <hi>Knowingly,</hi>) the very <hi>Essences</hi> of <hi>Bodies,</hi> their Underlings.

Sight of GOD, and the End, or <hi>Summum Bonum</hi> of our Nature,) they make the Light of Glory, which is the <hi>End,</hi> the <hi>Means</hi> to it self; and withal to no purpose. <hi>GOD</hi> has made our Soul <hi>Intellective,</hi> and capable to see Infinite Truth, that is, <hi>Himself;</hi> and Sanctifying Grace, or the <hi>Love of GOD</hi> above all things, has already elevated that Natural Faculty above what meer Nature could have rais'd it to, and <hi>GOD</hi>'s Essence is <hi>Infinitely Intelligible;</hi> And can any <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Object</hi> be more fitted to one another?

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:110692:202"/>
Formal Distinction of those two Notions as they are conceiv'd by us, we are debarr'd from say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>One</hi> of them is the <hi>Other,</hi> or that <hi>Mercy</hi> is <hi>Iustice;</hi> whereas, regarding them <hi>as they are in GOD,</hi> we not only <hi>may,</hi> but <hi>must</hi> say, his <hi>Mercy is his Iustice;</hi> because there is but one <hi>most Simple Formality</hi> in GOD, which gives Him the Denomination of <hi>Merciful</hi> and <hi>Iust.</hi> 'Tis plain then, that these two Virtues cannot be in <hi>GOD,</hi> as they are thus <hi>formally Distinct,</hi> or <hi>Two,</hi> as our Notions represent them; nor, consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>at all,</hi> unless they be compriz'd in some For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality which eminently contains them both, and may be said to be <hi>Formally</hi> in <hi>GOD.</hi> Casting then our Thoughts about, we find in <hi>GOD</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Attribute, call'd <hi>Goodness,</hi> which includes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of having them when as it <hi>ought</hi> to have them, it <hi>falls</hi> so far <hi>short,</hi> or is <hi>Imperfect</hi> under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Ens.</hi> Let's go on, and ask: Is our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Ens</hi> predicated with Propriety of <hi>GOD?</hi> No certainly: For the Notion of an <hi>Ens</hi> amongst us is Distinct from the Notion of <hi>Existent;</hi> and, we truly say of those we call <hi>Entia</hi> or Things, that they sometimes <hi>Exist,</hi> and sometimes <hi>not-Exist.</hi> Whence our Notion of <hi>Ens,</hi> not having <hi>Actual Being</hi> in it, can only be this, that it has a <hi>Power to be,</hi> which is so far from being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly said of GOD whose Essence is a <hi>Pure Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of Being,</hi> that 'tis Diametrically Opposite to it. Is our Notion of <hi>Existence</hi> at least with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety said of <hi>GOD?</hi> No, neither: For, [<hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence</hi>] amongst us signifies only the <hi>Act</hi> of the Thing, or <hi>somewhat</hi> of it, but it does not signifie the <hi>Exister;</hi> which yet <hi>GOD</hi> most properly is. But, being once come to <hi>Existence,</hi> we are at the Top, and the Highest, Purest and Best of of all our Human Notions, and can go no farther.</p>
               <p>52. Whence is clearly deduced, that there is no Notion we have, or Word<note place="margin">Hence is concluded, that all the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Words we have, whether Affirmative or Negative, do full short of the Divine Nature.</note> we use, which, in propriety of Speech, may not be <hi>Deny'd</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> because his Infinitely <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and yet <hi>All Perfect Existence,</hi> includes them <hi>all</hi> in <hi>one</hi> All-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending Formality.

               <p>1. HAVING, as I hop't, settled the Way of Exact Reasoning in my METHOD <hi>to Science;</hi> and reduced the Notions, of which we make use in more Sublime Subjects, to a Distinctness in my METAPHYSICKS; I cast about to find out some Particular Point, to which, as a Proper Instance, I might apply my Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Productions; and, thence, manifest that they were not <hi>high-flown Fancies,</hi> as some incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Readers may imagine, but <hi>Solid</hi> and <hi>Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>

                  <hi>Truths.</hi> Nor could there need any Long En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry to make my Thoughts come to a Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. I had, to my great trouble, observ'd how rudely the Mystery of the most <hi>B. Trinity</hi> had been attackt of late by some Witty and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Gentlemen; and had received Information also, that the Boasts of their wonderful Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances by the way of <hi>Reason,</hi> had given great Advantages to <hi>Deists</hi> and <hi>Atheists;</hi> who, siding with them, did thence take occasion to ridicule Christianity, whose prime Fundamental, was (as they pretended) a piece of Pure <hi>Nonsense.</hi> I saw very clearly, that all their Objections proceeded upon most <hi>gross Mistakes;</hi> and (which I am loath to say) from <hi>Unskillfulness</hi> in <hi>Logick,</hi> or the Rules of Right Reasoning; and from perfect <hi>Ignorance</hi> in <hi>Metaphysicks:</hi> The former of which, by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing exactly our several <hi>Notions</hi> or <hi>Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects,</hi> is to give us Light to know what <hi>is</hi> truly a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> what <hi>not;</hi> and the other, instructs us how we are to discourse of the <hi>First Being</hi> and his <hi>Attributes.</hi> The Principles and Deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in which <hi>Sciences</hi> being in so <hi>high</hi> a Degree <hi>Evident,</hi> I could not but <hi>discover clearly,</hi> and therefore, (the weight of the Circumstance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring it,) I dare <hi>confidently declare,</hi> and offer to <hi>maintain,</hi> that all their Objections against that Mystery are not only perfectly <hi>Groundless,</hi> but when they come to be sifted and examin'd by those <hi>Tests</hi> of <hi>True Reason,</hi> extreamly <hi>Weak</hi> even to <hi>Childishness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. And, indeed, they deliver those Objections of theirs in so <hi>sleight</hi> a Manner, as if themselves made account they writ to none but <hi>half-witted</hi> Readers; who stand ready to give up their Assent,

Now what Man of Sense can they hope to satisfie by such a <hi>shallow</hi> way of Discoursing; much less the <hi>Learned Divines of the Universities,</hi> to whom they take the Boldness to address their Pamphlets. Certainly, when the <hi>Thesis</hi> is of so <hi>Soveraign</hi> a Nature, we ought, if ever, proceed with all the <hi>Accuracy</hi> Imaginable.

               <p>3. For the Point it self is of that <hi>Vast Concern,</hi> that either it must (in case it be <hi>True</hi>) render the Deniers of it most Ungrateful, Impious and Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemous, in Degrading our Infinite GOD, Blessed for evermore, who, to save Mankind, so mercifully condescended to take our Nature upon Him, into the <hi>Abject</hi> condition of a <hi>meer Creature,</hi> made of <hi>Nothing,</hi> and therefore <hi>Next to Nothing;</hi> or else, if it be, (as they pretend) <hi>False,</hi> it must

lay the Horrible Blemish of being <hi>Idolatrous</hi> in the Highest Degree, upon the Christian Church for so many Ages: Nay, farther, it must <hi>Unchurch</hi> her absolutely, and make her no better than a <hi>Synagogue of Sathan;</hi> since she builds the main Body of all her Faith on the Profession of <hi>Christ's</hi> Divinity; whom she <hi>adores daily</hi> and most <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly;</hi> and this, not with a <hi>Relative</hi> but a <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative</hi> Divine Worship; nay makes Him the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the <hi>First Beginning</hi> and <hi>Last End</hi> of all things.

Which if they please to do, I dare assure my Readers it will be impossible the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie should <hi>hover,</hi> or be <hi>long Depending.</hi> I have set them a Sample what Method they may take, if they sincerely and impartially aim at <hi>Truth.</hi> To this end, I lay my <hi>Principles;</hi> which I will <hi>vouch</hi> and <hi>maintain</hi> to be <hi>Evident,</hi> and far from <hi>Gratuitous Suppositions.</hi> I <hi>state</hi> the Question; I <hi>clear</hi> the words, of which we are to make use, from <hi>Ambiguity;</hi> and, by this means, I make a <hi>Clear Stage</hi> for both Parties: Let them do the same, and it will be impossible that Endless Wrangle should defeat the Expectation of our Readers, or the Victory of Truth hang long in Suspense.</p>
               <p>5. If any blame me for being <hi>too Exact:</hi> First, I am not asham'd to declare, that it was my Full Intention to bend my utmost endeavours to settle this Point so <hi>Unanswerably,</hi> as far as it depends on the <hi>Way of Reason,</hi> that the Opposition against it may never rise again to <hi>pester</hi> and <hi>divide</hi> the Church, nor prejudice the Eternal Salvation of Mankind. Next, I must own, that it is <hi>Uneasie</hi> to me, when I am to <hi>maintain</hi> any <hi>Truth,</hi> not to lay my <hi>Principles</hi> first, and take care they be <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:</hi> And, unless I do this, I am still dissatisfied
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:110692:232"/>
with my self; and afraid lest some Plausible Fancy should lead me <hi>astray</hi> from the Truth, and make me <hi>stumble</hi> into some Errour. The greatest Wits and most Learned Scholars living are liable to <hi>fall,</hi> if they want these <hi>Supports;</hi> which, and only which, can enable our Reason to take <hi>Firm Steps,</hi> and keep it on it's Leggs <hi>Upright.</hi> Whence if be a <hi>Fault,</hi> I hope it is a <hi>good one:</hi> At least, I have been since my riper years, so <hi>enur'd</hi> to it, that I must confess I <hi>cannot</hi> help it; nor <hi>would</hi> I, if I <hi>could.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Indeed, were there none that <hi>Impugn'd</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Faith, it would be Needless in that case to be at the Expence of so much Time and Pains to <hi>Defend</hi> it.

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:110692:238"/>
we do <hi>here,</hi> but all their Knowledge is by <hi>Simple Intuition,</hi> which has nothing of <hi>Succession</hi> or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in it; and therefore, this sort of Spiritual Operation only, is that which can be Apply'd to GOD; the Other, which is <hi>Part after Part,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in some respect Quantitative or Corporeal, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To begin then with <hi>Substance.</hi> A Natural <hi>Thing</hi> or <hi>Ens,</hi> call'd also an <hi>Individuum,</hi> or <hi>Substantia Prima,</hi> (only which do exist in Nature, and, consequently, from which only we have all our Natural Notions) does give us these Distinct or Abstracted Conceptions of it. To take them in Order, and consider, in the First place, what's most <hi>Potential</hi> and <hi>Imperfect</hi> in a Thing; we can conceive, that (it being <hi>Mutable</hi>) there can <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Natural Thing be <hi>made of it;</hi> and therefore, that it has <hi>in it</hi> somewhat by which it has a <hi>Power</hi> to become <hi>Another Thing;</hi> which Power we call <hi>Matter:</hi> For we call that <hi>MATTER,</hi> of which any Thing is <hi>made.</hi> Now, this meer <hi>Power to be a Thing,</hi> cannot be held, by Virtue of that Sole Notion, to <hi>be a Thing;</hi> since nothing <hi>is</hi> that which it is <hi>only</hi> a <hi>Power to be;</hi> and if it be not, <hi>as</hi> thus conceiv'd, a <hi>Thing,</hi> it cannot be conceiv'd to have any Accident, Mode, or (which is the same) <hi>Determination</hi> of Thing in it, which are <hi>Subsequent</hi> to the Notion of <hi>Thing,</hi> for all these are apt to <hi>Determine</hi> the Thing, which is against the Notion of a <hi>meer Power,</hi> which is utterly <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate:</hi> Hence is seen clearly why <hi>Aristotle</hi> gave

                  </gap>oth; which our Referring Power, comparing <hi>One</hi> of them to the <hi>Other,</hi> gains thence a Relative Notion of <hi>Equality</hi> between them, and denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates them <hi>Equal.</hi> Thus the Relation of <hi>Identity</hi> in Nature between Two Men, is nothing but those very Natures, Compar'd as aforesaid; whence
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:110692:241"/>
we truly conceive there is a Relation of <hi>Identity</hi> between them.

               <p>13. <hi>Prel.</hi> XIII. Hence, tho' the <hi>Act</hi> of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding is Necessary to the Referring those Correlates <hi>actually;</hi> yet the Formal Notion [or <hi>Ratio</hi>] of those Relations themselves is <hi>entirely</hi> taken from what's in those <hi>Subjects</hi> that are <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated;</hi> nor does that Act of ours enter into the Relation <hi>it self,</hi> or bear <hi>any part</hi> in it. This is very Evident; because 'tis not the Act of the Understanding, Comparing those Things, which is Denominated <hi>Alike, Equal,</hi> or the <hi>Same;</hi> but the <hi>Things themselves</hi> which are <hi>Compar'd,</hi> or are the <hi>Objects</hi> of that Act. Whence the <hi>Act</hi> it <hi>self</hi> is no Part of the Relation, but is <hi>Extrinsecal</hi> to the precise Notion of it. As farther appears hence, that <hi>Relation</hi> is one of those Notions which are call'd Accidental Modes or <hi>Accidents,</hi> whose whole Being (such as it is) is to affect the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> in their several ways, and <hi>denominate</hi> them such as they do formally <hi>make</hi> them: Since then <hi>Relation</hi> does not affect or denominate the <hi>Act</hi> of the Understanding, but the <hi>Things</hi> which that Act <hi>compares;</hi> and, as has been often demonstrated, the Accidents or Modes are <hi>Really</hi> the <hi>Same</hi> with the Thing which they modifie; it follows, that <hi>Relation</hi> is the <hi>Thing it self</hi> in our Minds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

So Whiteness in those Subjects, which are <hi>White,</hi> is Apprehended and Denominated by an <hi>Absolute</hi> Name, and they are both call'd <hi>White;</hi> but put two such Subjects with Whiteness in them, in our <hi>Mind,</hi> which is a <hi>Comparing</hi> kind of <hi>Container,</hi> or a <hi>Comparing</hi> Power, and they come thence to be Apprehended by a <hi>Relative</hi> Notion, and Denominated by a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative</hi> Word [<hi>Alike.</hi>] So that the Things themselves do give themselves this Relative Notion and Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of being <hi>Alike;</hi> taking them as in such a <hi>Container</hi> as our Mind is, which is apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider them in order to one another, or refer them <hi>Actually.</hi> These Things consider'd, no Man of Reason can imagine, that, tho' we use the Common Word [<hi>Relation,</hi>] because it passes amongst Learned Men, (as we do other Abstract Words) therefore it means something hovering in the Air (as it were) without a Subject, like a kind of <hi>Idea Platonica;</hi> or that it can be any thing but the very <hi>Thing</hi> it self which is <hi>Related.</hi> And hence it is that that most Solid and Acute Distinguisher of our Natural Notions, <hi>Aristotle,</hi> rather chuses to make use of the <hi>Concretes;</hi> and, as he call'd

               <p>1 THE Divine Nature, which is the Subject of our present Discourse, may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd two manner of Ways. One is, as to what GOD <hi>is in himself,</hi> as the Mysticks treat of Him; in which Sense He <hi>Abstracts</hi> from all our <hi>Natural Notions,</hi> because He <hi>Transcends</hi> them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore He is altogether <hi>Unconceiveable</hi> and <hi>Unnameable</hi> by us in this State; and only Intelligible by the Angels and Saints in Heaven; to whose Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Eye, purify'd from all <hi>Sinful</hi> Affections, and Dispos'd by Perfect <hi>Charity,</hi> he reveals His
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:110692:243"/>
Blissful and Glorious Face, to be seen by a Clear and Simple <hi>Intuition.</hi> The other way is to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Him as He is the <hi>Object</hi> of our <hi>Natural No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> which, having first (as is said above) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd them from their Imperfection, we <hi>transfer</hi> to Him; and, thence, become Enabled in some sort to <hi>speak</hi> and <hi>discourse</hi> of Him, <hi>Truly,</hi> (tho' with some Impropriety,) in our <hi>Low</hi> and <hi>Homely</hi> Language.</p>
               <p>2. Since then 'tis manifest that we cannot <hi>Speak</hi> or <hi>Discourse</hi> of, much less <hi>Explicate,</hi> what we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>conceive,</hi> or of which we cannot have any Notion; 'tis Evident, that the Divinity being the subject of our intended Discourse, is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd and taken according to the <hi>Later</hi> manner, and not according to the <hi>Former,</hi> in our Discourses concerning it.</p>
               <p>This premis'd, since Faith (by <hi>Prelim.</hi> V.) is deliver'd to us in Words expressing our <hi>Natural Notions,</hi> the True State of the Question is this; Whether the Divine Nature, Conceiv'd by us according to such Notions as we had from Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which being depur'd first from their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Perfections, we Apply to GOD; does not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us, as we affirm of Him that He is Just, Merciful, Wise, <hi>&amp;c. So,</hi> with <hi>Equal</hi> Reason and Truth, to affirm that He is <hi>ONE</hi> according to His <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Essence;</hi> and withal, <hi>THREE</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Another</hi> Notion or <hi>Respect,</hi> which we fitly call [<hi>Person?</hi>]</p>
               <p>To set this Question, and our ensuing Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a <hi>Clearer Light,</hi> we will divide this <hi>Entire</hi> Question into <hi>Five</hi> Distinct or Particular ones, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:110692:244"/>First, Whether it be not Agreeable to Rational Principles taken from our Natural Notions, to affirm that the Divine Nature does verify some <hi>One</hi> Notion that is <hi>Common;</hi> and some <hi>Others</hi> that are <hi>Distinct</hi> or <hi>Particulars,</hi> to which that Common Notion is Apply'd?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whether these Particulars are not <hi>Three,</hi> and no more?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whether those <hi>Three Particulars</hi> are not most fitly call'd [<hi>Persons?</hi>]</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whether those <hi>Three Persons,</hi> be not most fitly to be call'd, <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>H. Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, and Lastly, Whether the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, notwithstanding this <hi>Plurality</hi> of <hi>Persons,</hi> is not still Perfectly and Equally <hi>One in Nature;</hi> or, rather <hi>more,</hi> (that is, under <hi>more</hi> Respects,) <hi>One in it's self,</hi> than it would have been in case this Plurality of Persons had been secluded.</p>
               <p>Now, if it shall appear by our Explication, that the Affirmative of all these is <hi>Consonant to Reason</hi> working upon our Natural Notions <hi>stript</hi> of their Imperfections, and, as such, <hi>Transferr'd</hi> to GOD; I hope it will satisfie <hi>Dissenters,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the Faith of those who Believe <hi>already,</hi> and convince every Intelligent Reader, that nothing can with true Reason be <hi>objected</hi> against this Divine Mystery.</p>

               <p>3. By the word [<hi>Father,</hi>] I mean one Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, who communicates the Nature of which Himself is, to <hi>Another</hi> Particular: And by [<hi>Son,</hi>] Him to whom that Nature is thus Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but that he <hi>does</hi> or <hi>does not</hi> Communicate the same <hi>Individual</hi> Nature, or that he is <hi>Before</hi> his Son in Time, and other Considerations arising from Matter, spring from the Imperfection and Limitedness of Creatures, and therefore they are not to be Transferr'd to GOD: Nor are they Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential to the Notions of <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son;</hi> as will be plain to any Man, who reflects, that if (<hi>per impossible</hi>) a Man did communicate his <hi>Individual</hi> Nature to Another, and that Other had it thus Communicated from him, and this <hi>Instantaneously;</hi> he would not, in that Supposition, be therefore <hi>less</hi> a Father, but <hi>more perfectly</hi> such, because the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Communicated is more perfectly the <hi>Same.</hi> Nor do [<hi>Sooner</hi>] or [<hi>Later</hi>] [<hi>Instantaneous</hi>] or [<hi>Not-Instantaneous</hi>], enter into the precise Notion of <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Son;</hi> as appears from the Definition of <hi>Generation;</hi> which <hi>abstracts</hi> from all those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations. Moreover, 'tis most Evident, that in such a case, the Person who Communicates his <hi>Individual</hi> Nature, and He to whom 'tis Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:110692:246"/>
would have, hence, <hi>some very neer</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to one another; and what imaginable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <hi>could it be</hi> but that of <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. I take the word [<hi>Generation</hi>] in the Sense of that Exact and Received Definition, <hi>viz. [Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessio Viventis a Vivente, tanquam a Principio Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncto, in Similitudinem Naturae,</hi>] which I shall show is perfectly Verify'd in the Procession of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Word.</hi> All other Considerations are Extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal and Forrein to the Notion of Generation, as may be gather'd from §. 3. and, therefore do not belong to it's precise Notion, but spring from the Imperfection of Creatures; nor, consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>as such,</hi> ought they be Transferr'd to GOD.</p>
               <p>5. The word [<hi>Person</hi>] signifies <hi>Perseity,</hi> (as some Schoolmen explicate it;) or what's so <hi>Subsistent</hi> of it self, or by the merits of it's <hi>own Notion</hi> or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, that it needs <hi>no other</hi> Formal <hi>Notion</hi> to compleat it, nor <hi>Word</hi> to express it <hi>better.</hi> The Etymology of that word (if such a Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not rather the <hi>Common Use</hi> of it only, be much to be regarded) seems to be this; that as we say a Speech is <hi>Dissona,</hi> when it <hi>varies</hi> from another in Sense, and <hi>Consona</hi> when it <hi>agrees</hi> to it: So a Thing is call'd <hi>Persona,</hi> when it <hi>thorowly</hi> or perfectly <hi>sounds</hi> or speaks the Notion of <hi>Ens;</hi> or expresses the <hi>utmost Completion</hi> of a Thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Notion of an <hi>Intelligent Being.</hi> See §. 2.</p>
               <p>6.

and the laying open what, with a Deep In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection, we discover to be included <hi>in it,</hi> or to belong to it <hi>Intrinsecally;</hi> and, since the Nature of GOD, is, at present, the <hi>Subject</hi> of our Discourse; or that which we are to <hi>explicate;</hi> our Question being, Whether GOD is not Truly <hi>One</hi> in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> or <hi>Essence,</hi> and Three according to the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Person?</hi> Hence, 'tis most fittirg we should <hi>take our Rise,</hi> and Ground our Discourse, from the Divine Nature <hi>it self,</hi> consider'd as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by us according to our Natural Notions, as is declar'd above.</p>
               <p>2.

to all Creatures, and conceive GOD to be <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> under these Considerations, as is declar'd <hi>Prel.</hi> VII.</p>
               <p>4. Farther, because that <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> are <hi>Imperfect</hi> which are exercis'd about <hi>Unworthy</hi> Objects; and those are <hi>most Perfect,</hi> which are employ'd about the <hi>Best</hi> and <hi>Noblest</hi> Objects that can be imagin'd; and only the Divine Nature is the <hi>most Excellent</hi> Object: It follows, that, since no Notion that is <hi>Imperfect</hi> is to be Attributed to GOD; Therefore the <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> which we attribute to Him must be the Knowledge and Love of the Best of all Objects, <hi>Himself;</hi> and thence we must affirm, without the least fear of Injuring the Divine Nature, that [GOD <hi>Knows</hi> and <hi>Loves</hi> Himself,] because to deny Him this, would make the Divine Nature most highly <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect;</hi> nay <hi>more</hi> Imperfect than <hi>Created</hi> Spiritual Natures are; especially if they are <hi>Pure Acts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Moreover, this Knowledge and Love of <hi>Himself,</hi> is (as it were) the <hi>Primary Operation</hi> of the Deity, as it is a <hi>Spirit:</hi> Wherefore, since the Primary Operation of all Creatures we converse with has been prov'd to be That which <hi>constitutes</hi> their <hi>Essences;</hi> we cannot but judge, that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering GOD according to our Natural Notions, this Knowledge and Love of <hi>Himself,</hi> is, in that regard, most <hi>Essential</hi> to GOD as He is a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. This Fundamental Principle then being laid as the Groundwork of all our ensuing Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; since (by <hi>Prelim.</hi> II.) and as plain Reason tells us, we are to <hi>discourse consequently</hi> of those True Notions we have of GOD, so they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply no Imperfection; we are to consider next
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:110692:248"/>
what <hi>Genuine Consequences</hi> do follow from this Position.</p>
               <p>7. It follows, then, hence immediately, that the Divine Nature does <hi>Verifie</hi> the Notions of <hi>Knower</hi> and Thing <hi>Known, Lover</hi> and Thing <hi>Loved;</hi> and that there is <hi>in</hi> the Divine Nature that which <hi>answers</hi> to those <hi>Distinct</hi> Notions; nay, which <hi>obliges</hi> us to say they are <hi>Distinct.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>8. 'Tis impossible to conceive, that the Notions of <hi>Knower</hi> and Thing <hi>Known,</hi> (and the same is to said of <hi>Lover</hi> and Thing <hi>Loved</hi>) should be the <hi>same</hi> Notion; and not <hi>Contradistinct,</hi> and (some way) <hi>Opposite</hi> to one another. First, Because plain Sense manifests they are <hi>counterpos'd.</hi> Next, the Art of Logick, which is entirely Grounded on our Natural Notions, and perfectly Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes them, informs us certainly that there is a <hi>Relative Opposition,</hi> and, consequently, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable <hi>Distinction</hi> between them. Thirdly, The Thing <hi>Known</hi> and <hi>Lov'd</hi> do evidently import the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Love;</hi> and, what's <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected</hi> cannot but be <hi>Distinct,</hi> or (some way) <hi>Other</hi> from That <hi>to which</hi> 'tis Objected. Fourthly, they being clearly <hi>Relatives,</hi> the very meaning of the word [<hi>Ad,</hi>] which formally expresses all <hi>Relation,</hi> must forcibly signifie there is some sort of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction</hi> between them. Lastly, They are <hi>Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives;</hi> which can have no Sense but this, that they <hi>mutually respect</hi> one another. Now that <hi>Knower</hi> and Thing <hi>Known</hi> should mutually <hi>respect</hi> one another, and yet there should not be (in some Sense) <hi>One and Another,</hi> is perfect Nonsense and meer Contradiction.</p>
               <p>9. Hence follows, that there must be <hi>some kind</hi> of Distinction in the Divine Nature it self; since
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:110692:248"/>
Predicates that do necessarily bear <hi>Distinction</hi> in their very Notion are truly verify'd of it: Nor can <hi>Distinction</hi> be in any thing, but it must make it, <hi>some</hi> way or <hi>other, Distinct.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. Nor can this Distinction proceed from the Imperfection of our Understanding, as it does when we distinguish other Divine Attributes; but it proceeds from the Soveraign <hi>Perfection</hi> of the Divine Nature it self, which is to <hi>Know</hi> and <hi>Love Himself:</hi> Nor does our Understanding in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this, <hi>deform</hi> our True Conception of the Deity but the true Conception of the Deity it self does thus <hi>Inform</hi> our Understanding, and <hi>obliges</hi> us to <hi>affirm</hi> thus of it.</p>
               <p>11. Hence this Distinction, which those words, [<hi>God Knows and Loves Himself,</hi>] do put in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, is <hi>Real:</hi> Not only because the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Self-Knowledge</hi> does <hi>Verifie</hi> it; but also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not grounded on our <hi>weak manner</hi> of Conceiving it, but, as was shown, §§. 4. 5. on the Perfection of <hi>GOD's Essence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12. Hence, as we transfer to GOD the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Justice, Mercy, Power, Wisdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we find in Creatures, by observing such Effects proceeding from Him as use to proceed from such like Perfections <hi>in us,</hi> or <hi>among us;</hi> so with the same, and far better Reason we may transfer to Him the Notions of Knowing and Loving Himself; and, consequently, of <hi>Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> between those Relative Notions of <hi>Knower</hi> and <hi>Known</hi> which are <hi>in Him,</hi> and objectively <hi>Him,</hi> by <hi>Priel.</hi> 10. 11.</p>
               <p>13. To understand this more clearly, we may reflect that the Names of those Virtues which we Transfer to GOD do not in their Notion import
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:110692:249"/>
that <hi>one</hi> of them is <hi>not another;</hi> nor hinder but they may all be compriz'd in <hi>one</hi> Eminently Perfect Attribute. I believe, that I have shown, (<hi>Solid Philosophy Asserted, Reflection</hi> XV.) that all Virtues, even amongst <hi>us,</hi> are comprehended in that one Notion, [<hi>Right Reason</hi>] working on such or such Objects, in such and such Occasions. Much more easily may they all be center'd in that one most Perfect Formality of GOD's Essence: Whence all the Distinction of those Attributes as they are in GOD, must necessarily be refunded into our manner of conceiving them by diverse Acts, or Abstracted Conceptions. But now, when we conceive that <hi>GOD Knows Himself,</hi> (and the same may be said of his <hi>Loving Himself</hi>) the business is quite otherwise. For the very Notion of [<hi>Self-Knowledge</hi>] does essentially import <hi>Distinction</hi> of <hi>Knower</hi> and <hi>Known.</hi> Even <hi>Knowledge,</hi> amongst<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>us,</hi> does essentially signifie, that the Thing Known is <hi>in</hi> our Knowledge as <hi>Another,</hi> or as <hi>Distinct</hi> from the Soul as <hi>knowing</hi> it; as is shown in the Book now cited, <hi>Prelim.</hi> II. §§. 22. 23. and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, §. 26. And Reason gives it <hi>must</hi> be so; since when I know a <hi>Tree,</hi> the Nature of a <hi>Tree</hi> which is in my Mind <hi>intellectually,</hi> is not <hi>there</hi> as either my <hi>Essence,</hi> nor as any Intrinsecal <hi>Mode</hi> of <hi>me,</hi> as is manifest; it must therefore necessarily be there as <hi>Distinct from me,</hi> or as <hi>Another.</hi> Nay, when our Soul knows her self, she must, some way or other, be <hi>Distinct</hi> from her self by that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for it cannot with any Sense be deny'd, but that she is in that case, her own <hi>Object;</hi> and that, therefore, for that very regard, she must be distinguisht, some way, <hi>from her self</hi> as <hi>Knowing</hi> that Object, as is shown, <hi>Prelim.</hi> IV. Nor is this
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:110692:249"/>
any <hi>Imperfection</hi> in a Created Spirit, to have her Objects in her when she knows them, as <hi>Other,</hi> or as <hi>Distinct from her:</hi> For 'tis the very Notion or Nature of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which if we take away from her, we must at the same time take away her Knowing Power, and her <hi>Spirituality,</hi> and put her to be made of <hi>Matter;</hi> it being the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of <hi>Matter</hi> and of <hi>Material</hi> Things to have nothing in them but such <hi>Modes</hi> which are <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal</hi> to their Subject, and Determine it's Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiality. Nay more, 'tis the <hi>highest Perfection</hi> of a Spiritual Nature to have things <hi>in it,</hi> which are <hi>different from it;</hi> as is demonstrated in my <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicks,</hi> Book II. Ch. 2. §§. 6, 7, 8, 9. Whence, there being no Imperfection in this Notion, but rather it being the <hi>best</hi> Perfection of a Spiritual Nature, we ought with far better Reason than <hi>any other,</hi> Transfer it to GOD; and to say, that <hi>GOD,</hi> by Knowing Himself, <hi>is</hi> (in some Sense or other) <hi>in Himself</hi> as <hi>Another,</hi> or that He is <hi>Distinct</hi> from <hi>Himself,</hi> as he is a <hi>Knower,</hi> as is seen <hi>Prel.</hi> IV.</p>
               <p>14. To finish this Point, we may reflect, that we may more easily be Mis-led by fancying those <hi>other</hi> Attributes to be Distinct in GOD; because, according to our manner of Conceiving they are <hi>Diverse</hi> from one another, and <hi>very Many</hi> of them; But in our case there are but <hi>Two</hi> single Attributes, <hi>viz. Self-Knowing</hi> and <hi>Self-Loving,</hi> and yet each of those single Attributes imports <hi>Distinction</hi> and <hi>Aliety,</hi> (if I may use that word) in it's own <hi>Particular</hi> Notion. Which shows plainly, that the <hi>Distinction</hi> here spoken of, does not arise out of the <hi>Number</hi> of those <hi>Diverse</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, or from our <hi>Distinct Acts</hi> of Conceiving them <hi>Abstractedly;</hi> but from each of those <hi>Single</hi>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:110692:250"/>
and <hi>Intrinsecal</hi> Natures or Notions of <hi>Self-Knowing</hi> and of <hi>Self-Loving;</hi> which, unless we should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously degrade the Divine Nature from being <hi>Spiritual,</hi> we must be forced to Attribute to Him; and consequently, <hi>some Distinction,</hi> as these words do most evidently import.</p>
               <p>15. Hence is farther manifested, that since GOD <hi>Knows and Loves Himself,</hi> there is in the Divine Nature some <hi>One</hi> Notion that is <hi>Common,</hi> and some Others that are <hi>Particulars.</hi> For it is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that <hi>Knower,</hi> and <hi>Known, Lover,</hi> and <hi>Loved,</hi> are all <hi>distinct</hi> Notions from one another, and therefore <hi>Particulars;</hi> as also that the word [<hi>GOD</hi>] is Predicated, and Verify'd of each of them. For, since all True Predication or Verification is made by the Identifying Particle [<hi>Est,</hi>] 'tis consequent, that the Divine Nature is <hi>in</hi> them <hi>all,</hi> and really <hi>Them:</hi> And therefore, since the single word [GOD] is but <hi>one</hi> Notion, and truly said of them <hi>All,</hi> it must be granted to be <hi>COMMON to them all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>16. And because this Common Notion [GOD] cannot but most properly signifie the Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is <hi>Infinite</hi> in <hi>Perfection;</hi> and to be a <hi>Suppositum,</hi> (by Sect. 3. §. 6.) is to be <hi>Compleat</hi> or <hi>Perfect</hi> in the Notion of Ens: Therefore, the Notion of a <hi>Suppositum</hi> cannot but be attributed to that Common Notion [GOD.] Wherefore that Notion is not only <hi>Common,</hi> but also a <hi>Suppositum;</hi> there is then a <hi>Common Suppositum</hi> in GOD, which is predicated of the <hi>Particulars</hi> truly attributed to Him; and, as has been prov'd, Identify'd with Him.</p>
               <p>17. In this Notion of the <hi>Common Suppositum,</hi> the Generality of the Jews, the Wiser Heathens, and all those who deny a Trinity, understood the word [<hi>GOD;</hi>] and perhaps our selves too, when
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:110692:250"/>
there is not in our Prayers or Discourse any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reference to any of the <hi>Persons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>18. Wherefore this <hi>Common Suppositum</hi> may not unfitly be call'd the <hi>Absolute</hi> Notion of GOD, and those <hi>Particulars</hi> the <hi>Relative</hi> Notions of the same Divine Essence; because they meerly spring from those <hi>Relations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>19. Whence, because the Common Suppositum, exprest by the word [GOD,] is held, by all who use that Word to be <hi>Infinite</hi> in all those Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, which we have Demonstrated in the Third Book of our Metaphysicks, to belong to the <hi>First Being, viz.</hi> Infinitely Wise, Just, Good, Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as also Eternal, and Self-Existent; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that <hi>all</hi> or <hi>each</hi> of those <hi>Particulars,</hi> which are Predicated of the Word [GOD,] and therefore are Identify'd with Him, must also be granted to have all those Infinite Perfections in them, which are attributed to Him; since [GOD,] who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all those Attributes is Predicated (or Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd) with them all; as is deliver'd accordingly in the Creed of St. <hi>Athanasius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>20. The Difficulty is, how we can with Truth, and our due Regard to GOD, who is essentially a most Pure Actuality of Being, make Him a <hi>Genus</hi> or a <hi>Species,</hi> Common to <hi>more</hi> which have the Notion of <hi>Inferiours</hi> in respect of Him. For true Metaphysicks admits no Composition in GOD of <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Difference,</hi> as is seen, Book III. §. 35. To clear this, we are to consider all those several <hi>Manners of Predicating,</hi> given us by <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> and allow'd by all the Learned World, call'd the <hi>Five Predicables.</hi> Now the Notions of <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species,</hi> which are made by Logical Abstraction, are <hi>Indeterminate</hi> and <hi>Potential</hi> in respect of the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:110692:251"/>
                  <hi>Inferiour</hi> Notions; and the Things, (that is, <hi>they,</hi> as thus consider'd) are <hi>Substantiae Secundae,</hi> which reach not to the Notion of <hi>Individuum,</hi> or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia Prima,</hi> only which are properly <hi>Entia</hi> or <hi>Capable of Existing;</hi> much less do they reach to the Notion of <hi>Existence,</hi> or <hi>Actual Being.</hi> This being so, it would be most absurd to Transfer such Notions to <hi>GOD</hi> who is <hi>Pure Existence.</hi> Nor can we Predicate any thing of Him as a <hi>Difference,</hi> which determines the foresaid Potentiality of the others; for in that which is essentially <hi>Pure Actual Being,</hi> there can be no farther <hi>Determination</hi> made; since this is done by the <hi>Act,</hi> and nothing can be <hi>more Actual</hi> than <hi>Pure Actuality of Being</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>21. Wherefore, setting these Three Predicables aside, there remain those Manners of Predicating call'd <hi>Proprium</hi> and <hi>Accidens.</hi> Now, I conceive, that it argues no Imperfection for the <hi>Common Suppositum</hi> to be Predicated of those <hi>Particulars,</hi> according to this <hi>Last manner.</hi> For first, This is not Abstracted from <hi>Inferiours,</hi> or Common to them as a <hi>Potential</hi> Notion Determin'd by <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences:</hi> Again, To be thus Predicated it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd that the Predicate be an <hi>Accident</hi> it self, or found in any of the Heads of those <hi>Modes,</hi> which are Contr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>istinguisht from <hi>Substance;</hi> but the Predicate <hi>here</hi> may it self be a <hi>Substante,</hi> provided it does not <hi>per se,</hi> or essentially and formally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Subject. <hi>V. g.</hi> When we say, [a <hi>Cup</hi> is <hi>Golden,</hi> or (which is the same) <hi>Gold;</hi> a <hi>Spoon</hi> is <hi>Gold;</hi> a <hi>Ring</hi> is <hi>Gold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>] the Predicate [<hi>Gold</hi>] ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to the <hi>Cup, Spoon,</hi> and <hi>Ring,</hi> is a <hi>Substance;</hi> and, in some Sense Common to them all; not as a <hi>Potential</hi> Notion, Determin'd by Differences, is common to it's <hi>Inferiours,</hi> and <hi>Essential</hi> to them;
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:110692:251"/>
but, because it does not <hi>Essentially</hi> belong to Gold to be apply'd to such a <hi>Figure,</hi> therefore it is <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental</hi> or not-<hi>Essential</hi> to it; and hence it is said to be Predicated of them <hi>Accidentally.</hi> Now in this manner the Common Suppositum [GOD] is Predicated of <hi>Knowing, Known,</hi> and the other Particulars without any show of Imperfection. I do not say, that <hi>Knowing, &amp;c.</hi> are Accidental to GOD, as it is to things of the said Figures to be Gold. I abstract from the <hi>Matter,</hi> and take only the bare <hi>Manner</hi> of Predicating; which is, not to be said or predicated as a <hi>Superiour</hi> of <hi>Inferiours,</hi> to which it's Potentiality is Determin'd by Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, but as one Substantial Notion, <hi>determin'd already</hi> as to it's own Nature, is Predicated of another, which is either (according to it's Notion) <hi>Substantial;</hi> or formally belonging to Another Head; as those <hi>Figures</hi> are in respect of <hi>Gold,</hi> and the Absolute Notion of the Divine <hi>Essence,</hi> according to the Distinction of our Natural Notions, is to that of <hi>Relation</hi> in Common.</p>
               <p>22. Or, if we <hi>invert</hi> the Order of those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, and say, [GOD is <hi>Known, Knowing, &amp;c.</hi>] and so make the Notion of GOD the <hi>Common Subject</hi> in those speeches in which the <hi>Relative</hi> ones are Predicated; then they may be truly said to be Predicated of him according to the Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable of <hi>Proprium.</hi> Which soever of those ways we take, no Imperfection will be refunded upon GOD, nor any Potentiality transfer'd to His <hi>most Pure Actuality;</hi> which is the chief danger to be avoided in our <hi>Predications</hi> concerning the Divine Nature.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That these <hi>Particulars,</hi> are THREE, and no more.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. SInce then this <hi>Common</hi> or <hi>Absolute</hi> Suppositum, call'd GOD, is justly held to be <hi>Infinite</hi> in Being; it follows, that He has all the Positive Perfections in the Line of Ens or Substance that can be imagin'd, and possesses them all <hi>Indivisibly</hi> in <hi>One most Actual</hi> Formality of <hi>Being;</hi> whence 'tis impossible to apprehend there should be any Distinction or Plurality at all in GOD, <hi>as</hi> he is <hi>thus</hi> conceiv'd, or under that precise Notion of meerly <hi>Being;</hi> since under that Notion He is <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisibly One;</hi> which farther appears hence, that even our ordinary Notion of [Existence] is <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible;</hi> much more must it be such when it is <hi>Infinite.</hi> Wherefore, it being no less evidently shown, Sect. 4. that there are some <hi>Particular</hi> Notions, or some sort of <hi>Plurality,</hi> Truly and Rightly Transferr'd to GOD, and <hi>Verify'd</hi> of Him: This must necessarily spring from our Conceiving GOD under some <hi>Other</hi> Notion (or some Notion that belongs to <hi>Another</hi> Head or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament) than that of <hi>Substance</hi> or meer <hi>Being;</hi> and, withall, from <hi>such a one</hi> as does not carry, along with it, when 'tis Transferr'd to Him, any Imperfection to the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:110692:252"/>

                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:110692:253"/>2. Nor need we look far to find what kind of Notion <hi>this</hi> is. We can no sooner consider, that GOD <hi>Knows and Loves Himself,</hi> (which is the Ground of all our Explication, and, as it were, the <hi>Text</hi> on which our Reason descants) but we must forcibly and immediately discover, that this Distinction in <hi>GOD</hi> must be taken from that Head of our Notions, call'd [RELATION.] For the <hi>Knower</hi> cannot be a Knower of <hi>Nothing,</hi> but of some <hi>Thing</hi> or some <hi>Object,</hi> which is <hi>Known</hi> by him: Nor can that Thing or Object be actually <hi>Known,</hi> but there must be some Thing which is a <hi>Knower</hi> of it; which shows those Notions are perfectly <hi>Relative</hi> to one another.</p>
               <p>3. Wherefore all the <hi>Distinction</hi> and <hi>Operation,</hi> which (as has been shown) is <hi>Verify'd</hi> to be in the Divine Nature, and all the Distinction of the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars we lately spoke of, must be taken from the <hi>Relations,</hi> according to which the Divine Nature is <hi>Referr'd</hi> to its self; and not <hi>formally</hi> and <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> from GOD'<hi>s Essence,</hi> which belongs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally to the Line of <hi>Substance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Nor need we fear to attribute <hi>Distinct</hi> and (some way) <hi>Opposite</hi> Predicates to GOD, and, consequently affirm that there is some kind of Distinction and Opposition in Him; since the Distinction necessarily imply'd in that Natural Notion we transfer to Him, does attribute to Him the Highest Perfection of His Nature as 'tis <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual;</hi> and is not Apply'd to Him according to the Notion of <hi>Ens</hi> or <hi>Being;</hi> but, according to Another Respect or Notion, which is Different from it; and (as is shown, <hi>Prel.</hi> X. and XI.) does not induce or require any Distinction formally of the <hi>Essence</hi> it self; Nay, when (as will be shown,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:110692:254"/>
Sect. VIII. §. 7.) that very <hi>Opposition,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it forces some kind of <hi>Plurality,</hi> does no less necessarily infer a <hi>more perfect Unity,</hi> (if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) in the Divine Nature, at least an Unity in <hi>more respects,</hi> than could have been Conceiv'd had there not been that kind of Distinction and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. Nor yet can any doubt of the <hi>Truth</hi> of this Thesis, which puts Distinct and Opposite Notions in GOD; since His Nature <hi>verifies</hi> those Distinct Notions, and Obliges us to Affirm them of Him, or Attribute them to Him.</p>
               <p>5. Since then these Particulars, which (as is shown, §§. 2. and 3) we <hi>truly</hi> attribute to GOD, must <hi>entirely</hi> be taken from the foresaid <hi>Relations;</hi> 'tis consequent, that the <hi>Number</hi> of them also must be taken from the <hi>Number</hi> of those <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. And, 'tis clearly Agreeable to Reason, that in those of the Former sort, there must be Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on <hi>both</hi> sides; which must, consequently, constitute, or rather Infers, <hi>Two Particulars.</hi> For, 'tis very Evident from §. 2. and, indeed, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to Common Sense, that (in our case) there is a <hi>Mutual</hi> Relation between the <hi>Knower</hi> and Thing <hi>Known;</hi> as is <hi>exprest</hi> by those <hi>very Words;</hi> nor can we Express them <hi>otherwise,</hi> while we must affirm that GOD <hi>Knows Himself.</hi> As will yet better appear, Sect. VII. §. 9.</p>
               <p>7. Which is hence confirm'd, because as GOD is essentially Infinitely-<hi>Intellective</hi> or rather <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;</hi> so He must also be Infinitely-<hi>Intelligible,</hi> or rather <hi>actually Known;</hi> otherwise there would want an <hi>Adequate</hi> Object of the Divine Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, which would also infer He is not <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Intelligent.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="401" facs="tcp:110692:254"/>8. These Relations are grounded materially and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>9. Wherefore, however the Divine <hi>Lover,</hi> when GOD <hi>Loves himself,</hi> cannot but have a Relation to the Thing <hi>Loved,</hi> because Love proceeds from the <hi>Goodness</hi> of the <hi>Object,</hi> and it's Agreeableness to it's (that is to GOD's) Nature; yet there is no Mutual Relation from the Thing <hi>Loved</hi> to the <hi>Lover,</hi> or to the <hi>Love</hi> of it. For the Greatest Good and Perfection of an Intelligent or <hi>Knowing</hi> Nature is <hi>Truth;</hi> and Truth does formally consist in this, that the <hi>Object</hi> is so <hi>in the Understanding,</hi> as it is <hi>in it's self,</hi> which is in our case, that the Divine <hi>Object Known</hi> is in the Divine <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or truly conceiv'd by it: Whence Love proceeds formally, properly and immediately, from <hi>both</hi> according to their <hi>Relative</hi> Notions by which they are <hi>Distinguisht,</hi> and not from the <hi>Absolute</hi> Notion which is <hi>Common</hi> to them <hi>both.</hi> Wherefore, since by §. 9. no Relation can be grounded on another <hi>Relation,</hi> and in case there were a <hi>Mutual</hi> Relation to the Lover, it must proceed or be grounded on the Relations of <hi>Knower</hi> and <hi>Known;</hi> it follows,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:110692:255"/>
that there can only be <hi>Three Relations;</hi> and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, (by §§. 4. and 5. as will be shown,) but Three <hi>Particulars</hi> in the Deity; nor can any <hi>more</hi> be attributed to it, according to our best Reason directed by True Principles, and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon our <hi>Natural Notions:</hi> That the <hi>Common Suppositum</hi> does not infer a <hi>Fourth</hi> Particular, will be seen, Sect. VI. §. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corollary.</hi> Since Divine Love proceeds from this that the Object is so in the Knower as it is in it self, which is the Formal Notion of <hi>TRUTH:</hi> Hence, 'tis seen, how much our Love ought to be set on <hi>Truth,</hi> which is the Natural Perfection of our Mind; how Like GOD those <hi>Noble</hi> Souls are whose Chief Affection is addicted to <hi>Truth,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Divine</hi> Truths: On the other side, how <hi>Ignoble,</hi> and <hi>Unlike</hi> GOD those Mean and Depraved Souls are who <hi>disregard</hi> TRUTH, and think the care of <hi>Promoting</hi> it is <hi>below</hi> their Empty Temporary Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That these Three Particulars are most fitly called PERSONS.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. THE next Question is, What Natural No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ours does most properly fit those <hi>Three Particulars,</hi> which we have been obliged to put in the Divine Nature; and what Word of ours does most fitly, and in the Common Usage of it, express that Notion. For, since we have granted in our Fifth Preliminary, that Christian Faith was Deliver'd at first in such Language as exprest our Natural Notions; that is, in such as was <hi>Usual</hi> in those Times and Places, and Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible by the Generality in their respective Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances; it cannot be deny'd but that we stand engag'd to show that our Explication must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise observe the same Rule, as to those Words which we pretend do signifie the Point of Faith it self, as exprest in our Catechisms and Creeds.</p>
               <p>2. To perform this as we ought, we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider first of what Notion or Nature those Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars must be conceiv'd to be; and because we have <hi>no</hi> Natural Notion but either of <hi>Substance,</hi> or it's <hi>Modes;</hi> it follows, that those Three Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars we speak of, must either be Particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>first</hi> sort of Notion [<hi>Substance;</hi>] or else according to some of the <hi>Later.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to clear this Point, and determine under <hi>which</hi> of these Notions they are Particulariz'd,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:110692:256"/>
we are to consider <hi>what</hi> it is that <hi>is</hi> thus Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lariz'd; and our former Discourse shows, that it is the <hi>Common Suppositum,</hi> or that which is that <hi>Absolute</hi> Notion, we call [GOD,] which is here Particulariz'd, or has these Particulars <hi>in it.</hi> And, indeed, there needs <hi>no</hi> more but these words, [<hi>God Knows and Loves Himself,</hi>] to evince this: For it is, hence, as Evident as plain Words can make any thing, that 'tis GOD who is the <hi>Knower,</hi> Thing <hi>Known,</hi> and <hi>Lover;</hi> which No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>give</hi> us, or rather <hi>are</hi> those very <hi>Particulars</hi> we speak of: Now, since the word [GOD] can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought to <hi>belong</hi> to, or be with any Sense, <hi>referr'd</hi> to any <hi>other of</hi> those Heads then that of <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Being,</hi> (whence as consider'd in an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and not in a <hi>Relative</hi> Sense, he is call'd the <hi>First Being,</hi>) hence 'tis GOD, conceiv'd under the Notion of <hi>Being</hi> or <hi>Substance,</hi> which is <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culariz'd.</hi> And, though GOD be not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lariz'd <hi>Substantially,</hi> or according to the <hi>Manner</hi> Substances are particulariz'd amongst us, which is that the Common Abstracted, Indeterminate or Potential Notions of the <hi>Genus,</hi> or <hi>Species,</hi> be <hi>Divided</hi> and <hi>Determin'd</hi> under the Notion of Ens, by means of Essential or Intrinsecal <hi>Differences,</hi> and so make <hi>more Entia,</hi> (for this, as was said lately, cannot be said of the <hi>Pure Actuality</hi> and <hi>Unity</hi> of the Divine Nature;) Yet he may be particulariz'd by reason of the <hi>Relative</hi> Conceptions verify'd of Him, which we have shown do not induce any Imperfection at all: Yet, as it is only the Common Suppositum or GOD, (taking that word in an Absolute Sense) which is <hi>Related,</hi> so it is only what's signify'd by GOD, (or the <hi>Primum Ens,</hi>) which is the <hi>Thing Particulariz'd.</hi>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:110692:256"/>
This being then manifest, and Particulars under the Notion of <hi>Substance,</hi> being most necessarily held to be Particular, <hi>Supposita,</hi> and, if they be <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent, [PERSONS;</hi>] it follows that these Three Particulars, or, <hi>Suppositums</hi> in GOD are fitly and properly to be call'd Three <hi>Divine PERSONS.</hi> And, he who will deny any part of this Discourse stands obliged to show either, that there are not Three Particulars in the Divine Nature; or, that it is not the Divine Nature under the Notion of <hi>Substance,</hi> which is the Thing <hi>Related,</hi> and thence <hi>Particulariz'd;</hi> or that Particulars under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Substance,</hi> are not to be call'd in true Speech, <hi>Suppositums;</hi> and, if they be <hi>Intelligent,</hi> in a vulgar word, <hi>PERSONS.</hi> He must also assign some other <hi>Notion</hi> under which we are to <hi>conceive</hi> them; and invent some other <hi>Name,</hi> sute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with our Natural Notions, by which we may <hi>call</hi> them. And, lastly, he stands bound to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the Reasons I have brought in my foregoing Explication for each of those Points. None of which, if he pleases to go to work like a Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and not Act a Banterer and Droll, he can. I am sure, ever be able to perform.</p>
               <p>3. This being so plain, I am sorry I must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that I am much dissatisfy'd that any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Writer, speaking of the <hi>B.

And, that it <hi>ought</hi> to be so, this Plain Reason farther evinces; because, since we cannot name them <hi>all at once;</hi> we must, in recounting them, forcibly name <hi>some One</hi> of them <hi>First:</hi> Nor could we give any good reason <hi>why</hi> we <hi>did this,</hi> unless there were some Consideration in <hi>that Person</hi> it self, which <hi>oblig'd</hi> us to it; otherwise we must be forced to say we did it <hi>without reason,</hi> or nam'd them <hi>at random.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. It remains then to show which of the Three Persons is the <hi>First;</hi> to give the reason <hi>why</hi> we put Him <hi>first;</hi> and, in <hi>what Sense,</hi> He is a <hi>First,</hi> or <hi>Principium,</hi> in that <hi>Order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Reflecting then on those Relations of <hi>Known</hi> and <hi>Knowing,</hi> we find that the <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rmer</hi> of these, the Divine Essence, as <hi>Known,</hi> has the Nature or Notion of an <hi>Object;</hi> and the Later, (there being no <hi>Potentiality</hi> in GOD) the Nature of <hi>Actual Knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and that our Natural Notions ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain us that the <hi>Knowledge</hi> proceeds from the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;</hi> for this is that which <hi>determines</hi> the Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of our Knowing Power by <hi>Informing</hi> it, and produces the Act of Knowledge; or, as the Schools phrase it, <hi>Specifies</hi> it. Whence, abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this way of producing Knowledge in us from all Potentiality and Causality, (as is most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it,) and only Applying to <hi>GOD</hi> what's Essential to the Notion of an <hi>Object;</hi> (in the being of which in our Understanding, Knowledge does necessarily consist,) we must rationally conceive and affirm, that the Divine Nature as <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or as <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Himself, does <hi>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="416" facs="tcp:110692:263"/>
it being Evident, that <hi>Love,</hi> which proceeds from the <hi>Goodness</hi> of the <hi>Object</hi> in our <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and, therefore, in this <hi>Order</hi> of our Natural Notions, necessarily <hi>presupposes</hi> the <hi>other Two,</hi> is with good Reason to be accounted the <hi>Third.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. For, in regard there can be no Adequate or Proper Object of the <hi>Divine Understanding,</hi> but the <hi>Divine Essence</hi> it self, and that all Others do fall Infinitely short of being worthy of it; hence, it is equally argumentative to say, that His <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> as it is <hi>Divine,</hi> proceeds from the <hi>Divine Essence</hi> as an <hi>Object;</hi> as it is, that <hi>our</hi> Knowledge of <hi>Nature</hi> does proceed from <hi>Nasural Objects;</hi> since, according to our most Natural and Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Notions, it as unavoidably follows, that GOD's Knowledge is therefore <hi>Divine,</hi> because the Object of it is GOD; as it follows that our Knowledge is therefore <hi>Natural</hi> because the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it is of <hi>Natural</hi> Notions; or <hi>Mathematical,</hi> because it has for it's Object those Notions which are <hi>Mathematical;</hi> nay, it would be Perfect Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense to affirm the <hi>contrary,</hi> or assign any <hi>other</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for it. So evidently Consonant it is to True Reason, and to our Natural Notions, to affirm that the Knowledge, even tho' <hi>Divine,</hi> does <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</hi> from the <hi>Divine Object;</hi> or, which is the same, that the Divine Nature as an <hi>Object</hi> is the <hi>First</hi> that we can possibly conceive in the Order of those Notions which we use when we say, [GOD Knows and Loves Himself;] or is the <hi>Beginning</hi> and <hi>Origin</hi> of <hi>Divine Knowledge,</hi> and, consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of <hi>Divine Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. To Explicate this yet more fully, and to clear our Natural Notion of <hi>Knowing,</hi> let us reflect on that passage of St. <hi>Austin</hi> at the end of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:110692:263"/>
[<hi>Nos ista quae fecisti videmus quia sunt: Tu autem quia vides ea, sunt.] We see, (or know) the things which thou hast made, because they</hi> are; <hi>but when thou seest them, thy Seeing them</hi> makes them bee. These last words show that when any Created Being proceeds from GOD, His <hi>Understanding</hi> does <hi>begin</hi> that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fair, and by <hi>Knowing</hi> it, <hi>makes</hi> them <hi>bee,</hi> or Creates them; but, in all <hi>other</hi> cases, our <hi>Knowledge</hi> comes from the Being of the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi> 'Tis then this Nature of Knowledge, thus Explicated, which is our <hi>Natural Notion</hi> of it, and which is Proper to our Soul as it is <hi>Spiritual.</hi> Wherefore we must either Transfer <hi>This</hi> to GOD, and say that His Knowledge <hi>comes from</hi> the Object; or else (having <hi>no Other</hi> Notion of it) we can never Understand the Meaning of those Words, [GOD <hi>Knows</hi> Himself,] nor, consequently Affirm that He <hi>does so.</hi> Certainly, nothing can be plainer than 'tis, that we cannot conceive this Knowledge to be <hi>of</hi> GOD, but because the Object of it is GOD. Wherefore, 'tis even <hi>hence</hi> most Evident, that the <hi>Procession</hi> of the Knowledge <hi>begins</hi> from the <hi>Object,</hi> or is <hi>originiz'd</hi> by it; So that the <hi>Knower,</hi> as <hi>such,</hi> has <hi>nothing</hi> but what he has from that which is <hi>Known.</hi> Whence follows, That this Priority of <hi>Order,</hi> spoken of above, must be a Priority of <hi>Origin,</hi> and has the Notion of <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation</hi> to what's <hi>principiated</hi> or <hi>proceeds</hi> from it: Nor does this kind of <hi>Priority</hi> put any <hi>Imperfection,</hi> or <hi>less Perfection</hi> in the Divine Nature as <hi>Knowing,</hi> more than it does in the same Nature as <hi>Known;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is equally Essential to the Divine Nature to be <hi>Knowing</hi> as 'tis to be <hi>Known;</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, 'tis impossible to conceive that <hi>one</hi> of the Correlates, considering them purely as <hi>Related,</hi>
                  <pb n="418" facs="tcp:110692:264"/>
(as is our case) should more <hi>depend</hi> on the <hi>Other,</hi> than that the <hi>Other</hi> should <hi>depend</hi> on It. Lastly, since, as appears by the words, [GOD <hi>Knows Himself,</hi>] both the Correlates are GOD, in whom is <hi>all Perfection</hi> imaginable; 'tis impossible, that either <hi>GOD</hi> as <hi>Known,</hi> or as <hi>Knower,</hi> should be in any sort <hi>Imperfect,</hi> notwithstanding the Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Origin</hi> between them; since this Priority arises out of that most Perfect Notion of <hi>Knowing,</hi> which necessitates, that the <hi>Knowledge</hi> must <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,</hi> or be <hi>originiz'd</hi> from the <hi>Object Known;</hi> as has been shown, §. 5.</p>
               <p>7. But to put it past contest, that, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we must be forced to allow that <hi>Knowledge</hi> is thus Originiz'd from the <hi>Object,</hi> yet there is not <hi>less Perfection</hi> in <hi>one</hi> than in the other, we lay this Position; <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>DEITY</hi> being <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely Perfect,</hi> where ever the <hi>Deity</hi> is, there must also be all the Perfections imaginable. Since then, when we say, [GOD <hi>Knows Himself,</hi>] both the <hi>Knower</hi> and Thing <hi>Known</hi> are GOD; there is found in each of them <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Absolute</hi> Attributes which belong to the <hi>DEITY,</hi> with the Connotate of [<hi>Infinite</hi>] annext to them; that is, all Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Perfections are both in the <hi>One</hi> and the <hi>Other.</hi> Moreover, amongst those Attributes, <hi>Self-Existence</hi> is one; if, indeed, it may be call'd an <hi>Attribute,</hi> and not rather, (as Metaphysicks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate) according to our manner of conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the very <hi>Essence</hi> of GOD; whence all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His Divine Attributes (according to our way of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing) spring. Since then <hi>Self-Existence</hi> is found in <hi>both,</hi> and the Notion of <hi>Self-existence</hi> bars all <hi>Imperfection</hi> or <hi>Dependence</hi> in Being, and all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="419" facs="tcp:110692:264"/>
'tis impossible to conceive that either of them should be Imperfect, or <hi>Dependent</hi> on the other. Again, since it is <hi>equally</hi> Essential to GOD to <hi>be Known,</hi> as it is <hi>to Know;</hi> and GOD cannot <hi>be Known</hi> without a <hi>Knower;</hi> if this Method of Objecting were Allowable where both are <hi>Infinite,</hi> we might with <hi>Equal</hi> Reason say, That the First Person, who is the Divine Object <hi>Known,</hi> depends on the Second, as that the Second, who is Divine <hi>Knowledge,</hi> depends on the First. 'Tis a Common Maxim, That <hi>Relationes mutuo se ponunt &amp; auferunt;</hi> and yet neither of them is said to be <hi>Dependent</hi> on the Other; since <hi>Mutual Dependence</hi> as to the <hi>Same</hi> Common Notion is direct Nonsence. But the main point is, that this Principiation or Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination does not formally respect the <hi>DEITY it self,</hi> or the Common Suppositum, any more in <hi>One</hi> than in the <hi>Other;</hi> but <hi>only,</hi> the <hi>DEITY</hi> as <hi>Related;</hi> that is, the <hi>Divine Personalities;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the <hi>Relation,</hi> (by <hi>Prelim.</hi> X.

               </p>
               <p>8. From this Discourse we see how the <hi>Trinity</hi> is <hi>in the Unity,</hi> because the <hi>Ground</hi> of all these Relations, that is, the Relations <hi>themselves;</hi> and, consequently, all the Three Persons, which are constituted by those Relations, are in that <hi>One Deity,</hi> or in the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Godhead:</hi> and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, how the <hi>Unity</hi> of the GODHEAD is in the <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Persons,</hi> because <hi>one</hi> and the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:110692:265"/>
Nature is in them all; as is evident from these very Terms; [<hi>GOD Knows and Loves Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>] Which, tho' Mysterious to the Rude and Unelevated Conceptions of Vulgar Discoursers, is, notwithstanding, (as has been shown) if we take each <hi>single</hi> consideration of it <hi>asunder</hi> by our Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractive or Natural way of conceiving, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course upon <hi>each</hi> of them <hi>distinctly,</hi> or as thus aparted, is perfectly <hi>Consonant to Reason</hi> working upon our <hi>Natural Notions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. We come next to consider by what <hi>Names</hi> this First and Second Person, the Divine Nature <hi>Known</hi> and <hi>Knower</hi> are to be call'd. In order to which we lay these Positions, <hi>viz.</hi> That GOD, who is in them both, is <hi>Living,</hi> (or rather Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially <hi>Life;</hi>) and, consequently, those two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in whom the Godhead is, must be <hi>Living</hi> also. Next, <hi>Knowledge</hi> cannot be otherwise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd but to <hi>come,</hi> or (as we use to say) <hi>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ceed</hi> from the <hi>Object;</hi> and therefore the Second Person must <hi>proceed</hi> from the First. Thirdly, The Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity communicates it's <hi>own Nature</hi> to the Knower, as appears by the words [<hi>Knows himself.</hi>] and also by <hi>Reason;</hi> for, otherwise, we could not say, [<hi>It</hi> is Known,] if <hi>It</hi> were not in the Knowledge or <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>njoyn'd</hi> with it <hi>Spiritually</hi> or intellectually. Now, if we spell these necessary Truths together, all which are imply'd in these words, [GOD <hi>Knows Himself,</hi>] we shall find they compound, and (not barely <hi>imply,</hi> but) <hi>fully express</hi> that the Definition of a <hi>SON</hi> is appropriated to the Second Person, <hi>viz.</hi> That He is a <hi>Living</hi> Person <hi>Proceeding</hi> from a <hi>Living</hi> Person, whose Nature is of the <hi>same Kind</hi> as the others, and is <hi>Conjoyn'd</hi> with him, or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains</hi> in him;] whence follows, that His Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:110692:265"/>
must properly and necessarily be call'd a <hi>FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER;</hi> and lastly, that the <hi>Procession</hi> of Him from His Father can therefore have no other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Word which we have, that can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>it it, but that of GENERATION.</p>
               <p>10. Hence it is, that <hi>Knowledge</hi> is Appropriated to the Second Person the <hi>SON;</hi> for which reason He particularly took our Flesh upon Him, and came to be our <hi>Master,</hi> and to <hi>instruct</hi> us in His Holy Law. Hence He is call'd <hi>Sapientia Patris,</hi> or <hi>Verbum,</hi> because <hi>Knowing</hi> does intellectually <hi>speak</hi> or <hi>express</hi> the Divine Nature <hi>Known</hi> by Him; as our Conception or <hi>Verbum Mentis</hi> does the <hi>Thing,</hi> or <hi>Truth,</hi> we conceive. Hence, He is truly said to be <hi>Deus de Deo, Lumen de Lumine, Deus verus de Deo vero:</hi> Because the Common Suppositum, the GODHEAD, is <hi>in both;</hi> and the Divine Nature as He is precisely a <hi>Knower</hi> is Originiz'd from <hi>it self,</hi> as it's own <hi>Object.</hi> Hence, lastly, Because of the Common Nature in <hi>both,</hi> and the Proceeding of <hi>One</hi> from the <hi>Other,</hi> He is call'd <hi>Imago Patris, Figura Substantiae ejus,</hi> &amp;c. All which, and many other such Expressions are exactly verify'd by the Principles here laid, and our Consonant Deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from them.</p>

Wherefore, since <hi>Sons</hi> amongst us, do proceed from their Fathers according to <hi>Specifical</hi> Likeness in Nature; it is most becoming GOD's Infinite Perfection, and His most <hi>ultimately Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mih'd</hi> Essence; that is, indeed the <hi>most Perfect</hi>

                  <hi>Unity</hi> of the GODHEAD it self, that His <hi>Coeternal Son</hi> should proceed from His <hi>Eternal Father</hi> according to the <hi>most Perfect IDENTITY</hi> of Nature that can be conceiv'd; that is, according to the self-same <hi>Numerical</hi> Nature. Wherefore this Divine Procession ought not to be explicated by Analogy to the <hi>Specifical</hi> Nature of <hi>Man,</hi> and it's being <hi>Common</hi> to more <hi>Individuals:</hi> For the <hi>Species</hi> does necessarily imply <hi>some</hi> Potentiality, tho' the <hi>Genus</hi> does <hi>more;</hi> and is <hi>Determinable</hi> (as was said) by <hi>Differences</hi> which are Intrin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>cal in the Line of <hi>Ens;</hi> and, therefore, (as was prov'd) do <hi>constitute</hi> formally more <hi>Entia,</hi> that is, more <hi>Things</hi> which have <hi>diverse Essences;</hi> all which is Inconsistent with the <hi>Divine Nature:</hi> Nor ought any Composition of such <hi>Superiour</hi> (or <hi>Potential</hi>) Notions be Transferr'd to GOD. And much less, since the <hi>Common Suppositum,</hi> (however it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated of more Particulars in the Manner expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated above,) has in it self, by virtue of it's own Infinite Self-Existence, the utmost Perfection in the Line of <hi>Substance;</hi> and is, by reason of it's <hi>Purest Actuality,</hi> more perfectly <hi>One Singular Absolute Being,</hi> than any <hi>Suppositum</hi> or <hi>Individuum</hi> is or can be amongst us Creatures.</p>
               <p>12. And the same, partly for the <hi>same</hi> reason, is, (<hi>Mutatis Mutandis</hi>) to be said of the <hi>Third</hi> Particular verify'd of GOD, or of the <hi>Third Person</hi> of the most B. Trinity. For, since it must be granted, that GOD <hi>Loves Himself,</hi> and the word [<hi>Himself,</hi>] in the <hi>Predicate</hi> of that Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, signifies the same as the word [GOD,] which is the <hi>Subject</hi> of it; 'tis as Evident, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature <hi>Loving</hi> is the same with the Divine Nature <hi>Loved,</hi> as it is that GOD is GOD. But,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:110692:266"/>
besides, that this is Evident from the very Terms, or the plain Sense of Words, there is Another very Peculiar Reason springing out of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Nature of <hi>LOVE,</hi> which according to our Natural and Vulgar Notions, (by which we are here to guide our selves) signifies to be Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Unitive</hi> of the <hi>Lover</hi> to the Thing <hi>Loved.</hi> Our Common Unstudy'd Thoughts and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage gives this to be <hi>True:</hi> If two Friends <hi>Love</hi> one another dearly, all Mankind uses to say, <hi>They are all One;</hi> and our B. Saviour prays to His Heavenly Father that He and His Disciples may be <hi>One,</hi> as Himself and his Father are <hi>One;</hi> that is, by Mutual <hi>Love;</hi> it being impossible those Words can <hi>there</hi> bear any other Signification.</p>
               <p>13. We have seen above, That <hi>Divine Love,</hi> which is the Third Person, proceeds from the <hi>Goodness</hi> of the Divine <hi>Object,</hi> or from the Divine <hi>Essence Known,</hi> (that is, the <hi>Father</hi>) in His own Divine <hi>Knowledge,</hi> in which consists <hi>Essential Truth;</hi> that this <hi>Truth</hi> is therefore GOD's <hi>Greatest Good;</hi> because this Infinite Truth is the Best Perfection of His Nature as it is <hi>Intelligent</hi> or <hi>Spiritual:</hi> That, because it does thus proceed from the Divine Object in the Divine Knowledge, this Third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son does, therefore, proceed from the Father and the Son <hi>immediately</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> according to their Distinct <hi>Personalities</hi> or <hi>Relations;</hi> and that, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, because no Relation can be grounded on Another <hi>Relation,</hi> but can only Refer what's <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,</hi> there can be no Reciprocal, Opposite or Distinct Relation of the Divine <hi>Object-Known</hi> to the <hi>Lover;</hi> nor, consequently, any occasion of conceiving a <hi>Fourth</hi> Person: It remains now to show, that since <hi>Love</hi> (by §. 12.) imports a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:110692:267"/>
                  <hi>Union</hi> or <hi>Conjunction</hi> of the <hi>Lover</hi> with that which it <hi>Loves;</hi> therefore, from the very Notion of the word [<hi>Conjoyn'd,</hi>] there must be some <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction</hi> between those which are thus <hi>Ioyn'd-to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:</hi> Since, what's in <hi>Every</hi> Respect <hi>One</hi> and the <hi>Same,</hi> cannot, without Injury to Common Sense, be said to be <hi>Conjoyn'd</hi> with it self in <hi>Any</hi> Respect, that is, Conjoyn'd <hi>at all.</hi> But in <hi>what manner</hi> does this Third Person proceed from the other Two? Not according to <hi>Likeness</hi> (or Identity) <hi>of Nature,</hi> as did the <hi>Son:</hi> but it <hi>presupposes</hi> this Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Conformity, Agreeableness or Identity of Nature in the Object as <hi>Known,</hi> and in the <hi>Knower</hi> as <hi>Knowing</hi> it; for, in this consists that Greatest <hi>Good</hi> call'd <hi>Truth,</hi> which is the Object of <hi>Love;</hi> and 'tis against all our Natural Notions to conceive <hi>Actual Love</hi> of a thing not Suppos'd to <hi>bee:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this <hi>Similitude</hi> of Nature is not the <hi>Formal Motive,</hi> nor the <hi>Manner</hi> by which Divine Love proceeds; but only this, that the other two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons according to their Distinction of <hi>Knower</hi> and <hi>Known,</hi> (in which consists Divine <hi>Truth</hi>) do inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate, as it were, that <hi>Bonum Dei,</hi> or <hi>Good,</hi> which is the Adequate Object of the <hi>Divine Will.</hi> The Son, therefore, proceeds from His Father, by having Communicated to Him the same <hi>Form,</hi> (as it were) or the Divine Nature as an <hi>Object</hi> which formally constitutes Him a <hi>Knower</hi> of it, and thence, a <hi>Son;</hi> The B. Spirit proceeds from the two other Persons as they are a <hi>Good</hi> to the Divine Nature; which it <hi>Affects,</hi> Spiritually <hi>clings</hi> to, or <hi>embraces;</hi> and so becomes or <hi>is</hi> Actually <hi>United</hi> or <hi>One</hi> with it. The Former (according to our weak manner of Conceiving) proceeds as coming <hi>from</hi> the Object Communicating it self <hi>to it;</hi> the Later,

               </p>
               <p>14. Having thus declar'd the Particularity or Distinction of the Three Divine Persons, in order to <hi>one another,</hi> it is seasonable to manifest, in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ext place, what Names and what Effects are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly to be Attributed to each of them, as they relate to <hi>us.</hi> Whence, it may appear, that as our Explication is Agreeable to <hi>Right Reason,</hi> so it is no less Consonant to Holy Scripture, and to the <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Language</hi> of the Christian Church. To mention a few Chief ones, will hint to us the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>est.</p>
               <p>15. Since then <hi>Being</hi> is the <hi>First,</hi> in Order, of all our Natural Notions, so that we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing to be <hi>Communicated,</hi> or to deserve <hi>Love</hi> unless it <hi>is:</hi> Hence the Notion of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being,</hi> is justly conceiv'd to be Appropriated to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the First Person, who is the <hi>Beginning</hi> and <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> of the rest, and communicates it to the <hi>Son;</hi> whence proceeds, (as was now said) the B. Spirit who is <hi>Divine Love.</hi> Hence, also, since <hi>Every thing Acts as it</hi> Is, He is said to be Author and Cause of all Created Being, or the <hi>Creatour</hi> of all things. Hence also He is said to be the <hi>Father</hi> of
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:110692:268"/>
all his Creatures, (in a Natural, but <hi>less Proper</hi> Sense) because He gives us our <hi>Being;</hi> and in a more especial manner, since His Only Son, by taking our Nature upon Him, made Himself, in some sort, our <hi>Brother:</hi> As also, in a <hi>Civil</hi> Sense; because it belongs to <hi>Fathers</hi> to <hi>provide</hi> for their Children, as His Heavenly Providence does for <hi>all</hi> His <hi>Creatures.</hi> Not to speak how He is a Father in a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Sense, as we are <hi>Re-generated</hi> by His <hi>Grace,</hi> given us freely for the Merits, and by the Means of His Eternal Son whom he sent amongst us to that end.</p>
               <p>16. What peculiar Attributes are appropriated to the <hi>Son,</hi> is declard above, §. 10. I only remark here, that when he is call'd <hi>Verbum,</hi> the <hi>WORD,</hi> by a Metaphor taken from our <hi>Verbum Mentis,</hi> that is, our Conception or Notion of an Object in our Knowing Power; we must take heed we do not understand, by those words, that Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Form of <hi>speaking Truth interiourly,</hi> which is found in <hi>Mental Propositions,</hi> which <hi>Affirm,</hi> or <hi>Deny;</hi> for even in Angels and Separated Souls (as has been demonstrated) Knowledge is <hi>above</hi> all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="428" facs="tcp:110692:269"/>
Good we affectionately long for. For this reason also, He is call'd our Spiritual <hi>Life;</hi> because Life consists in <hi>Self-moving;</hi> and nothing moves us so effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciously as <hi>Love,</hi> which is the proper Act of the <hi>Will,</hi> that Faculty that sets all our <hi>Inferiour</hi> Powers on work. And for the same reason, He is called particularly the <hi>Spirit;</hi> because as the <hi>Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> in the Body give us all our <hi>Natural Motion,</hi> so <hi>Divine Love,</hi> his peculiar Name; and Nature, gives us all our <hi>Supernatural</hi> Tendency to Heaven; so that no External or Interiour Actions we perform do avail us, or bring us the least Step nearer our True End, Eternal Happiness, unless either out of an Immediate or Remote Intention, it be done out of that Regard or <hi>Intuitus.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason why He is call'd [<hi>Spirit,</hi>] which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly signifies <hi>Breath,</hi> is, Because <hi>Breath</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> are in common speech Equivalent: [<hi>While I breath,</hi>] and [<hi>while I live,</hi>] having the same signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; as have also to <hi>Expire</hi> and to <hi>Die.</hi> Lastly, since <hi>Heavenly Love,</hi> which Divines call <hi>Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace,</hi> is our Supernatural <hi>Life,</hi> which (as was said) the Peculiar Influence of the Third Person does (as it were) <hi>inspire</hi> or <hi>breath</hi> into our Souls; hence, He is, from this Effect, by a Specifical Appellation, call'd the HOLY GHOST or <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> For, none can think He is call'd <hi>Spirit,</hi> meerly because He is of a <hi>Spiritual Nature,</hi> since this is an Attribute of the GODHEAD, and therefore <hi>Common</hi> to all the Three Persons; nor, because He proceeds from the Father and the Son by a kind of Imaginary Action call'd <hi>Spiration;</hi> of which I must, for my part, confess I can make no Conception, nor how it comes to be Transferr'd to GOD.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="429" facs="tcp:110692:269"/>18. I may perhaps incurr some. Censure for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Procession of the Holy Ghost, is to be explicated by <hi>Spiration,</hi> of which Word many Great Men have made use. The best way to clear my self from affecting Singularity, is to give my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons why I dislike it, and submit them to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Peers. First, Faith (as was shewn Preliminary V.) must have been deliver'd in such Language as is apt to signify our <hi>Natural Notions.</hi> Secondly, Hence, tho' it may be allowed to Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men, in <hi>Explicating</hi> this Mystery, to make use, upon occasion, of some Term of Art which is current in Schools; yet is it utterly Disallowable, to use any which has not for its <hi>Sense,</hi> some Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Notion of Mankind; otherwise it will <hi>Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the Explication instead of <hi>Clearing</hi> it. Thirdly, It is agreed, and most Consonant to Reason, that no Notion taken from <hi>Material</hi> Beings ought to be Transferr'd to GOD, but by the Intervention of <hi>Spiritual</hi> ones, to which they are Metaphosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally apply'd; in regard He is of a <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and not of a <hi>Corporeal</hi> Nature. Fourthly, There can be no Spiritual Notion that respects the Internal Nature of a Spirit, but Being, Knowledge, Will, and the Objects of these too last, which <hi>determin</hi> their Internal Operations. Fifthly, There is none of all these that seems Proper to signify the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of <hi>Divine Love,</hi> by <hi>Spiration.</hi> Not <hi>Being!</hi> for That, if Compleat, Stayes in its self, as being the most Absolute Notion: nor can it respect any <hi>other</hi> Notion conceivable in GOD other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than as an Object.

self; whereas <hi>Spiration</hi> has a Notion of something <hi>Transitive</hi> to <hi>Another.</hi> Sixthly, It has too much of <hi>Action</hi> in it's Formal Notion, which may hazard to breed a Conceit of <hi>Efficiency</hi> and <hi>Effect.</hi> And, lastly, Because, as apply'd here to signifie a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession from Father and Son, it can have <hi>no one</hi> Notion in it, and therefore it has <hi>None.</hi> For, since the Holy Ghost does proceed from them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their <hi>Personalities;</hi> that is, from the Divine Essence <hi>as Known,</hi> and <hi>as</hi> the <hi>Knower</hi> of it; and there can be <hi>no one</hi> Notion <hi>Common</hi> to Thing <hi>Known</hi> and <hi>Knower,</hi> which are so widely Different, being <hi>toto genere</hi> Disparate and Contradistinct, but <hi>Being;</hi> my Dulness cannot comprehend what <hi>one</hi> Notion the word [<hi>Spiration</hi>] can signifie; since it cannot be Univocally Apply'd to both; nor how it sutes with our Natural Notions we have of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Natures; nor in what manner, or for what reason it is Transferr'd to GOD: which makes me doubt that meerly the word [<hi>Spiritus</hi>] apply'd particularly to the Holy Ghost, was the best Ground of this recourse to <hi>Spiration,</hi> and not the Notion of any Virtue, or Operation which <hi>Nature</hi> has given us of a Spiritual Being. Notwithstanding, I doubt not but these Great Divines had some good meaning in it, tho' it colours not with my Thoughts: Nay, that they meant the same in substance which I do, tho' perhaps I do more nicely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And the same, I doubt not, may be said of all those Learned Writers who have of late Explicated this Mystery <hi>variously:</hi> of which the Anti-Trinitarians do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frivolously make great Brags, and hope to get some Advantage by it.

For, the Article of Faith it self <hi>Abstracts</hi> from <hi>all</hi> Explications, and stands Firm on it's <hi>own</hi> Grounds, Divine Revelation; tho' both They, I, and Others, should all of us fall short in Explicating it right in every particular. Thus much concerning the Names and peculiar Attributes of the Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and the Congruous Reasons why we apply such Attributes to each.</p>
               <p>19. Notwithstanding all that is said above, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these Appropriations in the performing Different Effects, belonging to the Particular No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and (as it were) Genius of each <hi>Person,</hi> as such; whenever <hi>GOD</hi> does any thing <hi>ad extra,</hi> or produces any Effect in His Creatures, the Whole Trinity concurs to that Action. For, since nothing can work but it must have the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or Essence proper to it's self; nor <hi>Act,</hi> unless it have a <hi>Will,</hi> the Notion of which is to be the <hi>Principle</hi> of Acting; nor can an Infinitely perfect Being <hi>act,</hi> without Knowing <hi>What,</hi> and <hi>How</hi> to Act; both the Eternal Father, Son, and Spirit, must all concur to every <hi>such</hi> Action. But 'tis otherwise in that which passes <hi>ad intra,</hi> or <hi>within</hi> the Deity it self, because of their Relative Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Opposition to one another. For, (if I may be allow'd to repeat so oft what is of most Importance) GOD, precisely as the Divine <hi>Object,</hi> or as <hi>Known,</hi> begets Divine <hi>Knowledge;</hi> and the Divine <hi>Essence</hi> in the Divine <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which is <hi>Essential Truth,</hi> and the most Proper and Best Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or <hi>Good</hi> of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Nature, is that Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Object from which Divine <hi>Love</hi> proceeds. Hence it is, that since God's <hi>Essence</hi> is <hi>Self-Existence,</hi> which is Infinitely <hi>Actual,</hi> and Infinitely <hi>Intelligible,</hi> or rather, Infinitely <hi>Known;</hi> it is Proper to say, that
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:110692:272"/>
the GODHEAD <hi>Self-Exists</hi> by the <hi>Father, Knows it Self</hi> by the <hi>Son</hi> who is <hi>Divine Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Loves</hi> it <hi>Self</hi> by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> who is <hi>Divine Love.</hi> Nor can any thing be more Agreeable to Reason than that it should be so, in case (as we ought) we will exalt GOD Infinitely above His Creatures: For, since Creatures do <hi>Exist</hi> by an Existence which is <hi>Accidental</hi> to them, whence it comes that their <hi>Powers</hi> by which they operate are in the Line of <hi>Quality,</hi> or are <hi>Accidents;</hi> It is therefore most Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that GOD, in whom there is nothing that is <hi>Accidental,</hi> but the most refined or sublim'd Notion of <hi>Substance,</hi> should exercise his own <hi>Essence</hi> upon <hi>Himself;</hi> and therefore should have a <hi>Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> Notion that is a <hi>Person,</hi> by and in which that Particular to which is specially appropriated Divine <hi>Essence</hi> should <hi>Exist;</hi> and, instead of <hi>Powers</hi> which are <hi>Accidents,</hi> should have parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Substances</hi> or <hi>Persons,</hi> by which He <hi>Knows</hi> and <hi>Loves Himself.</hi> And therefore, as is said above, GOD <hi>Self-exists</hi> or <hi>is</hi> by the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Father, Knows Himself</hi> by the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Son,</hi> and <hi>Loves Himself</hi> by the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>

               <p>2. But first, I complain that these Objecters <hi>confound</hi> themselves by not Distinguishing clearly their <hi>own</hi> Conceptions; and, therefore, neither <hi>We</hi> nor <hi>Themselves,</hi> know well what it is they would be at. Let us try then if we can <hi>unravel</hi> their Thoughts, which they have taken such pains to <hi>perplex.</hi> Can they deny that GOD <hi>Knows and Loves Himself?</hi> 'Tis certain they will not; for this makes GOD less Perfect than a <hi>Creature:</hi> Tho', as far as I see they never think of it, or what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences follow from it; notwithstanding (as was shown) this is the Ground-work on which all true Explication of this Mystery is built. Can they deny, that, this granted, (as it must be) we are forced to affirm that GOD is the <hi>Knower,</hi> and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>Known;</hi> as also the <hi>Lover</hi> and Thing <hi>Loved?</hi> The very words fly in their Faces, and tell them they <hi>deny</hi> that which is <hi>perfectly Equivalent</hi> to what they have granted.

'Tis
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:110692:273"/>
equally against Common Sense, unless they will say, that by the word [<hi>Himself</hi>] is not meant [GOD,] which is Self-evident. Can they say, that <hi>Knower</hi> and <hi>Known, Lover</hi> and <hi>Loved,</hi> are not <hi>Distinct,</hi> and (in some sort) <hi>Opposite</hi> Notions? All Mankind will laugh at them, and every Junior Sophister who ever heard of the Predicament of <hi>Relation</hi> will hiss them. Can they say that the Deity does not <hi>Verifie</hi> those <hi>Distinct</hi> Notions, or that we say <hi>False</hi> when we attribute them to GOD? Themselves will not affirm it. Can they say, That, tho' GOD Verifies them, yet there is no Distinction <hi>at all</hi> in GOD? This is pure Nonsense. For, First, These <hi>Distinct</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Attributes are not <hi>Extrinsecal</hi> Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but most <hi>Intrinsecal</hi> and even <hi>Essential</hi> to GOD; to <hi>Know</hi> and <hi>Love Himself</hi> being the Perfection of His <hi>Spiritual</hi> Nature, and one of His Chiefest Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes. Next, If those Notions do <hi>most formally</hi> import <hi>Distinction,</hi> and there be <hi>in</hi> GOD that which <hi>verifies</hi> them, there is what verifies Distinction, <hi>in</hi> GOD. May they not then with equal reason say, that <hi>Gold verifies</hi> the Notions of <hi>Yellow,</hi> and <hi>Heavy,</hi> yet there is no <hi>Yellowness</hi> or <hi>Weightiness</hi> in <hi>Gold?</hi> Can they say, That tho' there be <hi>Distinction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

To meet with them I desire them to reflect, that as there could not be any Instant in which GOD <hi>was not;</hi> so neither could any Instant be Conceiv'd in which He <hi>had not</hi> all His Perfections, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them that of Knowing and Loving Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and, consequently, in which his Divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence as an Object <hi>Known</hi> did not communicate it self to the Divine Knower of it. They may please to reflect too, that there are even <hi>amongst us</hi> many things <hi>before one another,</hi> nay, even as <hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>Effects,</hi> which are not so much as for <hi>one</hi> Instant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one another in <hi>Time.</hi> For Example: Bodies are therefore <hi>Passive</hi> because they have <hi>Matter</hi> in them; they are Passive <hi>thus,</hi> or <hi>Divisible,</hi> because they have <hi>Quantity</hi> in them; and <hi>Corruptible</hi> because they are <hi>Divisible;</hi> nay, 'tis also, in proper Speech True that the following ones <hi>proceed</hi> from those that are foregoing as their Causes; and yet they

Whence, for much better Reason may the Son <hi>proceed</hi> from the Father tho' they be both <hi>Coeternal.</hi> They will reply, That all these Effects <hi>proceed</hi> from <hi>Formal</hi> Causes, which may be conceiv'd not to <hi>pre-exist</hi> before one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And I reply, That in this present Explication all the Divine <hi>Processions</hi> are put to be by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Form,</hi> and not of <hi>Action</hi> or <hi>Efficiency;</hi> and I much fear that their Transferring <hi>Action</hi> to GOD in their Thoughts, which implies <hi>Motion,</hi> drew them into this Misconceit of Priority after the manner of a kind of Imaginary <hi>Time.</hi> According to the way of discoursing which I take the Divine Object <hi>Inexists</hi> in the Divine Knowledge; which, according to our Natural Notions is call'd <hi>Informing</hi> it. I have produced many Demonstrations both in the Second Preliminary to <hi>Solid Philosophy Asserted,</hi> and others (B. I. Ch. 6.) in my <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> to show that our Knowledge can be only made by this, that the <hi>Object</hi> it self is <hi>in</hi> our Understanding or <hi>informs</hi> it, when we <hi>Know;</hi> and that every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Knowledge we have is <hi>Specify'd,</hi> nay <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually Determin'd</hi> to be <hi>This,</hi> by the <hi>Object;</hi> and must <hi>proceed</hi> from it both as to its being <hi>at all,</hi> and also as to it's <hi>Being This.</hi> And I dare affirm, That let Witty Men beat their Brains till they are weary, they will never make any other Sense of what it is to <hi>Know,</hi> than this, That the Object <hi>Inexists</hi> in the Knowiag Power as <hi>Another</hi> Thing, or as some way <hi>Distinct</hi> from the Knower. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:110692:275"/>
this Notion of <hi>Knowing</hi> abstracts from <hi>sooner</hi> or <hi>later, Eternal</hi> or <hi>Not-Eternal;</hi> and therefore may, in this regard, be sitly <hi>Apply'd</hi> to GOD, who Knows Himself <hi>Eternally;</hi> and because (as has been often said) this Knowledge comes from the Divine Object from all Eternity; hence it <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>must</hi> be also <hi>said</hi> to <hi>Proceed</hi> or be <hi>Originiz'd</hi> from it from all Eternity: since he <hi>Formally</hi> becomes a <hi>Knower</hi> by means of that <hi>Object-Known.</hi> This is all the Priority Christian Divines acknowledge. This abstracts even in us Creatures (I mean in Souls Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated and Angels, who in the <hi>First Instant</hi> Know Themselves) from all <hi>other</hi> kinds of Priority. Whence 'tis very weak to infer hence, that the Father is <hi>Prae-existent,</hi> as if there were any imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Instant in Eternity, in which the Father <hi>was,</hi> and the Son <hi>was not;</hi> or that the Son for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is not <hi>Self existent;</hi> since, besides the want of such a Priority as they fancy and build their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection upon it, all the Absolute Attributes of the Deity, and amongst them <hi>Self-Existence,</hi> and <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> too, are Communicated to Him <hi>by,</hi> and <hi>in,</hi> the Divine Essence <hi>Known,</hi> or from the <hi>Father.</hi>

Another Bugbear to their <hi>Fancy,</hi> (for 'tis <hi>That</hi> and not <hi>True Reason</hi> that gives the Ground to all their Objections) is this; That, by our Discourse, God the Father must <hi>communicate</hi> his <hi>Essence,</hi> and his <hi>whole</hi> Essence to the Son; which they think is sufficiently overthrown by meerly asking, [How should both have the <hi>same</hi> thing? especially, How should He <hi>have it still</hi> who has already Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated it, or <hi>Parted with</hi> it <hi>all?</hi>] And this looks very plausibly to those poor Ignorant Souls who never reflected on <hi>Spiritual</hi> Natures, but think we must discourse of them in the same manner as we do of

               <p>6.

But 'tis prodigiously weak to object this in our case, where the Discourse is of <hi>GOD's Knowing Himself,</hi> and where it is granted that He does so; unless those Gentlemen think that the Word [<hi>Himself,</hi>] in that speech, does not signifie [GOD;] or else they conceit that GOD is the <hi>Worse</hi> by Knowing Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; that is, the <hi>Worse</hi> for being <hi>Infinitely Perfect;</hi> for in such Nonsense as this, all their Objections against the most B.

               </p>
               <p>7. Tho' I cannot but judge that enough has been said, both <hi>here,</hi> and indeed in divers places of this Treatise, to assert and manifest, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this Distinction or Plurality of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, there is not the least Show of prejudicing the <hi>Unity</hi> of the GODHEAD; yet it were not amiss to add one Consideration more, which will much surprise the Anti-Trinitarians, and be lookt upon by them as a most strange Paradox: which is, that the <hi>Unity</hi> of the GODHEAD is so far from
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:110692:277"/>
being violated by a <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Persons,</hi> that it is in divers regards <hi>better Strengthen'd</hi> by that Position. To show which I premise this <hi>Lemma;</hi> That That <hi>Unity</hi> is Best which is <hi>every manner of way</hi> such, and not that which is <hi>not so:</hi> Whence follows that such a Compleat Unity <hi>in all Regards</hi> ought to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd to the GODHEAD. Wherefore, since it has been by so many Demonstrations (quoted and related to above) prov'd, I hope beyond all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of Confute, that <hi>Knowledge</hi> consists in this, that the Nature <hi>Known,</hi> (even tho' it be of a Material or Corporeal thing, which is of a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> Nature to that of the Knower) must, out of the very Notion of being <hi>Kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore, since it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Divine <hi>Unity,</hi> to be <hi>Infinitely,</hi> and, consequently, <hi>every way</hi> such; even out of this very consideration, secluding all others, there ought to be admitted a <hi>Trinity of Persons.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Substance of the foregoing Explication, Recapitulated.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>1. TO sum up the precedent Explication in short. Since GOD Knows and Loves <hi>Himself,</hi> there is in the Divine Nature what does <hi>Verifie</hi> both <hi>Knower</hi> and <hi>Known, Lover</hi> and <hi>Loved.</hi> Wherefore since each of these Pairs of Notions, they being relatively <hi>Opposite,</hi> have unavoidably some <hi>Distinction</hi> in them; and being <hi>verify'd</hi> of GOD are <hi>in</hi> the Divine Nature, there is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily <hi>some</hi> Distinction in the Divine Nature. Again, since these Notions, which are <hi>Verify'd</hi> of GOD, and therefore (since they cannot be thought to be <hi>Extrinsecal</hi> Denominations) are really <hi>in</hi> Him, are <hi>Distinct,</hi> and not <hi>Common</hi> Notions to Many; but each of them <hi>singular</hi> in it's self; they must be <hi>Particulars,</hi> to which the word [GOD] is <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and (in some manner or other) predicated of them all: There are therefore <hi>in</hi> GOD, (in some Sense or other) <hi>Distinct Particulars:</hi> As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears farther, because this Predication is made by the Copula [<hi>Est,</hi>] which <hi>Identifies</hi> those Particulars with the Common Predicate, (GOD;) that is, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies these Distinct Particulars are <hi>Intrinsecal</hi> to the Divine Nature, and not Apply'd to it <hi>Outwardly</hi> by our false or untoward <hi>manner</hi> of Conceiving it, but spring out of the very <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Thing</hi> (or Divine Nature) <hi>truly</hi> Conceiv'd. Also, since what's meant by the word [GOD,] must be conceiv'd to have <hi>All</hi> Perfections in it in the Line of <hi>Being,</hi> of
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:110692:278"/>
which to be <hi>Subsistent,</hi> or a <hi>Suppositum,</hi> is <hi>One;</hi> we must be forced to say, that what's meant by the word [GOD] is not only <hi>Common</hi> in respect of those others, but also that 'tis a <hi>Common Suppositum;</hi> and, that it is the <hi>Common Suppositum</hi> which is <hi>Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd</hi> of all those <hi>Particulars.</hi> And, since it cannot be Verify'd or Predicated of them as a <hi>Genus</hi> or <hi>Species,</hi> because These do necessarily include <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination</hi> and <hi>Potentiality,</hi> which are Inconsistent with GOD's Purest <hi>Actuality;</hi> therefore it must be Predicated of them after such a manner as is <hi>not</hi> Generical or Specifical, but in such a way as a Notion which is in <hi>One</hi> Line is predicated of such Notions as are conceiv'd to be <hi>Formally</hi> in <hi>Another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. These Particulars can be but <hi>Three,</hi> tho' there seems to be two Conjugations (as it were) of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually <hi>Opposite Relations.</hi> Because Divine <hi>Love</hi> ought to proceed from the Greatest GOOD that can be conceiv'd to belong or be Connatural to GOD as He is of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Nature; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>Infinite Truth;</hi> or, (which is the same) from Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite or Divine <hi>Truth Known</hi> in the Divine <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi> which amounts to this, that Divine <hi>Love</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Two other Particulars <hi>formally</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their <hi>Relations.</hi> Whence no Correlation can be from those other Persons to Divine <hi>Love</hi> which <hi>thus</hi> proceeds from them; because Relation is Grounded on that which it <hi>Refers</hi> or <hi>Relates:</hi> It being then Evident, that whatever is the <hi>Ground</hi> of Relation, or <hi>Related,</hi> must be some <hi>Absolute</hi> Notion, and not such a one as is <hi>Relative;</hi> it follows, that there cannot be any <hi>Correlation</hi> where the Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Ground is a <hi>Relative</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>3. These Three Distinct Particulars, <hi>Verify'd</hi> of GOD, and therefore Truly <hi>in</hi> the Divine Nature,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:110692:278"/>
are properly to be called <hi>PERSONS;</hi> because, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ONS. There are therefore <hi>Three Persons</hi> in GOD. Amongst which, since Knowledge formally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from an <hi>Object</hi> of the <hi>same</hi> Nature in both the Knower and thing Known; and to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a <hi>Living</hi> Nature to another <hi>Living</hi> Particular, is to GENERATE; hence this Procession is truly call'd GENERATION; and therefore the Divine Object Known, from which Divine Knowledge thus proceeds, is truly (tho' in a Spiritual Sense) call'd a <hi>FATHER,</hi> and the Divine Knowledge a SON; and the former of these is the <hi>First</hi> by way of <hi>Origin;</hi> because Knowledge must be conceiv'd to <hi>proceed</hi> from the <hi>Object;</hi> and not the <hi>Object,</hi> or <hi>Thing</hi> to proceed from the <hi>Knowledge,</hi> unless that Knowledge makes it to <hi>be,</hi> or <hi>Creates</hi> it, as the Divine Wisdom does Creatures. The <hi>Third</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is properly call'd <hi>Divine Love,</hi> because Love proceeds from that which is our Greatest and most Connatural <hi>Good,</hi> perfectly and expresly <hi>Known,</hi> or (as we phrase it) <hi>conceited,</hi> (or fully conceiv'd) to be such. Now the Greatest <hi>Good</hi> of GOD who is of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Nature, is Essential <hi>TRUTH,</hi> which (as was said) consists in this, that GOD <hi>knows Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;</hi> or (which is the same) that the Divine <hi>Object</hi> is in the Divine <hi>Knower:</hi> By which is seen <hi>How</hi> and <hi>Why</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> who is <hi>Divine Love,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from both the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Wherefore, since, as appears by those oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recited Words on which we build our Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Common Suppositum, exprest by the word
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:110692:279"/>
[GOD] has in it <hi>All</hi> the Perfections that can be imagin'd, and this <hi>Infinitely;</hi> hence all the Three Persons having the <hi>common Suppositum,</hi> or the GODHEAD, in them, are <hi>Coeternal, Co-omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> &amp;c. and in every respect <hi>Co-equal,</hi> as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest in ihe Creed of St. <hi>Athanasius.</hi> Whence all Objections of their being before one another for some <hi>Time,</hi> or some <hi>Instant,</hi> as also of <hi>Dependence</hi> on one another; and all Distinction in <hi>Nature,</hi> or imagin'd <hi>Plurality</hi> of <hi>Gods;</hi> are Diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> Lastly, hence all pretended Arguments taken from <hi>Fancy</hi> (for, from True Reason none at all can be drawn) are, by the respective parts of this Explication, shewn to be frivolous, and either <hi>Answer'd,</hi> or else <hi>Forestall'd</hi> and <hi>Prevented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. If the Anti-Trinitarians have any Objections in their <hi>Quiver,</hi> I have set them here a fair <hi>Mark,</hi> at which they may <hi>level</hi> them. They may see here, that I do not wrap my Discourse in Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity of words; but I <hi>distinguish</hi> my Notions as <hi>exactly</hi> as is possible, and <hi>draw</hi> my Conclusions <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently:</hi> Nor have I any Deductions which are nor grounded on <hi>Principles.</hi> But I foresee that they will not be able to raise any Opposition which is not built on <hi>Faneies,</hi> taken from <hi>Material</hi> Beings, which are too grofs to be made use of when we are discoursing of GOD, and altogether unfit to be Transferr'd, in <hi>their</hi> rude sense, to so <hi>sublime</hi> a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; or else that they are occasion'd by perfect <hi>Ignorance</hi> of <hi>Spiritual</hi> Natures and their Operations. The main Distinction between <hi>which</hi> and <hi>Bodies</hi> is this, that, whereas <hi>Bodies</hi> being <hi>Divisible</hi> Entitites, can have nothing in them (Matter supposed) but their own Accidents or <hi>Modes,</hi> which <hi>Determine</hi> the
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:110692:279"/>
Matter thus or thus, and thence, make it this or the other <hi>Individuum,</hi> so that a Corporeal Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situm or Thing can have nothing in it but its <hi>own</hi> Nature, and its own <hi>Intrinsical</hi> Modes which have no Being but <hi>Its:</hi> A <hi>Spiritual</hi> Being, (which is so far Superiour to it, that it is constituted by its Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, [<hi>Indivisible</hi>] which is of a (<hi>Contradictory</hi> Nature to it,) can, therefore, by its Proper Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, [<hi>Knowing,</hi>] have <hi>all other</hi> Essences or Natures in it <hi>besides its own,</hi> and <hi>engraft</hi> them (as it were) on its <hi>Stoek</hi> of Being; and in such a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from the former, that, as they are <hi>in It,</hi> they are no <hi>Part,</hi> or <hi>proper Mode,</hi> of the Spiritual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self, nor any <hi>Intrinsical</hi> Accidents of it; but they are there formally <hi>as Others,</hi> or as <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from it;</hi> nor are they <hi>Dependent</hi> on the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Nature that Knows them, for their <hi>Being,</hi> as were the <hi>Corporeal</hi> Modes on their <hi>Subject;</hi> but they have a <hi>Proper</hi> Being of their own <hi>out of</hi> the Understanding, and <hi>Independently on it.</hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise when they have an Act of <hi>Love,</hi> they have a Propension, Tendency, or Panting after the <hi>Object</hi> of that Love, and an endeavour to be <hi>Conjoyn'd</hi> and <hi>United</hi> to it by way of Attainment or Fruition of the <hi>Good</hi> they conceive to be in it: Whence 'tis plain that they are carry'd to it as it is <hi>Another,</hi> or as 'tis <hi>Distinct from themselves.</hi> So that even when an Angel, or a Soul, Knows and Loves <hi>its self,</hi> they must, in some Respect or other, be <hi>Distinct</hi> from themselves, as they are the <hi>Object</hi> of that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Love; as the very word [<hi>Object</hi>] does Evidence; and as manifestly appears from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tithesis between Knower and Known, Lover and Loved. Only, because (as was shown above) in <hi>Creatures,</hi> which are not <hi>Self-Beings,</hi> this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:110692:280"/>
(and consequently Love) are <hi>Accidental</hi> to them, in regard that even their <hi>Existence</hi> (which this Knowledge and Love presupposes) is <hi>Extrinsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> and <hi>Accidental</hi> to their <hi>Essence;</hi> therefore this <hi>Distinction</hi> which <hi>Self-Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Self-Love</hi> makes in them, and which is the <hi>Immediate</hi> Ground of those <hi>Relations,</hi> cannot make Distinction in their <hi>Substance:</hi> Whereas in GOD, in whose Essence there can be no <hi>Accidents,</hi> nor any thing <hi>Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> but purely <hi>Substance;</hi> Self-Knowledge and Self-Love must necessarily Distinguish, and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, Particularize the <hi>Substance;</hi> and hence <hi>Particulars</hi> of a Substance which is <hi>Intelligent,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in proper Speech, call'd <hi>Persons,</hi> it obliges us to put a <hi>TRINITY</hi> of PERSONS in the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Nature,</hi> or in the UNITY of the GODHEAD.</p>
               <p>6. Perhaps it may be Objected, That I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with my self, while I say, that there are no <hi>Accidents</hi> in GOD; and therefore only His <hi>Substance</hi> is Particulariz'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whence we infer Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Persons; and yet, we put <hi>Relation</hi> in GOD which is an <hi>Accident.</hi> I answer, (that) as appears by our State of the Question, we do not put Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in GOD, <hi>as He is in Himself,</hi> but only <hi>as He is Conceiv'd by us;</hi> and that, as we conceive Him according to our Natural Notions, it is impossible to conceive, or speak of Him <hi>otherwise.</hi> To the Objection 'tis Reply'd, that we do not Transfer the Notion of <hi>Relation</hi> to GOD without stripping it first of its Imperfection which is to <hi>inhere</hi> in GOD as in its <hi>Subject,</hi> or as a <hi>Mode</hi> of it; which implies <hi>Potentiality</hi> in the Subject, and <hi>Dependence</hi> on it in the <hi>Form.</hi> We have already shown that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, (meerly as Relation) does add no Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Imperfection to that on which 'tis Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:110692:280"/>
and which has an <hi>Absolute</hi> Notion: As <hi>Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> between two Things that are <hi>White,</hi> adds in <hi>neither</hi> of them the least Perfection or Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>their</hi> Absolute Notion; that is, it makes nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them more or less <hi>White.</hi> Wherefore the Relations in GOD are as <hi>Essential</hi> to Him as is the Knowing and Loving Himself, which <hi>Grounds</hi> these Relations. Nor is this Peculiar in the <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Notions we apply to GOD; for Mercy, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Goodness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the rest of such Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes are <hi>Qualities</hi> in us, and exprest as such; and yet they are <hi>Essential</hi> to the <hi>DEITY;</hi> and have their Natures which they had as <hi>Accidents,</hi> Dignify'd to be several Inadequate Conceptions of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Essence</hi> it self.</p>

                  <p>Of what <hi>vast</hi> Importance and most Efficacious Influence the Belief of the Blessed TRINITY is to <hi>Christian Life,</hi> and to the <hi>raising</hi> our Thoughts and Affections towards <hi>Heaven.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>1. I Doubt not but the Anti-Trinitarians will complain sadly of the Christian Church as barbarously Uncharitable, for cutting off from the Body of their Society, Excommunicating and delivering over to Satan so many well-meaning Persons who embrace their Sentiment. They will ask why the Denying a Tenet, which is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Speculative,</hi> should be so hainously taken and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely resented? They will be apt to liken Church-Governours to those hot-headed School-Divines
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:110692:281"/>
who all-to-be-Heretick those who will not allow their Opinion. They will pretend that, as long as Men do sincerely Worship the only True GOD, and keep His Commandments (which they will profess they do from their Hearts hold and intend) no more can in reason be requir'd. Is not this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, will they say, for Salvation? Must the Seamless Coat of Christ be torn and shatter'd to pieces, Charity and Church-Communion be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the height, for the sake of a <hi>Speculative</hi> Tenet; which, however it may please some, can sute with the Fancies of <hi>very Few;</hi> perhaps <hi>None,</hi> if they would but lay aside their Customary Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, which Education and not Judgment has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them; and set themselves seriously to reflect how <hi>Uncouth</hi> it is to their Reason, and how utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Unuseful, Ineffectual, and of no Influence at all, it is to Good Life, Piety, and Virtuous Action. Thus they will plead for their Impious Doctrine, and Schismatical Fact; and their Apology will be receiv'd with Applause, by all the <hi>Latitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarian</hi> Party. For nothing is so Cheap, and Costs so little, and withal is so Necessary for those who are destitute of Solid Reasons, as 'tis to Affect and have Recourse to <hi>Godly Cant,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. In Answer, First, we will speak to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> and their <hi>Guilt</hi> or <hi>Innocence;</hi> then to the <hi>Point</hi> it self. We ask then those Rabbies of the Anti-Trinitarians, Who taught them that piece of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which they proceed upon as if it were a a Self-evident Principle, that the way to determine what we are to Believe, what not, is to <hi>begin</hi> our Enquiry by scanning the Articles of Faith them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by our <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Obvious Reason;</hi> and to make This the <hi>Test</hi> of what we are to <hi>Accept,</hi>
                  <pb n="451" facs="tcp:110692:281"/>
what to <hi>Reject.</hi> For, First, they cannot but see <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hat this takes away the very Notion of <hi>Faith</hi> out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f the Hearts of Mankind. I suppose by [<hi>Reason</hi>] <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd therefore can be no <hi>Rule</hi> at all. And, if they will not believe but upon <hi>Evident Reason,</hi> then 'tis <hi>Science;</hi> and so farwell <hi>all Faith.</hi> Secondly, If they say they intend only to Evidence the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Tenet to be <hi>False,</hi> and not any Point of Faith to be <hi>True;</hi> we are but where we were. For, where the Tenets in Question are <hi>Contradictories,</hi> as 'tis here; he that Evidences the <hi>Trinity</hi> of Persons in the GODHEAD to be <hi>False,</hi> does, with the same Labour, and at the same time, Evidence the <hi>Unity</hi> of Person in the same GODHEAD to be <hi>True:</hi> Since then this later is a Point of <hi>Faith</hi> with them, they must still grant that, by Evidencing this, they turn <hi>Faith</hi> into <hi>Science.</hi> Thirdly, This Tenet, amongst others, was held by themselves, e're they renounc'd it, to have come to them by <hi>Divine Revelation;</hi> wherefore, they are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by recurring to this New Rule of <hi>Humane Reason,</hi> to bid adieu to all <hi>Divine Revelation;</hi> and, so, they fall in with the <hi>Deists;</hi> For, why should <hi>one</hi> Point of Faith be received upon their Rule of <hi>Humane Reason,</hi> and not <hi>All.</hi> Fourthly, They are False to their <hi>own Rule,</hi> and their own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; and therefore are not to be <hi>Credited,</hi> nor without some straining of Charity, to be excus'd as to their having <hi>Sincere Intentions.</hi> An <hi>Evident Proof</hi> can be no other but a clear <hi>Demonstration,</hi> and to this I have not observ'd they ever so much as <hi>pretended.</hi> 'Tis easie to call any pretty <hi>probable</hi> Proof an <hi>Evidence,</hi> so it be but sutable to <hi>Fancy:</hi>
                  <pb n="452" facs="tcp:110692:282"/>
But <hi>Demonstration</hi> carries something that is <hi>Manly, Decisive</hi> and <hi>Victorious</hi> in its Notion; to which therefore 'tis dangerous for <hi>Plausible</hi> and <hi>Probable</hi> Discoursers to pretend. A True Demonstration must be built on <hi>Principles</hi> that are <hi>Evident,</hi> and finally reducible to <hi>Self-Evidence:</hi> So must the Consequence of it too, and the <hi>Medium</hi> must be such as is most <hi>necessarily Connected</hi> with the two <hi>Extremes.</hi> What I affirm then is, that they have not Produc'd so much as <hi>One</hi> Demonstration, (however they would have it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hought they have,) though they cautiously mince it in the Expression. If they have any such let us see it, let us hear of it. I will grant them that <hi>any One,</hi> which is truly such, will conclude the Point, and carry the Cause. They have seen my Explication, what Grounds I proceed upon, and what Principles I build on. Wherefore, to make short work of it, I send them a flat Challenge to produce this one Demonstration of theirs against this Mystery. Half a Sheet of Paper will <hi>conclude</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, as far as it depends on the way of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reason;</hi> to which they have appeal'd from <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> and from the <hi>Iudgment</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Christian Church. If they be <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi> they will put it to the Tryal; if they <hi>refuse,</hi> they give themselves to be <hi>Guilty</hi> of persisting <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily</hi> in an <hi>Errour,</hi> and manifest that they <hi>took up</hi> this Pretence of <hi>Evident Reason</hi> for a Stale to draw after them the <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Unstable;</hi> but that they do not think it their Interest to <hi>stand</hi> to the Rule themselves have espoused. Fifthly, By renouncing <hi>this</hi> Fundamental of Christian Faith, they have, by Consequence, invalidated <hi>all</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith, by denying the <hi>Certainty</hi> of the Ground
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:110692:282"/>
of <hi>All</hi> Faith. For this was held by the Christian Church upon <hi>some</hi> Ground; which, by their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession as to this Point, they have Renounc'd; and by consequence, have brought all Christian Faith into a <hi>Groundless</hi> Uncertainty. Lastly, By their <hi>Denial</hi> of this Article, they <hi>accuse</hi> the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church of being <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> in the most Fundamental Article of her Faith, and in the greatest part of her Worship, in Adoring so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, heartily and devoutly, a <hi>Man</hi> for GOD, and a <hi>Creature</hi> for the Dread <hi>Creatour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. To summe up then this whole Discourse. If the taking away the Notion of <hi>all Faith,</hi> and turning it into <hi>Science.</hi> If to renounce, by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> which none but <hi>Deists</hi> professedly Oppose. If the Injury done to <hi>Humane Reason,</hi> (besides the <hi>misapplying</hi> it) and the <hi>Fourbe</hi> put upon weak Souls, in setting up for <hi>Evident Reasoners,</hi> without offering so much as <hi>One</hi> Argument which is in true Speech <hi>Evident,</hi> or Conclusive; If the <hi>undermining</hi> the <hi>Ground</hi> on which <hi>all</hi> Faith is built, as to our Knowledge of it. Lastly, If the <hi>accusing</hi> their former <hi>Superiours,</hi> the Church-Governours, so many Venerable, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Holy <hi>Fathers</hi> of the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="454" facs="tcp:110692:283"/>
still to remain in her, would hazard to infect with their Contagious Doctrine and Practice the Sounder Faithful. If these things, I say, be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly so, then the Church and her Governours are <hi>Acquitted,</hi> and the Blame and Guilt lie evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently at <hi>their</hi> Doors: This is the true Point to be <hi>Decided.</hi> Which, I believe every Man of Common Sense, were they of the Jury, would quickly <hi>determin,</hi> without needing to go from the Bar to debate it, or consider of it.</p>
               <p>4. But this is not all that may be alledg'd against them; There seems moreover, to be imply'd in their Discourses, that the <hi>most perfect</hi> Law and <hi>most Elevating</hi> Principles of Christianity are no better than that most Imperfect State of the <hi>Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> which rais'd Men to no higher a pitch than that of meer <hi>Moral Honesty;</hi> in which divers of the Antient Heathens excell'd many Christians. What Necessity was there, in such a case, that Christ our Saviour should come amongst us, take such pains in Preaching and working Miracles, Suffering a most Cruel Death on the Cross, Rising again from the Dead, Ascending into Heaven, and Sending His H. Spirit, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Certainly, it had been very Prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous to have laid so many <hi>Supernatural, Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> and <hi>Prodigious</hi> Means, to compass such an End, as was within the Power of Nature, without Miraculous or Supernatural Assistance, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve.</p>
               <p>5. This shews their sleight Opinion of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> Law. the Nature of it's <hi>Principles</hi> and the <hi>Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy</hi> of the Motives it proposes; which was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God's Wisdom to purifie in the <hi>best</hi> manner the hearts of the Faithful, and to raise them to the Love of Heaven by the most Powerful Means Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

If GOD had not been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to us, and believ'd by us to be <hi>Iust,</hi> what Sinner would not have run on in Sin, presuming He was <hi>Unconcern'd</hi> in Sublunary Actions, and would never <hi>call him to account</hi> for his Sins? Or, if he held him severely <hi>Iust</hi> and not <hi>Merciful,</hi> what poor Creature, conscious to himself how often he had grievously Offended Him, would not <hi>Despair</hi> of Pardon, think all was irrecoverably lost, and thence run forwards headlong in Sinning; wanting En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, or <hi>Hope</hi> of any Favour, in case he should return, and repent? Who would at all <hi>Love</hi> Him, if he did not think Him <hi>Good; Believe</hi> in Him if He were not <hi>Veracious;</hi> or <hi>Trust</hi> in Him if He were not <hi>Faithful</hi> and <hi>Powerful?</hi> Or, lastly, Who would care to lead a <hi>Holy</hi> Life, if He deem'd that GOD was not <hi>Holy Himself?</hi> So that all sorts of the Best Virtues, Faith, Hope, and Charity, would be <hi>banisht</hi> out of the Thoughts of all Mankind, if GOD had not Reveal'd Himself to them under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of these several <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>7. Now, the <hi>main Efficacy</hi> and Powerfulness of all these Highest Motives to true Sanctity depends on the Belief of Three Divine <hi>Persons</hi> in the Unity of the GODHEAD.

Next, Is not the Belief that GOD <hi>sent</hi> His only Son to Die for our Sins, that GOD the Son <hi>did</hi> die for us, and in his proper Person <hi>taught</hi> us His Heavenly Doctrine, and <hi>led</hi> such a most Perfect <hi>Life</hi> amongst us for our Example; and the many other Tenets and Motives consequent from these; I say, Are not these <hi>Better</hi> Means of Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and <hi>more Effectual</hi> to raise our Thoughts to an Affectionate <hi>Love</hi> of Him, to <hi>Trust</hi> in His <hi>Mercy,</hi> to <hi>follow</hi> His <hi>Dectrine,</hi> and <hi>imitate</hi> His Holy <hi>Life,</hi> than if a <hi>meer Man,</hi> a <hi>Creature,</hi> and therefore <hi>infinitely short</hi> of His Divine Majesty, had been sent for that purpose? Now, if they grant These, then they must acknowledge, that the Doctrine of the Trinity, upon which all these Advantages are Grounded, being the <hi>Best Means,</hi> or rather the Principle, on which these Best Means for Virtue are Built, must be acknowledg'd to be <hi>True.</hi> I am far from thinking that <hi>Ignorance</hi> is the Genuine <hi>Mother of Devotion:</hi> much less, that <hi>Errour,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially so <hi>shameless</hi> an Errour, as is nothing but <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense</hi>

               <p>1. BUT what shall the <hi>Unlearned Vulgar</hi> do in the mean time?

How, then, and in what manner, ought they to bear themselves? Their Reason is startled and dissatisfied; and consequently, their Conscience; when it is confidently <hi>Pretended,</hi> and offer'd to be <hi>Prov'd,</hi> that the embracing this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net obliges them to acknowledge more GODS than <hi>One;</hi> which both sides grant to be <hi>Perfect I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry.</hi> I Answer, and offer to them these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations.</p>
               <p>2. And, First, I would ask them of what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or Profession they were when they first
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:110692:288"/>
Read those Books, or listen'd to those Discourses which startled them in the Belief of a Trinity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Had they <hi>any Faith</hi> at all before, or were they mere <hi>Infidels,</hi> or <hi>Seekers:</hi> If they had <hi>any Faith;</hi> then they had some <hi>Ground</hi> for that Faith, and held that Ground <hi>Certain,</hi> as the Ground of <hi>Faith</hi> ought to be; and then they stand oblig'd by Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Reason, either to see that Ground <hi>invalidated</hi> and <hi>overthrown,</hi> or to <hi>continue</hi> where they are. Now, this Opposing the Point it self by way of <hi>Pretended</hi> Reason does not at all combat their <hi>Ground</hi> of Believing thus, but brings Foreign <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections</hi> against the Particular Article, which is a kind of <hi>Conclusion</hi> from that Ground; that is, it lets the <hi>Principle</hi> alone, and attacques the <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> which is manifestly an Indirect way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and withal Foolish: For, if the <hi>Principle</hi> stands, what's bulit on that Principle <hi>will</hi> stand too, let Objections say what they please. Besides <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> have something of <hi>Solid</hi> in their Meen and Notion; and ought always (and generally do) subsist upon <hi>Settled Iudgment,</hi> and <hi>Right Reason;</hi> whereas <hi>Objections</hi> are almost always the Product of <hi>Fancy,</hi> which is a Volatil, Roving and Unsettled Faculty, ever <hi>Wayward, Humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>3. Again, a very ordinary Experience in the World will teach them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Lawyers plead <hi>very plausible</hi> for <hi>contrary</hi> Causes, and sometimes Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers for <hi>contrary</hi> Opinions; so that it is not every <hi>seeming.</hi> Reason which we cannot readily Answer, though it may look very Plausible, that ought to shock us, or make us entertain an ill Opinion of
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:110692:288"/>
our <hi>Principle it self.</hi> But, it must be such a <hi>Solid Reason</hi> as may be held <hi>more Evident</hi> than the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> was on which they, and the Body or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity they were in, had built their former Faith; otherwise it cannot with any Sense be held able to <hi>cope</hi> or <hi>contrast</hi> with it, much less to <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw</hi> it.</p>
               <p>4. They ought, I say, in such a Case, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that they <hi>were</hi> formerly in a Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, or in <hi>some Church,</hi> and were Actually <hi>Members</hi> of that Body, from which they must <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;</hi> and so be guilty of a very Criminal <hi>Schism,</hi> if they divide themselves by Apostacy from it: which makes it plain to the meanest Capacity, that the Reasons which are oppos'd, ought to be most <hi>Evident,</hi> and most <hi>Cogent.</hi> This ought to make them cautious and wary in admitting such Objections for true Reasons; lest, if they hap to be prov'd False, they run themselves desperately into such a dangerou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="466" facs="tcp:110692:289"/>
Proof against the Trinity. For did they ever lay any <hi>Self-Evident Principles,</hi> or build on them, as those to which those Proofs are finally reducible? 'Tis unheard of; and yet without these, 'tis impossible there can be any <hi>True Evidence,</hi> or <hi>Demonstration.</hi> For, whatever pretends to be <hi>Evident,</hi> must either be Evident <hi>of it self,</hi> or be <hi>made Evident</hi> by something that is <hi>moro</hi> Evident than it self is; which must either run on <hi>Endlesly,</hi> or terminate at length in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is <hi>Self-Evident.</hi> A Demonstration, if truly such, and clearly propos'd. obliges all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature to assent to it, if they be Unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd. If they can pretend they have any such Demonstrative Argument that the Doctrine of the Trinity is such Nonsense, and so Impious, why do they not produce it, stand to it, show the Principle it is grounded on, and the Connexion it has with that Principle. <hi>One</hi> such Argument would <hi>decide</hi> the Cause, and put an end to the <hi>Whole</hi> Controversie. But, alas! they dare not so much as say, (I am sure they never did) that they have any such kind of Argument.

               </p>
               <p>5. They ought to consider next, when they have left the Particular Church in which they were, and in which there are <hi>Church-Governours,</hi> and a great <hi>Body</hi> of Christians with whom they do joyn in Faith, Prayer, Sacraments, Discipline, and other Spiritual Duties; with <hi>what</hi> Church-Governours, and <hi>what</hi> Body of Men they will joyn in Prayer, and such Devout Offices. Can a few Men scatter'd here and there, who sculk in Corners, do not own themselves openly, nor <hi>barefacedly</hi> protest and preach against this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which (if False) is so manifestly Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous; can, I say, such a Rope of Sand, such an Unconnected Multitude, who thus let GOD's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour go to wrack, have the <hi>Face,</hi> or the <hi>least show</hi> of a <hi>Church?</hi> With whom then will these New Proselytes joyn hemselves in Prayet, Sacraments, Church-Government, and other such Concerns? This is so shameful to their pretended <hi>Church,</hi> that though 'tis against all Conscience and Sense, they are content to joyn in Prayer and other Religious Duties with <hi>our</hi> Churches, (though themselves must hold them most abominably Idolatrous) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than make a ridiculous show of their own Party alone. Perhaps too, <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Indemnity</hi> are two powerful Motives to induce them to this Brotherly Compliance and Correspondence: For such Men do not use to be guilty of such a <hi>Zeal</hi> for <hi>GOD's Honour,</hi> or for their own Persuasion, as to hazard <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> no not the less of any Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Advantages for GOD's or Truth's sake. They are cast in a new Mold from that of other good Christians, and approach to the <hi>Deists,</hi> as in other Prudent Methods, so in this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="468" facs="tcp:110692:290"/>6. If those Unstable and Dissatisfy'd Men say they are not <hi>able</hi> to Judge whether the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons they bring are <hi>Conclusive</hi> or <hi>no;</hi> they plainly confess they hanker after them out of the bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Humour of <hi>Singularity,</hi> and <hi>Novelty;</hi> since they consent to alter their Former Faith upon such Reasons as they <hi>know not</hi> whether they be <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Bad,</hi> Solid or Aiery, fit to be yeilded to or no: That is in plain Terms, they have an <hi>Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to that Party, but yet they do not well know <hi>why.</hi> If they alledge that their Reasons seem <hi>more easie</hi> to them than those brought by <hi>others:</hi> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, First, That <hi>Easiness</hi> is not a sign of <hi>Truth.</hi> The <hi>Highest Truths,</hi> especially those belonging to <hi>Spiritual</hi> Natures, are the <hi>Hardest</hi> to conceive, and yet not a jot the less <hi>True.</hi> 'Tis easier to conceive GOD to be a <hi>Body,</hi> and perform all his Actions by <hi>Motion,</hi> as we do <hi>ours;</hi> and yet it is so far from <hi>True,</hi> that it is a damnable Errour, and destroys the Nature of the DEITY. Or rather it is a vast Prejudice against all their Arguments, and their very <hi>Way</hi> of Arguing: For, tho' <hi>each single word,</hi> in which Faith was deliver'd, was <hi>easie,</hi> so that the then Believers could have a right Apprehension, or Notion of what was taught them; yet, when the Point comes to be canvast by <hi>Disputation,</hi> and Reasons produc'd <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> and that the Point is of what passes in the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> which is not only <hi>Spiritual,</hi> but <hi>Infinite;</hi> 'tis a certain sign, that, if the Reasons either Party produces be <hi>Easie</hi> to Vulgar Fancies; 'tis, I say, a <hi>most certain sign,</hi> that they are merely <hi>Superficial,</hi> and do not reach the Nature of so abstruse a Mystery, or so <hi>High a Subject.</hi>

Western Churches should meet together in the First Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> (who by their Station must needs know the Sentiment of the then Christian Church;) and there Decree and Subscribe to the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and propose a Formal <hi>Creed,</hi> what every Man ought to believe in that Article. Those Bishops could not be thought to act herein against their Conscience; nor could any ever impeach their <hi>Sanctity,</hi> so as to make them such a pack of Villains as wilfully to Damn themselves, and all those Souls they had Influence over, by Defining that a Creature was truly GOD. Add, that neither could they be <hi>Ignorant</hi> of the Doctrine and Practice of the foregoing Church from Christ's time. Their Session was not much more than 300 Years after the Birth of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; allowing then about 30 Years for our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Life-time, and 25 (more or less) for the Apostles Lives after his Death, and 50 for the Lives of those Bishops e're they met; it was easie for their Great Grand-fathers; nay, divers of <hi>their</hi> Grand-fathers, and also for the Grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of <hi>many</hi> in that Age, to have liv'd in the times of the Apostles; and it was utterly Incredible there should be such a Change in Faith, so Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally and far spread, and none know who first <hi>introduced</hi> it, and were the chiefest Instruments in propagating it; and a thousand times harder to conceive that it should not be vigorously op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd till <hi>Arius</hi> his time. Besides, their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,</hi> and <hi>Adoration</hi> of Christ could not but go along with their <hi>Faith;</hi> and who can without Madness imagine, that an Universal Change of <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Practice</hi> in so <hi>high</hi> a Point as the joyning a <hi>False GOD</hi> with a True one, a Creature with a Creatour, in their Adoration, could possibly

creep into the World and diffuse itself over the Church, and yet should never be <hi>Observ'd</hi> and <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,</hi> when it first appear'd.</p>
               <p>8. Moreover, since these Doubters were brought up amongst Christians, they cannot but know how highly Faith, Hope, and Charity, which were ever held the <hi>Best</hi>-of <hi>Supernatural Virtues,</hi> are necessary to promote Souls in Holiness, raise their Thoughts and Affections vigorously to Heaven, and thence conduce to their Salvation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by our former Discourse, they must needs see how those Virtues are enfeebled, and the Best Motives to erect their Souls to Heaven are made flat and Insignificant (in comparison) by the Denying this Mystery: And, consequently, since <hi>Errour</hi> can never be a Friend to <hi>Piety,</hi> that that Tenet is <hi>True.</hi> Nay, they must be conscious to themselves, that, by <hi>Denying</hi> it, they bereave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the most effectual Means to elevate their Souls to <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of Heaven, which is the only Disposition that can bring them thither. Those well-meaning Men are born in hand by their Deluders, that, by dis-believing the B. Trinity, it is but <hi>one</hi> Point they deny; but that they may, and do, nevertheless, stand right in <hi>all the rest.</hi> But they are Abus'd. Whoever denies the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> does, by consequence, deny <hi>all other</hi> Tenets, and enervates <hi>all</hi> the Motives that are <hi>Peculiar</hi> to Christianity as <hi>such,</hi> or as it superadds to the Law of Nature and that of <hi>Moses;</hi> as might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be shown in every Article of our Creed, (were it Seasonable to make so long an Excursion,) and how it is, one way or other, influenced by This.

him, and yet, be but <hi>One,</hi> according to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Thing,</hi> or but <hi>One Man.</hi> Which done, let but the several Notions or Respects that belong to this Mystery be <hi>Distinguish'd;</hi> (by <hi>Confounding</hi> which those Men do pretend to show it Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictious;) and a little Instruction will let them see plainly, that, at least <hi>many</hi> of their Objections, if not <hi>all,</hi> are merely Frivolous and Insignificant.</p>
               <p>15. To make this sink better into their Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, it were not amiss to Instance in some one Paragraph of the aforesaid <hi>Letter, concerning the Trinity and Athanasian Creed.</hi> Wee'll take one of the shortest, but withall the Pithiest and Shrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in their way of Arguing. 'Tis found, <hi>p.</hi> 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. in these Words, [<hi>If the Father is an Infinite All-perfect Being; and, if the Son is Distinct from the Father; he must, if he be a</hi> GOD, <hi>be a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Infinite All-perfect Being; for the same Being can be no way Distinct from its self: And, certainly, two Distinct All-perfect Beings are two Distinct</hi> GODS.] How currently and smoothly this glides over the <hi>Fancy:</hi> Yet, when examin'd, and brought to the Test, it will appear by and by, that 'tis so incomparably <hi>Weak</hi> and <hi>Silly,</hi> that 'tis scarce pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to croud <hi>more Nonsence</hi> into so narrow a Room. Which I show thus.</p>
               <p>16. 'Tis acknowledg'd, <hi>the Father is an Infinite All-perfect Being;</hi> for he has the Divine Nature in Him, which is <hi>Infinitely Perfect,</hi> or truly GOD. He Proceeds. [<hi>and if the Son is Distinct from the Father.</hi>] In <hi>what</hi> Sense, I beseech him, or accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>what</hi> Notion or <hi>Respect</hi> do we hold He is <hi>Distinct?</hi> In that of <hi>Being?</hi> Not <hi>one</hi> Man in GOD's Church ever said it. What we hold and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is, that He is <hi>only</hi> Distinct from Him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

A Man is Marry'd, and has never a Child; and then he is a [<hi>Man</hi>] but is [<hi>not a Father</hi>] Afterwards, he has a <hi>Son,</hi> and then he is a <hi>Father;</hi> and yet he is the <hi>same Man,</hi> or the <hi>same Being</hi> he was: though, <hi>to be a Father,</hi> and <hi>not to be a Father,</hi> abstractedly conceiv'd, be Contradictories. It follows, [and therefore, <hi>he must if he be a</hi> GOD, <hi>be a Distinct All perfect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>] And why must this follow, when the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction affects the GODHEAD, only according to that Respect called <hi>Relation;</hi> and not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Respect called <hi>Essence,</hi> or according to the GODHEAD it self, or the Divine Nature. 'Tis strange that these Men cannot Reflect that, when we say, [God <hi>knows Himself</hi>], or, which is the same, [GOD <hi>

But the <hi>Reason</hi> he <hi>gives for this Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> exprest in the words, [<hi>For the same Being can be no ways Distinct from it self</hi>] is such a most Profound piece of Ignorance, that 'tis <hi>Unparallell'd.</hi> Indeed, a being can be <hi>no ways Distinct from it self,</hi> under the Notion of <hi>Being;</hi> for this were <hi>to be the same Being,</hi> and <hi>not to be the same Being;</hi> but that it can be <hi>no ways</hi> (as he says) <hi>Distinct from it self,</hi> but it must have a Different Being, is against our Common Notions, the Common Language, and the Common Sense of all Mankind.

Respects, or Considerations which we may make of the <hi>same Thing,</hi> or the <hi>same Being.</hi> But these Gentlemen Discourse as if there were but One Predicament, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Substance,</hi> or <hi>Being,</hi> and they have either <hi>Cashier</hi>'d or else had, for hast, quite forgot the other <hi>Nine.</hi> And is such a shallow Pamphlet, a fit Present for the <hi>Learned Divines of the Universities!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>17. Let us put a Parallel to this Discourse. Imagine then <hi>Peter</hi> were both a <hi>Father</hi> and a <hi>Son,</hi> in respect of his Different Correlates; these Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen will undertake to prove plainly, that he must therefore be <hi>Two Men</hi> thus. [If this Father be a Rational Creature, and the Notion of Son be
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:110692:297"/>
Distinct from that of Father; then <hi>Peter,</hi> if he be a Man, must be a Distinct Rational Creature, for the same Being can be <hi>no ways</hi> Distinct from it self, and certainly two Distinct Rational Creatures are <hi>Two Men.</hi>] The Parallel is his own Discourse put in the very Tenour he laid it. Only we put the [<hi>Notion</hi>] or <hi>Respect</hi> of <hi>Son</hi> to be Distinct from that of <hi>Father,</hi> because we speak of them (as we ought) <hi>precisely</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> according to <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects;</hi> and not <hi>materially;</hi> for, so consider'd, they are all Identify'd with the <hi>DEITY;</hi> whence, St. <hi>Austin</hi> in his Books <hi>De Trinitate,</hi> when he names <hi>Deus,</hi> adds immediately <hi>id est, Trinitas;</hi> and these men know well that 'tis our constant Profession, that the Trinity is no otherwise to be <hi>Worshipt</hi> than in the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Godhead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>18. Thus these Gentlemen by their New <hi>No-Logick,</hi> have prov'd <hi>Peter</hi> to be <hi>two Men,</hi> and to have <hi>two</hi> Individual <hi>Natures</hi> in him, because he has <hi>two</hi> different <hi>Relations;</hi> which kind of Respect call'd <hi>Relations,</hi> since (if we take the whole Extent of that Notion and all the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars under it) we acquire and lose a hundred times a day in one kind or other, no one Being in Nature would be constantly the same, but must be perpetually <hi>multiply'd</hi> into the Lord knows <hi>how many</hi> Beings or Things.</p>
               <p>19. But the main Point is, That our Question is not whether the same thing can be any way Distinct from it's self; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut, whether the Same Thing <hi>may not,</hi> and <hi>does not,</hi> Ground and Verify <hi>many</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions or Respects of <hi>divers</hi> kinds; as is shown in my First Preliminary; and, whether it does hence follow, that if we affirm that it is <hi>One</hi> according to <hi>One</hi> of those Respects, and yet <hi>Three</hi>
                  <pb n="483" facs="tcp:110692:297"/>
according to <hi>Another</hi> of those Respects, there can be, in that case, any show of a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> which is the Affirming and Denying of it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Same Respect.</hi> This, is the true Point, which these Objectors never <hi>touch</hi> nor <hi>heed;</hi> but, instead of <hi>Distinguishing</hi> those several Respects, they <hi>jumble</hi> them all together <hi>confusedly;</hi> and then, when they have thus <hi>shuffled away</hi> the true Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, they pretend to <hi>Decide</hi> that which they have not <hi>Toucht,</hi> (perhaps never <hi>Thought</hi> of it,) by an Untoward and Aukwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>20. My last Advice to those Dissatisfy'd Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, is, Than they would be so True to their own Reason, as not to fancy themselves compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>Iudges</hi> of what they cannot but know they are not able to <hi>decide;</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> undertake to <hi>sound Depths</hi> which are beyond the Length of their <hi>short Line;</hi> nor be inveigled to apprehend that those most sublime Points that concern what passes <hi>within</hi> the <hi>DEITY</hi> it self, must (when it comes to be Debated or Explicated) be as plain and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to every <hi>Ordinary</hi> Understanding as a piece of a <hi>Romance.</hi> 'Tis the greatest Policy of those Men, in gaining Proselytes, to spread about their Pamphlets among the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> and to persuade them that what's <hi>True</hi> must needs be <hi>Easie,</hi> (as to which Flam every Man who has study'd the Mathematicks is able to undeceive them) and so make them <hi>Iudges</hi> of the Controversie; which is very gratifying to Original Sin, and to our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Pride, the Effect of it. And, if once they can bring them to <hi>swallow</hi> this <hi>bait,</hi> and embrace this Erroneous Principle of <hi>over-weening,</hi> they are
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:110692:298"/>
sure they are <hi>caught.</hi> For, then, they have no more to do but to propose to them some pretty <hi>superficial</hi> Tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>es, which if examin'd by True Principles, have not a grain of Sense in them; and yet, being suteable to the pitch of weak Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, are very Plausible and Taking, and they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently hold themselves well appay'd. By this means also they are brought to <hi>undervalue</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn all <hi>Learned</hi> Discourses which go the <hi>bottom</hi> of the subject in hand; because they are not at the first sight so easily intelligible to their Low Capacities.</p>
               <p>Thus I have endeavour'd both to <hi>satisfie</hi> Learned Readers, how this most Holy and Fundamental Article of Christian Faith is Explicable, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to True Principles of <hi>Reason</hi> working upon our <hi>Natural Notions;</hi> and also to <hi>Establish</hi> the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned</hi> from the Delusions of those, who, while they oppose it, renounce <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> both. Which done, I have no more to do but to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to GOD the <hi>FATHER</hi> who <hi>Created,</hi> and <hi>Preserves</hi> us; to GOD the <hi>SON</hi> who <hi>Redeem'd</hi> and <hi>Enlightens</hi> us; and to GOD the <hi>HOLY SPIRIT</hi> who <hi>Sanctifies</hi> and <hi>Comforts</hi> us. To all whom, as being <hi>One</hi> GOD, Blessed for Evermore, be ascrib'd all Honour and Glory.</p>
