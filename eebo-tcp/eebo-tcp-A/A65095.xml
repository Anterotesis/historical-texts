         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>ARts are the only helps towards Humane Perfection. Thoſe therefore which are the helps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the eaſineſs, maturity, and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Arts, deſerve beſt of Mankind. Whence it is that God would not ſuffer the firſt deviſers, ſo much as of Shepards Tents, of Muſical Inſtruments, of Iron Works, to be unknown to the World: The laſt whereof, even Heathen Antiquitie hath in common judgment continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much difference of Name, tell this day; although I cannot believe that any of the Heathen Gods were ſo ancient. Yea hence it is, that the Holy Ghoſt challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the faculty of manuary skill, to his own gift; as being too good for nature, and <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oo meritorious of men. That <hi>Bezalell</hi> and <hi>Aholial</hi> could work curiouſly in Gold
<pb facs="tcp:56578:8"/>
and Silver, for the material Tabernacle is from Gods ſpirit, and not theirs: How much more is this true in thoſe ſciences which are ſo Eſſential to the ſpiritual Houſe of God. I ſubſcribe therefore to the judgment of them, that think God was the firſt Author of Letters, whether by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> reports from <hi>Eupolemus,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ancient Progeny of <hi>Seth,</hi> in the firſt World, as <hi>Joſephus.</hi> Wherefore we cannot but think them worthy, that have applyed themſelves wholly to adorn and garniſh this mortal Life with their Inventions, and to accompliſh the feeble indigence of our condition, by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of their Proviſion: as they that have excogitated and imagined any Art whereby the Common Wealth of the World is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; or any other Miſteries or Crafts to the maintenance, and comfort of the Body. Howbeit they are worthy to have greater commendations, that by their ſubtle devices have found out the Liberal Sciences, whereby the Divine and Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al part, called <hi>the Soul of Man,</hi> is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified: yet we may not therefore forget Writers of meaner things, but are out of
<pb facs="tcp:56578:8"/>
duty bound to make ſome worthy memorial of their benifits, declaring our kindneſs towards them; to the intent that others might be incouraged, to interpriſe the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement of like endeavours to the great aid and preferment of the Common wealth, conſidering that ſuch devices ſhall be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred to perpetual fame and renown, and to the profit of many, and eaſe of all men, it were therefore in my Opinion both a point of deteſtable unkindneſs, and a part of extream inhumanity, to defraud them of their praiſe and perpetual memory, that were Authors of ſo great a benifit to the univerſal World. In conſideration for the further compleating of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Youth, I was moved to take in hand, to draw into a brief and eaſie Alphabetical Table, what I have in my Reading found copiouſly gathered together, without any ſuch method, in ſeveral Authors of the firſt inventors of ſuch arts as are never to be forgotten.</p>

               <p>GOD when he had finiſhed the World, did Create the firſt Man ADAM, of the Earth of the Field of <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> Thus <hi>Adam</hi>

made by God, Marrying of his Wife <hi>Eve</hi> was Author and Beginner of the whole poſterity and Linage. The Beaſts, after they were all Created in their kind, were Named by <hi>Adam,</hi> with the ſame Names. He made the firſt Leather-coats for himſelf and his Wife <hi>Eve,</hi> our old Mother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arethmatick</hi> or <hi>Numbers,</hi> as ſome ſay, were invented by <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> others ſay by <hi>Mercury: Jovius</hi> ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Pallas</hi> formed them. The manner of counting years in <hi>Greece,</hi> was by <hi>Olympiads,</hi> which contained the ſpace of five years, as the <hi>Romans</hi> did <hi>Luſtra,</hi> which contained the ſame Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years: ſometimes by Nailes. For every year the Conſull or chief Judge called <hi>Praetor,</hi> in the Ides of <hi>September,</hi> faſtned a Naile in the Wall of <hi>Jupiters</hi> Temple, next joyning to the. Temple of <hi>Pallas,</hi> to ſignifie the ſpace of years. And we uſe to Write our Numbers with theſe ſeven Letters, <hi>C. I. D. L. M. V.

               <p>
                  <hi>The Art of Memory</hi> was found by <hi>Simonides</hi> in <hi>Theſſaly:</hi> For when he was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56578:10"/>
invited to a Noble Mans Houſe called <hi>Scopa,</hi> it chanced that he was ſent to ſpeak with two young men at the Gate, when immediately the Banqueting-House fell, and deſtroyed all the Gueſs. Then he, becauſe he reme<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>red in what order and place every one ſate, delivered every one his Friend to be Buried, by which he perceived the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>the Art of Memory. Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> excelled in Memory, who could call every Man in his Army by his Name. <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Embaſſador of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> the day after he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaluted every order of Nobles by their proper Names. <hi>Mithridates</hi> could ſpeak Twenty-two Languages. <hi>Julius Ceaſer</hi> could read, endite, and hear a Tale at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> the occaſion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of this Art was, that in it Learned men through their obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Celeſtial Bodies, wherein the whole moveable courſe of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the riſing, going down, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Planets might be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. Some put the invention of this Art on the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> others on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56578:11"/>
                  <hi>Mercury,</hi> but <hi>Joſephus</hi> concludes, that <hi>Abraham</hi> inſtructed them and the <hi>Chid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi> in it, and thence it came into <hi>Greece,</hi> as <hi>Phericides, Pythagoras, Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> acknowledges, that they were Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to the <hi>Aegyptians. Pliny</hi> will have <hi>Atlas</hi> to be the firſt Founder or contriver of it, which occaſioned the Poets to feign that he beareth Heaven upon his Back. <hi>Sernius</hi> would have <hi>Prometheus</hi> to find it out. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs all theſe (as I ſuppoſe) were the beginners of this faculty, every man in his own Countrey where he dwelled: for even from the beginning of the World, the Sons of <hi>Seth</hi> deviſed firſt the ſcience of the Stars, and for as much as they feared leaſt their Art ſhould periſh, before it came to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of men (for they had heard their Grand-Father <hi>Adam</hi> ſay, that all things ſhould be deſtroyed by the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Flood) they made two Pillars, one of Stone, the other of Brick, to the intent that if the Brick waſted with Water or Storms, yet the Stone ſhould preſerve the Letters whole and perfect, and in their Pillars they Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56578:11"/>
all that concerned the Obſervation of the Stars. And therefore 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Caldees</hi> learned <hi>Aſtrology</hi> of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and ſo conſequently, it ſpread it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other Nations. <hi>Endimion</hi> was the firſt that found out the courſe of the Moon, the reaſon of her being Eclipſed, <hi>Pythagoras</hi> obſerved the courſe of <hi>Venus. Archimedes</hi> found the uſe of the Sphere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alchimia</hi> or <hi>Alchimy,</hi> ſignifieth <hi>infuſion</hi> or <hi>ſteeping;</hi> for <hi>Chimia</hi> in Greek, denotes <hi>Infuſed.</hi> There is a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie when <hi>Alchimy</hi> was invented: For neither <hi>Pliny</hi> (though he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe a moſt diligent Author) nor any Greek or Latine Author make any mention of it, but I believe that it is very ancient; for <hi>Suidas</hi> writeth that the Art of <hi>Alchimy</hi> endured till the time of the <hi>Argonantes,</hi> when <hi>Jaſon</hi> went to take away the Golden Fleece; which was nothing elſe than a certain Book that taught to turn other Mettals into Gold: for thoſe that invented that ſtory, conceating its name invented
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56578:12"/>
the Golden Fleece. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> profeſſed this Art very much, in the Reign of the Emperour <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> who hating them becauſe they made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, Burned their Writings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their deſtilling of Gold and Silver, leaſt (as he feared) they being made Rich by this Art, and having gotten good ſtore of Wealth, they ſhould Rebell againe. The Emperour <hi>Diocleſian</hi> was Created in the year 287; ſo that this Art was rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed than new.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Authors of the firſt Names of Countreys,</hi> were, ſome of the moſt eminent of them, as followeth, <hi>Arphax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad</hi> was the firſt Founder of the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Lud</hi> of the <hi>Lidians:</hi> of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Cham</hi> were <hi>Chus,</hi> that named the <hi>Aethiopians;</hi> and <hi>Meſre</hi> the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Aegyptians. Chanaan</hi> of whom the <hi>Cananites</hi> had their name: The Linnage of <hi>Chus</hi> was <hi>Seba,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the <hi>Sebees</hi> came; and <hi>Evila</hi> of whom came the <hi>Evilites.</hi> And in the like manner we muſt believe, that of them came all other Nations and People of the World, which are now encreaſed,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56578:12"/>
that they can ſcarcely be numbred. Of or from the <hi>Aire Anaximenes</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth all things to have had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. <hi>Metrodorus</hi> affirmeth the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal World to be Eternal, without beginning or end. <hi>Epicurus</hi> one of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus</hi> Diſciples, putteth two cauſes Attomes, or Motes, and vacuity and emptineſs, of theſe he ſaith the four Elements come. Theſe are the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Phyloſophers that were men without the knowledge of God: But (as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> record) the Scripture concludeth, <hi>that in the begining God made all things of nothing;</hi> as St. John ſaith, <hi>all things were made by him.</hi> And therefore (as <hi>Lactantius</hi> writeth) let no man be curious in ſearching, of what material God made theſe great and wonderful Works, for he Formed them all of nothing, by the power of his mighty Word. Of the ſame Opnion is <hi>Plato</hi> in his Book called <hi>Timeus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amphitheaters and Theatres,</hi> were certain places, as Scaffolds with Pentiſes, wherein the People of <hi>Athens</hi> ſtood to behold the Enterludes that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56578:13"/>
were ſhewed: and they were made like half a Circle, with Benches one above another, that they might without any impediment ſee the Playes; <hi>Dionyſius</hi> did firſt inſtitute them in <hi>Athens:</hi> in the midſt of the Scaffold or Theatre ſtood the Stage, wherein Comedies, Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, with other Shews were exhebited to the common ſort. Of whom the <hi>Romans</hi> took example, to make ſuch Scaffolds. <hi>Caius Curio,</hi> at his Fathers Burial, Builded two Theatres of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber after ſuch a faſhion, that they might in time of <hi>Enterludes</hi> ſtand one contrary to another; in ſuch wiſe that neither Play ſhould diſturb one the other: And when it pleaſed him he turned them together, and made an <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheatre,</hi> which was a round Scaffold full of Benches of divers heights; wherein he ſet forth a Game of Sword Players. <hi>Cains Julius Colſar</hi> Builded the firſt <hi>Amphitheatre</hi> in the Field conſecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Mars;</hi> In which were ſet forth ſhews of Wild Beaſts, and Sword Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for the cuſtome was that ſuch as were condemned to Dye, or taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners in War, ſhould be caſt there to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56578:13"/>
the wild Beaſts to be devoured and ſlain. It was ſtrewed with Sand, leaſt the Blood of thoſe which were ſlain ſhould defile them that fought, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them: and therefore, there were certain appointed for to toſs and ſtrew about the Sand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amber,</hi> as <hi>Diodorus</hi> witneſſeth, was found in the <hi>Iſle Baſilea,</hi> which lyeth againſt <hi>Scythia,</hi> above <hi>Galatia</hi> in the great Ocean, where it was firſt cut up, and was never found or ſeen in any place before.</p>

               <p>BIBLE, the Reading of part of it at Dinner time, hath been of a long continuance, which did proceed from the Godly Doctrine which Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed his Diſciples in, at all times, but chiefly at his laſt Supper, wherein he Treated of the perfection of all the miſteries of Religion.

                  <hi>Tell Building,</hi> men at the firſt lived like wild Beaſts, in Caves, and alſo Fed on Fruits and Roots of the Earth: but after they perceived the neceſſary uſe of Fire againſt the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment extreamity of cold: ſome began to edifie Cottages of Boughs and Trees, and ſome digged Caves in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and by often experiencing ſuch means, they attained to a greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in <hi>Building</hi> with Walls, that they did get up with long Props, and did wind them about with ſmall Rods, and ſo daubed them: and to keep out the Storms, they covered them with Reeds, Boughs or Fen-ſedges,. Thus in proceſs of time they came to the Art of <hi>Building,</hi> which as <hi>Diodorus</hi> ſaith, is aſcribed to <hi>Pallas:</hi> But we are rather to believe, that either <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Jubal,</hi> the Son of <hi>Lamech,</hi> found out this Art.</p>

                  <hi>Baths,</hi> of which thoſe that were hot, were uſed firſt privately of all men, according to their degree and ability, for the preſervation of their Health: but in proceſs of time they builded common Baths and Hot-houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es for to Sweat in; and the Noble did Bath and Waſh with the Common; and at laſt men and women were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted moſt Laciviouſly to Bath toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  <hi>Bondage or Slavery,</hi> I find that it began amongſt the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and had its Original proceeding of <hi>Canaan</hi> the Son of <hi>Cham;</hi> who, becauſe he had Laughed his Father <hi>Noah</hi> to ſcorn, as he lay diſſolately when he was Drunk, was puniſhed in his Son <hi>Canaan</hi> with <hi>Bondage</hi> and <hi>Thraldome.</hi> The order of Manumiſſion in old time was in this manner: The Lord or Maſter took the Bondman by the head, or ſome other part of his Body, ſaying, <hi>I will this Fellow be-free,</hi> and ſo diſmiſſed him. <hi>Pliny</hi> was of opinion, that <hi>Bondage</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in <hi>Lacedemonia.</hi>

or Popular State, where the common People have a ſtroke in Rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Publick-weale.

The <hi>Diadem</hi> which was the token of the Honour Royal had its firſt inſtitution from <hi>Libes Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi> The <hi>Athenians</hi> ordained the ſtate of a Common-wealth, that was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the whole Commons as <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, although they alſo had Kings, whereof <hi>Decrops Diphyes</hi> which Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Moſes</hi> time, was the firſt.

                  <hi>Crowns or Garlands Moſes</hi> made many of them, and he was many years before <hi>Bacchus,</hi> of whom <hi>Pliny</hi> writes that he did invent and wear the firſt <hi>Garland</hi> made of Ivy on his Head; and afterwards it grew to be a cuſtome, that when they Sacrificed to any of their Gods, they were to be Crowned with a Garland, ſo was the oblation alſo. At the firſt the manner was in all Plays and Sacrifices, to make <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> of Boughs of Trees. And after they were garniſhed with variety of flowers among the <hi>Siconians,</hi> by <hi>Pauſias</hi> and <hi>Gliceria</hi> his <hi>Lemman,</hi> not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Winter Garlands, that he called <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> which were made of Wood or Ivory, died with many colours, began to be worne. And in proceſs of time they made Crowns of Brazen plates guilt or covered with Silver, called for their thinneſs, Garlands. Laſtly, <hi>Craeſus</hi> the rich did firſt ſet forth in his Game ſhews, or Crowns
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56578:19"/>
with Silver or Golden Leaves, and conſequently there were invented ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of Crowns, as the <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant</hi> Crown, that the Emperour or grand Commander ware in his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; this was firſt made of Olive, and afterwards of Gold. The <hi>Murall</hi> and <hi>Wall</hi> Crown, that was given to him that firſt ſcaled the Walls. The <hi>Camp</hi> Crown, that was the reward of him that firſt adventured Valiantly into the Camp of his Enimies. The <hi>Navall</hi> or <hi>Sea</hi> Crown, that was ſet on his Head, that firſt Boarded his Enimies Ship. And all theſe were of Gold. The <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidional</hi> Crown, that was worn of him that delivered a City Beſeiged, it was compoſed of Graſs. There was alſo a <hi>Civill</hi> Crown, which was a Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which a Citizen gave to him, that had valiantly preſerved him from his Enemies; this was made of Oken Branches. And this manner of Crown the <hi>Athenians</hi> did firſt deviſe, and gave it to <hi>Pericles.</hi> There were moreover Crowns of Pearls, <hi>French</hi> Crowns, and Garlands compoſed of the Ears of Corn, which as <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth, were
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56578:19"/>
firſt in uſe amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands made of <hi>Cinnamon,</hi> Woven and Emboſſed with Gold; <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> did firſt conſecrate in the Capitoll, in the Temple of Peace. In ſome ſpace of time, the exceſs of Crowns grew to be ſuch, that the <hi>Grecians</hi> in their Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, Crowned both their Heads and their Cups alſo, whereof the <hi>Jonians</hi> were Authors. <hi>Pliny</hi> writes that with one of theſe ſorts of Crowns, <hi>Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria</hi> empoiſoned <hi>Antonie.</hi> And <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes</hi> is alſo ſaid to have uſed Crowns of Garlands in his Feaſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Citties,</hi> the occaſion of Building of them is thus reported. For when men, as is ſaid before, had gathered themſelves into ſeveral Cottages, they lived in diſtinct Houſes, which made them begin to think of gathering wealth for the support of their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. But ſeeing themſelves daily rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſpoil'd by thoſe that were ſtronger, they were forced to joyn themſelves together in a Company, and to dwell within a certain compaſs of ground, which they either Walled, or Trenched about. Afterwards it is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56578:20"/>
ſaid that <hi>Cecrops</hi> built <hi>Athens,</hi> and by his own name called it <hi>Cecrepia.

But <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays that <hi>Cain</hi> was the firſt that built a City, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it <hi>Enochia,</hi> after the name of his Son <hi>Enoch;</hi> and after the dayes of <hi>Noah</hi> by the advice of <hi>Nimrod,</hi> there were certain men that built a very high Tower, which was called <hi>Babel.</hi> Tents were invented by <hi>Jabal</hi> the Son of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech.</hi> Among the <hi>Phenicians</hi> they were found out by <hi>Seculus.</hi> Houſes of Clay were firſt invented by <hi>Doxins</hi> the Son of <hi>Gellius,</hi> who took his example from the Swallows Neſts. Brick building was invented by <hi>Eurialus</hi> and <hi>Hyperbolus</hi> brethren at <hi>Athens,</hi> though others at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute it to <hi>Reſta</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</hi> Tile and Slate were the inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Synarus</hi> of <hi>Agriopa</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> Quarries were invented by <hi>Cadmus</hi> in <hi>Thebes:</hi> But the invention of ſuch Arts is more fitly thought to be referred to <hi>Cain,</hi> or the poſterity of <hi>Seth,</hi> who made two pillars, one of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56578:20"/>
Brick, the other of Stone. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, 'tis not denyed, but thoſe aforeſaid Perſons began their inventions, in the Countries where they lived. Marble was uſed in building by the Nobility of <hi>Rome,</hi> for to ſhew the coſtly magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: ſo that <hi>Scaurus</hi> being a publick Officer in <hi>Rome,</hi> cauſed 360 Marble Pillars to be carried for the making of one Stage, whereon an Enterlude was to be plaid. <hi>Lucius Craſſus</hi> was the firſt that had Pillars of Marble. <hi>Lepidus</hi> made the Gates of his Houſe of <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Marble.

                  <hi>Divination</hi> is reckoned to be of two ſorts; the one Natural, the other Artificial, Natural, is that which is occaſioned by a natural commotion or ſtirring of the mind, which happens ſometimes to men when they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep; ſometimes by a kind of fury or rapture of the mind, as it was with the <hi>Sybils;</hi> of the ſame nature were the oracles of <hi>Appollo</hi> and <hi>Jupiter Hammon.</hi> Artificial thoſe which proceed from conjectures, old conſiderations and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of the entrails of Beaſts, fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Birds, caſting of Lots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The inſpection of the Bowels of Beaſts was invented by the <hi>Hetrurians,</hi> which chanced thus.

Letters; for <hi>Gramma</hi> in Greek ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a Letter in Engliſh. <hi>Grammar</hi> is an Art that doth conſiſt in Speaking and Writing without Fault or Errour, ſo that every Word have his due Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and as <hi>Quintilian</hi> determineth, is devided into two parts, the way to ſpeak congruouſly, and declairing of Poets; as <hi>Tully</hi> writeth, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a <hi>Grammarian</hi> the dedication of Poets, the knowledge of Hiſtories, the expoſition of Words, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain utterance of Pronounciaiton. <hi>Grammar</hi> took its beginning from marking and obſerving what was moſt fit and unfit in communication, which thing men counterfeiting in their ſpeech, from thence this Art took its Riſe, even as Rhetorick was percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; For it is the duty both of the <hi>Grammarians</hi> and <hi>Orators</hi> to have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and reſpect how to ſpeak. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mipus</hi> ſaith that <hi>Epicurus</hi> firſt taught the Art of <hi>Grammar,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> eſpyed and perceived firſt the commodity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it.

There are of Laws three kinds: one Natural, that is not only appropriated to man, but alſo it concerneth all other living things either in the Earth, Sea, or Aire; as we perceive in all kinds of living Creatures, naturally a certain familiarity of Male and Female, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation of Kind, and a proclinity to

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56578:37"/>
and did inhibite that a Child under the age of three years ſhould be bewailed, and that the elder ſort ſhould be mourned no more months then he had lived, if any were married within that ſpace again it was counted for a great reproach: Wherefore <hi>Numa</hi> ordained that ſuch as left of Mourning before the day limited ſhould offer a Cow that was great with calf for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation. If that Rite were uſed now adayes, and namely in <hi>England,</hi> we ſhould have ſmall ſtore of Veals, there be ſo many that Marry within the ſpace of time preſcribed. <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth that the Women in their Mourning laid aſide all Purple, Gold, and Sumptuous or rich Apparral, and were cloathed both they and their kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in White Apparrel, like as at that time the dead body was wrapped in White cloaths. The white colour was thought fitteſt for the dead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is Clear, Pure, Sincere, and leaſt defiled, and when the time of their weeping was expired, they put on other Veſtures.

Marriage were not alike in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, nor kept after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

The <hi>Seythians, Scots,</hi> and <hi>Athenians,</hi> at firſt uſed the Women in common publickly like Beaſts: the <hi>Maſſagers</hi> Married their Wives, but they alſo uſed them in common. Amongſt the <hi>Arabians,</hi> it was the cuſtome that all the Kinſmen ſhould have but one Wife, and he that came to meddle with her, ſhould ſet his Staffe at the Door. The <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Babilonians</hi> bought their Wives in the Market for a price, which cuſtome ſtill remains amongſt the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Saracens.</hi> The <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zomons</hi> when they are firſt Married, uſe to ſuffer their Wives to be Layne withall the firſt Night by all their Gueſts, and after that, keep them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to themſelves. There were a certain People of <hi>Affrick</hi> that were wont to offer ſuch Maids that were to be Married to the King of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56578:42"/>
to deflowre ſuch as he pleaſed. It was alſo the cuſtome amongſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> that the Lord of the Manner was to Lye with the Bride the firſt Night, which cuſtome remained till it was aboliſhed by <hi>Malcolme</hi> the third. Marriage amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> was kept inviolable till divorcement began. The Rites of Marriage were various in <hi>Rome;</hi> and the manner was that two Children ſhould Lead the Bride, and a third bear before her a Torch of White-Thorn in honour of <hi>Ceres,</hi> which cuſtome was alſo obſerved here in <hi>England,</hi> ſaving that in place of the Torch, there was carried before the Bride a Baſon of Gold or Silver; a Garland alſo of Corn Eares was ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Head, or elſe ſhe bare it on her Hand; or if that were omitted, Wheat was ſcattered over her Head in Token af Fruitfulneſs; alſo before ſhe came to Bed to her Husband, Fire and Water were given her, which having power to purifie and cleaſe, ſignifyed that thereby ſhe ſhould be chaſt and pure in her Body. Neither was ſhe to ſtep over the Threſhold, but was to be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56578:43"/>
bourn over, to ſignifie that ſhe loſt her Virginity unwillingly, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuperſtitious Ceremonies, which are too long to rehearſe. Marriage began firſt in Paradiſe, where God joyned <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> together, before they knew Sin, that by the congreſſion and company of theſe two Sexes and Kinds, their iſſue might be enlarged to repleniſh the World.</p>

Of this moſt ſuperſtitious Sect, <hi>Mahomet,</hi> Born in <hi>Arabia,</hi> or as ſome report in <hi>Perſia</hi> was the Author: his Father was a Heathen Idolater, and his Mother an <hi>Iſmaelite,</hi> which cauſed her to have the more inſight into the Law of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews.</hi> This wicked Plant brought up and foſtered under his Parents, and inſtructed like a Mungrell in either of their Laws, became expert, being of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56578:43"/>
a quick and ready Wit: after the Death of his Father and Mother, he was a Servant to one <hi>Abdemona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> an <hi>Iſmaelite,</hi> who put him in truſt with his Merchandiſe, and other Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; and after his death, he Married his Miſtreſs.

He conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> divers lands and ſubdued them as Tributaries, and compelled them to live after the Tradition of his Laws, that he gathered out of the New and Old Teſtamants, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Heriſies of the <hi>Nicoluits, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niches,</hi> and <hi>Subelians:</hi> He died in the 40 <hi>th</hi> year of his age, his body was carried by the <hi>Saracens</hi> into a City of <hi>Perſia</hi> called <hi>Mecha,</hi> and put into a

Coffin of Iron which through the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of a Load-ſtone (to thoſe that know not the Sympathy of Nature) makes it to ſeem as if it hung mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly.

                  <hi>Martyrs,</hi> of them our Saviour Chriſt was the firſt Witneſs, and was incarnate, to be ſo for the Truth, he had for his Bleſſed and True Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the envy of the <hi>Jews;</hi> inſomuch, that they perſecuted him to the vile Death of the Croſs, for his moſt ſacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and report of the Truth; and they did no leſs perſue the Apoſtles and Meſſengers of the Truth: For when they following the Example of their Maſter, did openly declare the word of Truth, and namely <hi>Peter</hi> did ſorely rebuke the wickedneſs of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for putting to Death our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, the Author of Life, advertiſing of them to repent and amend. The <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo furious, that they Murthered <hi>Stephen,</hi> as the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56578:46"/>
Acts of the Apoſtles teſtifies, becauſe he was a Fervent and Zealous Witneſs of the Truth. This <hi>Stephen</hi> did two years continually, after Chriſts Death, diſpute with all the Learned men of <hi>Alexandria, Cyrene, Cilicia,</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> and by Heavenly Wiſdome confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all their Worldly Reaſon and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Learning, for which they were ſo poiſoned with Malice againſt him, that they violently Thruſt him out of the Citty, and then cruelly ſtoned him to Death. Thus <hi>Stephen</hi> was the firſt open maintainer and defender of our Chriſtian Religion. Afterwards St. <hi>Luke</hi> the Evangiliſt found ſuch bitter and ſharp perſecutions did burſt out againſt the Chriſtians that were in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that they were enforced to ſtray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and were ſcattered throughout all <hi>Jewry</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> ſaving that the Apoſtles remained and Sojourned at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Notwithſtanding this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution was a great furtherance of the Goſpel, by reaſon they ceaſed not, but Preached ſtill the Word every where to the great advance, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the number of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56578:47"/>
Amongſt the Heathen Nations <hi>Nero</hi> in the <hi>13th</hi> year of his Reign, was the firſt that perſecuted our Religion univerſally, and put St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> to Death, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently many other Innocents were ſlain cruelly: For out of a Bloody mind he had, he could not ſpare his own Countrey; but either for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of the ruinous Houſes, which he was exaſperated to behold, or elſe deſirous to ſee a reſemblance of the Burning of <hi>Troy,</hi> he ſet on fire the moſt part of the Citty of <hi>Rome,</hi> with ſo huge a flame, that it burnt ſix Days and ſix Nights continually, to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhing of many Thouſands of the Cittizens. Then to mitigate that shamefull and abominable Crime, he forged falſe Witneſſes, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were guilty of that Enormious Fact; and ſo, Thouſands of Innocents for Religion were moſt cruelly put to Death for the Tyrants pleaſure; and to obdurate and harden himſelf in miſchief, he proclaimed an open Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution againſt all that profeſſed the Name of Chriſt.

in the <hi>12th</hi> year of his Reign renewed another Perſecution; he cauſed St. <hi>John</hi> to be put into a Veſſel of burning Oyl, whereof he received no hurt. <hi>Trjan</hi> raiſed a third. The fourth <hi>Marcus Antonius. Lucius An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius Commodus</hi> ſtirred up. The fifth Perſecution was under the Emperour <hi>Severus.

The eighth <hi>Valerius.</hi> The ninth began under the Emperour <hi>Aurelianus.</hi> The tenth was by the Command of the Emperour <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximianus Herculeus:</hi> this Perſecution was far more cruell and general then any of the reſt; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that <hi>Diocleſian</hi> in the occient, and <hi>Maximinian</hi> in the occident, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed all the Churches, and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Chriſtians with moſt horrid Cruelties. The Books of Scripture were Burned, Churches plucked down, Chriſtian Magiſtrates that were in any Office were depoſed, Souldiers were enforced to deny their Faith; or elſe to be deprived of their Eſtates, or looſe their Lives. Neither were the three cruel Tyrants, <hi>Mezentius, Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>

Interlaced with Iron, ſeeming to ſtrike Fire out of a Flint, the word's <hi>ex ferro flamman,</hi> at the end hangs the Fleece, or <hi>Toiſond'or:</hi> Their Cloaks and Hoods are of Scarlet, garded with Embroidery like flames of Fire. <hi>Philip</hi> appointed for the celebrating of that Order on St. <hi>Andrews</hi> day, being the Thirtyeth of <hi>November.</hi> But the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, (Heir of the Houſe of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and chief of that Order) changed their Apparrel, and ordained that their Cloaks ſhould be of crimſon Velvet, and their Hoods of Violet coloured Velvet, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath they ſhould wear a Caſſock of cloath of Silver.</p>

the Brothers and Companions of this Order were bound at receiving of them, to forſake and leave all other orders, if they were of any, either of a Prince or any Company, only excepting Emperours, Kings and Dukes, which beſides this Order, might wear that Order whereof they were chief, with the agreement and conſent of the King and Brotherhood of the ſaid Order of other Emperours, Kings and Dukes. And for the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſance of this Order, and the Knights thereof, he gave to every one of them a Collar of Gold, wrought with Cockle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhells, Interlacing one another with a double pointing Ribbon of Silk, with Golden Taggs; the word, <hi>Imenſi Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Oceani,</hi> which King <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, becauſe of his Name, changed into a <hi>White-Friers,</hi> or <hi>Franciſcans</hi> Girdle, made af a Twiſted cord, and cauſed to be hanged on that collar a Tablet of St. <hi>Michael</hi> upon a Rock, conquering the Devil.

It was called by the name of the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe this <hi>Henry</hi> was on a <hi>Whitſonday</hi> choſen King of <hi>Poland.</hi> Of this Order is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a Book, containing the Articles whereunto the Knights thereof were bound. Among which I have princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally noted one, that is, to defend and ſuſtain the Clergy: For that the King doth give to every one of them the Rent of certain Abbies, Religious Houſes, or other Spiritual Lands, whereof they ſhall allow a certain Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, to the entertaining of ſuch a number of Religious perſons in every Religious houſe under him, and for that benefit are ſworn at the entring into the ſaid Order, always to defend the Spirituality, and to maintaine the Clergy in their priveledges; but how they keep their Oath, it is eaſily to be diſcerned in every place of their ſpiritual poſſeſſions: with which I have been often times very much diſſatisfied in, (for having oftentimes
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56578:58"/>
tryed the courteous demeanour, that commonly Religious Men uſe to Strangers that come to visit their houſes:) I have divers times been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently enformed by the Religious, how the King hath given the rents and Poſſeſſions of their Houſes to the Knights of his Order, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions already rehearſed, which Knights allow them ſuch bare exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, that by reaſon it is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to entertain the fourth part of the number of them appointed, many of them are conſtrained to forſake their houſes, and beg, or elſe they muſt ſtarve. The Pope conſidering what diſmembring of Church Lands arriſeth from this Order in the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> would not grant the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof: but notwithſtanding the Popes miſlike thereof t'is ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. The Collar of this Order is of <hi>Flowers de Lys,</hi> and Flames of Gold with a Croſs, and a Dove on it Pendant, repreſenting the Holy Ghoſt, Wrought in Orange tawny Velvet, garniſhed about with Silver Beams, which the Knights of that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56578:59"/>
Order wear upon their Cloaks, before their heart. Their Robe is a black Velvet Mantle, poudred with Lillies and Flames of Gold and Silver. None are admitted to this Order, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove their Nobility by three De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents at leaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Sixth Order,</hi> is of the Bath, brought firſt into <hi>England</hi> 1399 by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nry</hi> the Fourth; they are Created at the Coronation of Kings and Queens, and at the Inſtallation of the Princes of <hi>Wales.</hi> Their Duty is to Defend true Religion, Widdows, Maids, Orphans, and to maintain the Kings Rights.</p>

                  <hi>Ointments, Pliny</hi> is of opinion, that they were uſed long before the Battel of <hi>Troy;</hi> for <hi>Jacob</hi> ſent to his Son <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Aegypt</hi> Ointments: and <hi>Moſes</hi> that was three hundred and fifty years before the Siege of <hi>Troy,</hi> maketh mention of Ointments, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sanctification of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and the Prieſts of the Old Teſtament. <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Solinus</hi> report, that <hi>Alexander,</hi> when he conquered the Army of <hi>Darius,</hi> found amongſt other Jewels, ſpoiles and things of value a Casket of Ointments, that he highly eſteemed of. But <hi>Herodotus</hi> affirms that they were frequently uſed long before <hi>Darius</hi> time. For <hi>Cambyſes</hi> Son to <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opus</hi> King of the <hi>Macrobians,</hi> with great preſents, whereof a Box of Ointments was one. It is not certain when they firſt were uſed in <hi>Rome:</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:56578:60"/>
but I find in <hi>Pliny,</hi> that the five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſixty fifth year of the City, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> being Vanquiſhed, P. <hi>Licinus Craſſus,</hi> and <hi>Julius Ceſar,</hi> then Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, commanded that no Forraign or Strange confection of Ointments ſhould be ſold in the City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Original of the Heathen Gods,</hi> as the Scripture hath it, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 6. was, <hi>When the Spirits of the air (the Rulers of this World)</hi> began to give Prophetical anſwers out of Images, made to reſemble mortal men. and by their wicked Subtlety, did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend themſelves ſometimes to be of the Number of good Spirits, ſometimes Coeleſtial Gods, ſometimes the Souls of Valiant Lords: they brought Men into ſuch error and perplexity, that in a ſhort ſpace they did alienate their hearts from the Religion and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the true God, and ſo deluded them as to make them to repare to them for help, and to inquire their Oracles and Anſwers; which of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe had doubtful underſtandings, leaſt their Ignorance ſhould be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. By theſe deceitful means they
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56578:61"/>
were by divers Nations Deified, and ſundry people after divers manners choſe them for Gods, and with great reverence Worſhiped them. Theſe ſpirits of the Air that gave ſuch doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful anſwers to them that euquired any queſtion of them, were at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of our Saviour Chriſt all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. For when he was carried into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which was a Countrey full of Superſtition and Idolatry, all the Idols of that Nation were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown and Fell to the ground at his comming. And in the time of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour, both their wicked Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were aboliſhed, and alſo the Oracles of <hi>Appollo</hi> at <hi>Delphos,</hi> of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter Hammon</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> with the like vanities were ſubverted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Opinions of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, concerning the birth of Man,</hi> Were divers <hi>(Diodorus</hi> record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) that they ſpake of two ſundry manners of birth, and firſt ſtock of Mankind: for they which contend that the World was not generate and without any danger of Corruption, ſay alſo that Man hath been in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56578:61"/>
Perpetuity, without Beginning. Of this Opinion were <hi>Pythagoras, Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocrates,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> with other Peripateticks, affirming that all things in the Eternal World, which have been, or ſhall hereafte come to paſs, are by Generation endleſs, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Beginning, and have only a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit or courſe of Generations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in both the Birth, and natural reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of things may be perceived. Others ſuppoſe this World had both an Original cauſe of Being and ſhall alſo end by Putrefaction, they hold Opinion that Man had a time of his Generation.</p>

Others attribute the finding of it to the <hi>Aegyptians;</hi> but the enlarging of it to <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> who, beſides other more rare Experiments, found out the way of drawing of Teeth. In <hi>Rome, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chagathus</hi> of <hi>Peloponeſus</hi> was the firſt Phyſitian. In <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> they uſed no Phyſitians, but brought the Sick Perſons into the Streets &amp; Publick places, that ſo the Paſſengers might tell them what manner of Medicine or Dyet was good for them: neither was it Lawful for any Man to paſs by, till that he had ſpoke with the Patient. Afterwards the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> did ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56578:62"/>
the Art of Phyſick, that every Diſeaſe had a diſtinct Phyſition to look after it; one for the Head, another for the Eyes, others for other parts according as they excelled. Of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines made by Herbs, we have already in another place in part diſcourſed. <hi>Chiron</hi> the Son of <hi>Saturn</hi> as he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to have been ſo knowing in the virtue of Herbs, may be Accounted to have been one of the firſt inventers of Salves for Wounds and Sores: he found out the Herb called <hi>Centaurie,</hi> wherewith he cured the Wound that he had received from <hi>Hercules's</hi> Arrows falling on his Feet as he was handling of his Quiver. <hi>Mercury</hi> found out the uſe of Moly, and <hi>Achilles</hi> the virtue of Yarrow. Medicines made with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, were from <hi>Sol</hi> the Son of <hi>Oceanus:</hi> ſeveral Herbs alſo very neceſſary for Medicines; were diſcerned from thoſe cures Beaſts out of an inſtinct of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made on themſelves. Dittany by the Hare, which being Wounded with an Arrow, by the ſuddain Eating of it, is ſaid to drive it out of her Body. Celandine, which is an Herb which is
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56578:63"/>
much uſed for the cure of decayed Sight, was firſt perceived by the Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that uſes to Heal the Eyes of her Young-ones with it. The Boar in his Diſtemper cureth himſelf with Ivie. The Storke firſt taught men the uſe of Gliſters, who finding her ſelf very full, purgeth with her crooked Bill in her Fundament. The Weeſel in combate with the Serpent preſerveth it ſelf with Rue, and the Stork with Origany; and in the ſame manner, Nature hath taught other Creatures particular Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines for their Diſtempers.</p>

                  <hi>Painting,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> expreſſes, <hi>Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> a <hi>Lydian</hi> did firſt invent, he deviſed Portrature in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> In <hi>Greece Phyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> the Couſin of <hi>Dadolus,</hi> according to <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> mind.

                  <hi>Paper,</hi> before the invention of it, men uſed to Write in Leaves of Date Trees, and ſometimes on the Bark of Trees. Afterwards they Wrote their

minds publickly on Plates or Sheets of Lead, and their private Affaires in Tables of Wax; for Tables as <hi>Homer</hi> expreſſes were before the Sige of <hi>Troy.</hi> Paper was firſt deviſed by King <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> as <hi>Varro</hi> ſaith, it was firſt made of Fenny Ruſhes, that grew in the Marſh ground of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> But <hi>Pliny</hi> will have it that it was uſed in the time of King <hi>Numa</hi> that Reigned Three-hundred years before <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and his Books which were found in a Cheſt of Stone in a Field, by <hi>L.

                  <hi>Printing,</hi> that rare Art and Miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which hath preſerved the beſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors from the danger of corruption, was firſt found out in <hi>Germany</hi> at <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunce,</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:56578:64"/>
by one <hi>John Cuthenbergus</hi> a Knight; he invented alſo the Ink that <hi>PRINTERS</hi> Uſe, ſixteen years after <hi>Printing,</hi> which was in the year of our Lord 1458. One <hi>Conradus</hi> an <hi>Almaine</hi> firſt brought it into <hi>Rome: Nicholas John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> a <hi>French-</hi>man, did very much poliſh it, and now it is diſperſed through moſt parts of the World. This No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Art was firſt to Print Letters in Tin, Lead, and other mixt Mettall; <hi>'tis a Divine and Heavenly invention:</hi> but it would have been more Marvellous if it had not been ſo common. It is ſtrange and ſcarcely to be ſpoken, but 'tis as true as truth it ſelf, that one <hi>Printer</hi> may Print ſo many Letters in one day, that the ſwifteſt <hi>Scrivner</hi> or <hi>Writer</hi> is not able to do ſo much in a year. This Art was at the beginning in great Admiration, and of no leſs Lucre and Profit. It was firſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with more boldneſs and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence then any certainty, and it was about Eeighteen years afterwards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was common in <hi>Italy.</hi> But by the induſtry of man's Wit, it grew to that perfection, that it is now arrived
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56578:65"/>
to. Truly it had gone ill with all good Diſcipline (if it were now to have its beginning, ſeeing that for the moſt part people are grown ſo effeminate, and ſuch epicures, for here Learning is not <hi>Al-a-mode,</hi> many of our Gentry will ſcarce take up Books if they lay in the High-wayes, which in times paſt were valued more then if every Leafe had been in Beaten Gold, that the greateſt ſums of Money would have been given for them. If this Art had not been found out in a convenient and happy time, the Noble Acts of all Nations had never been ſo manifeſt to the Word: In like manner the memory of Ancient antiquity had not been ſo reſtored, and the Divine Wiſdome of the Phyloſophers had been in danger of being loſt, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath laine obſcure in a few written Copies theſe many Ages is now by this Art ſet forth to all immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Poetry</hi> is a moſt excellent Art, for it comprehends all other Sciences: This Art is only given of Nature by a Divine inſpiration, without which <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:56578:65"/>
affirmeth there could never be excellent Poets; for it proceedeth not ſo much from Art or Precepts, as from the Divine inſpiration and Spiritual power; and therefore <hi>Ennius</hi> called Poets Holy, becauſe they have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial prerogative. The beginning of this Art is very Ancient, and as <hi>Euſebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> ſaith, it flouriſhed firſt amongſt the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that were long before the <hi>Greeks.</hi> For <hi>Moſes</hi> the great Captain of the <hi>Jews,</hi> at that time he led the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> into the Land of Promiſe, paſſing the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> which by the power of God gave place to them, inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt made a Song of Hexameter Verſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, to render thanks to God for that deliverance. And <hi>David</hi> the Holy Prophet of God, after he was diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and freed from all his troubleſome and dangerous affairs in War, and had eſcaped the Aſſaults and Conſpiracies of Treaſon, living in happy and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous times of Peace, deviſed many pleaſant Tunable Hymnes for the praiſe of God in ſundry kinds of Meter. For as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith, the Pſalter of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56578:66"/>
                  <hi>David</hi> is in as good Number and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as either the Greek <hi>Planudes,</hi> or the Latine <hi>Horace:</hi> ſometimes in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi> Numbers, ſometimes in the Metre of <hi>Sappho,</hi> ſometimes with half mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. What is more ſtately and high then the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Deutrinomy,</hi> and of <hi>Iſaiah?</hi> more ancient then <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons?</hi> more perfect then <hi>Job?</hi> we may more highly aſcribe the invention of it to the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> 'tis nevertheleſs to be acknowledged that <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Linus,</hi> and after them <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiod</hi> did publiſh and adorn this Art with all manner of rich Furniture. The <hi>Romans</hi> received it not till of latter times; for <hi>Livius Andronicus</hi> (as <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> writes) in the year 513, after the City was Builded <hi>(Cains Claudius Cento,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Tuditanus</hi> being Conſuls) ſet forth the firſt Enterlude or Fable, a year before <hi>Ennius</hi> was Born. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe days it was ſo deſpicaple, that if one had profeſſed himſelf to be a Poet, he was imagined to be as bad as a Murtherer. The Author of Meter was Almighty God, who proportioned the World, with a certain order as it
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56578:66"/>
were a Meter: For there is none (as <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> taught) that can poſſibly doubt, but that there is in things Heavenly &amp; Earthly, a kind of Harmony; &amp; unleſs it were govern'd with a formal concord and deſcribed number, how could it ſo long continue? all other inſtruments that we poſceſs, are all faſhioned by a manner of Meaſure. <hi>Diodorus</hi> aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the invention of Meter, which the Poets by a Spiritual influence uſed in their Works, to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. Of Meters there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds that have their Name either of the thing that is deſcribed therein, (as Heroical Meter is ſo called of the Wars of Noble men that are conteined in it) wherein alſo <hi>Appollo</hi> gave his Oracles, therefore <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith we have that Meter of <hi>Pythius</hi> Oracle, or of the inventour as <hi>Aeſclepiadicall,</hi> or of the quantity of <hi>Jambicks,</hi> becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of a ſhort and long, which <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilocus</hi> firſt invented, of the number of Feet as <hi>Hexameter</hi> and <hi>Pentameter,</hi> which is alſo called Elegaical. The Shepards Song <hi>Daphus</hi> the Son of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> was firſt expert in: others in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56578:67"/>

               <p>A SATYRE, is a Poem that ſharply rebuketh Vice, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding of any Perſons. There are two kinds of Satyrs, the one which was both amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> in Antient times uſed for the diverſity of Meters much like a Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but that it is more wanton. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> of <hi>Tharſus</hi> and one <hi>Menipus</hi> a bond-man, whom <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> did counterfeit, were expert in this way of writing. The Second manner of Writing of Satyres was railing, only ordained to enveigh againſt Vice, they were deviſed of the <hi>Romans</hi> upon
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56578:75"/>
this occaſion. When the Poets that wrote the old Comedies, uſed to handle for their Arguments not only feigned matters, but alſo things really done, which although at the firſt was tollerable, yet afterwards by reaſon that they were ſo ſharp and bitter, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt every one that they pleaſed to have a fling at, there was a Law made, that no man ſhould afterwards repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend any perſon by name. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> in the place of theſe Comedies, ſubſtituted ſuch Satyres, as they had newly invented: afterwards began the new Comedi, which concernes gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all men of mean eſtat; and hath leſs bitterneſs and railing, but is more pleaſant and full of paſtime for the Auditors. Of theſe Comedies <hi>Menan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and <hi>Philemon</hi> were Authors, who abated of the tartneſs and crabbedneſs of the old writings, of them <hi>Caecilus, Nevius, Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terentius,</hi> learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to compile Comedies, although (as <hi>Quintilian</hi> will have it) they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver arrived to the leaſt proportion of their Patrons, becauſe as he writes they never attained to the leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56578:75"/>
of their Patrons, becauſe the Latin tongue is not ſo fit to receive the Ornaments of Eloquence, as the Greek tongue is. The Satyres had the names of <hi>Barbarian</hi> Gods that were Rude, Laſcivious, and Wanton in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; In this form of writing <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Horatius, Perſius, Juvanal,</hi> were the moſt eminent.</p>

Lib.</hi> 18. and the 23 in his Book <hi>de Cinitate Dei:</hi> the ſubſtance whereof followeth. The Earth ſhall ſweat the ſigns of Judgment: From Heaven ſhall come a King which ſhall Reign for ever, that is to ſay, in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Fleſh, to the end, that by his preſence he ſhall judge the World, ſo the unfaithful as well as the faithful ſhall ſee God with their eyes aloft a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Saints; and in the end of the World the Souls of Men with their Bodies ſhall appear; whom he ſhall judge when the roundneſs of the Earth untiled, ſhall be full of Clods of Earth and Graſs; Men ſhall caſt away their Idols, and all their precious Jewels, the World ſhall be conſumed with fire, he ſhall peirce the inferiour parts, and break the Gates of Hell; then to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56578:76"/>
the fleſh of Saints ſhall be given free and clear Light, and the evil ſhall be burned with Eternal fire: all Secrets ſhall be opened, and every one ſhall know the ſecret of his Neighbour, and God ſhall diſcover the Conſciences and Hearts of all men: then ſhall there be Lamentation and gnaſhing of Teeth, the Sun and the Stars ſhall looſe their Light, the Firmament ſhall be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the Moon ſhall be darkned, the Mountains ſhall be thrown down, and the Valleys ſhall be made equal with them; there ſhall be nothing in the World higher then another, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Valleys ſhall be made plain, all things ſhall ceaſe, and the Earth ſhall be dryed unto powder and duſt, the Fountains and Rivers ſhall be burned likewiſe: Then ſhall a Trumpet ſound from Heaven. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other things were Propheſied by this <hi>Sybil,</hi> and becauſe they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and therefore not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> before they came to paſs; ſhe ſaid they ſhall think me a falſe and blind Propheteſs, but when that they ſhall ſee theſe things
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56578:77"/>
accompliſhed, they will remember me, and call me not falſe Propheteſs, but the Propheteſs of the Almighty God. The Sixt was <hi>Samia,</hi> Born in the Iſle of <hi>Samos;</hi> ſhe ſaid, he being rich ſhall be Born of a poor Maid; the Creatures of the Earth ſhall adore him, and praiſe him for ever. The Seventh was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Cumana,</hi> becauſe ſhe propheſied at <hi>Cumas,</hi> a Town of <hi>Campania</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> her propheſie was, that he ſhould come from Heaven, and reign here in pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; he ſhould Rule in ſilence, and be Born of a Virgin. She is affirmed to have Written nine Books of the <hi>Sybils,</hi> they were all preſented by an old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to <hi>Tarquinius Superbus,</hi> but he not willing to pay ſo great a Sum of Money as was demanded, denied them: whereupon the old woman being vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Burned three of them, requiring as much Money for the other ſix, as for all: which being denied, ſhe alſo Burned the other three, asking as much for the other three remaining as for the reſt, which <hi>Superbus</hi> amazed, gave, and the old Trot vaniſhed. The Books contained manifeſt propheſies of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56578:77"/>
the Bleſſeſſed Kingdome of Chriſt, his Name, his Birth, and Death: they were burned by the Arch Traytour <hi>Stilico,</hi> ſo that thoſe Propheſies which are now extant, are only ſuch as are extracted out of other Writings. The Eight was <hi>Helle-ſpontica,</hi> Born at <hi>Marmiſea,</hi> in the Territory of <hi>Troy;</hi> her Propheſie was, that a Woman ſhall deſcend of the the <hi>Jews,</hi> called <hi>Mary,</hi> and of her ſhall be Born the Son of God, Named <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Carnal copulation; for ſhe ſhall be a Virgin before and after his Birth, he ſhall be both God and Man, he ſhall fulfill the Laws of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſhall add his Law thereunto, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhall remain for ever. The ninth was of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and Propheſied in the Town of <hi>Ancire:</hi> one-of her ſayings were, The Higheſt ſhall come from Heaven, and ſhall confirm the Counſell in Heaven, and a Virgin ſhall be ſhewed in the Valley of the Deſarts. The tenth was <hi>Albunea,</hi> Surnamed <hi>Tyburtina,</hi> becauſe ſhe was Born at <hi>Tyber,</hi> Fifteen Miles from <hi>Rome;</hi> her Propheſies was that the inviſible Word
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56578:78"/>
ſhall be Born of a Virgin; he ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe amongſt Sinners, and ſhall of them be deſpiſed. <hi>Lactantius Finuianus</hi> rehearſed divers of their Propheſies, without making any particular menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them: it is the opinion of ſome that they are to be referred more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to <hi>Sibylla Samberta,</hi> who Wrote Twenty-four Books in Verſe, chiefly Treating of the comming, miracles and life of Chriſt, whereunto the ſayings of all the other <hi>Sybils</hi> are conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> likewiſe in his Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-third Chapter of his Book <hi>de Cini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate dei,</hi> reciteth theſe Propheſies as followeth: Then he ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the wicked hands of the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, and they ſhall give him Buffets on his Face with their ſacrelegious Hands, they ſhall Spit upon him with foul and accurſed Mouths. He ſhall turn unto them his Shoulders, ſuffering them to be whipped; yea he ſhall hold his peace, not ſpeaking one word, to the end, that none ſhall know from whence his Words proceed. He ſhall alſo be Crowned with Thorns; and they ſhall give him Gall to eat, and Vinegar to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56578:78"/>
drink: Behold the Feaſt that they ſhall make him, inſomuch that the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and blind People ſhall nevertheleſs not know their God converſing amongſt Men: But they ſhall Crown him with Thorns, mingling for him Gall and Vinegar: then the Vaile of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall be rent, at Mid-day it ſhall be dark Night for the ſpace of three hours. So the Juſt ſhall dye the Death, and this Death or Sleep ſhall continue three dayes: and when he ſhall have been in the Bowels of the Earth, he ſhall riſe again and return to Life. <hi>Lactantius, Lib. 4. Chap.</hi> 15. rehearſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth theſe Propheſies of them: <hi>He ſhall raiſe the Dead, the Impotent and Lame ſhall walk and run nimbly, the Deaf ſhall hear, and the Blind ſhall ſee, the Dumb ſhall ſpeak: and that with five Loaves and two Fiſhes, he ſhould nouriſh in the Deſart Five-thouſand men, and the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof ſhould be ſufficient to ſatisfy many more.</hi> Many other things were foretold by theſe <hi>Sybils,</hi> as well of the ruins of great States, as of what they predicted of Chriſt.

To build theſe walls were hired by <hi>Semiramis,</hi> out of divers Countryes for a long ſpace 300000 men. The Second was the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of the Sun, offered by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> unto <hi>Jupiter.</hi> This Pillar ſtood in the Iſle of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and was made of Iron in the form of a man, of incredible great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, inſomuch that a man could ſcarce Fadom the great finger thereof.

This Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument was of a moſt excellent kind of Marble, it was 411 feet in circute, and 25 cubits high, it was invironed with 36 Pillars, moſt curiouſly carved. The Fifth was the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus</hi> of which in 'its proper place we have alſo diſcourſed more at large.
