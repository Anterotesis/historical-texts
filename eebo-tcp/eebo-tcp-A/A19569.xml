            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Earely beloved) I have lived now by Gods gratious diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, above fifty yeares; and in the place of my allotment two and twenty full. How unprofitably ſo ever in the dayes of my vanity, when the world, the fleſh, and the Devill, bore ſway; yet, through undeſerved grace, painefully, ever ſince the weight of a peoples care was noticed to my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I have had <hi>great labours, ſome watchings, many ſtrifes,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
<pb facs="tcp:480:6"/>
with my ſelfe, and others, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout truth, and godlineſſe. And though I have earneſtly contended that <hi>the mouth of the oxe might not be muzled, that treadeth out the corne,</hi> but that J, and others of Gods labourers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ight live honorable of the goſpell, and at the Altar, at which we ſerve, as Chriſt hath ordained: yet (with a good conſcience) I can ſay as the Apoſtle, <hi>I have coveted no mans gold, or ſilver, or apparrell:</hi> I have loved, and <hi>deſired to ſpend, and to be ſpent, though the more I love, the leſſe I am loved</hi> of ſome few</p>
            <p>I know that J muſt <hi>lay downe this tabernacle,</hi> and the time of my diſsolution is not farre off. Therefore doe I more ſeriouſly beginne to thinke of my ſtate: and doe ſet upon it to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how I am like to be preſented <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tribunall ſeate of God.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I thinke of my ſinnes, and manifold
<pb facs="tcp:480:6"/>

            <p>But, till that time come I lie under the expectation of flouds of ſorrowes, ſtreames of temptations, and other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane infirmities. I pray that J may doe nothing that may diſhonour Chriſt my maſter, and that I may ſuffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may drive me from him and his ſervice. J know that the waſters of grace are ſtrong, and many, and that no goodneſſe is entayled to us without great care and vigilancy. I know that ſinnes and afflictions are the two great enemies of perſeverance.
<pb facs="tcp:480:7"/>
And though ſinne be the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, which yet (through grace) I have learned to trample upon with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant acts of piety and charity, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my meaſure,</hi> yet afflictions are my next care, which if they bee ſlighted, will make ſecret inrodes to hind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>My afflictions have not beene ſo weighty as millions of Gods deare ſaints have felt. In this Gods grace hath beene marvellous, becauſe hee knowes my weakeneſſe to beare, and my unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe to bee a ſouldier in that war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare: yet have they not beene ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as that they have not made me work enough. It is grievous to bee ſlighted of them whom a man dearely loves and to have contempt powred upon that which comes in fulneſſe of ſtrength, and tenderneſse of affection to doe good. Jt is hard not once ſcarce to be thanked, for conſtant travels to
<pb facs="tcp:480:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
edifie and ſave ſoules. It is ſomething to ſee reſpects fly abroad in full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſtrangers, when nearer relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are forgotten.</p>
            <p>But to bee <hi>perſecuted by the tongues</hi> of thoſe a man deſerves well of, and to be <hi>privily ſmitten</hi> of thoſe from whom beſt incouragements are due, will wound the heart of a <hi>David</hi> though he be after Gods owne heart. J have of long ſuffered words of dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution and diſparagement. They have beene my meate, drinke, and cloathing.

not lived like thy ſervant, though with much ſenſible weakeneſſe? have <hi>I not laboured in thy vineyard</hi> with all my ſtrength? have J not taught thy truth by <hi>taking heede to reading and doctrine?</hi> yes ſurely, ſaith my conſcience I have <hi>kept back none of thy counſell,</hi> I have not <hi>ſtrengthened the hands of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe.</hi> I have loved the godly, as ſuch, though I have hated their indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions, as well as my owne. J have been kinde and courteous to thoſe that have ill rewarded me. Onely, this is the truth, J have loved the Church of God amongſt us, and the whole go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement eccleſiaſticall, and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall If any thing have appeared harſh, I have excuſed it a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:480:8"/>
ſay, like a man, but J will ſay, and J am ſure, like a miniſter.</p>
            <p>This hath fallen upon darke melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick, high lookt, and ſowre natures, and ſo hath ſuffered a diſguſt. Some have beene ſowred, but ſweetned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with the trade of the good word of God, and the practiſe of affability. Some have beene eſtranged till this contracted folly hath beene digeſted. Some have complayned of chiding, when my nature can chide nothing but ſinne and diſorder: and ſome have hardned themſelves in error, and ſchiſme. To croſſe me (I feare) and my tenets for the Church, they have revenged upon themſelves.</p>
            <p>What theſe few will gaine in the iſſue I doe not know. This (I doubt) that they will repent, if greatneſſe of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack will let them looke backe againe, when it is too late. But for you (my good people) <hi>in whoſe hearts God

            <p>I know that ſome of you beare a deare and tender affection to theſe few ſeduced ones, though now they will not heare you. Ye have lived in the ſame Church together like friends: ye have delighted in the ſame word of God, prayer, and ſacraments: yee have ſweetly comforted one another in the private communion of Saints: and
<pb facs="tcp:480:9"/>
ye ſee that ſtill they ſeeme to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable lives towards men, and that they pretend to delight ſtill in the word of Chriſt, which <hi>is the onely rule of ſalvation.</hi> Theſe things will give great advantage to them to worke upon you, and to you to keepe intimate familiarity with them. But (in the feare of God I beſeech you) take heede: weigh well what in this diſcourſe J ſay, and <hi>God give you underſtanding in all things.</hi> Jt is no ſmall charge to unchurch a church, to unminiſter a miniſtery, and to unworſhip a worſhip. They muſt be ſure of their hands, that they can, and will anſwer it to Chriſt with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence when they have done it. To doe it with a trembling heart, is to doe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt conſcience. To doe it <hi>with full aſſurance of underſtanding,</hi> is to doe it with ſure warrants, and precepts of Chriſt. If they have ſuch againſt our
<pb facs="tcp:480:10"/>
Church, I am ſure we ſhall finde them: if not let them goe, if they will, but follow not them in the breach.</p>
            <p>To keepe you out of it, I have done as J doe: and to gaine them too, if they will not bee reſolved without grounds. J am ſure they ſhall have no iuſt cauſe to except againſt my dealing with them. They may except againſt me, as an <hi>Engliſh Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Biſhops creature,</hi> as I heare, but ſhall never againſt my courſe with them. I have dealt with them with matter more then with words: and becauſe they pretend to two things, to the <hi>ſcriptures,</hi> and to <hi>conſcience,</hi> and I know a third thing in them, <hi>weakeneſſe.</hi> Therefore have J dealt with them accordingly. J have compared ſcripture with ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to finde out the truth, but cannot finde theirs. I have dealt
<pb facs="tcp:480:10"/>
conſcionably with them in fighting with that onely weapon againſt them, of their owne chooſing, the word of Chriſt. And becauſe they are weake, I have not ſhewed my ſelfe a man in giving them any bitter language, or exaſperating termes. As the barking of one dogge begets the barking of another, though it bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Moone: ſo is it with high words, and therefore it were glorious, and above a man, if it were layed downe on all ſides, and partakings. But as the waves of the ſea, when they meete not with a rocke, but with the ſands, they returne backe-againe with a wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry flaſh: ſo have J done by them, <hi>that all our matters may be done in love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeede I have taken their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted name out of their mouthes, <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:480:11"/>
and given their right one unto them, <hi>Browniſts;</hi> and this J have done out <hi>of conſcience.</hi> I finde by experience that the word, <hi>Separation,</hi> doth winne to their cauſe: For, when people of ſtrong affections, and weaker Iudgements, doe reade of the neceſsity of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſcriptures; and can not diſcerne how we have made ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from heatheniſme, and when we have beene thruſt out of <hi>Rome (becauſe wee were unwilling to bee ſo bad as ſhee)</hi> have maintayned our juſt ſtanding from her in a divided way; they have beene willing to hearken to a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting plott. Therefore Browne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leader amongſt us, to this breach, (if now time hath not made it worſe then he intended it) J can not nickname, but inconſcience call
<pb facs="tcp:480:11"/>
the childe after the fathers name. Jt was Chriſts courſe, <hi>ye are of your father the Devill, his children ye are,</hi> and ſo muſt I.</p>
            <p>Jt is true alſo, that afterwards, yee may finde ſome opinions gone againſt, that are held by ſome that keepe Communion with our Church, as of a true Church. But I am ſure they are the <hi>Browniſts</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alſo, to whom I ſpeake. All that I can ſay therefore for that, is this. Jt may bee, that ſome of you know, or have heard of that Noble Moralizers fable of <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olus,</hi> who when hee was in all his military accoutraments to give combate (as hee thought) to <hi>Argalus</hi> a Knight of the Sunne. This mans wife dreſſed her ſelfe in her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands armour, and gave her husbands enemy meeting. <hi>Amphiolus</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters
<pb facs="tcp:480:12"/>
valiantly, gave a wound in the necke, cloſeth, overthrowes, and gives a mortall wound in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But when hee opened the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, viewes his Conqueſt, and ſaw it was faire <hi>Parthenia, Arga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> his wife, he could have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the day, it became not a man ſo to ruine a woman. Such is my caſe heere. J ſay as a father of old, <hi>I dare not write againſt a Biſhop of my communion;</hi> the love of brotherly peace is glorious in the Church, even among men that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe differ in opinion. But if they put on the armes of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, (becauſe they will bee ſo) with whom I fight for truth, I cannot helpe it, if they meete with a blow, though I glory not in it, yea am ſorry that there ſhould be any ſuch cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:480:12"/>I have now done, and commend you all <hi>to the word of Gods grace which is able to ſave your ſoules,</hi> though no Bowniſt, nor Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt had ever beene hatched. <hi>Live in peace, and the God of peace ſhall bee with you.</hi> Give not way to any opinion whereby the <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſpirit, and the bond of love</hi> may be broken. <hi>Play the men, be ſtrong and of a good courage.</hi> Have prepared hearts to dye for Chriſts cauſe: but, to bee ſticklers in ſuch poore quarrels, as can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bring peace to the Church, nor comfort to you at laſt, abhorre. <hi>Wee muſt all appeare before the Iudgement ſeate of God,</hi> where colours ſhall doe us no good, becauſe we ſhall be iudged naked: where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences ſhall doe us no good, becauſe <hi>the bookes ſhall bee opened:</hi>

Theſe thou ſhalt finde cleared (as I judge in conſcience) in moſt Sections, as thou goeſt along. Theſe are <hi>1 Cor. 6.17.</hi> whereupon they ground their ſeparation; and <hi>Mat. 18.15, 16, 17, 18. 1 Cor. 5.</hi> whereupon they ground the new Pariſh diſcipline. Thou ſhalt finde theſe cleared <hi>Section 5. and 12.</hi> But before thou readeſt, I would intreate thee to correct the errours of the preſſe, printed at the latter end of the booke: and then learne with me, or learne me.</p>

               <p>Indeed <hi>Browne</hi> did afterward fall away from them, and his owne tenets, for the moſt part.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing the firſt authour juſtly gives the name (as that carpenter that builds an houſe for the building of it, though after<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward hee burne it down) therefore I cannot bee ſo unjuſt, as to ſuffer them, by mee, to

               <p>Theſe grounds of Browniſme they referre to three heads, to wit, our church, our miniſtery, and our worſhip.</p>
               <list>

                  <item>3 They deny us to have a true worſhip.</item>
               </list>
               <p>If this charge were true, ſurely, they might ſay as <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Eliab, Is there not a cauſe</hi>? But whether it bee not moſt falſe let a good conſcience, guided by the word of God, Judge,</p>
               <p>Firſt, they deny that wee have a true church. And though wee being in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and they labouring to caſt us out, we might put them to the proofe, yet ſhall I (by Gods helpe) tender them this one reaſon, among many, to prove that we have a true church.</p>
               <p>Where there is the true matter and form of a true church, there is a true church. For this cannot be denied, that the matter and forme of a true man make a true man, that is, the body and ſoule united: ſo muſt it be in the church. But our church hath the true matter and forme of a true church: and therefore is a true church.</p>
               <p>It is denied by the <hi>Browniſts</hi> that wee have ſuch matter and forme; and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:480:30"/>
thus, firſt for the matter. The true matter of a true church is <hi>ſuch as profeſſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving truth taught in the Scriptures,</hi> and is proved thus. That which makes a man a true member of a true churh, that doth make a true church (for members doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the whole): but profeſſion of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving truth makes a true member of a true church; for <hi>Symon Magus,</hi>

Now, that we in the church of <hi>England</hi> do profeſſe ſaving truth, according to the ſcriptures cannot be denied. If <hi>the Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> ſay, that wee overthrow all by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of wicked lives in perſons, in, and of our church. I am ſure that the church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> was worſe then ours can be (in ſome things), it was too bad with <hi>envyings,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Object.

Then let them know that Chriſts body may be taken two wayes: for a body of all thoſe that ſhall be ſaved;<note place="margin">Eph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1.23.</note> and this is the catholicke church, which are in communion of ſaints for life: and for a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of thoſe that are in the way of ſalvation if they be not enemies to themſelves; as <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry branch in Chriſt that beareth not fruit.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, for the forme of a true church, that is Chriſt united unto the perſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing his ſaving truth. For as the forme of a man is his ſoule united to his body; ſo the forme of a church, which is the body of Chriſt, is Chriſt united unto it. Now, that Chriſt is united unto our church, is proved thus: becauſe hee gives the law of union to us as to the body, and makes it effectuall for conviction, or converſion, to ſerve the living and true God. As a king is united to his ſubjects by his lawes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:480:31"/>
of them for rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: ſo is Jeſus Chriſt to our church. As the head united gives lawes to the body for ſafety: ſo doth Chriſt give lawes to us for our ſalvation in his word.<note place="margin">Pſal. 147.</note> 
                  <hi>He hath not dealt ſo with every nation,</hi> yet (bleſſed bee his name) he hath ſo dealt with us to the joy of our ſoules.<note place="margin">Object.</note> True (ſay the <hi>Browniſts</hi>) wee have his lawes, but doe not anſwer them in our lives.</p>
               <p>This doth not cut us off (being but true in part) till Chriſt hath ſued out his bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> no more then the diſobedience of a wife makes her no wife; the diſobedience of a ſonne no ſonne; and the diſobedience of a ſervant no ſervant.</p>
               <p>Againe Chriſt is united to us, becauſe hee makes his law effectuall for the convincing of all, and for the converting of many ſoules to cleave unto him faithfully.<note place="margin">Gal. 3.17 Rom. 6.</note> VVe are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and ſo <hi>put on Chriſt,</hi> and are <hi>graffed into the ſimilitude of his death and reſurrection.</hi> But as we grow in age, many grow in grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe, and <hi>forget the covenant of their God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 78.10 37.</note> Then comes the word of Chriſt convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and calls many backe, kills ſinne, quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens grace,<note place="margin">Luk. 1.17</note> and <hi>converts the hearts of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the children, and the diſobedient to the wiſedome of the juſt.</hi> This the <hi>Browniſts</hi> will not deny. They confeſſe that God hath many gracious people amongſt us by the word, and ſacraments. VVhence, I pray, doth this proceed, but from the influence
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:480:32"/>
and power of Chriſt united to us? I am ſure that Chriſt <hi>is the way to</hi> heaven;<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.</note> and one ſoule cannot bee converted from the kingdome of ſinne to grace, but it is by the power and influence of Chriſts three offices. As he is a Prophet,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30</note> hee muſt be his <hi>wiſedome,</hi> to teach him repentance from dead works, and faith in Chriſt. As hee is a Prieſt, he muſt make his attonement betwixt God and him for <hi>righteouſneſſe.</hi> And as he is a King, hee muſt over-maſter the gates of hell, and maintaine him to himſelfe in the way of ſalvation, for <hi>ſanctification,</hi> and full <hi>redemption.</hi> Conclude therefore, that if wee have the matter and forme of a true church, wee muſt bee a true church againſt all exception, if good conſcience judge by the word of God.</p>

of more or fewer, ſeparated from all falſe waies, and having ſufficient autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity within it ſelfe for governement in all cauſes eccleſiaſticall, and aſſembling (at times convenient) for exerciſe of governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſolemne worſhip. This is the full ſumme of what I can conceive them to ſay of a true church: in which they would make it up of theſe foure ingredients.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> it muſt be a ſet congregation (which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
we call a pariſh, and they miſlike).

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> it muſt bee ſeparated from all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
falſe wayes, not onely of <hi>Iewes, Turkes,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> but from all groſſe ſinnes and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which doe pollute the worſhip of the ſincereſt ſervice of God. Yet ſurely, they would have them better taught, and made good, that, by the conſent of the members,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:480:33"/>
they might be jointed in at laſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it muſt have ſufficient authority within it ſelfe for governement in all cauſes eccleſiaſticall, that is, a plenary power, by conſent of members, to ordaine mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, call, or caſt them out, (as the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the church requires) to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and receive in, and to order all things in their aſſemblies for the advancement of Chriſts kingdome, without the leave or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of any.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> it muſt aſſemble for acts of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement, and ſolemne worſhip, (without which it is but a ſhadow) that is, it muſt meete in their meeting places to pray, preach, prophecy, baptize, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, as the ſpirit gives wiſedome and utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>Now, becauſe they finde not our chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches thus made up, according to their owne fanſies; therefore doe they forſake them as falſe, or (at the leaſt) no true churches. This is their new way of churching and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churching of aſſemblies (ſo farre as I can ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their conferences and writings): and they judge of our aſſemblies after this mould. I hope they will not deny us to have aſſemblies; or to be ſeparate from <hi>Iewes, Turkes, Pagans, Idolaters,</hi> and wicked <hi>Belia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> in communion for ſpirituall life by Chriſt; that wee have authority, and power for ordination, excommunication, abſolution, and order; or that wee have
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:480:33"/>
aſſemblies for governement, and ſolemne worſhip: and for the reſt of the frame it is but the iſſue of their owne braine, and not of the law and rule of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For <hi>firſt,</hi> whereas they would have no nationall churches, but particular in depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent congregations:<note place="margin">Act. 7.38</note> they muſt confeſſe that the whole nation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was but <hi>one church.</hi> And though then they had but <hi>one Tabernacle,</hi> yet when after they were divided into ſeverall <hi>Synagogues,</hi> did they not continue the only church of God? were they not ſtill reputed of God as one man, though ſome were better, and more worſe?</p>
               <p>It is true, ſay they,<note place="margin">Object.</note> becauſe they had but one high-prieſt, a figure of Chriſt which was to vaniſh. Nay rather,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> becauſe they were but one people and common-wealth, profeſſing the ſame religion, and ruled by the ſame lawes, both before they had one high-prieſt, and after, when (by corruption) <hi>they had two.</hi>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> whereas they urge that a true church muſt be ſeparate from all falſe waies: it is true; it muſt be thus in profeſſion, when they are plainely diſcovered by undoubted ſcriptures: but that it muſt be actually thus, or be unchurched, is utterly falſe. <hi>Iſrael</hi> was <hi>Gods people,</hi>

                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> whereas they put into the end of their aſſembling, not onely the exerciſe of governement, whereof they have none, and preaching, prayer, ſacraments, which are good indeed, if done by right perſons, and in right manner; but <hi>prophecying</hi> too: ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly herein they <hi>walke not with a right foote according to the truth</hi> of the ſcriptures.<note place="margin">Gal. 2.14</note> They make <hi>prophecying</hi> an act of ſome private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whereby, as the ſpirit moves them, they put in, in publicke, their verdicts with their Paſtours and Doctours, about the ſence, doctrine, and application of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures propounded: but how Chriſts word makes this good to them I cannot ſee, nor ever ſhall.

               <p>If therefore they will prophecy, let them ſhew their calling to that office, and then vent their gifts. Doe they doe it by vertue of their generall, or ſpeciall calling?

               <p>NExt they object againſt us the <hi>entrance into a true church.</hi> Wee ſhould (ſay they) have entred into the ſtate of a viſible church, by voluntary covenant upon know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to advance the kingdome of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo to have a right to the name of a true church, and to the priviledges of it for us, and our children: but wee were forced in our firſt planting by edicts, lawes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, and yet admitted members, and our poſteritie after us by baptiſme, even of ſuch of us as are not members in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
               <p>Put caſe this great plea were true at firſt, yet may not an after mending of what was firſt amiſſe, rectifie and confirme all? Things may bee ill done at firſt, which being once done, may bee of force, and being well carried may end with a bleſſing. A child marries without conſent of parents, and it is wickedly done, yet when it is done, and ſealed with the bed by free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſhall it not bee of force? Nay, doe not parents looke upon their courſes, and, if they ſee a good carriage, and good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, doe they not like it well, and follow it with their bleſſings? Shall wee make
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:480:39"/>
God an harder maſter? will hee not love <hi>Iacob</hi> though hee got the bleſſing by deceit? God purpoſed him the bleſſing: and though hee got not the poſſeſſion the right way, ſhall his purpoſe faile? God forbid: yea <hi>let God be true and every man a lyar;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ro, 3.3, 4</note> 
                  <hi>Iacobs unbeliefe makes not the faith of God of none effect.</hi> So might God deale with us. Hee purpoſed to us the covenant of the Goſpell, and wee came not to it the right way, yet when we are in it, <hi>in the place where it was ſaid unto us, ye are not my people,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 9.26</note> 
                  <hi>wee ſhall bee called the children of the living God.</hi> Put caſe a childe bee cut out of the mothers belly, and come not the ordinary way, ſhal the father when hee ſees it live, and thrive, deny it to be his childe, and conclude it to be a baſtard? So will our God deale with us.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould wee grant them this? wee failed not in our entrance: they can never prove it by the word of Chriſt. A true viſible church may bee conſidered two waies; in <hi>the planting,</hi> and <hi>in the reforming of it.</hi> How wee entred into a true church in our firſt planting, God knowes,<note place="margin">Ro. 10.18</note> we know not from his word. <hi>The ſound of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles went into all the earth, and their words into the end of the world. The Goſpel is come unto you</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Coloſsians) and to all the world, and bringeth forth fruit</hi>:<note place="margin">Col. 1 6.</note> and ſurely it entred to us (as it ſhould) by ſome Apoſtle, or Apoſtolicke men, to make our
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:480:40"/>
ancient predeceſſours a true church. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we were without Chriſt: now wee know him. Before, wee were without the covenant; now wee are in by baptiſme. Before, wee were no profeſſours; now we are,<note place="margin">Ex. 20.</note> and God <hi>ſhewes mercy to thouſands among them that love him, and keepe his commandements,</hi> and <hi>is their God, and the God of their ſeede.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 9.9. Gen. 17.7.</note> But this is not the ſtate of the queſtion now.</p>
               <p>Therefore for the <hi>reforming</hi> of a church God would have this courſe. As it was with <hi>Iob,</hi> hee was firſt of Gods making, and next (by Gods permiſſion) of the Devils marring, when he was full of bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and ſores, ſcarce knowne to his friends, and loathſome to his wife. All this while <hi>Iob</hi> was a true man, as he was before, though clouded with ſome fearefull fits of impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But when God would lift up <hi>Iob</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, hee did not make a new <hi>Iob,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the old, he cured, and cleanſed him, that hee might appeare like himſelfe, and his end was happy. So God dealt with the church. After it had covenanted with God at firſt, it wanted no botches, it was fearefully overſpread with diſeaſes. But when God would have it raiſed againe, hee doth not build a new church, but refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the old. Hee ſhewes our forefathers where they were at a loſſe: that they had the faith of Chriſt in the articles, and the profeſſion of it in publicke feſtivities: but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:480:40"/>

they entred upon neceſſarie knowledge; that they made a covenant in receiving the word, and ſacraments; that they were voluntarily, or forced, yet lawfull profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, when they ſtated a viſible church: yet they were (many of them) <hi>baptized, when they were the ſeed of them that were not mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible church.</hi> Conceive it thus.

               <head>SECT. 9. A queſtion by the way, about bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Baſtards of impenitent Chriſtians.</head>
               <p>I Confeſſe, I never yet talked with any <hi>Brownist</hi> about this particular; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I finde too many conſcious people, hanging after forraigne novelties, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing upon (with admiration) the membring, and diſmembring in viſible churches: who when they heare of Chriſtians lawfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten children denied baptiſme, beginne to wonder that chriſtians baſtards ſhould be admitted. Therefore to cleare both (as God ſhall in able) I ſhall labour to ſatisfie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (as I have done ſome) in this queſtion. <hi>whether baſtards are baptizable while their mothers are in their ſinnes of adultery, or forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and whether men ought not to stay their baptiſme, untill they be reconciled to God, in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:480:44"/>
open church, which is publickely ſcandalized by her fact, and from which ſhe hath diſmembred her ſelfe by her misdeed</hi>?</p>
               <p>In this I finde two queſtions inwrapt in one: whether baſtards are baptizable? and whether men ought not to ſtay ſuch bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, till the harlot bee reconciled to God, and this be done in the open church ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, from which by her fact ſhe hath cut herſelfe off by her ſinne? I ſhall firſt labour to ſtate theſe queſtions, and then the caſes will more eaſily appeare.</p>
               <p>The eſtate of the firſt may be thus ſet. By <hi>baſtards,</hi> ſuch children are meant, as come not into the world by lawfull acts of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: and by <hi>baptizable</hi> is meant, ſuch as have a right to the ſacrament of baptiſme in the church. And the queſtion is not, whether <hi>bastards</hi> in generall are <hi>baptizable</hi>? for ſo it is certaine that all are not, as the <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards</hi> of <hi>Iewes, Turkes,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> who have no right to <hi>baptiſme</hi> but by perſonall confeſſion. But the queſtion is, whether the baſtards of the profeſſours at large, in a chriſtian church, which is in covenant with God (for the outward priviledge of the church at leaſt) have right to baptiſme? of theſe the inquiry is, becauſe in the ſecond part of this queſtion, is ſpoken of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers reconciling to God, in the open church offended.</p>
               <p>The ſtate of the ſecond queſtion muſt be laid by conſidering two things:

               </p>
               <p>The perſons enquired of, are <hi>Men</hi>: and it is too generall a terme. For it cannot meane, <hi>any men</hi> of that aſſembly, where ſuch a baſtard is preſented: for they have no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority (knowne to mee from ſcriptures) to meddle in any cenſure eccleſiaſticall.

               <p>Next, conſider in the queſtion, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theſe perſons, <hi>whether they ought to ſtay baſtards from baptiſme</hi>? By this, two things may bee meant: <hi>denying</hi> baptiſme; but no man would utterly exclude ſuch: and <hi>ſuſpending</hi> baptiſme; and of this is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: for it makes a double limitation; firſt, <hi>till the harlot be reconciled to God.</hi> In this, the queſtion meddles not with the <hi>judgement of God,</hi> who by his ſure omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, knowes who are reconciled to him, and who not: nor with <hi>the judgement of the conſcitnce</hi> of any reconciled perſons, who by the aſſurance of faith or hope, may believe, or hope, that they are reconciled; for this is Gods tribunall: but with <hi>the judgement of the church,</hi> which under the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of charity (as it was termed of old) by the harlots words, and actions may judge the beſt: and ſo this parr of the queſtion is utterly void. For I never yet knew harlot but would confeſſe, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her ſinne, and promiſe amendement before her baſtard was baptized, and ſo give a ground for charitable hope.</p>
               <p>The ſecond limitation is, <hi>till ſhee bee pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickely reconciled to the church ſcandalized, from which by her fact ſhee hath cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> the perſons offended, are <hi>the Church ſcandalized</hi>: by which the queſtion meanes not the <hi>Catholik,</hi> or <hi>nationall</hi> Church; for with both theſe the harlot may be friends ſtill; becauſe they cannot take notice of every ſuch fact, to bee offended by it: But the particular Church and aſſembly united by God, and the lawes for the profeſſing of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſaving truth. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> conſider then the danger of the harlot offending; <hi>ſhee hath cut her ſelfe off,</hi> as the queſtion implyes: but conſider <hi>how</hi> ſhe hath cut her ſelfe off? and <hi>how farre?</hi> ſhee hath not cut her ſelfe off by excommunication eccleſiaſticall: for that is not in her power, and the <hi>Church</hi> hath not yet proceeded againſt her: but by excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication morall, by the wickedneſſe of

her fact, which makes her cenſurable both heere and hereafter, in an high degree, if ſhe repent not heartily. But how farre hath ſhe cut her ſelfe off?

And ſecondly, from publike communion with the viſible Church in ſome holy things, when ſhe is proceeded againſt, till ſhee hath outwardly, in the congregation confeſſed her fault (if neede require) and promiſed amendment. In ſome holy things (I ſay) for I anſwer, none will deny her a right to reade the word of God, or to heare it read, to heare good exhortations and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or to pray in private, which yet are the acts of a true Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> conſider the remedy of this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, (<hi>her reconciling to the Church:</hi>) by which we muſt not vnderſtand, her returning into favour, by communion with the Church in repentance unto life, and the faith of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:480:47"/>
elect; for no man, or men, can judge cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely of theſe: but onely returning into favour by communion with the Church in profeſſion to have them.</p>
               <p>The queſtion being thus ſtated, wee may the more eaſily conceive and give ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying anſwers. To the firſt, <hi>whether Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards are baptizable</hi>?<note place="margin">1 Why the baſtards of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are baptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</note> I anſwer, the baſtards (as other children) of Iewes, Turkes, and Infidels are not: but the baſtards of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of Chriſtianity are, for theſe two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe that which gives right unto the parents, gives right unto the children in the parents right (for when the parents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the faith of Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.16.</note> the Apoſtles did baptize them and their children, if any ſuch were in the houſhold:<note place="margin">Act. 12. Act. 8. Mat. 28.</note>) But profeſsion of Chriſtianity gives right to the Parents: for if men doe but profeſſe their faith in the Trinity, they are baptizeable: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the baſtards of Chriſtans are baptize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe the children of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are baptizeable: but baſtards of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, are the children of Chriſtians; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſuch parents ſhould be rebaptized: therefore they are baptizeable.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond queſtion, <hi>whether men ought to ſtay their baptiſme, till the harlot be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto God in the open church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcandalized by her fact, and from which ſhee hath diſmembred herſelfe by her miſdeed</hi>? I
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:480:47"/>
anſwere, firſt to the grounds of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in limitations: and next to the queſtion it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>To the grounds of the queſtion,<note place="margin">2 An har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots fact doth not make her no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</note> I anſwer two things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that her fact hath not ſo diſmembred her as to make her no chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. For let me aske, doth a vaſte ſinne ſo cut off from Chriſt, that it doth unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian a man or woman? I doe not aske this to move any man or woman to flatter themſelves in ſuch a caſe. For ſuch have juſt cauſe to doubt whether they are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivocall members of ſaving Chriſt: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they know by aſſurance of faith, whether ever they ſhall riſe againe: becauſe <hi>God ſaies to no man, ſinne, and my grace ſhall helpe thee up.</hi> But I aske it, to ſhew the hope and charity of the church, about ſuch wicked profeſſours of chriſtianity. Beſides, if her fact had made her no chriſtian, ſhee ſhould be rebaptized: but ſhee hath ſtill the character of baptiſme, and hath right to the inward comforts of it, if ſhe repent: and ſo, in her ſtate, and right, her baſtard hath a right alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I anſwer, that her ſcandalizing of the church, where ſhee lives,<note place="margin">3 An harlots fact doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive her or her child of the right of chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive her ſelfe, or her childe, of the right of chriſtianity. As for her childe, the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall was given by the mother, not that, who is a ſufferer in the ſhame of the ſinne, not a doer in the worke of it. As for her ſelfe, though her ſcandall deprive her of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:480:48"/>
the beſt comforts of chriſtianity, till ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: yet not of a right to ſome of the outward priviledges of Chriſtianity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the baptiſme of her childe is one.</p>
               <p>And this the rather, becauſe an harlot amongſt chriſtians, having a baſtard and not profeſſing her ſelfe ſorrowfull, and that ſhee doth believe in Chriſt, is not (for ought I know, or have heard) to bee found what ever her heart be.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4 No man ought lawfully to ſtay ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Baptiſme.</note>Now, ſecondly, to the queſtion it ſelfe, I anſwer, that no man either in that church, or over that church, ought lawfully to ſtay <hi>baſtards</hi> from baptiſme. Becauſe they that are in the covenant of Chriſtianity (<hi>as thoſe that are to be regenerated, though not yet actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally regenerate</hi>) are not to be ſtayed from baptiſme:<note place="margin">Vt regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randi et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi nondum regenerati</note> but the baſtards of chriſtian har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots are in ſuch a covenant of chriſtianity: therefore they ought not to bee ſtaied from it. That it is thus with chriſtian harlots ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares thus: becauſe if a chriſtian church be in the covenant of chriſtianity, then all the members,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12, 27.</note> and matter of it are: therefore the church of <hi>Corinth</hi> is called <hi>the body of Chriſt,</hi> in reſpect of the covenant of chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, though fearfull wickedneſſe was acted in that church about word, ſacraments, and converſation. But ſuch baſtards are ſome of the members of a chriſtian church, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought not to bee ſtaied from bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. That they are me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of a a chriſtian church, appeareth thus, Becauſe all that are

                  <note place="margin">Object.</note>Their reaſons are two. <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe all they, and onely they may be baptized, which either doe actually beleeve, or are of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving parents: but baſtards in infancy, doe not beleeve actually, nor are of beleeving parents:<note place="margin">Sol.</note> therefore they are not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizable. But I anſwer to the argument, and application of it. The argument is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:<note place="margin">Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titij.</note> for what if baſtards bee ſuch as <hi>whoſe parents are unknowne</hi>? in ſuch a caſe the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſay well, if they ſhall be borne among chriſtians,<note place="margin">Si inter Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos nati fuerint, ex Charitate habendi profilijs Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum ſi non ſit ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta cauſa contrariu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendi.</note> the law of charity is to repute the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the children of chriſtians, if there be not a juſt cauſe to preſume otherwiſe.

All they, and onely they ſhould bee bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, which either doe actually beleeve, or which are of beleeving parents, or in charity may bee preſumed ſo to bee. To the application of it to baſtards, I ſay; none will reſolutely affirme, that Chriſtian baſtards while they are infants, are neither actuall beleevers, nor of beleeving parents, nor may bee preſumed ſo to bee: will they hold, that in the act of adultery there is an utter falling from the covenant of chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. <hi>In ſenſu compoſito.</hi>
                  </note> Have they not read of taking the members of Chriſt, and making them the members of an harlot? or will they hold that the act of whoredome doth utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh baptiſmall grace in the parents? I thinke they will not; I know they cannot. No corporation doth caſt off their members from their enfranchiſements before triall,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:480:49"/>
convictions, and judgement: much leſſe will Chriſt. Yet they ſay two things in their owne defence. Firſt, that baſtards beleeve not actually. Indeede it were too lofty to ſay that they beleeve as men of yeares who are wrought upon by the word, and prayer. But were it not very harſh to ſay they are in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fidels? Are they not members of a Church in the outward covenant of chriſtianity as well as others? Have they not read of the ſeedes of faith, in ſuch? or that Chriſt ſpeaking of little ones, ſaith, <hi>they beleeve in his name?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 18.6.</note> It may be, he ſpeakes of ſuch as were admitted already into the covenant of circumciſion: but may not they judge charitably of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards, in ſuch a caſe, ſeeing ye ſee, or may ſee (in the iſſue) baſtards to live graciouſly in the boſome of the Church? If they know none ſuch, yet I doe; bleſſed be God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they ſay that the fathers and mothers of baſtards are unbeleevers: becauſe they are <hi>unjuſt,</hi> they <hi>worke from the fleſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6:9.10 Gal. 5.9.22. 1 Cor. 6. 1 Tim. 5.8</note> they are <hi>ſhut out of the Kingdome of heaven,</hi> and they <hi>provide not for their owne</hi>: and thus they reaſon. They that are unjuſt, bring forth the fruits of the fleſh, ſhut themſelves out of the kingdome of heaven, and provide not for their owne as they ought, are unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. But fathers and mothers of baſtard are ſuch: therefore they are unbeleevers. To this I anſwer two waies.</p>
               <p>Firſt in generall, by uſing their own reaſon layed otherwiſe thus. They that are unjuſt, live in the fleſh, ſhut themſelves out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:480:50"/>
&amp; proprovide not for their own are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers. But many chriſtian parents of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren lawfully begotten are ſuch: therefore they are unbeleevers I confeſſe there is ſome difference to be put here betwixt parents of lawfully begotten children, &amp; parents of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards, becauſe thoſe doe it in an act of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and goodneſſe, and that by Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance if they doe it as they ought; and theſe doe it in an act of impudence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice. But if an act of injuſtice and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſſe doth of it ſelfe, make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers, as they are ſuch, then it reacheth to the one as well as to the other. But there is no good religion bids us to thinke that an act of injuſtice in the parents ſhould put a child both into the ſtate of ſinne (<hi>in the neglect of a ſacrament,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eze. 18.</note>) and into the ſtate of puniſhment (<hi>in being deprived of it</hi>) when yet the child hath not followed, nor countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the parents wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer in particular to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and firſt to the ground of it, that ſuch wicked chriſtians are not ſo unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers as to bee quite unchriſtianed, and ſo to be deprived, in themſelves, and their ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards of the ſign and ſeale of the covenant.

               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:480:50"/>Of theſe there are to many amongſt us, and all chriſtian churches. From hence proceedes that, they not believing the word of chaſtity, are unchaſte, the word of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, are unjuſt, and the word of care for children, are careleſſe, and the like,<note place="margin">2 In whole.</note> 
                  <hi>Vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in whole,</hi> when chriſtianity is dead in them at the roote; as when the whole ſaving word is rejected. This is that unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe which doth unchriſtian a man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and if it be finall, is a ſtate of Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme. Though (it may be) there be ſuch parents in the eyes of God; (yet I thinke) few or none are ſuch among Chriſtians in the eies of the church. They will all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to believe in Chriſt, and when they are convincingly moved, will lament their ſins, and promiſe to doe ſo no more. To the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the argument to fathers and mothers of baſtards in a chriſtian church, that they are ſuch, is an unſufficient plea. And whether they bee ſo, to the cutting of them off from Chriſtianity in generall, and making their baſtards unbaptizable, judge by what is ſaid, and what followeth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they give another reaſon thus.<note place="margin">Object.</note> They that have no grace already conferred, <hi>are not to bee made partakers of the ſigne and ſeale of grace.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note> But baſtards have not grace conferred, they neither actually believing, nor being borne of chriſtian parents: and therefore they are not to bee baptized, I anſwer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> they meane not (I thinke) the in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:480:51"/>
grace of actuall faith, ſuch as <hi>Abraham</hi> had; for then, why was <hi>Iſhmael</hi> circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?</p>
               <p>But they meane the outward grace of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving right to the ſigne and ſeale of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and thus their application to baſtards is falſe: underſtand their argument thus. They that have not the outward grace of right to the ſigne and ſeale of the covenant, are not baptizable. What though <hi>Abraham</hi> had true actuall faith when hee ſubmitted to circumciſion, doth it follow that all that ſucceed him in circumciſion ſhould have ſo alſo? Prove that and turne Anabaptiſts: take away circumciſion and baptiſme from all infants. Therefore I deny the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that baſtards of wicked chriſtians have not the grace of right to baptiſme. They have a right to receive that right whereto their parents have a right to convey: and certainely theſe have a right to convey the right of baptiſme to their children; both as they are believers of the word of ſalvation by Chriſt, and as they profeſſe to ſtand in ſuch a way, though they are wicked and ungodly in particular acts.</p>
               <p>They have a right alſo to the offers of grace in a chriſtian church, and ſo have a right to baptiſme: for heerein God offereth grace by way of ſigne, and ſeale of Gods co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. To underſtand this, conceive theſe two points.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the difference of the offer of grace to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:480:51"/>
them within, and to them without the church. They without have a right to it in the word: for I may preach the word to a <hi>Iew, Turke, Heathen,</hi> if hee come within my limit,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.19.</note> and will heare. But they within have a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it in the word, and ſacraments, according to Chriſts commiſſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the priviledge they have by it, is, not to bee graffed into the body of Chriſt, according to the election of grace, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the profeſſion of the Goſpel, and the ſtate of the church viſible heere.</p>
               <p>Thus their reaſons are voide from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that baſtards are not baptizable. Now marke what reaſons they make, and finde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and what they anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſome of the baſtards predeceſſours <label type="milestone">

have beene believers, and this is ſufficient to admit them to baptiſme, according to the promiſe made to believers, and to their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.

But what anſwer they? They ſay <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Solution. </seg>1</label>
three things; firſt they ſay, it followes not: becauſe baſtards are not the generation of them that love God, and keepe his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. Take heed:<note place="margin">Cenſure.</note> was not <hi>Davids</hi> child

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Solution. </seg>2</label> parents in thoſe accurſed acts, loved him not. Secondly, they ſay, that it is one thing to ſay, that God will ſhew grace and favour to one, and another thing to ſay, that he is already in grace,<note place="margin">Cenſure.</note> as hee muſt bee that is baptized. I have anſwered before, that the baſtards of Chriſtians have <hi>the grace of right to Baptiſme,</hi> and that is ſufficient in this caſe: for otherwiſe, <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> right to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Solution. </seg>3</label> circumciſion cannot bee found. Thirdly, they ſay, that that promiſe of God in the ſecond commandement may have a double ſence, firſt, that God will extend his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to many ages on them that love him, when they are come to age, and capeable of his love by practiſe.<note place="margin">Cenſure.</note> But thus they make them that love God to bee the poſterity, when it is plaine, the promiſe was made to them that received the law then, and were to continue in the profeſſion of ſaving truth, and ſo to all others in ſuch a caſe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God will ſhew little children favour for their fathers and mothers ſake to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:480:53"/>
generations. But this they thinke, cannot bee meant, neither in deede is, as I conceive Yet then adde a third ſence, which they forget, that God will ſhew the poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that continues in the profeſſion of his name, favour; not for their parents ſake, but for his owne ſake, for his promiſe ſake,<note place="margin">Gen. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>7.</note> which he makes to them that love him, and that, <hi>for many generations</hi>; and then I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus. <hi>That which keepes the generations to come, who live as profeſſors in the viſible Church in covenant with God, that gives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of ſuch parents right to the ſeale of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, of which they are capable.</hi> But Gods promiſe to faithfull parents in the viſible Church, keepes ſuch generations to come in covenant with God: and therefore have they right to the ſcale of the covenant, whereof they are capable. Now whereas they aske, whether all children, or ſome have right? I anſwer, all, to the grace of right to Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they bring forth another ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Objection. </seg>3</label>
that if baſtards bee withheld from Baptiſme, there will be no difference put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Baſtards</hi> and their parents.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:480:54"/>
God will Iudge</hi>) yet let God have his honour in hating infidelity above whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Let not the Scripture bee wronged; but thoroughly weigh their words. They ſay firſt,<note place="margin">Cenſure.</note> that Baſtards and their parents are all infidels: what? though their parents bee Chriſtians?<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.8.</note> yes ſurely, ſay they; becauſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>they are worſe then infidels.</hi> Let them conſider, becauſe they are worſe then carefull infidels, in not caring for their children (which is againſt the fift and eight commandements) are they worſe then infidels in infidelity? They are chriſtians, yet worſe, and better, worſe in diſgracing their poſterity:<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.19, 20.</note> yet better in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving ſtill the doctrine of chriſtianity, and ſo giving a right to baptiſme. But they ſay further, that parents of baſtards are worſe in ſtate then <hi>Turkes,</hi> and they would prove it from a Text of finall Apoſtacy: but what proofe this can be againſt an act of whoredome (in the paſſion of luſt, clowding reaſon in an heate) I cannot tell? Let a <hi>Turk</hi> be a <hi>Turk,</hi> but no worſe; and let a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Harlot be an harlot, but no worſe.

               <p>Fourthly, they meete with another objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Cenſure.</note> that Baſtards are borne, &amp; the Church is their Mother; therefore baptiſme ought not to be denyed them. It ſhould have beene put thus; they are borne of Chriſtian parents, who by profeſſion are members of the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:480:54"/>
Church, and ſo the Church is their Mother,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> and the mother of their ſeede; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to bee baptized. But in their anſwer, they fall into two errors. Firſt, that the Church is a company of true beleevers who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God bath choſen to eternall life; which Church I pray? Not that whereof new borne baſtards of Chriſtian parents are by profeſſion members. The holy Catholike Church, and proper <hi>body of Chriſt,</hi> may be defined by beleevers in that ſence of it: but that the viſible Church, in the outward face of it, is thus defined, wants warrant in the word of Chriſt. Thus the Church is a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons united according to the word.<note place="margin">Act. 2. 42. 1 Cor. 1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>in the profeſsion</hi> of ſaving truth, whether they are elect, or no. Their ſecond error is, that Baſtards are infidels; for this can not bee conceived of baſtards of Chriſtian parents, as is before proved.<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Objection. </seg>5</label>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, they yet finde more arguments to oppoſe them:<note place="margin">Cenſure.</note> Baſtards may belong to Gods election, and therefore are not to be denyed Baptiſme: It ſhould have beene thus ſet: They may belong to Gods election as members of the viſible Church: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe election may belong to Jewes and Turkes, who yet are not Baptizable without perſonable profeſſion. But they anſwer thus,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> it muſt not be ſaid, they may belong,<note place="margin">Cenſure.</note> but they doe belong to Gods election: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the ſigne is not to bee adminiſtred unto them. Doe they conſider how thus they take away Baptiſme from all men,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:480:55"/>
women,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.19</note> and children? <hi>The Lord knowes who are his</hi> and the Church reaches but to the judgement of charity. A judgement of certainety, to warrant us in theſe acts is no where granted, though baptiſme bee defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the laſt gaſpe for any thing knowne to me of faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Objection. </seg>6</label> Sixtly, they further finde another argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if baſtards were denied baptiſme, this were to make the children to beare the iniquity of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.<note place="margin">Eze. 18.</note> But may they not rather thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute?<note place="margin">Cenſure.</note> The children whoſe parents have a right to baptiſme, have alſo a right to baptiſme themſelves, notwithſtanding their parents perſonal faults; for otherwiſe they ſhall be puniſhed for parents faults: But the chriſtian parents of baſtar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They have a right of poſſeſſion to the baptiſme they have: and a right of expectation to the comfort of it, upon their faith and repentance. But take their anſwer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> and they ſay foure things. Firſt, that they do not meane to deny bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, but to defer it. Indeed heere is ſome charity, but not enough, upon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer grounds, Againe they ſay, to defer baptiſme is not to puniſh them for their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſinnes; yes that it is, if it bee meerely inflicted for parents ſinnes. Though the baptiſme of children of believers is not to remunerate them for their parents righre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, but a bleſſing upon them for Gods
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:480:55"/>
promiſe ſake to believers; yet to deprive infants of it meerely for parents ſake, is a puniſhment for parents ſinnes. Thirdly they ſay, that the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks of actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſinnes of great ones, and not of little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens ſinnes: and when they have ſayd thus, they confeſſe it is not to the purpoſe heere. Yet conſider this point: Can any man be guilty of the perſonal ſinne of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with whom onely there is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuffering, and not of ſinning? God forbid, and yet ſuch is the caſe of infants from us. Laſtly they aske, what danger is it if baſtards ſhould bee unbaptized till they are of yeares? I anſwer, there are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers more then one. The danger of <hi>inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> at large, in withholding a right from them: yea, may I not call it ſacriledge?<note place="margin">Act. 8. &amp; 9</note> The danger of the <hi>neglect</hi> of this ordinance, which is the ordinary way of God for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the viſible church.<note place="margin">Mat. 28.</note> And the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>elevating</hi> baptiſme above the mind of Chriſt, who will have grace offered to all entring chriſtians in it, yea, and given by way of promiſe and covenant which ſhall not faile to the receivers.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, they yet finde another reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Objection. </seg>7</label>
them: that though the parents of baſtards have greatly ſinned, yet we ought to judge charitably of them, and of their children. I lay it downe otherwiſe, thus: They who (at leaſt) in the judgement of charity are chriſtians,<note place="margin">Cenſure.</note> ought not to have
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:480:56"/>
their children kept from baptiſme: but the parents of baſtards in a chriſtian church, are (at leaſt) in the judgement of charity chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, (for otherwiſe they were rebaptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) therefore their children ought not to be kept from baptiſme.<note place="margin">Sol.</note> Now take their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. They ſay, the judgement of charity ought alwaies to be according to truth. This is true, of truth probably preſumed. But what doe they aſſume? that whoremongers and harlots cannot bee judged ſuch while they are in their ſinnes, which make them unbelievers. But ſay, I pray: Is their ſin properly againſt faith or manners? Is the bad working, or idleneſſe of faith, in this ſinne againſt manners, of ſuch power, as utterly to roote out their <hi>doctrinall faith,</hi> which yet is ſufficient to intitle their chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren to baptiſme? If they anſwer but theſe demands well, they ſhall ſee their owne errours.</p>

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:480:62"/>
no chriſtian Magiſtrates while thoſe ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were in writing: and Chriſt knew them to be ſufficiently inſtructed in the old. This is a ſure rule, <hi>that what is warranted in the old teſtament, and not contradicted in the old or new, may</hi> (as the warrant goes, either by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for things neceſſary, or paterne for things lawfull) <hi>goe for currant ſtill.</hi> But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the new teſtament ſaith, that wee muſt pray for kings, that by their authority wee may live in <hi>godlineſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.2.</note> as by thoſe that are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us <hi>for our good,</hi> ſpirituall and temporall, ſurely,<note place="margin">3.

               <p>But (ſay they) it is for Chriſt,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> not for kings, to appoint orders about his worſhip. This is true for ſubſtantiall orders;<note place="margin">Sol.</note> for theſe thas are in the will of Chriſt may not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: but for matters of circumſtance, which concerne time, place, and outward forme, not determined, kings are bound, as ſupreame members of the church, over which they are, to uſe chriſtian conſiſtories to order them, ſo as may agree to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his church, as well as the maſter of a family may command his ſteward to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his whole family, that the private wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in his family be not diſhonoured. This ads both to the glory and ſtrength of a church: to the glory of it, when kings are nourcing fathers; and to the ſtrength of it,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:480:63"/>
when the power of a king is the churches, for the ſuppreſſing of vice, and maintenance of vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Obiect. Sol.</note>But then (ſay they) they may enjoine their owne inventions in ſtead of Gods will.

Theſe are impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: and it theſe are enjoined, chriſtians muſt patiently ſuffer, and lovingly mourne, till in the day of Judgment God fanne away the chaffe.

                  <note place="margin">Mar. 9.40</note> In theſe the chriſtian magiſtrate hath a power for order, and uniformity.

For put caſe a man had never a good finger, nor hand, never a good toe, nor foote, never a haire on head, or beard; or if he have all his members, yet he hath the palſie in one, the goute in another, blindeneſſe in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, deafeneſſe in another, botches in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, numneſſe and deadneſſe in another, is hee therefore no true man?

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If ſecondly, you aske what benefit this wicked man can have by this ſacrament? I anſwer, hee hath the benefit of profeſſion; he doth receive Chriſts liverie of ſervants,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.12 friend,</note> and doth ſubmit himſelfe to his ordinance, and acknowledge his publick authority for the benefit of his church. And this is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious benefit, in it ſelfe, for a chriſtian to weare Chriſts badge. But hee doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the benefit of the body and bloud of Chriſt, with the benefits of them to life: For if he did thus <hi>eate his fleſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 6.54.</note> 
                  <hi>and drinke his bloud, hee had eternall life.</hi> He brings his ſoule to the ſacrament without the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the covenant written upon it,<note place="margin">Ier 31. Heb. 8.</note> and ſo, though he accept of the offer of grace in the ſigne, yet hee carries not away the ſeale of it, no more then <hi>Iudas</hi> did from the paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over. His right, and benefit therefore will bring little comfort to him at the laſt, when his reckoning comes.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, this wicked man having a right to it, and a benefit too, (ſuch as it is to

him), you aske, what ſeparation Gods word will warrant from ſuch communicants?

It is true, wee reade much in the writings of men of ſuſpenſions from this ſacrament, even of thoſe, that were neither children, fooles, mad-men, demoniacks, nor excommunicate perſons by private, miniſters: but I would ſee this (for the right of it) ſoundly proved by the undoubted rule of Chriſt. I have read alſo, that the bleſſed Fathers, in the wary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline fit for their times, did not onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime before the ſacrament by their Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, <hi>depart ye that are novices, poſſeſſed, and under your penance for your crimes</hi>; but would not alſo admit any, but the believers, and the baptized, ſo much as to ſee the ſacrament. I have reade alſo of the cautelouſneſſe of thoſe holy men, in admitting penitents to the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:480:74"/>

As they firſt admitted them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the limits of the church: next to lye down as humble ſuiters, to forget ſcandall, at the church porch: next to heare, but not ſtay prayers: next to heare, and ſtay prayers too: next to ſee the ſacrament of the Lords ſupper, but not to receive it: and laſtly, when they were ſufficiently humbled, and edged to thoſe high myſteries, they were admitted to the Lords table. Theſe courſes had high and excellent uſe in thoſe times, when they were to lift up the honour of the ſacrament in the ſight of infidels, and hold cloſe ſuch chriſtians as played faſt and looſe with Chriſt, as peace, or perſecution came. And though they had not particular warrant from God, yet it being done <hi>decently, in or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der,</hi>

for every particular congregation where Chriſtians live: before this in body, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent that is obſtinate muſt bee conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, bee it leſſe or greater: and it hath a power in governement, even in theſe things of higheſt nature: therefore the power of government is in the people, as well, as deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as in others. Heere is their impregnable hold (as they thinke) and therefore they come upon us thus roundly: Chriſt hath charged his Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.20.</note> and their true ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours: <hi>that they ſhould teach all nations to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all things whatſoever hee hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them</hi>: but you that are the miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> doe not teach us to obſerve all things: for Chriſt hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a forme of governement,<note place="margin">Matth. 18.</note> wherein all members ſhould have publicke cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of offences for the advancement of the kingdome of Chriſt, and you ſuffer him to be diſhonoured, and us to bee robbed of our rights; and therfore ye are not the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt, neither is your Church a true Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus (ſo farre as I can gather from them,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> and conceive) I have given them the full advantage of their plea. But if all this were true, it doth not follow that wee are not the true miniſters of Chriſt, nor that our Church is not his true Church. Not the firſt, becauſe that expoſition of Chriſts words is their owne, and not Chriſts. If Chriſt had ſaid unto us, that hee would have
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:480:85"/>
ſuch a governement erected in every pariſh, then wee ſhould diſhonour our maſter, and rob Gods people, not to preach it.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Neither doth it follow, that our Church is not the true Church of Chriſt. What though-ſomething that Chriſt hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be obſerved be not taught, nor obſerved, doth it therefore follow that ſuch a Church is not his? What Chriſtian is there that hath all Chriſts obſervations taught in every congregation where hee comes, or, if hee have them all, doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and doe them as he ought? And yet, I hope, he may be a true Chriſtian, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the day of Chriſt.

                  <note place="margin">Sol.</note> that this is any part of the Apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip. Indeed they tell us (as before) that Chriſt ſaid, <hi>goe tell the Church,</hi>

               <p>Learned men of moſt ages have much loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon that text,<note place="margin">Matth. 18 expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded.</note> and have applied it either by way of alluſion, or properly to church

diſcipline, ſome way or other. Some chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in this laſt age have looked upon it fully, and (as they thinke) have ſquared an exact diſcipline according to it; though I cannot finde that they cut their courſe fully accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their owne ſence. Some particular perſons finding this to bee the ſtrongeſt hold for that new diſcipline, have ſought to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it ſo, as utterly to roote out excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication from the church; and others (fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the good uſe of that cenſure for the well being of the church) have beene as eagar to maintaine this hold.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 3.13.</note>Let me tell them then, that as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>Forbeare one another, and forgive one another, if any man have a quarrel, or complaint against any</hi>: ſo Chriſt in that chapter gives a remedy againſt private contentions.

other petty dues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the officers of courts to procure their fees, whereof both muſt live or ſterve, would they ever run to the dreadfull ſentence of excommunication? It proceeds not from any order or ſentence of our Biſhops, but from a meere want of other law, for which I hope they will not ſeparate from the common-wealth; get ſome law to recover their rights other wayes, and then excommunication ſhall ſhine in its glory. Yet, in the meane time, thus much (I am ſure) may be ſaid, to quiet a tender conſcience. A man askes his dues, and it is denied: ſo hee that denies it, is an <hi>unrighteous perſon.</hi> He askes it againe, and it is denied in choller: ſo, he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, is <hi>a contentious perſon</hi>; hee askes it againe, and hee is reviled: ſo hee that doth ſo is <hi>a reviler.</hi> Now, the holy Ghoſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Ro. 2.8, 9.</note> that <hi>contentious perſons ſhall have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and wrath, tribulation, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh</hi>: that <hi>unrighteous perſons,</hi>

They are not to them onely, as outward gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of worſhip, but as proper worſhip, efficacious and meritorious: their number ſtifles devotion, and fills it with ſhewes without ſubſtance.

And I am ſure the Word of Chriſt, which warranteth what is commanded, and what it goeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt is not againſt it. It is true,<note place="margin">Object.</note> it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely for many mouthes to put up a peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the King at once: It would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found him whoſe apprehenſion and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is limited.

                  </gap>d then to ſupply all defects in all, all pray with one heart, as one man, <hi>the Lords Prayer,</hi> which is the King of Prayers: and ſo riſe with ſhort and earneſt prayers, that they may praiſe God, and that God would help them; and with a profeſſion of their faith in the Trinitie, and deſire that all glory may bee given unto that bleſſed three in one. Thus, I am ſure, if wee have pious and humble ſoules, may we be prepared, for the publike worſhip of God, publikely.</p>
               <p>Now for the ſervice and worſhip it ſelfe, in this good Booke it hath three degrees, the <hi>Beginning, Middle,</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of it. In the beginning of it there is <hi>reading of Pſalmes</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> principally to raiſe up our affections, and of other <hi>Scriptures</hi> both of the Old and New Teſtament, to confirme our judgements in the truth,<note place="margin">Act. 17.</note> and to helpe us <hi>to ſearch whether things heard are ſo or no.</hi> There is confeſſion of our faith, that wee may profeſſe it as a briefe rule from Scriptures, to try whether we ſtand in the faith, whereto we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the truths of faith in the Scriptures. And we have Prayers wherein wee are not long at once, or with a breath; but have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and divided ſalutations, praiſes and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:480:127"/>
Petitions, for our ſelves: chiefe members, and the Church, that we may the better hold out unto the end without diſtractions.</p>
               <p>All this (I am ſure) none, if they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, can juſtly blame. Onely there is one thing (worth notice) which doth hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reliſh to ſome fewe, and can by no meanes be indured by the Browniſts, and that is the <hi>Litany.</hi> This ſtickes moſt, becauſe they are more carefull to make objections againſt it, then anſwers for it, that they may have comfort and peace with us. Therefore (with Chriſts helpe) I ſhall indeavour two things; to ſhew the reaſon of the name, and how they may ſatisfie themſelves againſt ſuch ſcruples as may ariſe. It is called <hi>a Litany,</hi>

               <p>There are divers exceptions againſt ours, therefore let us ſee next, how they may ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themſelvs againſt them.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee gets the Leitourgy, or common-prayer booke of the bleſſed Fathers, and adds to it of his owne rubbiſh, as Maſſes for quicke and dead, Dirges, Requiems, Praying to Saints and ANGELS, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Bells and Candles, to give power to drive away Devils. When this was eſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the breaking out of the beames of the glorious Goſpel, the bleſſed Martyres challenge their owne, and leave the wicked traſh to the founder.

Wee are not able to receive his truth and love toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither ſtands it with his diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wee being not extraordinary, but ordinary ſervants, who muſt attaine by induſtry. Hence therefore men dreaming that they have attained, when there is much behind, doe ill uſe what truth and love they have, and ſo faile foulely.</p>

They thinke that no man is more worthy to have then themſelves. Some are wicked and not worthy: ſome are good, yet themſelves are better: ſome are idle and will live upon the ſpoile: and ſome are painefull, and therefore the better able to provide for themſelves: ſtill ſelfe is thought to be the onely man to have.

               <p>Now, becauſe it is ſo difficult a work, not only to continue in good works, but in truth and love which muſt make them excellent: therefore the Apoſtle would have us ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our ſelves by the fellowſhip of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like aſſemblies that we may be able <hi>to exhort one another.</hi> Such is the inconſtancie of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in all good courſes, that it is eaſily apt
