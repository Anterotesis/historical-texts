         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Bristoll, touching his dishonourable surrender
therof to the enemy, contrary to his Trust and Duty,
by Clement Walker and William Prynne Esq.</head>
            <p>1. <hi>INprimis,</hi> That he the said Colonell <hi>Nathaniel Fiennes,</hi>
did suddenly apprehend, imprison, &amp; remove Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
<hi>Thomas Essex,</hi> late Governour of the said City and
Castle from his government there, upon pretence that hee
intended to deliver up the same (not then fully fortified, or
sufficiently provided to withstand any long siege) into the
hands of the common enemies of the Kingdome and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
contrary to the trust reposed in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that
hereupon, hee the said Col. <hi>Fiennes</hi> obtained the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the said City and Castle for himselfe, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
to defend and keep the same, to the uttermost extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
against the said enemy, for the use of the King and
Parliament, and not to surrender the said City and Castle,
or either of them to the said enemies, or to any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whatsoever, without the previous consent and order of
the Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:54640:4"/>2. <hi>Item,</hi> That the said Colonel, soone after hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Governour of the said City and Castle, did by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
law, apprehend, condemne and execute some chiefe
Citizens thereof; Namely, Master <hi>Yeomans,</hi> Master <hi>Butcher,</hi>
and others, onely for intending to deliver up the same to
Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> when he came first before <hi>Bristoll</hi> (not then
fully fortified and stored) though they did not actually sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
the same.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Item,</hi> That he the said Colonel did put the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Kingdome, Country and City, to a vast expence in
fortifying and furnishing it, and the Castle thereof with
<unclear>Forts</unclear>, Sconce, Canons, Ammunition, Arms, Victualls,
Provision of all sorts, and with Garrisons sufficiently able
to defend and maintain the same for Three moneths space
or more, against all the power of the Enemies, that might
or did come against the same; and did likewise promise
and undertake to divers Gentlemen and Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
to defend the same for so long space or more, in case
they should be besieged.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Item,</hi> That he the said Colonell, notwithstanding
the said premisses, when the enemy came before the said
City and Castle, with no extraordinary Forces or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition
able to force the same, and besieged them not
above foure dayes at the most, did before ever the enemy
had taken any of the out Forts, or Sconces about the
same; or had made so much as the least battery or assault
upon the walls of the said City or Cast<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, or any myne
or breach into any of the Forts thereof, contrary to his
former trust, promises, duty, and the honour of a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
most dishonourably, cowardly, and traiterously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
up the said City and Castle, with all the priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54640:4"/>
Canons, Ammunition, Artillery, Armes, Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Provisions, Magazines, Victualls therein, and the
very Colours too, without, and against the consent of
the Parliament, or his Excellency their Generall, into the
hands and power of Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and other common
enemies of the Kingdome and Parliament, to the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
great danger, dishonour, losse and prejudice of
the whole Kingdome and Parliament, the evill examples
of other Governours and Townes, the losse of most of
the Westerne parts of <hi>England,</hi> and great incouraging, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching,
and strengthening of the said enemies, both by
Land and Sea, and that upon very dishonourable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
to which hee was no wayes necessitated, and had
no care to see them punctually performed by the enemy,
when complaint thereof was made to him for reliefe, to
the great prejudice and impoverishing of the Inhabitants
and Garrison sou diers there.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Item,</hi> That the said Colonell, without the privity
or consent of any Councell of Warre, did of his owne
head, send out for a parley with the enemy, when the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
and souldiers advised and perswaded the contrary,
and would have repulsed the enemies, and defended the
said City and Castle to the utmost, that the surrendering
up of the same was principally occasioned by earnest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
advice, and cowardice of the said Governour,
contrary to his trust and duty to keepe the same: And that
the said Governour, when as the Councell of warre una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously
voted upon the parley, that it was neither safe,
nor honorable for them to depart the Towne, unlesse they
might march thence with halfe their Armes at least,
and with their Colours; thereupon, after some private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with Colonell <hi>Ierrard,</hi> one of the enemies Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54640:5"/>
in the Garden, without the privity, and contrary
to the Vote of the said Councell, did make &amp; insert the last
Article, that they should leave all their Canon and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,
with their Armes and colours behinde them,
and returning to them out of the Garden, told them
plainly, that they must now deliver up all to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
but what was expressed in the Articles, he then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
and leave their Armes and colours behind them,
to the said councells and fouldiers great discontent. And
whereas by those very Articles, the said Town and castle
were not to be delivered up till nine of the clocke the
next morning, nor the enemies to enter them, till the
souldiers, and other Gentlemen were marched out, the
said Governour was so over hasty to surrender up the
same, that hee delivered them up to the enemy above
one houre, or more, before the houre agreed on; and
suffered the enemies to enter and possesse them before the
souldiers were marched out, whereby many of the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
were pillaged in the castle and towne, and divers
of the Inhabitants best affected to the Parliament, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
before the houre of surrender came, to their great
losse and undoing.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Item,</hi> That he the said Colonell, during the foure
dayes siege of the said City and castle, did not give
any such incouragement to the souldiers and Officers
(who bravely defended the same, and slew neere one
thousand of the enemies best men, by his own printed
Relation, with the losse onely of eight persons) which
much discouraged them, as his duty and place requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and they expected; and that when a small number
of the enemies, not two hundred (who gave themselves
for lost,) had entred the Line of Commumication
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54640:5"/>
at the weakest place, which vvas worst guarded; On Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesday
morning the 26. of Iuly last (being bravely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed
by the Souldiers with great losse in all places else)
he the said Colonell for two houres space or more (du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which time no more Enemies entred or approached
the said Breach) both neglected and refused to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
or incourage the Officers and Souldiers, who
offered to beate them out in due time, as he was advised
and pressed to do by Captain <hi>Bagnall,</hi> Livetenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
<hi>Damson,</hi> and divers others, who would have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
that service; and instead of incountering the said
Enemies (against whom the very women offered to go on
with their children to dead the Canon, if the Souldiers
were afraid, rather then the City and Castle should be
yeelded) called off the Souldiers and Officers from the
Line and Out-workes (that the Enemies might the better
enter them without resistance) upon pain of death, much
against their wills, who should and would have hindered
and repulsed the Enemies, and discouraged and hindred
such as were forwards to have cut them off, sounding a
parly when the Enemies were so beaten that they threw
down their Armes, and ready for quarter, insomuch
that divers of the Souldiers and Inhabitants, cryed out
they were betrayed, and some of the Souldiers brake their
Armes in discontent, swearing they would serve the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
no more.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Item,</hi> That the said Governour, notwithstanding
his promises to defend the said City and Castle, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
it to the last, had yet a reall intention to deliver up
the same to the Enemy before ever they were Besieged
by them, and no thought at all to defend it to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
or till it might be relieved by his Excellency, as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54640:6"/>
appeares by the premised Articles, by the said Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
refusall to send the Prisoners formerly taken out
of the said Castle, before the Enemy approached, when
moved to it, saying to Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> and others, that
he would detain those prisoners still there, to make his
owne Conditions and Composition the better with the
Enemie, if they came before it, by his commanding Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Hassard</hi> the Master Gunner there, to lay aside a Reserve
of Thirty Barrells of Powder, with Match and Bullet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable,
to which when he was reduced, he would then
Treat with the Enemy, (which he did before he was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to this large Reserve) by other speeches to the like ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
And by his moving Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> to depart from
Bristoll, before it was besieged, who otherwise would
have adventured his life in its defence.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Item,</hi> That he the said Governour, when he sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
the said Castle to the Enemy, had at least sixty
Barrells of Powder therein (besides what was in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Forts) being ten more then were in Gloucester
when it was first besieged, Five hundred Canon shot,
fifty great Granadoes, fourteen hundred weight of Match
or more, great store of Musket Bullets, and Tin to make
more, A Match-maker, a Bullet-maker, with materialls
to make Match and Bullets, and all manner of provisions
and Victuals, sufficient to maintain one Thousand men for
three or four moneths space at least, Eleven Canons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Mounted, (besides 44. Canons mounted in the City
and Forts) All which were surrendred to the Enemy
before any Battery or assault made against the said Castle
(though he had men more then enough by his own relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to defend it) contrary to his promise made to divers
Inhabitants of the said City, best affected to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54640:6"/>
to defend the same to the uttermost, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
every foot thereof with the Enemy, and to keep it,
or to lay his bones therein; who thereupon sent in their
Estates, with provisions for them and their families, for
three moneths or more, into the said Castle, where the said
Colonell promised to secure and defend the same, most of
which their Estates, were there seized on by the Enemy
to their undoing, By reason the said Colonell admitted
the Enemies into the said Castle, and delivered up the keyes
thereof unto them, before the houre agreed on in the
Articles, such was his extraordinary haste, to quit the
same.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>Item,</hi> That the said Colonell, to aggravate this his
dishonourable action, hath presumed to justifie the same,
not onely before the Honourable House of Commons,
by word of mouth, but likewise before the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and world in Printed Relations and Letters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he hath laid an extraordinary great Blemish both upon
the Honourable Houses of Parliament, and his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Essex,</hi> their Lord Generall, by publishing
in Print, That had he Manfully held out the said City
and Castle to the last, yet he could not have expected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
relief from them in six or eight weekes space at the
least, when as Glocester since Besieged with a far greater
force then Bristoll was, yet relieved by them in lesse then
halfe the time (as Bristoll doubtlesse might and would
have beene) and held out a full mone<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hs siege or more,
as Bristoll might have done, though he the said colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
to adde to his former offence, and hinder or antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
the Relief of Glocester, that it might be lost as
Bristoll was, gave out in speeches to some Members
of the house of Commons and others, and namely to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54640:7"/>
Master <hi>Samuel Browne,</hi> and Master <hi>Iohn Sedgwick,</hi> that he
would lose his head, or be hanged, if Glocester could or
would hold out three dayes siege, if the Enemy once
came before it, or words to the like effect.</p>
            <p>10 <hi>Item,</hi> That the said city and castle were so coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and unworthily delivered up to the enemies, that they
have since published in print, and given out in speeches
that the said Colonell <hi>Fines</hi> did bestow the same upon
his Majesty, that they were delivered up to them beyond
their expectation, and that they could not have taken
the same, had it been defended by the Governour, who
eventually at least if not intentionally, did but strongly
fortifie, and plentifully store the same, with all manner of
provisions to make it Tenable, at the Kingdoms and the
Countreys extraordinary expence, to render up the same to
the Enemies with great advantage to them, and far more
prejudice and dammage to the Commonwealth, as soon
as it was made defensible.</p>

                  <p>ON Friday night late I received a Note from
your Foot-boy, without name or date, with a
datelesse, nameles Paper inclosed, pretended to be
a Proclamation of my Lo<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Generals, to appear at a
Councell of War on Thursday next (not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
what time of the day) to be held in the army,
(without mentioning in what certain place, the
army being dispersed into divers quarters remote
from Town) to justifie what I have written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the cowardly and unworthy surrendring
up of <hi>Bristoll;</hi> which generall, the consciousnesse
of your own guilt makes you (it seems) to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
wholly to your self, though not named
by me: which I shall be ready to do (since thus
unexpectedly challenged into the Lists) when I
shall be legally summoned thereunto, at a certain
competent time and place. To which end (since
your Foot-boyes namelesse, dateleffe Summons,
without any Warrant under my Lord Generalls
Hand and Seal; with the datelesse, namelesse,
placelesse; sealesse Proclamation inclosed; are but
grosse artificiall flourishes to blinde the world,
and meer Nullities in Martiall, Common, Civil,
Canon law, as all professors of them wil instruct
you; and such an <hi>individuum vagum,</hi> which makes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54640:8"/>
intelligent men conceive, that you intend onely
to abuse the world with flourishes, bravadoes, and
never to put your self upon a reall publike triall.
I and Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> to set you into a Legall reall
way of triall, have both joyned in two Petitions
to my Lord Generall and the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
to appoint a generall Councell of War,
for the hearing of this publike case in a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
time (the next Wednesday if you please) and
fitting place within Westminster or London, in
presence of the House of Commons, of which
you are a Member, to the end you may vindicate
your Honour, and make good your printed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the House, your Letter to his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and delusory rude answer to Mr. <hi>Walkers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, if able, to your just Purgation, and our
disreputation; or else give him and me leave to
disprove them, and justifie what we have severally
written (my self by no lesse authority then a
Committee of the House of Commons) to your
just dishonour, capitall censure, and maintenance
of our reputations, which you would wound, if
possible, to repair your own. Truth seeks no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
fears no colours, Trialls; neither shall I in
this common cause, wherein the Kingdom hath
suffered more damage by <hi>Bristolls</hi> surrender, then
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54640:8"/>
your life or estate are ever able to satisfie, though
you should lose both for it (as may peradventure
chance to do, if you make no better a defence of
your cause, in which you have now most unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
ingaged me past all retreats) then of this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and castle, and that by your own Martiall Law
(to omit ancient Presidents) who dispossessed
Colonell <hi>Essex</hi> of his Governorship of that place,
hanged up two Citizens there, and ransomed
others, onely for attempting to deliver up <hi>Bristoll</hi>
to the Enemy before it was fortified and furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
when you did them a far greater kindnesse, to
fortifie and furnish it with all sorts of Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Provisions, at the Parliaments and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
cost, and then most valiantly surrendred it,
with all the Canon, Ammunition, Treasure, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
Ships, Prisoners, Arms, Colours in it;
and if we beleeve <hi>Mercurius Aulicus,</hi> bestowed them
on the King, to the irrepairable losse and danger
of the whole Kingdom, before any one Sconce
taken, any one shot made against the Cities
or Castles walls, or the least assault of either
of them. And yet such hath the carriage of
this strange action hitherto been, on your
part, that
<q>Dat veniam Coruis, vexat Censura Columbas.</q>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:54640:9"/>
You censure, quarrell all other men who dare be
so valiantly honest as to dispraise this your He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicke
State-Service, which hath quite undone
them. Sir, if you be as really confident of your
owne innocency and valour, as you are quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of our pretended calumnies of them, (who
beleeve we have written far more trueth of you,
then your self hath done) I beleeve you will
cordially second our Petitions, for such a fair
publike triall as we desire, and the world expects,
after so many printed Bravadoes; otherwise the
whole Kingdom will pronounce you guilty, and
all men of Armes, of honour, proclaime you a
coward, if you flee a fair publike Triall; wherein
I shall punctually follow those Texts you point
me to, Exod. 23-1, 2, 7. (which I wish you had
made use of in this cause) and ayme not so much
at victory, or private ends, as verity and publike
good in this legall combat, in which I hope to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
my selfe a true friend to my Countrey, and
no enemy to your self, but a pious one, of your
owne seeking.</p>
