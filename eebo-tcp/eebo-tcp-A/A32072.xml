            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEREAS out of Our tender Care to Our City of London, and in hope to reduce them to their due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Us, We by Our Proclamation, hearing date at Our Court at Oxford the eight day of December now laſt paſt, did Declare Our Royall Pleaſure to be, That there ſhould be no ſtop or interruption to any of Our lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Subjects, as they ſhould travell to Our City of London with any Cloaths, Wares, or Marchandize, but that they ſhould freely and peaceably paſſe without any let, trouble or moleſtation whatſoever; Which Grace and Favour unto them, have in theſe many Moneths wrought this contrary effect, That above all other paths of this Our Kingdom A prevalent faction of that City (which over-rules the whole) hath ſo far joyned with, and in that horrid Rebellion, that it hath denounced war againſt the whole Kingdom, by violent oppoſing all the poſſible wayes to Peace; and ſo that City formerly famous for their Loyalty, and Love to their Sovereigns, is now become the head of that Traiterous faction, and the receptacle of all ſuch as are diſaffected to Our Goverment, and the Lawes of the Kingdome: and not only willingly conſents and ſubmits to all burthens and impoſitions laid upon them, for the ſupport and maintenance of the Rebellious Armies raiſed againſt Us, but malitiouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes and purſues all ſuch who are but ſuſpected to wiſh well to Our Service. And when We pitying the deſperate and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition of Our People, were gratiouſly pleaſed to deſire a Treaty for an Accommodation, and propounded that whileſt that Treaty ſhould continue, there might be a ceſſation of Armes, and a free Commerce for all Our loving Subjects in all parts of Our Kingdome, that ſo the benefits of Trade and Commerce being injoyed, Our good People might bee the more in love with Peace, yet this motion thus proceeding from Us was nevertheleſſe by ſpeciall incitation from the City of London (which by the Grace of Our ſaid Proclamation enjoyed the ſaid advantage of the whole Kingdome) ſcornfully neglected by the enemies of Peace, and all entercourſe interdicted to Our City of Oxford, the preſent place of Reſidence for Our Court and Army, and that reſtraint is continued upon all thoſe who are thought to be ſerviceable, or but well affected to Us: We therefore being thereunto enforced out of this neceſſity, and finding that the Trade and Commerce of the Kingdome, which ought to be maintained for the publicke benefit of all Our good People, is by this meanes inverted only for the advantage of thoſe Places, and Perſons which che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh this Rebellion, the Goods and Merchandiſe of ſuch who are thought well affected to Us being ſeiſed when they are brought, to London, have thought it fit and reaſonable to revoke and recall that Our former Act of Grace and Favour. And by this Our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, We doe publiſh and Declare to all Our Subjects, That whoſoever of them, either in their perſons ſhall from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth travell unto Our City of London, without Licenſe from Our Selfe, or one of Our Principall Secretaries of State, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, or Lieutenant-Generalls of Our Armies, or the Governours of any of Our Townes, Caſtles, or Forts, or with their Goods, Catle, Victuall or Merchandize of any ſort whatſoever, ſhall from henceforth travell unto, or for Our ſaid City of London or Suburbs thereof, without Our expreſſe Licence for the ſame under Our Signe Manuall, ſhall adventure the ſame at their own Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rills, We being reſolved by all poſſible means to ſeize the ſame; And that all thoſe who from any parts of this Our Kingdome ſhall furniſh or ſerve Our ſaid City of London or Suburbs thereof, either by Sea or Land, with any Victualls, or other Proviſions, or with any Merchandize to maintaine them or their Trade, as long as they ſhall obſtinately ſtand out in Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt Us, We ſhall eſteem as perſons diſaffected to Us, and to Our Government, and as Ayders &amp; Aſſiſters to the Rebells, and ſhall according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deale with them, and proceed againſt them: And that this reſtraint ſhall continue upon them untill ſuch times as the inhabitants of the ſaid City, finding their errors, ſhall returne to their due obedience unto us, ſtraitly commandaig all the Officers of Our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and all other Our Officers, Miniſters, and loving Subjects in all places through which any Perſon, Goods, Cattle, Victuall, or Merchandiſe ſhall paſſe or be conveſed towards the ſaid City of London, to apprehend the perſons, and ſeiſe and detaine the Goods, untill upon ſpeedy notice to us they ſhall receive Our further directions: We hereby aſſuring them they ſhall receive part of ſuch Goods ſo ſeiſed in ſatiſfaction and for their reward. But for the continuing of the generall Trade and Commerce of the Kingdome, and the Manufactures thereof (which We deſire to uphold and advance) We leave all Our Subjects to trade freely in, and unto all other parts, and if and unto all other Ports, or Havens of this Our Kingdome, not being in actuall Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Us; and from thoſe Ports to Trade with their Merchandiſe freely into any other Parts wherſoever beyond the Seas, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in amity with Us, without any reſtraint whatſoever.</p>
