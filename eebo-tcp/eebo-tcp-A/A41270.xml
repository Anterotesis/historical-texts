            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SUffer me to Expoſtulate with you, on behalf of thoſe abuſed People in your Counties, that have of late been render'd Blaſphemers, and to Apologize a little for them; whom <hi>ſome</hi> among you have lately often <hi>Aſſembled</hi> and <hi>Conſulted</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how they might (by <hi>Subtilty</hi> and <hi>Miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation)</hi> Incenſe you (and by you, thoſe in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) againſt this Innocent People, and your peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Country-Men and Neighbours, that the Monſter of Perſecution might be again raiſed and let looſe on them to ſuppreſs them.</p>
            <p>But conſider, are there not many things in your <hi>Counties, Towns</hi> and <hi>City,</hi> more needful to be ſuppreſſed than theſe Induſtrious and Well-meaning People, <hi>viz.</hi> reigning Evils, yea, groſs Vices, and abominable Oaths and Execrations, to the Blaſpheming the Name of God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; Swearing by his Blood, and calling upon God to Damn their Souls; againſt which crying Sins many wholſome Laws are made:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96758:3"/>
Is there not more need that theſe Oaths, and all ungodly Plays, and Bear-baitings, and Bull-baitings, and things that tends to corrupt the Youth, defile the People, and to provoke God, ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and Application made to the Parliament, and Endeavours uſed, that they ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, rather than your Neighbours, thoſe ſober and honeſt People among you, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> whom you know are not ſuch, but thoſe that fear God, love their Neighbour, and do good to all, and pray for their Enemies; and only for their Religious Diſſent from the Eſtabliſhed Religion in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and matter relating to the Worſhip of their God, have been great Sufferers in this Land, and among you, eſpecially in the City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> in whoſe Goals and Dungeons they have lain like Men buried Alive, to the imparing their Healths, and weakning them in Body and Eſtate, and to the Endangering their Lives, and making their Wives <hi>Widows,</hi> and their Children <hi>Fatherleſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the Lord, by his Divine and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Providence, Glorious and Eternal Power, in tender Mercy and Compaſſion to his Suffering and Afflicted People, hath inclined the Heart of the King, and thoſe in Authority, to Indulge them in the free Exerciſe of their tender Conſciences, in their Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Religious Aſſemblies; for which they are truly Thankful unto God, and thoſe in Authority.</p>
            <p>And whatever evil things have or may be ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted againſt them, by Men of corrupt Minds, and evil Deſigns, who are of <hi>Cain</hi>'s Nature, in <hi>Hammon</hi>'s Pride, of <hi>Iſhmael</hi>'s and <hi>Judah</hi>'s Spirit, and of that Seed of Evil-Doers that ſhall never be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned; and that do not conſider what the Lord

            <p>But theſe People, for whom I Apologize and Appeal to you, however they are or may be Rendered and Repreſented by Men of Evil Deſigns and Perſecuting Spirits, Have, Do, and and by the Lord's Aſſiſtance, are Reſolved to continue Quiet in the Land, and in their Chriſtian Duty and Practice, of <hi>making Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>

            <p>Notwithſtanding ſome called <hi>Clergy-Men</hi> in your Counties have (as the <hi>Chief Prieſts, Scribes and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> in days paſt did our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt) accounted his Followers, your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours called <hi>Quakers,</hi> to be Blaſphemers and Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and have made them the Objects of their Wrath, and what they cannot do, would incite you, and ſtir up others too, and as <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:96758:4"/>
But rather <hi>obſerve</hi> the Converſation, and <hi>Examine</hi> the Doctrines of thoſe your Neighbours, called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> againſt whom this great <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Combination</hi> is; and take not things upon <hi>Truſt</hi> nor <hi>Report:</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Excellent Advice of Wiſdom, follow her Direction, take her Councel, for ſhe is worthy, who ſaid, <hi>Blame not before thou haſt examined the Matter, firſt underſtand, and then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inſpect their Converſations, and ſee if you can find that they are ſuch, that either Curſe, Swear, Revile, Blaſpheme or ſpeak Evil of <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or if any of them Contemn <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> as they are falſly charged: It's hoped their Patient Suffering and Peaceable Deportment, under all the various Revolutions of Government, will ſufficiently Evince the contrary; and their Paſſive and Patient Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein for Conſcience ſake they could not Actively obey, may well demonſtrate their Regard to <hi>Magiſtracy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And altho' in ſome things they have ſeemed to differ from thoſe of other Perſwaſions, yet who can Convict them of Error in any <hi>Fundamental Doctrine</hi> of the Chriſtian Religion; or of their not holding that which is truly <hi>Eſſential</hi> to Salvation, and agreeable to the holy Scriptures? Which holy Records (how ever they have been Miſrepreſented, or falſly Accuſed, as Slighters and Contemners of them) I do declare on their behalf, they have always had, and ſtill have, a high Eſteem of, and true Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue for them, above all other Writings, or Books; and their frequent uſe of them, and preſſing their Children and Servants to the reading therein, may ſufficiently Demonſtrate to thoſe that know them, the Innocency of this abuſed People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:96758:5"/>
Be you therefore like the Noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> ſearch the holy Scriptures, and you may ſee their Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Doctrines are not contrary thereto, but may be plainly proved thereby: For they deſire not any farther to be Credited, or to have what they Write or Preach received by any, but as its conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant thereto, and anſwers that Holy Principle, and Divine Oracle, that the Great and All-wiſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all things, hath placed in every Man's Heart and Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Suſpend therefore your Cenſure, and forbear your Complaints, till the Contrary of theſe things are cleared to you, by ſound Reaſon, and plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, without any corrupt Meanings, falſe Gloſſes, or Interpretations.</p>
            <p>And if they were a People miſtaken in any Point, or were Clouded in their Underſtandings; would it not (I beſeech you conſider) much more become thoſe that eſteem themſelves Learned Miniſters of the Goſpel, in Meekneſs to <hi>Inſtruct,</hi> and by ſound Doctrine to <hi>Convince</hi> them; rather than to call them, and Charge every one of them to be <hi>Blaſphemers,</hi> and make no Proof thereof.</p>
            <p>It's true the <hi>Quakers</hi> complied to meet them at <hi>Weſt-Dereham,</hi> the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> 1698. altho' there was not a Mutual Conſent, of the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, in the Letters that paſſed between them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Conference, as thoſe that peruſe the Letters may find, yet ſo Eager were theſe Men, and Reſolute, that in their laſt Letter to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> they tell them, <hi>Their Meaſures are Fixt, and they may chuſe whether they will Meet them, upon the Terms reſolved upon or No:</hi> Yet the <hi>Quakers</hi> went, and in the preſence of the People, requeſted to have the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Names, Titles of Books, and Pages, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96758:5"/>
to prove their Charges out of; but inſtead of that, were <hi>Hallowed</hi> and <hi>Hiſſed</hi> at by ſome of thoſe <hi>Clergy-Men,</hi> as ſuch of you, as were preſent, may well Remember.</p>
            <p>And if theſe People muſt be accounted <hi>Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> if they diſown not thoſe Books, or their Friends that Writ them, without ſeeing the Books, or what's in them; how can they be either juſt to their Friends, or true to themſelves; for ought any Man to condemn another, without full Hearing and due Examination, or would thoſe <hi>Clergy-Men</hi> account it juſt, that any ſhould charge them as the higheſt of Criminals, and Condemn and Sentence them as ſuch, for what ſome of their Brethren have Writ in Books, which they never ſaw nor read, nor knew the Contents of; or would they be ſo unjuſt to themſelves, and falſe to their Brethren, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them Guilty in ſuch ſort, and condemn them for Writing that they themſelves neither knew or never ſaw: If not, Why ſhould the <hi>Quakers,</hi> without ſeeing the Books and examining the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, be obliged to condemn their Friends for Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers of <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> or be eſteemed <hi>Blaſphemers.</hi>

            <p>Conſider this I beſeech you, and examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it agrees with Chriſt's Doctrine, <hi>All things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye would that Men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets:</hi> Or whether there is any ground to conclude, that the Chargers would ever have refuſed to have given the Account deſired by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> if they had been well aſſured, that by the Expreſs words of theſe Books, out of which they pretend to prove their Charge, it would be clearly and evidently proved.</p>
            <p>Let theſe things be duely conſidered, Oh ye In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Counties aforeſaid, or to whom this
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96758:6"/>
may come, and let Chriſtian Moderation be exerciſed towards your Peaceable Neighbours and Country-Men.</p>
            <p>Remember the <hi>Anthem</hi> the Angels ſounded when they publiſhed the Goſpel, was, <hi>Glory to God on High, on Earth Peace, and Good Will to Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we all endeavour to be found in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of this, it will render us more like to him that we all Profeſs, who ſaid, <hi>By this ſhall all Men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have love one to another:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 13. 35.</note> It's thoſe that dwell therein that wear his Badge. <hi>For whoſo hateth his Brother, is a Murtherer; and ye know that no Murtherer, hath Eternal Life abiding in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 John 3. 15.</note> 
               <hi>him, for Envy ſlayeth the ſilly One,</hi> and Hatred is the Badge of a Perſecutor, and renders People too like <note place="margin">Job 5. 2.</note> him, that firſt Envied and was Wrathful, and then Murthered his Brother, becauſe the Lord had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his Sacrifice: Yet the Lord ſaid to <hi>Cain, If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? And if thou</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 7.</note> 
               <hi>doſt not well, Sin lies at the Door.</hi> And while Sin lies there, it's a Bar to keep Man from Acceptance with God, altho' he may Sacrifice and Offer, he'll fall ſhort of his Duty whilſt that's loved and lived in. But he that Envies not, but Loves his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 38. 39. Lev. 19. 18. Rom. 13. 9. Gal. 5. 14. James 2. 8.</note> as himſelf, keeps the great Commandment of him that in all things we ought to hear; and it's thoſe that abide in his Love that knows of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>Therefore, Oh ye Inhabitants aforeſaid, and all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of what Degree, Rank or Quality foever, let a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Conſideration, which is an <hi>Effect</hi> of true Wiſdom, and a due <hi>Examination,</hi> which all Wiſe Men ought to uſe, be had and made by you, before you Exclaim againſt a People ye know no Evil by; be not hurried into a Miſapprehenſion of this Peoples Doctrines by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96758:6"/>
Men filled with prejudice, and whoſe Intereſt prompts them in General to Lurk, in which lies Deceit, and therein under pretence of Miſchief, Threatning Danger, Venemous Doctrines, Blaſphemous Books, and Pernicious Principles, tending to ſubvert the Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, do but endeavour to draw you into the like Enmity with them: Let your Experience now, which you have had of this People, under the various Revolutions of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Nation, for above Forty Years, ſpeak for them, whether they have not been of thoſe that are quiet in the Land; but theſe things which are falſe and ſlanderous Stories ſuggeſted without Ground or Proof, are like <hi>Demetrius</hi>'s Exclamations againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Moreover ye See and Hear that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 19.</note> 
               <hi>not alone at</hi> Epheſus, <hi>but almoſt throughout all</hi> Aſia, <hi>this</hi> Paul <hi>hath perſuaded and turned away much People:</hi> But <hi>Demetrius</hi> was ſo Ingenuous then, as to confeſs it was <hi>That Craft</hi> by which he and his Brethren got their <hi>Wealth,</hi> that was in <hi>Danger,</hi> and plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated that was the Cauſe of his Wrath; <hi>And when they heard thoſe things they were full of Wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Remember the Town-Clerks Advice, when this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>proar</hi> was, he ſaid, <hi>Ye ought to be Quiet, and to do nothing Raſhly, for theſe Men are neither Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Churches, nor Blaſphemers of your Goddeſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore if <hi>Demetrius,</hi> &amp;c. hath matter againſt any Man, the <hi>Law</hi> is open.</p>
            <p>And Oh my Friends! to you I appeal, whether ever ye knew, or did obſerve, the <hi>Demetrius</hi>'s of our Age preſent any Man, or proſecute him at Law, or Incenſe or Stir up the Magiſtrates, and endeavour by Petition to Incenſe the Government againſt him, whilſt he lived in Pride, Gluttony, Drunkenneſs or any Exceſs of Riot. But this hath often been ſeen,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96758:7"/>
that when thoſe, or any have turned from their Evil Ways, become Conſcientious, and could not pay their Tithes, or comply with ſome other things that are acknowledged but Outward and Viſible Signs, of an Inward and Spiritual Grace. Then, Oh then! how have theſe been proſecuted, if but for a few Farthings, a few Pence and Shillings; the Juſtices and Officers troubled, the Courts and Lawyers imployed, and Mony ſpent, Revenge vented, and Havock and Spoil made, Two, Three or Four times more taken then demanded: And yet theſe Suffering People are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed againſt as Men of Pernicious Principles, the great Growth and daily Increaſe of whom, threatens the Nation with Miſchiefs and Dangers.</p>
            <p>And although the Law is open to Puniſh <hi>Romiſh Emiſſaries;</hi> yet theſe Petitioners cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to take that way, but would falſly inſinuate, there were ſuch among the Teachers of the ſaid People.</p>
            <p>And yet are not many of theſe <hi>Clergy-Men</hi> in Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Practices, <hi>viz.</hi> Bowing to the Alter, and to the Eaſt, and having God-fathers and God-mothers, as they call them, and Signing Children with the Sign of the Croſs, and their Surplace, and their Abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in which the Miniſter is to ſay, I abſolve thee from all thy Sins; are not theſe things Romiſh, ſee the <hi>Maſs Book?</hi> And alſo their Proſecuting for Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaries and Smoak-Penny, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Therefore, while ye have Time, prize your Time, and the Day of your tender Viſitation, which God, through Chriſt, is affording to you, that the things that belong to your Peace you may come to know, before they are hid from your Eyes; theſe things will be of profit to you, and your ſo doing will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak you Chriſtians indeed; for if you bear that Name, and are not guided and led by Chriſt's Spirit, <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 9. 14.</note> you will be found none of his, nor Sons of God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs what you will, if you remain <hi>Workers of Iniquity</hi> Chriſt <hi>will profeſs, he knows ye not, and will bid you depart from him</hi> into Everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 23.
