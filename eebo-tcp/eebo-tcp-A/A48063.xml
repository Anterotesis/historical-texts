            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>A</hi> LETTER <hi>from</hi> JAMAICA, <hi>to a Friend in</hi> LONDON, <hi>concerning</hi> Kid-Napping.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOURS found me a little Indiſpos'd; but yet I made the beſt Enquiry my Health and Opportunity would give me leave to Anſwer your Deſires. The Relation you have ſent me of the great Abuſes in the Spiriting away of Children, makes a very ſad Story; and muſt needs be a Lamentable Grief to their Parents that have loſt them. You ſhould have done well to have ſent me the Names of thoſe that are miſſing; or if you think fit to have me look any further into this buſineſs, pray let me receive your further Directions at your beſt leiſure. We are not without Apprehenſions here in this Place for the Diviſions in <hi>England;</hi> I wiſh we may yet live to meet again in Comfort and Peace.</p>
            <p>The Paper which I ſend you here encloſed, is all I was able to do in ſo ſhort a time; but upon the Truth of it you may depend. I do not know but you may find in this Liſt ſome unhappy People that you look for; and it would be well if you made a Publication of it in one of the comon <hi>News Papers:</hi> Mr. <hi>Janeway,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Curtis,</hi> I make no doubt will do it for you, and it may be ſo Notified, as that any of thoſe good People that have loſt their Children, may underſtand whither to Repair for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
            <p>If you know no better a way, you might do well to apply your ſelf to Mr. <hi>JOHN WILMORE</hi> in <hi>Jewen-ſtreet,</hi> who is a Planter himſelf, and knows all the Tricks of thoſe Raſcals. Beſides that, he is a Man of Buſineſs in the City, a large Acquaintance, a <hi>True Proteſtant,</hi> and (if I am not miſtaken) a <hi>Common-Council-Man.</hi> He is very Induſtrious and Charitable beſide; and if there ſhould be occaſion, he is as likely to aſſiſt you as any Man I know: thô it were to go as far as the <hi>Hope</hi> upon the Errand, to ſave a Poor Child from <hi>Want,</hi> and <hi>Slavery.</hi> I need ſay no more to you, than that if you have his Friendſhip, he can tell you all the ways of the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan:</hi> how they take up Children, Inviegle them away, and the conveieances they have for the concealing of them. Theſe <hi>Kid-Nappers</hi> will tell you perhaps that a Child was ready to be eaten up with Vermin, and they took him in Compaſſion; that they could not get quit of him, or perſuade him to come back it may be, thô he were ready to leap into the Sea: wherefore you muſt get a diſcreet Juſtice to examine the mater; ſo the reſt I leave to your diſcretion.</p>
            <p>Little <hi>Will</hi> takes to his buſineſs very well; and I hope his Friends will have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of him. Pray Commend me to all my good Friends and Acquaintance in your Neighbourhood, and pardon all Faults; for I muſt immediately take my leave of you, and Subſcribe my ſelf your Affectionate Kinſman and Servant,</p>
