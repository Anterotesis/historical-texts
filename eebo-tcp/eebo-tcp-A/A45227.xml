            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>TO the honour of almighty God, and of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, both for the trying out of truth, and the profit of holy mother the Church, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of our University of <hi>Prage,</hi> which, avoiding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to do that which shall be prejudicial to the truth, hath deferred to give their consent unto the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the forty five Articles, wishing even unto this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent sufficient probation to be given of the condemnation of the said Articles, and particularly of every one of them. Whereupon the said University doth alwaies require due proof of the same, forsomuch as Pope <hi>Damasus</hi> in his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non distinction sixtie eight chapter, Chorepiscopi, saith thus; That it is necessarie that whatsoever thing standeth not by due reason should be rooted out. Whereby it appeareth, that the condemnation of the five and forty Articles, if it stand not with proof and sufficient demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration for every Article, is necessary to be rooted out.</p>
               <p>But if any man will object and say, that to require a reason of every thing, is to derogate from Gods divine power. Unto this answer Master <hi>William</hi> doth answer himself in his Philosophy, the first book, almost at the end; where he intreating of the place, in the second Chapter of <hi>Genesis, God made man of the slime of the earth, &amp;c.</hi> hath these words; For in what point (say we) are we contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the holy Scriptures, if we seek by reason to declare wherefore any thing is done, which is said in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be done? For if that a wise man should say that a thing is done, and do not declare how it is done, and another man speaketh the very self-same thing, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96364:7"/>
how it is done, what contrariety is there? But for so much as they themselves know not the force of nature, to the intent that they might have all men partakers with them of their ignorance, they would have no man to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it out. But they would have us beleeve as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people, neither to seek any reason of our beleef, that the prophecie might be fulfilled; <hi>Such as the people is, such shall be the priest.</hi> But we truly do say, that in all things a reason is to be sought,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An allegory upon the Paschal lamb.</hi>
                  </note> if it may by any means be found. But if that any man do stay at any thing which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doth affirm, let him commit the same unto Faith, and unto the Holy Ghost. For <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>If the lamb cannot be eaten, let it not be by and by consumed in the fire; but let him first call his neighbour which dwelleth next house unto him; and if they also be not sufficient to eat the lamb, then let it be turned in the fire.</hi> So likewise, when as we goe about to seek any thing as touching the Godhead, and that we be not able of our selves to comprehend the same, let us call our neighbour which dwelleth next house unto us; that is to say, let us seek out such a one as dwelleth in the same Catholick faith with us; and if then neither we, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet he be able to comprehend the same, let it then be burned with the fire of faith.</p>
               <p>But these men, albeit they have many neighbours dwelling near unto them, yet for very pride they will not call any man unto them, chusing rather to continue still ignorant, then to ask any question. And if they do know any man to enquire for his neighbour in such case, by and by they cry out upon him as an heretick; presuming more upon their own heads, than having confidence in their wisdom. But I exhort you to give no credit unto their outward appearance, for already it is verefied in them, which the Satyrical Poet saith; No credit is to be given unto the outward shew: for which of them all is it that doth not abound with most shamefull and detestable vices? And in another place he saith; They are very dainty of their speech, and have great desire to keep si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. And thus much hath Mr. <hi>Wilhelmus.</hi> Let all such


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96364:7"/>
hear whom this parable doth touch: for I with the rest of the Masters, Bachelors and Students of our University, considering how hard a matter the condemnation of the forty five Articles of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> without reason, is, and how grievous a thing it were if we should thereunto consent, doe call together my neighbours, the Doctors of this Universitie, and all others which would object any thing against the same, that we might presently finde out the reason of the condemnation of this article, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the taking away the temporalties from the Clergie.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding I doe professe that it is not my intent,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A Protestation, whereby he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth light unto the Reader, how the proposition aforesaid is to be understood, and addeth, that the goods of the clergy are not utterly to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away but in case they doe abuse the same.</hi>
                  </note> like as it is not the meaning of the Universitie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade, that Princes or secular Lords should take away the goods from the clergie when they would, or how they would and convert them to what use they list. But our whole intent is, diligently to search out whether this Article, as touching the taking away of temporalties from the Clergie, may have in it any true sense, whereby it may be defended without reproof. Wherefore this Article, being the seventeenth in the number of the forty five is, propounded under this form: The Lords temporal may at their own will and pleasure, take away the temporal goods from the Clergie, if they doe offend, and therein continue. It is thus proved: The Kings of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament took away the temporal goods at Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement from the Clergie; that is to say, from the Priests offending. Therefore the Kings of the New Testament, at Gods commandment, may do the like, when as the Priests of the new law do offend. The consequence dependeth upon a similitude. And the antecedent is evident. First, it is proved by <hi>Solomon</hi> in the 3. of the <hi>Kings,</hi> 2. chapter, which <hi>Solomon</hi> deposed <hi>Abiathar</hi> the high Priest, because he had taken part with <hi>Adonias</hi> the brother of <hi>Solomon</hi> to make him King, without the advice either of <hi>David,</hi> or of <hi>Solomon</hi> himself, which ought to reign, and set up <hi>Sadoc</hi> the Priest in the place of <hi>Abiathar,</hi> because he had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented with <hi>Abiathar</hi> unto <hi>Adonias,</hi> as it is written in the 3. book of <hi>Kings,</hi> 1. chapter, where it is said, <hi>Adonias,</hi> the

               <p>This was the cause of the deposing of <hi>Abiathar,</hi> because he took part with <hi>Adonias,</hi> that he should be King against <hi>Solomon</hi> the eldest Son of King <hi>David</hi>: wherefore it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the third book, and second chapter of the Kings; The King said unto <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Priest, <hi>Goe your wayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Anathoth <hi>thine own field, for thou art a man of death; but this day I will not slay thee, because thou hast carried the Ark of the Lord before my father</hi> David, <hi>and didst labour in all things wherein my father laboured.

               </p>
               <p>Behold, the most prudent King <hi>Solomon,</hi> according to the wisdom which was given him of God, did exercise his power upon the said Priest, putting him out of his priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and setting in his place <hi>Sadoc</hi> the Priest. This was a greater matter than to take away the temporalties. If then in the Law of Christ, which now raigneth over us, a Bishop should likewise rebell against the true heir of the kingdom, willing to set up another for King; why should not the King or his heir have power, in like case, to take away the temporalties from him so offending?</p>

to be intercessor for the sins of the people, if the Priest which ought to intreat for the same, have committed greater offences) and under your dominions the Priest do live wickedly and unchastly; therefore that the offence of a few might not turn to the destruction of many, we ought earnestly to seek the punishment of the same. And it followeth, if we do command any person, we do send him forth, with the consent of your authority, who to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with other Priests, shall diligently seek out, and according unto Gods word correct and amend the same.

against the outward enemies; even so likewise ought they to be against the inward enemies of the soul. And like as in just war against the outward enemies it is lawfull to take away their goods, so long as they continue in their malice; so also is it lawfull to take away the goods of the Clergy, being the inward enemy. The consequence is proved thus; for so much as the domestical enemies are most hurtfull.</p>
               <p>Item, it is thus argued; if God be, the temporal Lords <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> may meritoriously and lawfully take away the temporal goods from the Clergy, if they do offend. For this point let us suppose that we speak of power, as the true authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike Scripture doth speak, Mat 3. 9. <hi>God is able even of these stones to raise up Children unto Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon it is thus argued; for if God be, he is om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, and if he so be, he may give like power unto the secular Lords. And so consequently they may meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and lawfully use the same power. But lest that any man may object, that a proof made by a strange thing is not sufficient; it is therefore declared how that the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Lords have power to take away their almes bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Church, the Church abusing the same, as it shall be proved hereafter. And first thus; It is lawfull for Kings, in cases limited by the Law, to take away the movables from the Clergy when they do offend: it is thus proved; For the temporal Lords are most bound unto the works of greatest mercy most easie for them: but in case possible, it should be greater almes, and easier tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral dominion, to take away their almes from such as build therewithall unto eternal damnation, through the abuse thereof, than to give the said almes for any bodily relief, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the assumption is true.</p>
               <p>Whereupon first this sentence of the Law of Christ in the second Epistle to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> the third Chapter is noted, whereas the Apostle writeth thus; <hi>When we were amongst you, we declared this unto you, that he that would not work should not eat.</hi> Wherefore the law of nature doth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense all such as have the governance of Kingdoms, to

                  </note>Hereby it appeareth, that the condition annexed to the endowing, or enriching of any Church; is, that God should be honored: the which condition if it once fail, the contrary taking place, the title of the gift is lost, and consequently the Lord which gave the almes ought to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the offence. Excommunication ought not to let the fulfilling of justice. Secondly, according to the Canon Law, 16 question 7. this sentence is noted, where it is thus spoken, as touching the Children, Nephews, and the most honest of the kindred of him which hath builded or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed the Church: <hi>That it is lawfull for them to be thus cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect, that if they perceive the Priest do defraud any part of that which is bestowed, they should either gently admonish or warn him, or else complain of him to the Bishop, that he may be correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But if the Bishop himself attempt to do the like, let them complain of him to his Metropolitane: and if the Metropolitane do the like, let them not defer the time to report it in the ears of the King.</hi> For so saith the Canon, <hi>Let them not defer to report it in the ears of the King.</hi> To what end I pray you, but that he should do correction: neither is it to be doubted, but that correction doth more appertain unto the King in this point for their goods, whereof he is chief Lord, by a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction proportional according to the fault or offence.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> Item, is thus proved; It is lawfull for the secular Lords by their power to do correction upon the Clergy by some kind of fearfull discipline appertaining to their secular power:<note place="margin">It is lawfull for the civil rulers to correct the Clergy.</note>

pertaining unto their secular power. For so much then as the taking of their temporalities is a kind of fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full discipline pertaining unto the secular power; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that it is lawfull for them thereby to do such cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. And consequently it followeth that the truth is thus to be proved. The consequence is evident; and the antecedent is proved by <hi>Isidore</hi> 23. <hi>quest.</hi> 5. <hi>Principes,</hi> where it is thus written; <hi>There should be no secular powers within the Church, but only for this purpose, that whatsoever thing the Priests or Ministers cannot bring to passe by preachings or teachings, the secular powers may command the same by the terrour and fear of discipline. For oftentimes the heavenly Kingdom is profited and bolden by the earthly Kingdom: that they which are in the Church, and do any thing contrary unto faith and discipline, by the rigour of the Princes may be troden down, and that the power of the rulers may lay that discipline upon the necks of the proud and stif-necked, which the utility and profit of the Church cannot exercise or use.</hi>

               <p>Item, all things that by power ought to work or bring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> to any perfect end by the reasonable measuring of the mean thereto, may lawfully use by power the substraction or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of the excesse, and the addition of the want of the means, according as shall be convenient or meet for the measure to be made. For so much then as the secular Lords ought by their power to provide for the necessary sustentation of the Christian Clergy, by the reasonable measuring of their temporalities, which they are bound to bestow upon the Christian Clergy, it followeth that they may lawfully by their power use the taking away or putting unto of those temporalities according as shall be convenient for the performance of that reasonable matter.</p>
               <p>Item, it is lawfull for the Clergy, by their power to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> take away the Sacraments of the Church from the laity customably offending, for so much as it doth pertain to the office of the Christian Ministers by their power to minister the same unto the Lay people.

inflamed, and therefrom proceedeth all kind of gluttony and leachery. It is evident in this point, for so much as the temporalities being once taken away, every one of those sins is either utterly taken away, or at the least dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, by the contrary vertue induced and brought in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon, if Priests do not minister of their temporali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as <hi>Hostiensis</hi> teacheth in his 3d. book of their Tither, First-fruits and Oblations, the people ought to take away the almes of their Tithes from them.</p>
               <p>Item, it is confirmed by the last chapter of the sevententh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> question, out of the decree of rents appropriate unto the Church, <hi>Quicunque.</hi> Whereas the case is put thus, <hi>That a certain man having no children, neither hoping to have any, gave all his goods unto the Church, reserving unto himself the only use and profits thereof: it happened afterward that he had children, and the Bishop restored again his goods unto him not hoping for it.</hi> The Bishop had it in his power, whether to render again, or no, those things which were given him; but that was by the law of Man, and not by the law of Conscience. If then by the decree of the holy Doctor St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> in his Sermon of the life of the Clergy, <hi>Aurelius</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Carthage</hi> had no power by Gods law to withhold that which is bestowed upon the Church for the necessity of children; by the which law, the wanton, proud, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable Clergy, being more then sufficiently possessed and enriched, do detain and keep back the temporalities to the detriment and hurt of their own state, and of the whole militant Church, the secular patrons being thereby so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverished,


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96364:15"/>
that they are compelled by penury to rob and steal, to oppresse their tenants, to spoil and undo others, and oftentimes by very necessity are driven to beggery.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> Item, suppose that a Priest and Minister, how grievously soever he do offend, by what kind or sign of offence soever it be, as it was in the case of Bishop <hi>Iudas Iscarioth:</hi> of the religious Monk <hi>Sergius,</hi> of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the heretick, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Priests, of whom the Scripture and Chronicles make mention, and daily experience doth teach us the same: it is evident that, as it is supposed, the Priests in the Kingdom of <hi>Boheme</hi> grievously offending,, it is the Kings, part, for so much as he is supreme head next under God, and Lord of the Kingdom of <hi>Boheme,</hi> to correct and punish those Priests. And for so much as the gentlest correction and punishment of such as be indurate in their malice, is, the taking away of their temporal goods, it followeth, that it is lawfull for the King to take away temporalities. Wherefore it should seem very marvellous and strange, if that Priests riding about should spoil Virgins, violently corrupt and defile honest Matrons; if in such case it were not lawfull for them to take away their Armours, Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, Horses, Guns and Swords from them. The like reason were it also, if they had unlawfully conspired the death of the King, or that they would betray the King un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his enemies.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> Item, whatsoever any of the Clergy doth require or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of the secular power, according unto the Law and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Christ, the secular power ought to perform and grant the same. But the Clergy being letted by riches, ought to require help of the secular power for the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the said riches. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the secular power ought in such case, by the law of Christ, to take upon them the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or duty of getting, keeping, and distributing all such manner of riches. The minor is hereby proved, that no man ought to have riches, but to that end, that they be helps, preferring and helping unto the office which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God. Therefore in case that secular possessions


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96364:15"/>
do hinder the Clergy from their duty, the secular power ought to take it away, for so did the Apostles, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. saying, <hi>It is not lawfull for us to leave the Word of God untaught, and to minister unto tables.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is confirmed, Every good Christian is bound to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> helpfull to his neighbour in those things, especially which do concern the publick good: But it will be a great help to a Clergy man to be deprived of his temporal possessions, it being granted, they do <note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 9 10. <hi>Phil</hi> 3 <hi>Id.</hi> 19. 20. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the case so may be that the chiefest help they can afford them, is to deprive them of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral goods, therefore in such a case they ought to do it.

This Case will not be denyed by any faithfull Christian, not over-blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the dross of Temporal things. For as St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> saith, <hi>It is expedient for many to fall into manifest sins, that knowing their own frailty they may live more humbly, and by grieving for their sins, they may be more cautious how they sin again.</hi>

                     <hi>A Sin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, doth render us more carefull.</hi>
                  </note> It is therefore much more expedient that many be poor, and to be without the civil Dominion. The Case admitted, it is manifest, that the King doth a good work in the General; now every such work may be well done; therefore he may well take away the Goods from an Ecclesiastical person: for if the greater part of evil works may in the generality of them be well done, much more may every good work in the generality of it; For it is not repugnant to Grace or Almes that this good work pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from it: neither is it to be doubted, but that God in such a Case doth give a power to the King, which he eternally ordaineth to the performance of his pleasure. It being granted then that the King, and the said Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick may reign together in Heaven, there would be both notice and joy for the taking away of such a Temporal estate, although by our Childish blindness it appeareth to men of a grosse understanding to be disadvantageous.</p>
               <p>Again, if this be an error, that Temporal Lords may at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> their pleasure take away temporal things from Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal persons, being habitually Delinquent; then it is false also against the true way of the Church, and so Heresie, because that All truth is in the holy Scripture, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> often affirmeth; and by consequent, since this


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96364:17"/>
way should be a falshood, it followeth that it would be contrary to the holy Scripture. And certain it is, that it is pertinaciously and strongly defended, because Kings and Princes believe that it pertaineth to their Soveraignty to have this powers; for grant the contrary, it will follow, that Ecclesiastical persons, seeing they are great Trangres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, may destroy both Kingdoms and their People, to prevent which it may be lawfull for the King to resist the Clergy, or to impugn his Charity, by the ablation of his proper Almes, and those Temporal goods, which are the Fire exciting hereunto. Now the King could not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully punish the bodies of such Traytors, if he could not lawfully take from them, and alienate their Temporal estates, over which he hath a special Dominion. And since this power is the chiefest Royalty of the King, it would be the same thing to infringe this power, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly to overthrow the Government of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> Again, seeing many Kings, and Nobles being Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks <hi>have oftentimes exercised that power</hi>; it were the same, according to such a form, to assert the assumption, and afterwards to condemn the Lives and Souls of those He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, which the Heirs of Kings, and especially their Sons have stoutly opposed; for thus, according to the Priests and Pharises accusing Christ of <hi>Heresie,</hi> they would impose a manifest Error, and Heresie on the King, of whom they have so great a Temporal assistance: But God when he pleaseth will move the heart of the King, to overthrow their madness.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> Again, Ecclesiastical persons are either the Chief Lords of those Revenues, and Temporal estates which the King hath given to them,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> It is confirmed also by the law and due of these Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al gifts of Almes; for the King is bound by the laws of God and of his Kingdom to preserve Justice, for the safety of his Liege-people.

to the Decrees of <hi>Gregory</hi> alledged in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going confirmation. <hi>If therefore the Temporal Lords</hi> (as the Clergy-men who enjoy these Gifts of Alms do chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge) <hi>are bound to continue the charitable Donations of their Fathers, whose Heirs they are</hi>; they are then bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <hi>themselves to that which followeth</hi>; for otherwise they would be obliged to Contradictories against the possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Divine law, <hi>viz.</hi> both to continue the said Gifts of Almes, and to defend their abuses in the several species of them; according to which sense, they do want the form and the very essence of a spiritual Gift of Alms. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Kings and Secular Lords are bound to continue the Almes of their Progenitors in the perpetuity of them, they are obliged also by the law of Spiritual almes to chastise their Liege-people abusing them. They are obliged also by that Obligation, to do justice to their Subjects, and to extinguish those injuries which most dangerously tend to the ruine of their Subjects.</p>
               <p>It is manifest, that in some case they are bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store their Goods to the Holy Church, and to take them away from the Despisers of God and his Kingdom; for this was the condition of the first and antient Donation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if our King have not the power over these his Peers to correct the abuse of Almes in his Clergy, he hath not the power of governing politickly over all his Kingdom; But yet if we do well attend to the holy Scripture, we shall know what is spoken of the priviledge of the King, to wit, that he hath a coercive power over the Clergy; and the Clergy have a priviledge also, that they have such a One set over them, to whom deservedly they may submit themselves.</p>

Do you forbid to dispence? No, but to dissipate; I am not so silly as to be ignorant that you are made Dispencers but to edification, not to destruction. Amongst Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sators, or Dispensers it is required, that a man be found faithfull: when Necessity urgeth, a Dispensation is excusable; when Profit inviteth it, the Dispensation is laudible; but this Profit must be publick, and common, and not private and particular; for where neither of these two are, it is not a faithfull Dispensation, but a cruel Dissipation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the words of this Saint it is manifest, that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging or exempting is not a <hi>faithfull Dispensation,</hi> but a <hi>cruel Dissipation.</hi> If Clergy-men be exempted, let their sin be never so enormous to from being corrected by any but the Pope only. For what is the profit of the Church, that Clergy-men should be wanton and rampant as Bulls, and like untamed Horses, neigh unto their Neighbours wives; unless in such grievous exorbitancies, some yoak, or curb be imposed upon them by the Princes. For Priviledging, Dispensation, or Exemption, ought not to be an Authority to them for the committing of sin; for St. <hi>Augustin</hi> in his fourth Book, intituled <hi>Authority,</hi> Quaest. 23. saith, <hi>That he who sinneth, sinneth not by the Authority, but against the Authority of the Law.</hi>

as <hi>the taking away of the Abuse is near to the last necessity of the perpetual Salvation both of Soul and Body</hi>; As it is a work of greater mercy to take away a Sword from a Mad-man that would kill himself, than to give a Sword to a persecuted man to defend himself from one that doth endeavour to kill him; for it is worse for a man to be killed by himself than by another; for the first is damnable, the second just, or meritorious. And to this sence is that of Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> 5. <hi>Quaest.</hi> 5. <hi>Not every one who spareth is a Friend, nor every one who scourgeth is an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; for the wounds of a Friends are better than the fraudulent kisses of an enemy; it is better to love with security, than to deceive with lenity.</hi>

                  </note> as Ecclesiastical Persons do joyfully receive Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from Kings and Dukes, for their good works: so by the same account when they do offend, they obediently ought to receive punishment from them for their evil work. The consequence holds, for punishment for sin, being humbly &amp; patiently received, is more profitable to a Man, than Prayse for a good work.

               </p>
               <p>If therefore the Pope without offence did so humbly receive punishment from the Emperour, why should not an inferiour Clergy-man be as patient, who justly, nay peradventure, who grievously offendeth? why should not, he I say, receive patiently punishment from him who is his King, or Prince, or Duke, and to whom he is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected?

So is it not convenient, that one of the Clergy should be a man of War, neither a Souldier to be one of the Clergy. Wherefore let us take away from them that which they do not justly, but wrongfully possess. And immediatly after she saith, The Omnipotent Father equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divideth all things, that is to say, the Heavens he gave unto the heavenly Creatures, and the Earth unto the earthly. And by this means was there a just division made between the Children of men, that the Spirituality should have such things as belong unto them, and the Secular people such things as are meet and necessary for them, so that neither of these two sorts do oppresse each other by violence; for God doth not command, that the one Son or Child should have both the Cloak and the Coat, and the other should go naked: but he willed, that the one should have the Cloak, and the other the Coat. Wherefore the secular sort ought to have the Cloak for the greatnesse of their worldly cares, and for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which daylie increase and multiply. The Coat he giveth unto the Spiritualitie, that they should not lack clothing, and that they should not possess more than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity doth require. Wherefore we judge and think it good, that all these aforesaid be divided by reason and equity. And whereas the Cloak and the Coat are both


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96364:23"/>
found, there the Cloak should be taken away, and given unto the needy, that they do not perish for lack or want. These aforesaid spake the Virgin <hi>Hildegardis,</hi> plainly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>showing the taking away of the Temporalities from the Clergy by the secular Lords, and shewing for what cause they shall be so taken away. And what manner of divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall be made of those things that are taken away, that they be not consumed, and spent unprofitably.</p>

            </p>
            <list>
               <head>Causes and Reasons why such Dispensations may be justly granted with honour and conscience.</head>
               <item>1. The State of the Crown of this Kingdom cannot well be sustained to govern and rule with honour, if such Possessions be taken from it:<note place="margin">Note.</note> for at this day, the greatest part of the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions of the Crown, consisteth of such Lands and Possessions.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:96364:61"/>2. Very many men have with their monies bought and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased great portions of those Lands, from the most Excellent Kings, <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>VIII.</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>VI.</hi> who, by their Letters Patents have warranted the same: of which Lands and Possessions, if the Owners should now be dis-possessed, the King should be bound to repay unto them all their money; which would arise to such an huge Masse, that it would be a very hard matter for the Crown to restore it.</item>
               <item>3. The Nobles and Gentry of this Realm, most of whom have sold and alienated their antient inheritances, to buy these new, cannot live according to their degrees, if these Possessions should be taken from them.</item>
               <item>4. The Purchasors, or Owners of such Lands and Possessions, in as much as they came to them by <note n="*" place="margin">The Henchers and Lawers of both Temples and Lincolns-Inne must hold so as well as other Purchasors.</note> just Title, according to the Ordinance of the Kings of this Kingdom, have held and do still hold a good and justifiable course in obtaining of them.</item>
               <item>5. The enjoying of such Lands and Possessions, is so common unto every state and condition of Men, Cities, Colleges, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporations, that if the same be taken from them,<note place="margin">Nota.</note> there will necessarily follow thereupon throughout the Kingdom, a sudden change and confusion of all Orders and Degrees.</item>
               <item>6. Seeing the Goods and Possessions of the Church, even by the authority of the Canon Laws, may be aliened for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Captives, and that the same may be done by that Church only, to whom such Possessions do belong: It is fit and reasonable that such Dispensations should be granted for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing of possession already gotten, for so great a good of publick concord <note n="*" place="margin">Mark this well.</note>, and unity of the Church, and preservation of this State, as well in body as in soul.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The consideration of this Statute, Letter and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the Pope himself, and our Popish Prelates, Clergy in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies, may perswade our present Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and Cathedral men to the like Moderation, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and Ingenuity, for the satisfaction of the King, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, Purchasors, and preservation of the Kingdoms, Churches Tranquility now and hereafter.</p>
            <p>Finally, because there is now an extraordinary great


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96364:62"/>
clamour against Sacriledge in most Pulpits, new Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, and in the Commons House it self, by many who understand not truly and thoroughly what <hi>Sacriledge</hi> is, I shall for a close of this Appendix inform them.</p>
