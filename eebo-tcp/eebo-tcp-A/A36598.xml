            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO
THE METROPOLIS
OF
GREAT BRITAIN,
The most Renowned and late Flourishing
CITY of
LONDON,
I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> its
REPRESENTATIVES
The LORD MAYOR and Court of ALDERMEN, the
SHERIFS and COMMON COUNCIL of it.</head>
            <p>AS perhaps I am the first
who ever presented a
work of this nature to the
Metropolis of any Nation, so
is it likewise consonant to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
that he who was to give
the first Example of such a
Dedication should begin it
<pb facs="tcp:65260:3"/>
with that City, which has set
a pattern to all others of true
Loyalty, invincible Courage
and unshaken Constancy.
Other Cities have been
prais'd for the same Virtues,
but I am much deceiv'd if
any have so dearly purchas'd
their reputation; their fame
has been won them by cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
trials then an expensive,
though necessary, War, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
Pestilence, and a more
consuming Fire. To submit
your selves with that humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to the Judgments of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and at the same time to
raise your selves with that
<pb facs="tcp:65260:3"/>
vigour above all humane Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
to be combated at once
from above and from below,
to be struck down and to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph;
I know not whether
such trials have been ever pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd
in any Nation, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
and successes of them
never can be. Never had
Prince or People more mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
reason to love each other, if
suffering for each other can
indear affection. You have
come together a pair of match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Lovers, through many
difficulties; He, through a
long Exile, various traverses of
Fortune, and the interposition
<pb facs="tcp:65260:4"/>
of many Rivals, who violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ravish'd and with-held
You from Him: And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
you have had your share
in sufferings. But Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
has cast upon you want
of Trade, that you might
appear bountiful to your
Country's necessities; and
the rest of your afflictions are
not more the effects of God's
displeasure, (frequent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of them having been in
the Reign of the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Princes) then occasions
for the manifesting of your
Christian and Civil virtues.
To you therefore this Year of
<pb facs="tcp:65260:4"/>
Wonders is justly dedicated,
because you have made it so.
You who are to stand a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to all Years and Ages, and
who have built your selves an
immortal Monument on your
own ruines. You are now a
<hi>Phoenix</hi> in her ashes, and, as far
as Humanity can approach, a
great Emblem of the suffering
Deity. But Heaven never made
so much Piety and Vertue to
leave it miserable. I have
heard indeed of some vertuous
persons who have ended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately,
but never of any
vertuous Nation: Providence
is engag'd too deeply, when
<pb facs="tcp:65260:5"/>
the cause becomes so general.
And I cannot imagine it has
resolv'd the ruine of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at home, which it has bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
abroad with such successes.
I am therefore to conclude,
that your sufferings are at an
end; and that one part of my
Poem has not been more an
History of your destruction,
then the other a Prophecy of
your restoration. The accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of which happiness,
as it is the wish of all true
<hi>English-men,</hi> so is by none
more passionately desired then

            <p>I Am so many ways oblig'd to you, and so little able
to return your favours, that, like those who owe
too much, I can onely live by getting farther
into your debt. You have not onely been careful
of my Fortune, which was the effect of your Nobleness,

in the correction of a Poem. But since you are to bear
this persecution, I will at least give you the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Martyr, you could never suffer in a nobler
cause. For I have chosen the most heroick Subject
which any Poet could desire: I have t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

management and prudence of our King; the conduct
and valour of a Royal Admiral, and of two incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Generals; the invincible courage of our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and Sea men, and three glorious Victories, the
result of all. After this I have, in the Fire, the most
deplorable, but withall the greatest Argument that
can be imagin'd: the destructio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> being so swift, so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
to vast and miserable, as nothing can parallel in
Story. The former part of this Poem, relating to the
War, is but a due expiation for my not serving my
King and Country in it. All Gentlemen are almost
<pb facs="tcp:65260:6"/>
oblig'd to it: And I know no reason we should give
that advantage to the Commonalty of <hi>England</hi> to be
for most in brave actions, which the Noblesse of <hi>France</hi>
would never suffer in their Peasants. I should not
have written this but to a Person, who has been ever
forward to appear in all employments, whither his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Generosity have call'd him. The latter part
of my Poem, which describes the Fire, I owe first to
the Piety and Fatherly Affection of our Monarch to his
suffering Subjects; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, in the second place, to the
courage, loyalty and magnanimity of the City: both
which were so conspicuous, that I have wanted words
to celebrate them as they deserve. I have call'd my
Poem <hi>Historical,</hi> not <hi>Epick,</hi> though both the Actions
and Actors are as much Heroick, as any Poem can
contain. But since the Action is not properly one, nor
that accomplish'd in the last successes, I have judg'd it
too bold a Title for a few <hi>Stanza's,</hi> which are little
more in number then a single <hi>Iliad,</hi> or the longest of
the <hi>Aen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ids.</hi> For this reason, (I mean not of length,
but broken action, ti'd too severely to the Laws of
History) I am apt to agree with those who rank <hi>Lucan</hi>
rather among Historians in Verse, then Epique Poets:
In whose room, if I am not deceiv'd, <hi>Silius Italicus,</hi>
though a worse Writer, may more justly be admitted.
I have chosen to write my Poem in <hi>Quatrains</hi> or <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za's</hi>
of four in alternate rhyme, because I have ever
judg'd them more noble, and of greater dignity, both
fro the sound and number, then any other Verse in use
amongst us; in which I am sure I have your approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb facs="tcp:65260:6"/>
The learned Languages have, certainly, a great
advantage of us, in not being tied to the slavery of any
Rhyme; and were less constrain'd in the quantity of

               </gap>s the
sense of all the rest. But in this necessity of our Rhymes,
I have always found the couplet Verse most easie,
(though not so proper for this occasion) for there the
work is sooner at an end, every two lines concluding
the labour of the Poet: but in Quattrains he is to carry
it farther on; and not onely so, but to bear along in his
head the troublesome sense of four lines together. For
those who write correctly in this kind must needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that the last line of the Stanza is to be
consider'd in the composition of the first. Neither can
we give our s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lves the liberty of making any part of a
Verse for the sake of Rhyme, or concluding with a word
which is not currant <hi>English,</hi> or using the variety of
Female Rhymes, all which our Fathers practis'd; and
for the Female Rhymes, they are still in use amongst
other Nations: with the <hi>Italian</hi> in every line, with the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> promiscuously, with the <hi>French</hi> alternately,
as those who have read the <hi>Alarique,</hi> the <hi>Pucelle,</hi> or
any of their latter Poems, will agree with me. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this, they write in <hi>Alexandrins,</hi> or Verses of six
feet, such as amongst us is the old Translation of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
by <hi>Chapman;</hi> all which, by lengthning of their
<pb facs="tcp:65260:7"/>
Chain, makes the sphere of their activity the larger. I
have dwelt too long upon the choice of my Stanza,
which you may remember is much better defended in
the Preface to <hi>Gondibert,</hi> and therefore I will hasten
to acquaint you with my endeavours in the writing.
In general I will onely say, I have never yet seen the
description of any Naval Fight in the proper terms
which are us'd at Sea; and if there be any such in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Language, as that of <hi>Lucan</hi> in the third of his
<hi>Pharsalia,</hi> yet I could not prevail my self of it in the
<hi>English;</hi> the terms of Arts in every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ongue bearing
more of the Idiom of it then any other words. We hear,
indeed, among our Poets, of the thundring of Guns, the
smoke, the disorder and the slaughter; but all these
are common notions. And certainly as those who, in a
Logical dispute, keep in general terms, would hide
a fallacy, so those who do it in any Poetical description
would vail their ignorance.

For my own part, if I had little knowledge of the Sea,
yet I have thought it no shame to learn: and if I have
made some few mistakes, 'tis onely, as you can bear me
witness, because I have wanted opportunity to correct
them, the whole Poem being first written, and now
sent you from a place, where I have not so much as the
converse of any Sea-man. Yet, though the trouble I
had in writing it was great, it was more then recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd

them, and made them fruitful: but here—
<hi>Omnia Sponte suâ reddit justissima tellus.</hi> I have
had a large, a fair and a pleasant field, so fertile, that,
without my cultivating, it has given me two Harvests

it is the happiness of the Age, so is it the peculiar good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the best of Kings, that we may praise his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

a just confidence of his own vertue, which the lustre of
no other can be so great as to darken in him: for the

               </gap>n from this
digression to a farther account of my Poem, I must
crave leave to tell you, that as I have endeavour'd to
adorn it with noble thoughts, so much more to express
those thoughts with elocution. The composition of all
Poems is or ought to be of wit, and wit in the Poet, or
<pb facs="tcp:65260:8"/>
wit writing, (if you will give me leave to use a Schoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
distinction) is no other then the faculty of imaginatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
in the writer, which, like a nimble Spaniel, beats ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and ranges through the field of Memory, till i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
springs the Quarry it hunted after; or, without meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor,
which searches over all the memory for the species
or Idea's of those things which it designs to represent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Wit written, is that which is well defin'd, the happy
result of thought, or product of that imagination. But
to proceed from wit in the general notion of it, to the
proper wit of an Heroick or Historical Poem, I judge
it chiefly to consist in the delightful imaging of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
actions, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssions, or things. 'Tis not the jerk o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
sting of an Epigram, nor the seeming contradiction of
a poor Antithesis, (the delight of an ill judging Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
in a Play of Rhyme) nor the gingle of a more
poor <hi>Paranomasia:</hi> neither is it so much the morality
of a grave sentence, affected by <hi>Lucan,</hi> but more spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
used by <hi>Virgil;</hi> but it is some lively and apt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
dress'd in such colours of speech, that it sets
before your eyes the absent object, as perfectly and more
delightfully then nature. So then, the first happiness
of the Poet's imagination is properly Invention, or
finding of the thought; the second is Fancy, or the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation,
driving or moulding of that thought, as the
judgment represents it proper to the subject; the third
is Elocution, or the Art of clothing and adorning that
thought so found and varied, in apt, significant and
sounding words: the quickness of the Imagination is
seen in the Invention, the fertility in the Fancy, and
<pb facs="tcp:65260:8"/>
the accuracy in the Expression. For the two first of
these <hi>Ovid</hi> is famous amongst the Poets, for the latter
<hi>Virgil. Ovid</hi> images more often the movements and
affections of the mind, either combating between two
contrary passions, or extremely discompos'd by one:
his words therefore are the least part of his care, for he
pictures Nature in disorder, with which the study and
choice of words is inconsistent. This is the proper wit
of Dialogue or Discourse, and, consequently, of the
<hi>Drama,</hi> where all that is said is to be suppos'd the
effect of sudden thought; which, though it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
not the quickness of wit in repartees, yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
not a too curious election of words, too frequent
allusions, or use of Tropes, or, in fine, any thing that
showes remoteness of thought, or labour in the Writer.
On the other side, <hi>Virgil</hi> speaks not so often to us in
the person of another, like <hi>Ovid,</hi> but in his own, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
almost all things as from himself, and thereby
gains more liberty then the other, to express his
thoughts with all the graces of elocution, to write more
figuratively, and to confess, as well the labour as the
force of his imagination. Though he describes his
<hi>Dido</hi> well and naturally, in the violence of her pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
yet he must yield in that to the <hi>Myrrha,</hi> the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blis,</hi>
the <hi>Althaea,</hi> of <hi>Ovid;</hi> for, as great an admirer
of him as I am, I must acknowledge, that, if I see not
more of their Souls then I see of <hi>Dido</hi>'s, at least I
have a greater concernment for them: and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
me that <hi>Ovid</hi> has touch'd those tender strokes
more delica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ely then <hi>Virgil</hi> could. But when Action
<pb facs="tcp:65260:9"/>
or Persons are to be describ'd, when any such Image
is to beset before u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but we so see them, as our own eyes could never have
beheld them so beautiful in themselves. We see the
Soul of the Poet, like that universal one of which he
speaks, informing and moving through all his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I esteem the Divinest part of all this writings, the

Nature, most of which are neither great in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> up:
but the words wherewith he describes them are so
excellent, that it might be well appli'd to him which
was said by <hi>Ovid, Materiam superabat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
connatural to the subject, and while we read him, we
sit, as in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lay, beholding the Scenes of what he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents.
To perform this, he made frequent use of Tropes
<pb facs="tcp:65260:9"/>
which you know change the nature of a known word, by
applying it to some other signification: and this is it
which <hi>Horace</hi> means in this Epistle to the <hi>Pisos.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Dixeris egregie notum si callida verbum</l>
                  <l>Reddiderit junctura novum—</l>
               </q>
But I am sensible I have presum'd too far, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
you with a rude discourse of that Art, which you
both know so well, and put into practise with so much
happiness. Yet before I leave <hi>Virgil,</hi> I must own the
vanity to tell you, and by you the world, that he has
been my Master in this Poem: I have followed him
every where, I know not with what success, but I am
sure with diligence enough: my Images are many of
them copied from him, and the rest are imitations of
him. My expressions also are as near as the Idioms of
the two Languages would admit of in translation.
And this, Sir, I have done with that boldness, for
which I will stand accomptable to any of our little Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
who, perhaps, are not better acquainted with
him then I am. Upon your first perusal of this Poem,
you have taken notice of some words which I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novated
(if it be too bold for me to say re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in'd) upon
his <hi>Latin;</hi> which, as I offer not to introduce into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
prose, so I hope they are neither improper, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unelegant in Verse; and, in this, <hi>Horace</hi> will
again defend me.
<q>
                  <l>Et nova, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fictaque nuper habebunt verba fidem, si</l>
                  <l>Graeco fonte cadant, parcè detorta—</l>
               </q>
The inference is exceeding plain; for if a <hi>Roman</hi> Poet
might have liberty to coin a word, supposing onely that
<pb facs="tcp:65260:10"/>
it was derived from the <hi>Greek,</hi> we put into a <hi>Latin</hi>
termination, and that he us'd this liberty but seldom,
and with modesty: How much more justly may I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
that privilege to do it with the same praerequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits,
from the best and most judicious of <hi>Latin</hi> Writers?
In some places, where either the fancy, or the words,
were his, or any others, I have noted it in the Margin,
that I might not seem a Plagiary: in others I have
neglected it, to avoid as well the tediousness, as the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
of doing it t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o often. Such descriptions or
images, well wrought, which I promise no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for mine,
are, as I have said, the adequate delight of heroick
Poesie, for they beget admiration, which is its proper
object; as the images of the Burlesque, which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to this, by the same reason beget laughter; for the
one shows Nature beautified, as in the picture of a fair
Woman, which we all admire; the other shows her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
as in that of a Lazar, or of a fool with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storted
face and antique gestures, at which we cannot
forbear to laugh, because it is a deviation from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But though the same images serve equally for
the Epique Poesie, and for the Historique and Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrique,
which are branches of it, yet a several sort
of Sculpture is to be used in them: if some of them are
to be like those of <hi>Juvenal, Stantes in curribus
Aemiliani,</hi> Heroes drawn in their triumphal Chariots,
and in their full proportion; others are to be like that
of <hi>Virgil, Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

You will soon find I write not this without concern.
<pb facs="tcp:65260:10"/>
Some who have seen a paper of Verses which I wrote last
year to her Highness the <hi>Dutchess,</hi> have accus'd
them of that onely thing I could defend in them; they
have said I did <hi>humi serpere,</hi> that I wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ted not onely
height of fancy, but dignity of words to set it off; I
might well answer with that of <hi>Horace, Nunc non
erat his locus,</hi> I knew I address'd them to a Lady,
and accordingly I affected the softness of expression,
and the smoothness of measure, rather then the height
of thought; and in what I did endeavour, it is no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to say, I have succeeded, I detest arrogance, but
there is some difference betwixt that and a just defence.
But I will not farther bribe your candour, or the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.

            <l>Then with the Duke your Highness rul'd the day:</l>
            <l>While all the brave did his command obey.</l>
            <l>The fair and pious under you did pray.</l>
            <l>How pow'rful are chast vows! the wind and tyde</l>
            <l>You brib'd to combat on the <hi>English</hi> side.</l>
            <l>Thus to your much lov'd Lord you did convey</l>
            <l>An unknown succour, sent the nearest way.</l>
            <l>New vigour to his wearied arms you brought;</l>
            <l>(So <hi>Moses</hi> was upheld while <hi>Israel</hi> fought.)</l>
            <l>While, from afar, we heard the Canon play,</l>
            <l>Like distant Thunder on a shiny day,</l>
            <l>For absent friends we were asham'd to fear,</l>
            <l>When we consider'd what you ventur'd there.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:65260:11"/>Ships, Men and Arms our Country might restore,</l>
            <l>But such a Leader could supply no more.</l>
            <l>With generous thoughts of conquest he did burn,</l>
            <l>Yet fought not more to vanquish then return.</l>
            <l>Fortune and victory he did pursue,</l>
            <l>To bring them, as his Slaves, to wait on you.</l>
            <l>Thus Beauty ravish'd the rewards of Fame,</l>
            <l>And the Fair triumph'd when the Brave o'rcame.</l>
            <l>Then, as you meant to spread another way</l>
            <l>By Land your Conquests far as his by Sea,</l>
            <l>Leaving our Southern Clime, you march'd along</l>
            <l>The stubborn North, ten thousand <hi>Cupid</hi>'s strong.</l>
            <l>Like Commons the Nobility resort</l>
            <l>In crowding heaps, to fill your moving Court:</l>
            <l>To welcome your approach the Vulgar run,</l>

            <l>And Country Beauties by their Lovers go,</l>
            <l>Blessing themselves, and wondring at the show.</l>
            <l>So when the new-born <hi>Phoenix</hi> first is seen,</l>
            <l>Her feather'd Subjects all adore their Queen.</l>
            <l>And, while she makes her progress through the East,</l>
            <l>From every grove her numerous train's increast:</l>
            <l>Each Poet of the air her glory sings,</l>
