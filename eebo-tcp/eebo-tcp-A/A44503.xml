         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

OF A DECISION OF
the chiefe Controverſie now debated
concerning Church-government.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST, I preſuppoſe I am to
ſpeak to men that make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of their waies, and
conſequently ſtudy to walke
by a rule. I preſuppoſe in the
ſecond place, that the rule
by which they deſire to
walke, is chiefly the cleere
word of God, but where this cannot be had, that
the principles and inditements of ſound reaſon they
will not reject: and laſtly, when reaſonings may be
doubtfull, that they will neither be ſingular and
wilfull in their owne ſenſe, but inclining to heare
the judgement of others, nor unwilling to yeeld
unto that, wherein all ſuch as are eſteemed to bee
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96853:3"/>
moſt rationall doe agree: with ſuch men I deſire to
ſpeake, and would tell them that I finde in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
of this time, divers little Treaties put forth,
many bitterly, and indiſcreetly, ſome modeſtly, and
wiſely writen; ſome for, and ſome againſt Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
all of them ſtanding for particular tenets, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to uphold their owne forme of government as
the beſt, and onely lawfull ordinance of God.
None that I have met withall doe looke upon the
matter without partiality to ſeeke concerning the
points chiefly to be queſtioned, a Deciſion, which
I thinke may be taken from undoubted grounds,
and undeniable principles. Therefore I thought it
might be of uſe to put ſomething to paper alſo in
this kinde, as it were to make a triall, whether or
no the way to decide this great controverſie might
not be found out ſo as to give preſent ſatisfaction to
the more ſimple and ſcrupulous; and to ſhew to the
more learned and judicious (whoſe doubts lie dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per)
a method whereby to reſolve themſelves, if
they will follow the ſame without prejudice, I ſhall
endeavour to doe.</p>
            <p>I take then the matter chiefly queſtionable,
though not hitherto mainly, and expreſly queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be this. <hi rend="margQuotes">Whether or no Chriſt hath not for
the uniting and building up of his Church, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
ſome overſeers or Biſhops (for I uſe theſe
names indifferently) to be before, and above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in Church government? or whether for the
uniting and building up of his Church, he hath
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96853:3"/>
made all overſeers to bee equall and independent
one from another?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the firſt be affirmed, then the queſtion muſt be
what that Priority, and Superiority is which Chriſt
hath allowed of? and how it ought to be exerciſed
above others? But if the laſt be maintained, then we
muſt be taught, what that prime and unſubordinate
Authority of every overſeer is, in his peculiar
charge? and how he ſhould exerciſe it? Now to
finde a way to decide theſe queſtions, I am as one
who is doubtfull, that I may beare a part of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of thoſe who are in doubt. Therefore to bee
able to reſolve my ſelfe, it will be neceſſary to lay
ſome grounds from whence inferences may be made
appliable to the queſtions now in hand.</p>
            <p>The grounds muſt be cleere doctrines of holy
Scripture, concerning the matters which are fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
in the queſtion. The inferences muſt be
rules taken from thoſe doctrines, whereby my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
may be directed to go the ſtraight way
towards a deciſion of the queſtion, and the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
muſt be a conſideration of the particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of things now debated, ſo far as they are
determinable by the rules which may be found out.</p>
            <p>Thus then to finde grounds of Deciſion I muſt
take notice firſt, of things fundamentall to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
which I ſuppoſe are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96853:4"/>
1. To what end Chriſt hath gathered together
and compacted into one body ſeverall beleevers
which are called his Church?</p>
            <p>2. What it is properly to build up his Church?</p>
            <p>3. What Officers were appointed by Chriſt to
be the builders of his Church?</p>
            <p>4. What their ſeverall charges and duties were
in the Church, and how they were to adminiſtrate
the ſame every one according to his gift and place?</p>
            <p>5. How theſe that were committed to their
charge, were to behave themſelves towards them?</p>
            <p>6. How according to the intention of Chriſt and
the rules proceeding from his ſpirit, the chiefe buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
his immediate followers the Apoſtles did put
all in execution? here then their practice in the way
of government is to be taken notice of.</p>
            <p>If theſe things can be found cleerly in Scripture,
I hope they will afford me ſome light, to ſatifie the
doubts of my weake conſcience, which now muſt
be full of ſcruples for other mens ſakes.</p>
            <p>But when I ſhall have gathered all that from cleer
Scripture can be gathered in theſe matters, if yet
ſomething ſhould be found obſcure, and doubtfull
concerning particulars now agitated, whereof per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96853:4"/>
no cleere precept is extant in Scripture from
whence I may be able to gather ſuch inferences as
may ſettle my conſcience and put it out of doubt
concerning ſome queſtions in government, as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this or that, in ſuch or ſuch a caſe ought either
to be or not to be done. Then I thinke I ſhould doe
well to looke firſt, upon the Apoſtles practice in
like caſes, or if that be perhaps alſo either unknowne
or not well knowne, as not recorded in the word,
then I ſuppoſe it will not be amiſſe to conſider the
laudable practice of other times, and chiefly thoſe
who moſt immediately followed the Apoſtolicall
age, taking notice of that which they did in ſuch
like caſes; that if perhaps in all Churches of all
ages and places, I finde ſome undoubted tokens of
univerſall conſent, I may be willing to reſt in it, and
not affect ſingularity; chiefly if I ſhould alſo finde,
that all the Churches of this preſent age, doe either
conſent fully thereunto, or at leaſt doe not ſo farre
diſſent from the ſame, as to condemne others who
follow not their different practice in ſuch caſes. In
all which Churches I ſay, I ought to take notice in
thoſe caſes, which ſhall be thus doubtfull, of their
formes of government ſo farre as I ſhall finde the
ſame ſubordinate unto the maine end for which
Chriſt gathered his Church, and not repugnant but
conſonant unto the rules and practice of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
which are cleerly recorded.</p>
            <p>For I conceive that if it can be made apparent, that
either the end for which Chriſt gathered a Church,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96853:5"/>
or the meanes of building it up appointed by him,
or the rules and conſtitutions of the Apoſtles deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to the builders which were to be their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers;
or their owne practice in governing the
Church according to Gods will, is repugnant to all
Priority, and Superiority, of one Paſtor above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then it muſt be granted, that no ſuch govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ought to be admitted. But if this not onely
cannot be made apparent, but rather the contrary,
namely that both the aime of Chriſt in compacting
his Church into one body, and the means by which
it is to be built up, and the rules given to the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and the practice of the chiefe Maſter builders,
whom I take to have been infallible in the way of
publicke government, doe ſhew forth that a Priority
and ſuperiority of one overſeer above another, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of: then me thinkes the firſt queſtion will
be decided, and muſt be anſwered yea: but then the
ſecond queſtion will come into conſideration,
namely that Priority, and Superiority, is which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
according to Chriſts aime, is anſwerable unto
the meanes of mutuall edification, is ſettled by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
rules, was practiſed by the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and hath been continued by all their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
from the moſt incorrupt primitive times, untill
this preſent age? which if I can by cleer word of
Scripture, and teſtimony of Authors worthy of
credit, in all ages finde out, then I thinke I ought to
ſet my minde at reſt, and caſt off further doubtings.</p>
            <p>If this rule of proceeding towards a deciſion of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96853:5"/>
the matter, be thus without further reſtriction and
exception admitted, then my next care muſt be to
follow it cloſely, and take heed leſt it be unſappled
to things indifferent, either in nature or proportion,
from thoſe wherein Chriſt and his Apoſtles with
their true followers in times moſt incorrupt were
converſant.</p>
            <p>Now then to make onely at this time a breefe
tryall of this way (for hereafter if need be matters
may be inlarged) I will ſummarily obſerve that
which is cleer Scripture concerning the forenamed
heads.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I finde that the end wherefore Chriſt
would have all his beleevers compacted and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into one body, is that the world ſhould beleeve
and know theſe two things: That the Father hath
ſent his Sonne to us, and that the Father loveth
the beleevers as he loveth his Sonne. This is cleer
in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 21, 22, 23. Another end of this union is
that the beleevers may bee able to build up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in grace. This is cleer in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 16. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end is, that they may preſerve themſelves from
the dangers of adverſaries, and the cauſes of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
<hi>Phil. 1. 27, 28. Gal.</hi> 5. 13, 14, 15. And a
further end is the holding up of the credit of Gods
Kingdome in the world, aſwell by life, as by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. and ſequent: but chiefly verſe
14, 15, 16. From whence I ſuppoſe theſe aſſertions
may ſafely be gathered as rules of future Deciſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:96853:6"/>
1. If the knowledge and faith of Chriſt, if the
Fathers love to all beleevers be made manifeſt unto
the word, if the building up of all beleevers amongſt
themſelves, if their preſervation from adverſaries,
and if the credit of Gods Kingdome both in life &amp;
doctrine, be upheld in the Church of God, more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
juſtly and ſafely by a Priority and Superiority
of overſeers one above another, then by an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of ſpirituall perſons and charges one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
then it is to be conceived, that a Priority and
Superiority of overſeers in Chriſts Church, is
more anſwerable to his aime in compacting it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one body, then an independency. But it may bee
conceived, that theſe ends may be attained more
directly, juſtly and ſafely by the one, then by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Therefore it may be conceived, that the one
is more anſwerable to his aime then the other.</p>
            <p>2. If there be any Priority and Superiority of
ſpirituall charges, and perſons, or any parity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency
of charges amongſt perſons which is
not ſubordinate, but repugnant unto thoſe ends;
then it is to bee conceived that ſuch both Priority
and ſuperiority, as alſo parity and independency is
altogether unlawfull. But perhaps there is ſome
both Priority, and Superiority, as alſo independency
and parity, not ſubordinate but repugnant to theſe
ends: therefore it is to be conceived, that perhaps
ſome both parity and independency, as alſo Priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Superiority is unlawfull.</p>
            <p>I take theſe aſſertions though doubtfully propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96853:6"/>
in reſpect of particulars, to be nevertheleſſe out of
all doubt in their generality; and therefore I lay them
as grounds of future directions towards a Deciſion
of the point.</p>
            <p>Secondly, concerning the building up of the
Church, I finde in Scripture that to build up the
Church of Chriſt is to uſe meanes <q>to perfect the
Saints till they all come unto the unity of the faith,
and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a
perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the
fulneſſe of Chriſt, that they may not alwaies bee
carried to and fro as Infants with divers windes of
doctrine; but dealing truly in love may grow up
in him, that is the head even Chriſt, from whom
the whole body fitly joyned together, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
by that which every joynt ſupplieth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the effectuall working in the meaſure
of every part, maketh encreaſe of the body to the
edifying of it ſelf in love,</q>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>Eph</hi> 4. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.</bibl>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are words of exceeding deepe and great
ſenſe, and yet me thinkes exceeding cleere if they
be reſolved into ſingle propoſitions, which now I
will not ſtand to doe, becauſe I muſt be breefe.
Therefore I will againe take up theſe rules.</p>
            <p>1. If it may be conceived, that a Priority and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
of ſome ſpirituall overſeers over others, be
a more direct and proper meanes then a parity, and
independency of the ſame is, to bring all the Saints
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96853:7"/>
of God unto the unity of Faith, and Knowledge,
and therein to a perfect manly ſtature, and the
meaſure of the fulneſſe of Chriſt; then I am bound
to thinke that a priority and ſuperiority is more
anſwerable to Chriſts intention in building up his
Church, then is a paritie and independencie, but
the Antecedent is perhaps true; therefore the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
perhaps alſo.</p>
            <p>2. If I finde that the independent paritie of
Miniſters doth keepe the Saints of God alwayes in
infancy, ſuffering them to bee carried to and fro
with divers windes of Doctrine, and maketh an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
way to the ſleight and cunning craftineſſe of
men, whereby they lye in wait to deceive; then I
am bound to thinke that an independent parity of
Miniſters is not anſwerable to Chriſts intention in
building up his Church. But I finde that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
parity of Miniſters doth perhaps this.
Ergo I muſt conclude that it is not perhaps anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to Chriſts intention in building up his
Church.</p>
            <p>3. If the independent parity of Overſeers may
ſeeme to me repugnant to that fit joining and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacting
of all beleevers into one body, whereby
as members one of another they ſhould ſupply by
their common joynts each one towards another
that which according to the effectuall working in
the meaſure of every part, ſhould make the increaſe
of the body to build it ſelfe up in love; and if a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96853:7"/>
priority and ſuperiority of Overſeers may ſeeme
not at all repugnant, but moſt conſonant to this
kinde of worke, then I may conceive that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
parity is not at all, and that the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
priority is altogether anſwerable unto Chriſts
intention in building up his Church; but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
may ſeem ſo to me, and therefore alſo the
latter.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, concerning the Officers, wee finde in
Scripture theſe by name: 1. Apoſtles, 2. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
3. Evangeliſts, 4. Paſtors and Teachers, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi>
4. 11. elſewhere wee finde other names of
Gifts and Offices; as workers of Miracles, Gifts
of Healing, Helpes, Governours, Diverſities of
tongues, Interpreters of tongues, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28, 29,
30. Item, Deacons, Exhorters, Rulers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 7, 8.
and Biſhops, Presbyters, and Deacons, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.
1, 8. and 5. 17, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>From whence I make theſe inferences. 1. If
theſe Officers appointed for the firſt building of
Chriſts Church were by degrees ſet in a priority
and ſuperiority one above another, then I may
conceive that a priority and ſuperiority of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Officers is not repugnant to the government of
Chriſts Church. But theſe Officers were ſo ſet
in relation of degrees one above another; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I may conceive that ſuch a gradation of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
Officers is not repugnant to the government
of Chriſts Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:96853:8"/>
2. If there was no independent parity in the
firſt Officers inſtituted in Chriſts Church, then I
have reaſon to conceive that an independent pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is not anſwerable to Chriſts intention, in inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting
Officers in his Church. But there was no
independent parity in theſe firſt Officers inſtituted
in the Church: Therefore I have reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that an independent parity is not anſwerable
to Chriſts intention.</p>
            <p>Here two things may be objected or excepted
againſt this Rule of Deciſion. Firſt, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
who were Chriſts firſt Officers were equal
one to another, and independent one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But to this I anſwer, That I ſpeake not of
the Officers appointed before the conſtitution of
the Church, but of thoſe that are named expreſly
to beare office in the Church already conſtituted.
Secondly, if then it bee ſaid, that the inequality of
theſe firſt Office-bearers doth proceed from the
difference of extraordinary and ordinary Officers,
then requiſit at the firſt conſtitution of the Church
which is not now requiſite after it is once conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted;
then I anſwer, that here I neither intend nor
have need to conſider which Officers were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
and which ordinary, becauſe I take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of them onely at this time as they were Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
extant at firſt, to build up the Church; and
my inference goeth no further as yet; nor muſt I
come to admit of that diſtinction in my thought,
till the matter it ſelfe carry me to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:96853:8"/>
Fourthly, I finde the ſeverall charges and duties
of theſe Officers to be theſe.</p>
            <p>1. Chriſt ſending forth his Apoſtles appointeth
them to be his witneſſes unto the utmoſt parts of
the earth, of that which he hath done for our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Acts</hi> 1. 8. Alſo hee giveth them charge to
teach all men to obſerve whatſoever hee had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them, and to baptiſe thoſe that received
their doctrine, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. 20. This they did, and
ſo gathered a Church together; wherein at firſt,
the faithfull having all things common, brought
their goods to the Apoſtles feet, making them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributers
thereof unto ſuch as had need. But the
Apoſtles found this charge impoſed upon them to
be too troubleſome, and not proper unto their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
calling; therefore they betooke themſelves
unto their owne peculiar charge which was to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
unto prayer, and the Miniſtery of the word;
<hi>Acts</hi> 6. 4. and gave advice that Deacons, ſhould be
choſen, whoſe peculiar charge at their firſt inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was to ſerve the tables, <hi>Ibid.</hi> verſe 2, 3. yet it is
evident that they alſo preached the word, and bore
witneſſe of Chriſt, <hi>Ib.</hi> verſe 9. 10. and Cap. 8. verſe
5. and baptiſed the beleevers, <hi>Ib.</hi> Chap. 8. verſ. 12. 38.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe Deacons, we finde that the Church
being conſtituted, other Officers in it are named and
ſaid to bee different in charges. As the charge of
Prophets was to propheſie according to the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
of faith, of Deacons to attend their Deacon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
of Teachers to attend teaching, of Exhorters
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96853:9"/>
to attend exhorting, of Diſtributers to diſtribute, of
Rulers to rule with diligence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6. 7. 8. of
ſpeakers with tongues to ſpeake, and of Interpreters
to interpret, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 27.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe duties thus generally mentioned,
we finde more particular charges mentioned. As
firſt, concerning the duties of Prophets, how they
ought to propheſie, &amp; of ſpeakers with tongues, how
they ought to ſpeak unto edification in the Church,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33.</p>
            <p>Secondly, concerning Rulers, where we finde
the charge given to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> either as
Evangeliſts, or as ordinary Biſhops, and Overſeers
of the Churches, next unto the Apoſtles; their
charge was to ſet in order things which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
left undone for the conſtituting of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
amongſt which the ordaining of Elders, and
Deacons in every Church, was a chiefe duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to them, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 3. Tit. 1. 5. item</hi> To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
and inhibit falſe doctrines, 1. <hi>Tim. 1. 3. Tit. 1.
10. 11. item</hi> To ſettle a courſe of prayers in the
Church, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 1. item</hi> To appoint due mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for widowes, and Elders, 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 9. 17.
18. item</hi> To be Judges in matters of accuſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Elders, <hi>ibid.</hi> verſe 19. and to give impoſition
of hands to thoſe that were approved and fit for the
Miniſtery, <hi>ibid</hi> verſe 22. <hi>item</hi> To maintaine their
authority, &amp; not to ſuffer themſelves to be deſpiſed
therein, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 12. Tit.</hi> 2. 15. And laſtly, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96853:9"/>
the things which they had heard of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
unto faithfull men, able to teach others who
ſhould be ſucceſſors in that place, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. As
for other Rulers in the Paſtorall charge, their duty
is ſpecified to be a watching over the ſoules of their
flock as thoſe which muſt give an account, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.
17. and in doing this, they are bound to call their
ſheep by name, to lead them out and to goe before
them, <hi>Ioh. 10. 3. 4. item</hi> To defend them againſt the
wolves, though they hazard their life in ſo doing,
<hi>ib.</hi> verſe 11. <hi>item</hi> To viſit the ſick, &amp; pray for them,
<hi>Iam. 5. 14. item</hi> To keepe the keyes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heaven to ſhut it, and open it as occaſion
ſhall require, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 19, and 18. 17, 18. and
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. 5.</p>
            <p>And then the generall duty of all Officers is, that
as every one hath received the gift, ſo he ſhould
miniſter the ſame to others as a good ſteward of the
manifold graces of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10.</p>
            <p>From all this I make theſe inferences.</p>
            <p>1. If all theſe charges and duties are different,
and yet ſhould be adminiſtred jointly as by ſeverall
members of one body, then it ſeems ſuch a priority
and ſuperiority in ſome, and ſubordination in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
is to be obſerved as is in the members of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
body, one in reſpect of another. But all theſe
charges are different, and yet ſo to be adminiſtred
as is mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4, 5. and till the end of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96853:10"/>
Chapter. Therefore it ſeems ſuch a priority and
ſuperiority in ſome, and ſubordination in others,
is to be obſerved.</p>
            <p>2. If theſe charges in their naturall property
as they ſtand in relation one to another, be repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to an independent parity, then there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
parity allowed of amongſt the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
who are to diſcharge the ſame. But it may
perhaps be made good that theſe charges are in
their naturall property as they ſtand in relation
one to another, repugnant to an independent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
therefore perhaps there is no independent
parity allowed of amongſt the Officers who are
to diſcharge the ſame.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the duty of the flock is in a word to be
obedient unto their Rulers, and to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unto them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7. 17. and to provide
neceſſary maintenance for them, <hi>Gal. 6. 6. 8.
1 Cor.</hi> 9. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>From hence I inferre, that if ſubmiſſion and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
is to be yeelded, and if Rulers be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in charge, then according to every ones de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
and different place in his charge, the ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ought to be differenced: But the Antecedent
is true, and therefore alſo the Conſequent. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I conceive, that more reſpect was due unto
Apoſtles even, as they were ordinary Miniſters,
then to their ordinary Rulers; and more to the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96853:10"/>
Biſhops and Overſeers that were made Iudges of
other Elders, then to the Elders that were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to be judged; and more reverence due to the
Elders then to the Deacons.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the practice of the Apoſtles as chiefe
Maſterbuilders was this: they laid the foundation
which is Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10, 11. they built by
preaching upon the foundation gold, ſilver, and
precious ſtones, they baptiſed the beleevers,
and gathered them together in one body, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
Elders and Officers over them to rule
them, and doe the work of the Miniſtery. See <hi>Acts</hi>
13. and 14. Chapters, and particulerly in Chap.
14. the verſes 21, 22, 23. They gave orders to
their followers concerning all things needfull for
edification in the Churches, as may be ſeene in
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> Chapters 5, and 6, and 7, and 8, and 9, and
and 10, and 11, and 12, and 14, and 16. verſe 1. and
in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> Chap. 8, and 9. in the Epiſtles to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>
and <hi>Titus</hi> throughout, and elſwhere, as in the
<hi>Acts</hi> in Chap. 6. and 15. and 20.</p>
            <p>From whence I infer, that if neither in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
owne practice, nor in the practice of thoſe
whom they ſet over the Churches in their owne
time there be any example of independent parity
intimated or uſed in the way of ordinary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then ſuch a parity may ſeem to be inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to be admitted into the Church of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:96853:11"/>
But perhaps no ſuch example is to bee found in
their practice or in the practice of thoſe whom
they appointed to bee ordinary Rulers of the
Churches in their owne time. Therefore an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
parity may ſeem inconvenient to bee
admitted.</p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly run over the fundamentall
matters of the firſt queſtion in hand, not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to determine any thing preciſely, but to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſome rules of determination whereby the
matter of priority and ſuperiority in government
may be tried more at large in due time.</p>
            <p>Only thus much I muſt now intimate, that my
doubt concerning priority and ſuperiority of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
Officers in the Church is ſo farre reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that it ſeemeth not at all repugnant to me
but rather more conſonant and anſwerable to
Chriſts intention in the firſt inſtitution of his
Church, then an independent parity. And this
is the firſt poſition wherein I receive ſome ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to my doubts.</p>
            <p>If therefore any will contradict this poſition to
make me againe doubtfull of it, I thinke he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to ſhew that an independent parity of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
is not onely no leſſe, but as much, and rather
much more anſwerable to Chriſts intention: and
this he muſt ſhew from the ſame grounds which I
have laid, except hee can ſhew theſe to be inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96853:11"/>
and lay ſome others that are more ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory:
which if he doth, then it will be alſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
that he define cleerly what that prime and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
authority is, which every Ruler hath
by himſelfe in his particular charge.</p>
            <p>As for me, becauſe I take this poſition as gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that Chriſt did inſtitute in the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of his Church a priority and ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of ſpirituall Officers; therefore I thinke I
may ſafely gather, that for the building up and
perpetuall propagating of the ſame, his intention
was not altered: which ſecond poſition if any will
deny, I ſuppoſe he will finde himſelfe obliged to
ſhew unto me ſufficient and evident cauſes, why
his intention ſhould be altered: and therefore that
frame of government which was either neceſſary
or moſt convenient for the firſt conſtitution and
building up of his Church, is inconſiſtent with the
perpetuall propagation thereof.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing I conceive it not likely that this can
be ſhewne, therefore I ought to proceed and come
to the ſecond queſtion, to finde out what the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
and ſuperiority is which Chriſt doth allow
of in the ſpirituall Rulers of the Church, and to
finde out this, it will bee requiſite to review a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
the grounds heretofore laid from whence
the poſition hath beene gathered, that a priority
and ſuperiority of Rulers in ſpirituall government
is anſwerable to Chriſts intention; which that we
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96853:12"/>
may doe, let us begin at the laſt and goe upward
towards the firſt.</p>
            <p>The laſt of our grounds was the practice of the
Apoſtles, which yeeldeth no example to us of any
independent pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ty, but rather of a ſuperior prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which in the way of their ordinary go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
they uſed over others. For I ſuppoſe no
man doubteth of this, but the Apoſtles were in
the ordinary cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe of their myſtery above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſpirituall Officers which ordinarily ruled the
Churches. If then it be granted that in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
courſe of their Miniſtery they were above
others, the next thing to be ſought after will be
this, wherein their ſuperiority did conſiſt? and
how far it was derived or not derived unto their
ſucceſſors?</p>
            <p>And to finde out this, I conceive that in the
Apoſtles diſcharge of their duty ſome thing was
extraordinary, as being uſefull and requiſite onely
for that time wherein they lived; and ſomething
ordinary and of perpetuall uſe which was to bee
tranſmitted unto their ſucceſſors.</p>
            <p>The extraordinary diſcharge of their Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
duty was firſt to lay the foundation, and
then to raiſe and ſettle that frame of Chriſts
Church upon the ſame which was moſt anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to his Kingdome: And to doe this, God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
them with extraordinary gifts, of tongues,
of knowledge, of wiſdome, of prudence, and of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96853:12"/>
infallibility in truth and publicke government,
and confirmed their authority with his owne
teſtimony bearing them witneſſe as the Apoſtle
ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 4. both with ſignes and wonders and
with divers miracles and gifts of the holy Ghoſt;
which by the impoſition of their hands he confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
upon the beleevers, as is evident by <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 17.
and 19. 6.</p>
            <p>This I conceive was their extraordinary autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and diſcharge of their duty which ſhould not
be tranſmitted to any after them, but ſhould reſt
in their perſons &amp; be for after times recorded in
Scripture, that thereby they ſhould become per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
Apoſtles unto all ages; as being ſet on
their thrones in Gods word to judge the twelve
tribes of Iſrael; ſo that their Apoſtleſhip although
in reſpect of their perſonall condition it was tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary,
yet in reſpect of their charge and meſſage
from God to his Church it is perpetuall, and yet
ſtill extant in the Church.</p>
            <p>The ordinary diſcharge of their miniſteriall
duty, was to beare witneſſe of Chriſt unto the
world, to declare by preaching the counſell of
God unto mankind, to attend the worke of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and to governe the Church according to the
rules by which they did at firſt conſtitute the
ſame. For no doubt the Rules which they gave
to others for the worke of the ordinary Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Government, they themſelves firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96853:13"/>
ſo that not onely by precepts but by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
they left their examples to bee followed as
rules, ſee <hi>Phil. 3. 17. 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 10, 11. From
whence I gather that what priority &amp; ſuperiority
ſoever in the ordinary government of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
Church of God they uſed over other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
to whom the particular ſpirituall charge of
a Church did belong, that the ſame priority and
ſuperiority may upon the like occaſions be uſed in
the ſame ordinary government: <hi>item,</hi> I gather
further, that they did tranſmit their priority and
ſuperiority unto thoſe whom they appointed to
be their ſucceſſors in the ordinary charge: I ſay
they did tranſmit it either by expreſſe precepts, or
by actuall practice propoſed to be an example un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them to be followed in like caſes, for thus
2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 10, 11. the Apoſtle recomendeth his own
practice to be obſerved. And laſtly, from both
theſe inferences I gather a third concluſion, that
if we will truly know what the priority and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
of one ſpirituall governour is above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the ordinary courſe of government, wee
muſt take notice of all the paſſages of Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
practice in this caſe. And this will ſuffice
at this time for an entry towards the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that which we ſeek for.</p>
            <p>The next ground going before this, was the
precept of obedience and ſubmiſſion due by the
members of the Church unto their Rulers that
watched over them: the precept is cleer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.
17. the rule inferred from thence was, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96853:13"/>
to the difference of Rulers in the degrees of
place, the ſubmiſſion and obedience was to be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenced.
Now if I would know what the different
degrees of Rulers are, I thinke I ought to obſerve
the property which the Apoſtle addeth unto the
office of a Ruler as a characteriſticall note of his
charge when he calleth him a watching Ruler over
the flock. From which property I gather this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
towards a further determination of the point
in hand; namely that what priority and ſuperiority
ſoever may bee found in the ordinary courſe of
watching, practiſed by the Apoſtles, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
tranſmitted unto their followers, that ſame
priority and ſuperiority in watching may bee law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
uſed now a daies; and therefore if in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
courſe of watching they did extend their
care unto more particular congregations then one,
then I thinke it may be ſafely concluded that ſuch
an extent of care in a priority and ſuperiority of
watching, and conſequently of ruling, may alſo bee
uſed. And let this alſo ſuffice for a further entry
at this time towards the determination of that
which we ſeek for.</p>
            <p>Againe, the ground precedent to this had foure
branches, whereof the laſt concerned the peculiar
duty of perpetuall Rulers, where we obſerved their
charge to conſiſt in watching over the ſoules of
their flocks, by calling them, by leading them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
them, viſiting them, and keeping the keies
of the heavenly ſheepfold, to ſhut out the ſheep, or
let them in, as they ſhould ſee occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:96853:14"/>
From whence I gather this inference, that what
priority and ſuperiority ſoever, any ordinary Rulers
had in the Apoſtles time above others in their
watching over the flocke, by calling, leading, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending,
viſiting and keeping the keyes of the fold,
that now alſo the ſame priority &amp; ſuperiority may
be lawfully exerciſed: and if it can be made appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
that any ordinary rulers had a priority and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
of watching above others which extended
it ſelfe unto more congregations then one, then I
ſuppoſe it may ſafely bee concluded that ſuch a
ſuperior priority of watching may bee lawfully
exrciſed.</p>
            <p>The other concerned the peculiar charge of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>
and <hi>Titus</hi> as they were either Evangeliſts,
or ordinary overſeers, I take them either way and
looke upon that which they had to doe, and ſay
thus: If all the things which they had recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to them be of perpetuall uſe in the Church of
God, then what priority and ſuperiority ſoever they
had over others in their courſe of government for
the adminiſtration of thoſe charges, that ſame may
now alſo be made uſe of, and is requiſite to be in the
Churches of all ages. But all things recommended
to them as I conceive are of perpetuall uſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore the priority and ſuperiority which
they had for the adminiſtration of the ſame
may alſo be made of: for although it be ſaid
that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were no ordinary overſeers
but Evangeliſts that is extraordinary, yet I cannot
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96853:14"/>
conceive them (no more then I doe the Apoſtles
themſelves) to be extraordinary governours of the
Church, in theſe duties which are perpetually to
be diſcharged in time to come; for what reaſon is
there to thinke a man an extraordinary Officer for
diſcharging an ordinary duty? as for the reſt who
are called Prophets, Teachers, Exhorters, Deacons,
Diſtributers, Speakers of tongues, and Interpreters
of tongues; all theſe though ſomething there might
be extraordinary in them, yet ſo farre as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the office is in ſome kinde, or altogether
remaining untill this day in the Church, ſo farre al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
that relation of priority, or poſteriority of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
or inferiority, wherein they ſtood one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
another, or all towards the chiefe ruling
watchmen of the Churches ought to remaine.</p>
            <p>But it may bee thought, that they ſtood under
<hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> as under chiefe watchmen, that
they ſhould be ordered and regulated by them in
their publicke actions, according to Apoſtolicall
rules; therefore it may be thought alſo that all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
having the ſame charge now a dayes, ought to
ſtand in the ſame relation under the like chiefe
watchmen.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, concerning the duties laid upon the
Apoſtles and Deacons heretofore mentioned; if
there bee nothing extraordinary therein for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
but only in reſpect of certaine circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of that time, of their perſons, and of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96853:15"/>
manner of that ſociety wherein they lived at
Jeruſalem; then it may be thought that the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
whereby they ordered all things for the good
of the Church, is not aboliſhed, but regularly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto their ſucceſſors, that in like caſes it may
be made uſe of by the cheefe watchmen over the
Churches: From whence I gather, that what prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and ſuperiority was deferred by the Church in
temporall things, firſt, unto the Apoſtles, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by them reſigned unto the Deacons, may in
like caſes be exerciſed in theſe times. And this may
ſuffice alſo concerning this matter to give yet a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
entry towards the determination of the point
in hand.</p>
            <p>Then the ground next precedent, was the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Officers firſt inſtituted in the Church; from
which I did infer, that if there was no independent
parity, but a ſuperior priority amongſt them, that
then a ſuperior priority was not to bee thought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to Chriſts intention in building up his
Church: which being granted, I now proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to gather this, that if the ſuperior parity was
not ground upon the perſons of the Officers, but
upon the offices committed unto them, which in
ſome reſpect were to be perpetuall in the Church;
then I may inferre, that as the perpetuall offices are
in priority and ſuperiority one above another, ſo the
Officers muſt bee diſtinguiſhed by their degrees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and therefore to finde out the degrees of ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in the Officers, we muſt reflect upon the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96853:15"/>
of the offices as they ſtand in relation one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
And this alſo may ſuffice at this time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a further determination of the point in hand.</p>
            <p>And then the ground that went before this, was
that which concerned the building up of the
Church, from whence as heretofore it hath beene
deſcribed, I inferre this, that ſuch a priority and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
of ſpirituall Officers one above another as
is moſt fit.</p>
            <p>1. To unite all Saints into one perfect man till
they come to the fulneſſe of the ſtature of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. To free them from the divers windes of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and deceit of ſeducers.</p>
            <p>3. To make them able to ſupply ſpirituall gifts
one to another, for their mutuall edification: is that
priority and ſuperiority which Chriſt doth allow
of. If therefore we can obſerve what kinde of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
and ſuperiority is beſt able to work the effects;
or if it bee found that they cannot bee brought to
paſſe, except ſeverall congregations become as one
body under one watching ſuperiority, which may
have an eye unto them all alike, then we ſhall bee
able yet more fully to determine this point in hand.</p>
            <p>And then the firſt ground of all was, that which
deſcribed the ends wherefore Chriſt would have
all beleevers united to one body. From whence
I gather this, that the priority and ſuperiority of
officers in ſpirituall government, which is moſt fit to
make the faith and knowledge of Chriſt apparent
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96853:16"/>
unto the world, to build up the beleevers amongſt
themſelves, to preſerve them from all adverſaries,
and to uphold the credit of Gods Kingdome, is
moſt anſwerable to Chriſts intention; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to know what that priority and ſuperiority is;
the properties which can reach theſe ends muſt bee
found in it, which properties if they be not repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant
but rather conſonant to that inſpection which
one overſeer may have over others in many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations;
then it will follow, that ſuch an inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is not repugnant, but rather conſonant to
Chriſts intention.</p>
            <p>And ſo I thinke I have found matter enough
whereby the nature of that priority and ſuperiority
which is to be defined may be knowne: if we will
meditate now fully upon theſe heads, and diſcuſſe
more diſtinctly the particulars contained under
the ſame, which in due time may be done by Gods
aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Thus I have laid grounds and gathered rules to
reſolve my doubts, firſt, whether yea or no a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
priority be more anſwerable to Chriſts intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then an independent parity in the government
of his Church? Secondly, what that priority and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
is? Now I muſt come to the conſequent
of this ſecond queſtion. viz. How this priority and
ſuperiority ought to be exerciſed towards others,
and to determine this, wee may gather rules from
three grounds which cleere Scripture doth yeeld
unto us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:96853:16"/>
The firſt ground is to be taken from the nature of
the dutie expreſſed in the peculiar name, wherein
the ſingular properties of the charge is denoted.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is to be found in the ſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
given to the chief Watchmen; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to which they were to behave themſelves in
their charge of Superioritie above others.</p>
            <p>The third is to be obſerved, in the examples and
practice of thoſe that commendably and lawfully
exerciſed their authority over others; or in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendable
practice of thoſe that varied from
the Rules.</p>
            <p>To touch theſe things, but in a word at this time;
I obſerve from the chiefe Names, <hi>viz.</hi> of Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
of Ruler, of Watchman, and of Biſhop or
Over-ſeer, that the propertie of Superiority ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
chiefly in the Relation which he that is ſet over
others hath unto the members of the Church, who
in compariſon of him are like a flocke of ſheepe; or
like a Common-wealth, and company of men; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to certain Laws and Conſtitutions, by which
they are to be directed in their joynt courſe and way
of life, and leſt they ſhould fall into ſome danger by
tranſgreſſing the ſame; the inſpection to be had over
them is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to his charg: So that if we take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
what the true eſſential property of a Shepheard
is in his leading ſuperiority, or of a watch-man ſet
in the Tower of a Citie, or of an Overſeer ſet to
look to a family in a houſe, the ſame Priority &amp; Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
may be atributed unto the chiefe officers,
which Chriſt hath appointed for his Church. From
whence againe I inferre, that according as the flock
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96853:17"/>
is ſmall or great, the watchtower high or low in a
big or little Citie; the companie leſſe or more; ſo
the ſuperiority in the charge may be differenced,
and by degrees extended or contracted.</p>
            <p>The name of Steward alſo is attributed unto the
chiefe officer but not unto him alone; yet it imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a power of diſpenſing theſe things which the M.
of the houſe hath appointed to be given unto his
houſhold. Therefore as the things to be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
are different, and either more or leſſe uniuerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to bee adminiſtred, ſo the difference of ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
may be obſerved in the Stewardſhip.</p>
            <p>The name of a husbandman is ſomewhat of an
other kind, for it imployeth a property rather of
painfulneſſe then of power and authority wherein
wee conceive, that according to the entent and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the ſoile, ſo the husbandry muſt be; for as
the ſoile may be larger or leſſer, ſo the Charge in
the husbandry thereof may be differenced.</p>
            <p>In like manner, the name of Builder may be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenced
according to the largeneſſe of the houſe,
and different duties in the building thereof.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the name of Angell is given to the Chief
Officer in a peculiar manner, as denoting a Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of meſſage, wherein he is employed by God
towards others, to declare his will and ſee it execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his Kingdome. For hee is the Ambaſſadour
of God unto his people, and hath the beams of his
authority conferred upon him. Thus then I gather
that all theſe names of Shepherd, Ruler, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
Over-ſeer, Steward, Husbandman, Builder,
and Angell denote cleerly a Superiority of Office
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96853:17"/>
over and towards the perſons unto which they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to diſcharge the ſame; nor doe their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
ſeeme repugnant to a gradation and differencing
of that ſuperiority which their name denoteth. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. A
peculiar manner of diſcharging the dutie commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto the Office-bearers in Chriſts Church, for as
each name hath a ſeverall ſignification, ſo it carieth
with it a peculiar relation which the Office bearer
hath towards the Church, according to which hee
ought to behave himſelf in the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of diſcharging
his dutie. And this will ſuffice to ſhew in generall the
way, how this priority and ſuperiorite ought to bee
exerciſed towards others.</p>
            <p>The more particular determination of this matter
muſt bee taken from the ſpeciall commandements
which are given to this effect, which are many, and
cannot now be inſiſted upon at large. therefore we will
only point at them, in ſhewing the places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
where they maybe found.</p>
            <p>The peculiar duties of a Shepheard, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of performing the ſame, are ſet forth, <hi>John</hi> 10. 1.
till 16. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 2. till 20.</p>
            <p>The Rulers dutie is mentioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 8. and
<hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. and <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 17, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>The Watchmans dutie is mentioned, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 17,
18, 19, 20. 21.</p>
            <p>The Biſhops dutie is largely mentioned in the
Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> throughout, and
chiefly in the places heretofore alleaged concerning
their peculiar charges, and 1 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 5. 12, 13, 14</p>
            <p>The Stewards dutie is mentioned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 52.
&amp; 24. 45. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:96853:18"/>
The Husbandmans and Builders duties are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
together, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
            <p>The Angels duties are mentioned, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. and 3.
Chapters throughout. In all which places I do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that the manner of diſcharging their duties is
chiefly inſiſted upon, as it hath a relation unto the
flock; ſo that their Priority and Superiority is only
in that reſpect, cleerly to be gathered, namely from
the duty which towards the flocke is to bee done:
Therefore perhaps very little will be found tending
to reſolve us of the doubt in hand, namely, how the
Priority and Superiority in Charge which one Over-ſeer
may have above another, is to be exerciſed. Yet
then if there be nothing at all repugnant unto this
Superiour Priority of one Over-ſeer above another
in the diſcharge of the duties here mentioned; then I
ſay I ought to conceive that they may very well ſtand
together: But if on the otherſide any thing here
mentioned in the manner of exerciſing theſe
Charges of Superiority, bee altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with an Independent Paritie of Over-ſeers,
and yet if that which is to bee done muſt bee
perpetually made uſe of in Church Government:
then I ſay it may be ſtrongly inferred, that as for
this reaſon an independent parity is not to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
ſo a ſuperior priority ought to be allowed,
yet always ſo, as it may be a furtheranc to all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of a particular paſtorall charge; and no wayes a
croſſe to the true manner of diſcharging the ſame.
And here I will leave it unto the impartiall conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of thoſe that are juditious, whether or no the
ſpecial commandements given unto <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:96853:18"/>
for the diſcharging of that Priority and Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
wherein they were ſet above other Officers, be
not of perpetuall uſe both in reſpect of the thing to
be done, and in reſpect of the manner of doing the
ſame, as it is recommended unto them; where ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
notice may be taken of that inſpection, which
is deferred unto them, over others, for the repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of falſe Doctrines, for the ordaining of Elders
in ſeverall Churches, for the impoſition of hands,
for the receiving of accuſations againſt Elders, and
for the power of the Keyes: which things ought
ſtill both for matter and manner to be continued as
they were recommended unto <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi>
except ſome ſubſtantiall difference can be ſhewed,
which as yet I cannot ſee.</p>
            <p>The examples of Practice both commendable
and diſcommendable, in reſpect of the lawfull or
unlawfull diſcharge of this duty, may be gathered
from ſuch places of Scripture, wherein the Acts
of Priority and Superiority, and the manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
the ſame are mentioned, I will name ſome
few that come now in my mind.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the practice of the Church, to which Chriſt
doth ſend us in caſes of ſcandall, <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 17.
whoſe authority is eſtabliſhed there, <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the practice of the Apoſtles at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
<hi>Acts</hi> 1. 15. till the end. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. in the
ordination of Deacons. And <hi>Acts</hi> 15. in holding
of the Synod, which determined the controverſie
riſen at <hi>Antiochia.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. in ordaining
Elders.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the practice of <hi>Paul</hi> in the matter of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96853:19"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 3, 4, 5. and in the manner
of exerciſing his power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. throughout. And
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. throughout. And <hi>ibid. Chap. 13. 2. 3. 10.
Item, 1 Theſſ.</hi> 2. 3. till 12. <hi>Item, Acts</hi> 20. 20. 26, 27, 33,
34, 35.</p>
            <p>Theſe are examples of commendable practice:
the examples of practice which is diſcommended
are theſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt of <hi>Diotrephes, 3. John</hi> 9. 10. who loved to
have a preeminencie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, of thoſe that in the laſt times ſhould
be diſobedient unto the truth through preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
who deſpiſing all Superiority ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
in the contradiction of <hi>Core, Judg.</hi> 21. by which
wee perceive that <hi>Core, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> were
types of that diſobedience which will be under the
Goſpell in ſome, who will take upon them to bee
equall, and in nothing inferiour to their lawfull Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the reproof of the Angels of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
for not exerciſing the authority which they
had, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 20.</p>
            <p>Theſe examples being wel examined, I ſuppoſe,
may give us ſome light to ſhew the manner how
the Superiour Priority which ſome have over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the Church ought to be put in practice.</p>
            <p>Thus having laid the grounds, and gathered
ſome inferences, whereby to regulate my thoughts
in this doubtfull matter. I thinke I may come to
the application of the ſame unto the Controverſie
at this time debated, to ſee by what meanes a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
thereof may bee found. And here I muſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96853:19"/>
conſider the circumſtances and properties of that
Authority which is now queſtioned, whether it be
lawfull or no? But when I intend to doe this, I
meet with a difficulty incident to all great diſputes,
which are commonly involved in a multiplicity of
particulars and variety of circumſtances; confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
debated, and partially related by oppoſite
parties, where every one ſeeketh his owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
ſo that it is very hard to ſtate the caſe
truly, according to the circumſtances, vvhich are
moſt materially therein to be conſidered, that the
Rules may be applied unto the fundamentall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of doubt, vvhich ought to be decided.</p>
            <p>Yet if I muſt be impartiall to cleare mine owne
and other mens ſcruples, I ought to ſtate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo, as both ſides may agree to have the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
Rules applied thereunto; And to doe this, I
conceive, it is beſt to proceed from that vvhich is
generall, till by degrees I come to that very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
wherein the controverſie and contradiction
of parties is moſt apparant. To which effect, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
firſt upon this generall aſſertion: Namely,
that there be ſome Eccleſiaſtical Over-ſeers, which
have a Priority and Superiority of government
above others in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> to which,
as it is, out of all doubt, that it is ſo in <hi>England,</hi> ſo in
the generall notion my former Rules are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant;
but rather agreeable, that it may be ſo.</p>
            <p>Then in the next place, I ſay, that this Priority
and Superiority given to ſome in the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> is in the purpoſe of the Law, by which it
is publiquely authorized; no more, but a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96853:20"/>
and Priority of watching over others for
the good of the Society. And this, I ſuppoſe, as it
is granted by both ſides to be true; ſo I think that
it is not repugnant to my former Rules.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I comceive that this watching Priority
and Superiority intended by the Law, is appointed
to be for this particular good of the Society; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the Flocks committed to every Over-ſeers
Charge, ſhould be called and led on in the way of
Godlineſſe, through the publick profeſſion of Gods
true worſhip, ſo as it may become moſt lawfully
conſpicuous unto the world. And to this effect,
the Over-ſeers are authorized to ſee, that the flock
be provided with fit Teachers, Paſtors, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
by lawfull election and ordination through
impoſition of hands, that it ſhould bee ſetled in a
courſe of publick prayers and ordinances, befitting
the adminiſtration of Chriſtian Religion; that it
ſhould be preferred from falſe Doctrines &amp; raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Wolves: That it ſhould not want a ſpirituall
Judicature, as well in matters of accuſation againſt
Elders, as in matters of ſcandall and offence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
member and member; and that in it the
power of the keyes, to ſhut open the Kingdom
of heaven, as occaſion ſhould require might not be
wanting; and that ſuch maintenance as is due unto
theſe that labour in the Word and Doctrine, and
neceſſary for the poore, the vvidow, and the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
may be provided for them. Thoſe I take to
be the true ends, for which the ſuperiour Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the Church of <hi>England</hi> are appointed by the
Church and State, to have inſpection over other
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96853:20"/>
Watchmen of an inferiour degree.</p>
            <p>And that ſuch Superiority in vvatching may be
exerciſed, I take it as granted from my former
ground and Rules.</p>
            <p>So then I finde no difficulty in the thing it ſelfe;
nor doe I thinke that any doth oppoſe a Superiour
Priority of Governours in this reſpect. But if any
doe, then I conceive they are bound to ſhew, that
in ſuch things no Priority or Superiority in watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſome few over many, may lawfully be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
in the Church of God; but that every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Officer in all theſe things is independent,
and may doe herein by himſelfe, whatſoever hee
ſhall think good, without all relation or ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
unto any, whom the Church doth appoint
over ſuch buſineſſes.</p>
            <p>Therefore from the thing appointed, and the
end wherefore it is appointed in this Church; I
come to the manner of appointing it: and here I
enquire whether this Priority, and Superiority in
government, hath not beene appointed by thoſe
who have authority to do it, that is, by the Church
it ſelfe (here I meane by the Church, the body ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
repreſentative or collective) according to the
precepts of the Apoſtles, and the moſt laudable
examples of primitive times? If yea, then I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
no exception ought to be taken at it; but if no,
then I think that the irregularity of the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ought onely to be excepted againſt and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
and the Office it ſelfe neither condemned
nor rejected but maintained.</p>
            <p>Now what the Apoſtolicall Precepts were, or
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96853:21"/>
whether or no there were any at all ever given for
the manner of appointing ſuch Officers in the
Churches, I doe not know becauſe I finde nothing
in Scripture more then I have intimated already;
which is, that ſuch Superiour Officers, are neither
repugnant to Chriſts intention, nor to the Rules and
formes of Government expreſly delivered unto us
in Scripture; but how they to be appointed (that
is to ſay) what manner of proceeding ought to be
uſed for their Election, calling and inſtitution in
their Superiour Charge) I find nothing in Scripture
that I can call to minde, except I will repreſent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
types unto my ſelfe, from which I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
gather no more but the ſhadowes of inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Therefore in this caſe, I ſuppoſe, I muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
my ſelfe unto my next generall ground of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
which is the laudable practice of primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
times, to ſee what hath beene done in like ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
by thoſe, whom wee eſteeme to have been moſt
rationall in the ways of true government, and moſt
likely to have ſeene and knowne the Apoſtolicall
Practice if there was ever any in this kind, different
from the ordinary way of appointing other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
in the Church. But if it be more likely that
the manner of appointing ſuch Superiour Officers
was rather not different in ſubſtance then different
from the ordinary way of calling and inſtalling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Officers; then perhaps it will not be amiſſe to
reflect upon the moſt immediate followers of the
Apoſtles, ſo as to take notice of their practice both
in reſpect of the thing it ſelfe, <hi>viz.</hi> that they had
ſuch Superiour Officers; and of the manner of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96853:21"/>
them as it was moſt anſwerable unto the
ordinary Inſtitution. And this I will rather doe
from other mens Obſervations, then from mine
owne.</p>
            <p>I find then that Doctour <hi>Reynolds</hi> in his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with <hi>Hart,</hi> Chapter 8. in the end of the third
Diviſion, and the beginning of the fifth doth well
obſerve; when as Elders were ordained by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
in ſeverall Churches, that in proceſſe of
time they did uſe to aſſemble themſelves, to the
end that things belonging to mutuall and common
edification, might be done by mutuall &amp; common
counſell and conſent. In theſe meetings they did
things orderly, and followed the examples of their
predeceſſours in like occaſions, to chuſe one who
was to be of their company, and Moderatour of
their actions.</p>
            <p>So amongſt the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem, James, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and <hi>John,</hi> are called the Pillars, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 9. and in
the meeting, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. the matter was concluded at
the determination of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus alſo in after times although there might be
many Elders and Paſtors in one Church, as at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,
Acts</hi> 20. 17. yet it may be gathered from
<hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 1. that there was one Chiefe in that
Church, whom Chriſt calleth the Angell thereof,
and directeth that to him which the reſt were to
know by his meanes. Hee was afterward from the
Priority and Superiority of his Office by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
called a Biſhop; For it is apparant, that in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
times there was one who had the Preſident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
amongſt the Elders.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:96853:22"/>
This Doctour <hi>Reynolds</hi> in the forenamed gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
from <hi>Cyprian, Epiſt. 6. &amp; 13. Prebyteris &amp; Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conis.</hi>
From <hi>Euſebius Hiſtor. Eccleſ. l. 6. c.</hi> 42. and from
<hi>Cornelius</hi> letter to <hi>Cyprian Epiſt. 46. apud Cyprian.</hi>
which Doctor <hi>Vſher</hi> alſo hath made more cleere by
ſome obſervations taken from <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epiſtle
to the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> written but twelve
yeeres after the writing of the Revelation of Saint
<hi>John,</hi> and from <hi>Tertullian</hi> who flouriſhed about a
hundred yeares after <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and from <hi>Leontius</hi> of
<hi>Magneſia,</hi> who at the Generall Councell of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
teſtifieth that from <hi>Timothy</hi> until that time, there
had been at <hi>Epheſus</hi> a continued ſucceſſion of ſeven
and twenty Biſhops, which Biſhops (no doubt) were
none elſe but the Preſidents of the <hi>Epheſine</hi> Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery.</p>
            <p>Theſe witneſſes being next to the firſt times, and
worthy of credit ſeem to make the matter of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive,
and (for ought that I ſee can be excepted)
of Apoſtolicall practice alſo, out of doubt. And if
this Prioritie and Superioritie was ſuch, and was in
this manner, received and deferred to one above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
I conjecture, that it was by imitation of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall
practice thus deferred and received, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I find nothing therein repugnant, but every
thing rather, and every way conſonant to Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Rules, ſo that unto this Biſhop as Preſident of
the Presbytery all the power belonging to the or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinary
Rulers did primely belong, which hee by
conſent of the reſt did exerciſe, or the reſt by
him did put to execution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:96853:22"/>
And this I conceiue was the practice of the Apoſtles
themſelves in their courſe of ordinary government, as
may be gathered, from <hi>Acts,</hi> 3. 15. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. This in
my apprehenſion is alſo moſt anſwerable to the rules
of perpetual government given unto <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi>
and this is every way conſonant to the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of officers in the Church to the means of building
up the Church &amp; to the intention of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in uniting
all believers into one body, and therefore may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſcruple be believed to have beene the practice
of the firſt primitive and incorrupt times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
granted as I think it ſhould, then I ought not to
make any more doubt of the matter; chiefely if
from that time to this day; and now alſo at this
time, in all the Chriſtian and proteſtant Churches
except onely thoſe that are in feare of danger by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the abuſe of this authority, or are under the
croſſe of a ſuperſtitious State-government) either the
undoubted footeſteps or the manifeſt uſe of ſuch a
Priority and Superiority hath beene in all ages and
places and ſtill is in ſome meaſure to be found which
if I perceive ſo to bee, as truly I doe; then I judge
that my minde ſhould fully bee at reſt, and trouble
it ſelfe no more about this matter. Thus I have ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
moſt of mine owne doubts ſo farre as I conceive
them to bee common both to the ſimple and more
learned. There be ſome other Scruples more proper
to thoſe that dive deeper into matters, which I know
not if it be fit to propoſe to every one leaſt in ſtead
of taking away ordinary, wee may ordinary, wee
might raiſe extraordinary ſcruples; therefore till I
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96853:23"/>
be better reſolved, what ought to bee done in this,
and perceive how farre this way of deciding matters
doth give ſatisfaction unto divided Judgements. I
thinke it will not be amiſſe to ſurceaſe. In the mean
time ſuch as are ſpirituall, ought to exhort all ſides
not to cenſure one another, with rigour, nor to doe
things with paſſion and raſhly, or to judge of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
according to the outward appearance, but to
judge righteous judgement which may bee done if
they will ſtudy to ſeperate in theſe particular courſes
and different opinions of moſt men, the precious
from the vile, and apply themſelves rather to heale
then to exaſperate ſores, rather to build up then to
pull downe. The Lord give us all underſtanding
that keeping the foundation aſwell in knowledge as
in practice we may through Charity build thereon,
not hay and ſtubble, but Gold, Silver and, precious
ſtones, yet when wee ſhall be carefull, firſt to keepe
our ſelves without blame in the midſt of this fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
generation, wee may then alſo be able to hold
forth unto al the word of life; &amp; making a difference
have compaſſion of ſome and ſave others with feare
as pulling them out of this fire of endleſſe ſtrife and
contention. Now the Lord enable us to doe this in
the Spirit of lenity, with godly Zeale to his Glory,
<hi>Amen.</hi>
