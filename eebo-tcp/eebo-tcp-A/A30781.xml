            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Truly Worthy Sir <hi>THOMAS COOKE</hi> K<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Alderman, and Sheriff of the Most Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous City of</hi> LONDON.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough a Stranger to your Person, 'tis impossible to be so to your Virtues; for General Fame (that is so often call'd a Lyar, and seldom takes pains to Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon Good Deeds, but on the cóntrary is most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious to expose the Bad) has taken an unusual and peculiar Care to Justify your Reputation; And the united consent of all Mankind concur, that in your Character she has spoke Truth, and what is as commendable, no more than the Truth.</p>
            <p>Your Generous Charity in many considerable Extremities, has sufficiently demonstrated, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Ancient Spirit of an <hi>English</hi> Man, but the more glorious Principle of a Christian. Charity the eldest Favourite of God, the first in Honour, and the last in Love, seems to be declared the Heir of all your Fortunes: It is your Private Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, your Secret Ambition, the Care of your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, and I cannot help saying, the Blessing that attends 'em.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50766:3"/>Your Noble Commiseration on the Deplorable Condition of many a wretched Soul in the Hard Frost must be remembred, when Corn and Goals were above their reach, and, indeed, so dear, that it would have been counted Impudence, in the greatest necessity, to have begg'd 'em; You, like a second <hi>Ioseph,</hi> in the Famine, reliev'd their wants, and gave 'em Fire to warm the Hearts you fed.</p>
            <p>Your most Commendable Bounty to the distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Irish</hi> Protestants must be remembred, for you were their greatest Benefactor, and the First. Such Publick Benevolence ought not to be conceal'd, tho' 'tis your desire; for you would be as well pleas'd to have it not known, as you are satisfied when you bestow it: But I say again, it ought to be Publish'd out of the hopes that the knowledge of such Goodness may rouze the sleeping hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our Land, that it may take place of Board Wages, which has scandalously shut up those Doors our Grandfathers always kept open for the Poor.</p>
            <p>It is not to be expected that my Pen should set forth your Praise as the merit of it deserves, but as the famous Sir <hi>Godfrey Kneller,</hi> in a Choice Picture will strike the Eye of the Beholder (tho' a Stranger to the Original) and tell him, some where or other he has seen that Face, tho' he cannot immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect the Person: So I will endeavour by the bold touches of Truth, to let the World know they have heard of the Man, tho' they cannot at the instant apply the Character to his Name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50766:3"/>So Famous a Citizen has not in many Ages fill'd the Walls of <hi>London;</hi> your Generosity is the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it, your Conduct and Affability the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of it; And you are one of the chiefest Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the support of its Trade.</p>
            <p>'Tis probable that the World may admire at a Dedication of this Nature to Sir <hi>Thomas Cooke,</hi> since the Custom of Poets has been to Address their Plays to the Nobility, either by the way of Thanks, for Patronizing their Works before they were made publick; or else in a Panegyrick on their Families: But I declare, neither of these are the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of this Epistle; but that it proceeds from a real respect I have to your great Character, and a desire of being the first that should Publish it to the World.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> whose Courage and Country once excell'd all others, were ever proudest of their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, and not without good Reason; for indeed they are the support of all Governments: And as they are the first to be Tryed, so they are the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to be Esteem'd, the most to be Encouraged, and the last to be Injured. <hi>Anthony</hi> reckon'd he had as good as Conquer'd <hi>Brutus,</hi> when his Oration had overthrown his Interest with the Citizens. That ours may always Flourish, and never want such Virtues as yours to advance their Prosperity, shall be the constant and fervant wish,</p>

            <lg>
               <l>IN this grave Age, improv'd by States-mens Art,</l>
               <l>Who e'er can think you'll like a Misses Part?</l>
               <l>Time was, when <hi>Rosamond</hi> might shine at Court;</l>
               <l>These are no days for Ladies of that sort.</l>
               <l>How strangely Time does Human Things decay!</l>
               <l>Four Cent'ries past, as ancient Writers say,</l>
               <l>She that we represent bore mighty sway:</l>
               <l>Her Beauty wondred at, her Wit extoll'd,</l>
               <l>Her yellow Locks were call'd too <hi>Threads of Gold.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But <hi>now</hi> should that Complexion use the Trade,</l>
               <l>Each puny Fop the Town has newly made,</l>
               <l>Would cry, <hi>Confound the Carrot-pated Jade.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Misses in times of War and Ieopardy,</l>
               <l>Like Armourers in days of Peace must be;</l>
               <l>His Swords and Helmets rust, and so will She.</l>
               <l>What sort of Criticks then must I endear</l>
               <l>To favour this abandon'd Character?</l>
               <l>The <hi>French</hi> fatigue too much, to mind <hi>Amour;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Th'<hi>Italian</hi>'s Bigotted; The <hi>Spaniard</hi> Poor;</l>
               <l>The <hi>Clumsie Lover,</hi> with his <hi>Northern Sense,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Would have the <hi>Yo-Frows,</hi> but would spare the <hi>Pence:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Rav'nous of Beauty; But when Purse should open,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Myn Heer</hi> is either deaf, or Drunk-aslopen.</l>
               <l>Thus all o'er <hi>Europe,</hi> as the Scenes are laid,</l>
               <l>War and Religion have quite spoil'd Love's Trade.</l>
               <l>Since then from Courts her Part must hope no pity,</l>
               <l>I'll try ths <hi>English Lovers</hi> of the City;</l>
               <l>Kind Souls, who many a Night o'er Toast and Ale,</l>
               <l>Have wept at reading <hi>Rosamond</hi>'s fam'd Tale,</l>
               <l>And will, we hope for Beauties sake, to day</l>
               <l>Confront the Wits, and save a harmless Play.</l>
               <l>So may you thrive, your Wagers all be won;</l>
               <l>So may your Wise Stock-jobbing Crimp go on;</l>

               <l>THus you the sad Catastrophe have seen,</l>
               <l>Occasion'd by a Mistress and a Queen.</l>
               <l>Queen <hi>Eleanor</hi> the Proud was <hi>French,</hi> they say;</l>
               <l>But <hi>English</hi> Manufacture got the Day:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Jane Clifford</hi> was her Name, as Books aver,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Fair Rosamond</hi> was but her <hi>Nom de Guerre.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Now tell me, Gallants, wou'd you lead your Life</l>
               <l>With such a Mistress, or with such a Wife?</l>
               <l>If One must be your Choice, which d'ye approve,</l>
               <l>The Curtain-Lecture, or the Curtain-Love?</l>
               <l>Wou'd ye be Godly with perpetual Strife,</l>
               <l>Still drudging on with homely <hi>Joan</hi> your Wife;</l>
               <l>Or take your Pleasure in a wicked way,</l>
               <l>Like honest Whoring <hi>Harry</hi> in the Play?</l>
               <l>I guess your minds: The Mistress wou'd be taking,</l>
               <l>And nauseous Matrimony sent a packing.</l>
               <l>The Devil's in ye all; Mankind's a Rogue,</l>
               <l>You love the Bride, but you detest the Clog:</l>
               <l>After a Year, poor Spouse is left i'th' lurch;</l>
               <l>And you, like <hi>Haynes,</hi> return to Mother-Church.</l>
               <l>Or, if the name of Church comes cross your mind,</l>
               <l>Chappels of Ease behind our Scenes you find:</l>
               <l>The Play-house is a kind of Market-place;</l>
               <l>One chaffers for a Voice, another for a Face.</l>
               <l>Nay, some of you, I dare not say how many,</l>
               <l>Would buy of me a Pen'worth for your Peny.</l>
               <l>Ev'n this poor Face (which with my Fan I hide)</l>
               <l>Would make a shift my Portion to provide,</l>

               <p>Who the Devil put it into his Lordship's head to employ me in State affairs? I shall marr all, for want of a Memory; and he might as well have attempted to make a Sieve hold Water, as trusted me with his Councils: It is certain I was never cut out for a Politician. This Reverend Abbot has engag'd me in a fine bus'ness. When <hi>Rosamond</hi> told me in Confession of the King's Address to her, and I acquainted his Lordship with it, he oblig'd me to persuade her she ought not to resist the Importunities of her Prince, lest her Obstinacy should occasion his Death, and Royal Murther was a dreadful thing: But what's the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his making me tell the Queen of it? He says 'tis to revenge our Patron <hi>Becket:</hi> I know not what it may come to; he has promis'd me Preferment, and my Conscience must submit to my Ambition.—Oh she's here.—How shall I deliver my self?—I'm a cursed Orator.—I'll put some hard words together, which will sound like Rhetorick, and that may pass for Learning if she understands 'em not.—Hail, Sacred Majesty.</p>
