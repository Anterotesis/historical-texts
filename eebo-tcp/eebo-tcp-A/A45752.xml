            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE troubles of</hi> Europe <hi>proceed origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from two cauſes: the one is the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of a Spirituall, the other of a Temporall Monarchy. That is the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, this is, or hath been, the Spaniſh, and may be from henceforth, the French ambition. The Pope doth labour to uphold his tottering Hierarchy, and to regaine the power which hee had over the conſciences of all Men, before it was cried downe as Antichriſtian by Proteſtancie. The Houſe of Spaine did labour to erect a new State in</hi> Europe, <hi>under the pretence of upholding and propagating the Catholicke Religion againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, till the French and Bavarians have pulled down his old one. Theſe two, and their pretenſions have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the affections of all men, either in reſpect of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or of civill intereſts. Each hath his owne way; but that of the Pope is moſt conſiderable, becauſe it is without reſiſtance, and hath aſsiſtance of both the others, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as each of the other pretenders to the Monarchy of State, doth oppoſe his Fellow. The Popes way to preſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to regaine the power which he had loſt, is to work the overthrow of the Proteſtant Religion, and to trouble the States wherein that Religion is planted. To do this,
<pb facs="tcp:54187:3"/>
hee maketh uſe of two advantages which hee hath above proteſtants; the one is Civill, the other Eccleſiaſticall. The Civill is, that he is able to ſet all the Popiſts <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces, and their chiefe Counſellors aworke, to intend joyntly the ſame thing againſt Proteſtants, as well in generall to oppoſe them, as in particular to weaken them in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme and power. As for example, he hath moved them all to contribute to a league againſt them, to diveſt them every where of all dignities; and particularly to weaken their voyces in the Electorall Colledge. And to effect theſe and ſuch like things, he can infuſe into their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels all the Maximes of ſtate, which are oppoſite to the faith and fundamentall grounds of the liberties of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in the publicke profeſsion of their Religion, and to perſwade the uſe of theſe Maximes, hee findeth out meanes to make every one apprehend hopes of advantage for himſelfe by the ruine of Proteſtants. For he knoweth, that it is not ſo much zeale for Religion, as intereſts, which moveth States. The Eccleſiaſticall advantage is the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer which he hath to breed and ſend forth Emiſsaries to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the common ſort of Proteſtants, and to ſet treaties on foot towards the more learned, ſuch as are moſt for his owne advantage. The Emiſsaries are bred in his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, of ſeverall Nations, but eſpcioally in his Colledge</hi> de propaganda fide, <hi>which is founded to undermine the ſtates of Proteſtants, by ſowing or fomenting the ſeeds of diviſion amongſt them. And to this effect alſo, the more learned of his Clergie are imployed to treat with the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Proteſtants for an agreement, which may bee patched up with ſome, or with all Proteſtants, by meere authority of Superiours, upon generall termes, and in outward ſuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

Now his great advantage to work out all his plots irreſiſtably is this, that amongſt the ſeverall Bodies of Proteſtants, there is none that taketh the matter of their common intereſt and preſervation to heart, to labour to diſa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>point his plots by meanes oppoſite to his deſignes, therefore it is certaine, that ſo long as Proteſtants have no ſuch aime to maintaine joyntly the common intereſt of Religion and Liberties, but are divided in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, that in humane appearance their ſtates muſt be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; in the end overthrowne; but if a joynt purpoſe could be wrought amongſt them for their common ſafety, and a good Correſpondencie ſetled in their Churches and States, to proſecute the meanes thereof, towards all thoſe whom it doth concerne, there is no doubt but hee would loſe his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and the Conſent of proteſtants to maintaine the light of the truth, and the liberty of the Goſpel, would fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his overthrow. Now to ſet this Correſpondencie in a joynt intention a foot amongſt Proteſtants, none have ſo great cauſe as the ſtate of great Britaine, and the preſent Parliaement of England, againſt which all the Popiſh Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of</hi> Europe <hi>is bent to hinder by all poſsible meanes, the Reformation now begun in that Iſland, therefore it will be altogether neceſſary, for the ſaid Parliament to move all other Proteſtants to joyne with them for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Proteſtant Cauſe againſt Popery. This cannot
<pb facs="tcp:54187:4"/>
be done otherwiſe, but by the meanes of a good Correſpondencie, which may be firſt begun with the State and Church of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and then joyntly with them proſecuted towards forraigne Protestants: And to this effect fit inſtruments ſhould bee cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and made uſe of theſe ſhould bee joyned in a Committee or standing Counſell at home to attend the work of a publick Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency with forrainners, and to unite them in the proſecuting of their true interests and common quarrell againſt Papiſts. And to this end they ſhould ta<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e the Palatine cauſe in hand, to make that Houſe (whoſe intereſt and right is greateſt among forraigne Proteſtants) conſiderable; and to aſsist it in recovering the right thereof, which it hath loſt in defence of the Protestant liberties in Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the way to make that Houſe conſiderable and by it to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold amongſt forrainners the Proteſtant cauſe, is to aſsiſt the Prince Elector firſt with Counſell and then with Strength. To aſsiſt him with Counſell, they ſhould joyne to him ſome of their owne Counſellors, to help him to manage the worke of a publick Correſpondencie with Proteſtants in their name; and they ſhould furniſh him with meanes of ſupport requiſite to maintaine other Councellors and Agents fit to negotiate in his owne name, his owne cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to keep afoot the publicke interest with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of Germany, and neighbouring States.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To aſsiſt him with Strength, by <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>ſecuting of this Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie with forraigne States, they ſhould make a League for him, and when their troubles ſhould be ſet led, joyne with others their forces to re-eſtabliſh him in his lands and dignities, to uphold in the ſame the Common Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this ground-work of Counſell whereof in reſpect of forrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners chiefly in Germany, the Prince Elector could bee made the head, be not first laid, it is ſure that no Army nor treaty with Auſtria will ever prevaile to ſettle matters. But if ſuch a Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation be (as it eaſily can bee, even in the midst of theſe troubles in England) ſet afoot, and thereby all thoſe that have a reall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
<pb facs="tcp:54187:4"/>
in the welfare of Proteſtants, made to concurre Counſels with great Britaine, and the Palatiue Houſe in Germany then it is not to be doubted but that with the ſupply of ſmall forces from England and Scotland, the Cauſe and Rights of all Proteſtants in the inereſt of that Houſe, may be gained; and the whole Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and Spaniſh power as well in the Empire, as elſwhere, irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſistably overthrowne. Perhaps the Auſtrian power in Germany may be moved to bend their Counſels for the true? Palatine Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itor againſt the Bavarian and French Deſigne, to keep up a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant party, that in ballancing the one by the other, it may ſtand. But as for the French, it is certain, that they in all things, and chifly in zeale for the Papall intereſts, doth emulate the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh power, and is no leſſe active; and as now matters are brought about, more powerfull to advance the ſame, then Spain is: and therefore in the aime of a Common Correſpondencie amongst Proteſtants, must be as much looked into, or more, then any other State.</p>
