            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <lg>
               <l>IN this word [MONEY] more is comprehended</l>
               <l>Than ever Tongue declar'd, or Pea commended:</l>
               <l>It governs all the Land, circles the Sea,</l>
               <l>And is the Worldling's <hi>Primum Mobile.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Money hath ſuch an influence on Men,</l>
               <l>It ſets up Kings, and plucks'em down again.</l>
               <l>Money! it is the Crown of all Events;</l>
               <l>It doth compound for all Impediments;</l>
               <l>It is a Spell that doth all Spirits raiſe;</l>
               <l>Honour, Health, Power, Pleaſure, Profit, Praiſe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <label>Quaery.</label> But will it buy Content? or can it cure</l>
               <l>A cancerous Conſcience? <hi>(Anſw.)</hi> Nothing hits more ſure.</l>
               <l>For you ſhall read in many a <hi>Roman</hi> Story,</l>
               <l>Money can free the Soul from Purgatory:</l>
               <l>It makes the Pope Infallible to be;</l>
               <l>Becauſe'tis more infallible than he.</l>
               <l>For Money, Men are int' all hazzards hurld,</l>
               <l>'Tis the adored Idol of the World.</l>
               <l>Though one Sect damn another, yet, in fine,</l>
               <l>They'r all Devota's at <hi>Pecunia</hi>'s Shrine:</l>
               <l>Albeit in Arguments they rant and tear,</l>
               <l>Plot and Confound, They'r all of one Mind there.</l>
               <l>The ſimple-ſeeming <hi>Quaker</hi> that will ſhun-ye</l>
               <l>In points of holineſs, will take thy Money.</l>
               <l>The Scripture Pedlers that do prate and cant,</l>
               <l>And cry the Laurd, Money's the meaning on't:</l>
               <l>Amongſt ſome Sects which different Tenents hold,</l>
               <l>The Goſpel is but a new name for Gold;</l>
               <l>And ſacred Offices are often ſold</l>
               <l>For Secular Silver. As, in dayes of old,</l>
               <l>All plenty was compriz'd in Milk and Honey;</l>
               <l>So in theſe dayes all merit lies in Money.</l>
               <l>It is and doth all things in every Cauſe;</l>
               <l>It gives new meanings unto old made Laws.</l>
               <l>Nothing but Money can do and undo:</l>
               <l>'Tis <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> and <hi>Moderator</hi> too.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If this thing Money were not all in all,</l>
               <l>How could the Sciences be Liberal?</l>
               <l>It doth maintain the Court, the Camp, the School;</l>
               <l>The greateſt Politician's but a Fool,</l>
               <l>If he want Money: 'tis ſo bright, ſo ſunny,</l>
               <l>That Men ſell Houſes, Lands, and Towns, for Money.</l>
               <l>Down Kirk, down State, down every thing muſt fall,</l>
               <l>Rather than want Intereſt and Principal.</l>
               <l>Money doth comprehend Lawyers and Laws;</l>
               <l>It is a Chancellor in every Cauſe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> are the Bounds of Right;</l>
               <l>Yet for all this <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> fight:</l>
               <l>Though <hi>Meum</hi> have the Milk, <hi>Tuum</hi> the Honey;</l>
               <l>Yet <hi>Tuum</hi> will fall out for <hi>Meum</hi>'s Money.</l>
               <l>It rules both Right and Wrong. What makes this ſtir</l>
               <l>Betwixt the <hi>French, Dutch,</hi> and the Emperor,</l>
               <l>But Money, or what Money doth bring forth,</l>
               <l>Navyes and Nations? 'Tis all Money's worth:</l>
               <l>Money is Sovereign of Sea and Shore;</l>
               <l>It doth at once, both make and heal the Sore;</l>
               <l>It bids defiance to all ſhapes of Slaughter</l>
               <l>At Sea, it makes Men run through Fire and Water,</l>
               <l>Soar to the Sun, and ſink to the Sea's center,</l>
               <l>Dare Death in all his glories, ſo the venter</l>
               <l>Doth produce Money, though but one ſmall ray;</l>
               <l>A Souldier will do this for a Month's pay.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When Money her allicient look extends,</l>
               <l>Some Men will truck for Fathers, Brothers, Friends,</l>
               <l>Which makes me pray, the King may keep his hold:</l>
               <l>His Father was the price of Gadly Gold;</l>
               <l>And His King too, though of celeſtial birth:</l>
               <l>'Twas Money bought the King of Heaven and Earth;</l>
               <l>And that ſame fatal Money made the Elf,</l>
               <l>That treacherous Treaſurer, to ſell himſelf</l>
               <l>Eternally, where Money's influence</l>
               <l>Is of no power to buy him back from thence.</l>
               <l>Money doth all things elſe; 'twere, of the two,</l>
               <l>Shorter to ſay what Money cannot do,</l>
               <l>Than what it can; our Priviledges, Laws,</l>
               <l>Religion, Reformation, Good old Cauſe,</l>
               <l>Are all but words for Money; It doth teach</l>
               <l>The Courtier how to Flatter, Prieſts to Preach,</l>
               <l>Souldier to Swear, and Citizen to Lye,</l>
               <l>And is the vital Blood of Soveraignty.</l>
               <l>It makes the Aged Young, the Crooked Streight,</l>
               <l>The Dwarf a Giant, The Fool Fortunate.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To cloſe up all, (for I but brieſly ſhew 'em)</l>
               <l>It is fitter for a Volume than a Poem.</l>
               <l>I'le leave this Theme to thoſe that better know it,</l>
               <l>Money's too great a ſtranger to a Poet.</l>
