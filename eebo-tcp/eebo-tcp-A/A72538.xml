         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I heard the Lord ſpeaking from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,

            <p>Now, what it is that ſhall come, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> not ſtay, is the ſubject of my ſpeech,
and the diviſion of my Text. There
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſhall come ſignes and wonders in
the latter dayes to provoke our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
there ſhall come faith and
confidence to all the godly, to aſſure
them of deliverance, and to this end
are wonders wrought, as in heauen

that the dampe of our ſinnes might

whoſe preſence wee may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

ſay nothing, yet ſhall the ſenſeleſſe
creatures grieue and grone after a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,
I ſay deliverance from the
bondage of corruption, wherin they
are, and from the dampe of ſinne,
wherewithall they are peſtered. Of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
theſe in order as God will. And firſt

prayer, aſſuring vs of deliverance,
when feare and fire ſhall fine vs for
our good; for it ſhall bee, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhall call vpon the name of
the Lord ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>What may be the meaning of the
ſpirit in this place, touching the
time and manner of theſe ſignes,
when, and how they ſhould appeare
to the worlds wonder, divers haue
diuerſly divined: 1. Some ſay the
accompliſhment ſhould bee at the
ſecond comming of Chriſt to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and bee harbingers of that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150667:6"/>
dreadfull day: 2. Others, for it
ſhall bee at the ſiedge and ſacking
of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> by <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Veſpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus:</hi>
of which opinion the Greeke
Paraphraſe is, which citeth <hi>Ioſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
writing thereof: 3. Some ſay,
the accompliſhment ſhould bee at
the death of Chriſt, and in the
day of his paſſion, when all the
world ſhould bee paſſionate for
him, but not with him, for hee muſt
tread the wine-preſſe alone. Laſtly,
and the leaſt in reputation of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are the Iews, who euen at this
day vnderſtand it to bee meant of the
warres of the Iſraelites, with <hi>Gog</hi> and
<hi>Magog, Ezechiel,</hi> 38. 39.</p>
            <p>But that I ſeeme not more opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue
then orthodoxall, I may
ſafely ſay with the precedent words
of my Text, that theſe ſhall bee
accompliſhed in the latter dayes,
which are alwayes taken for the
dayes of Chriſt, when with the
effuſion of his bloud hee will pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
out the abundance of his ſpirite
vpon all fleſh, and withall ſhew his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150667:6"/>
wonders from time to time to a

comming in grace, to the laſt day
of his appearance in glory, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
ſhall appeare, more or leſſe,
to the comfort of the godly, and
confuſion of the wicked.</p>
            <p>And ſurely, it is reſpectiue to ſee,
how ſparing the Lord is of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and how plentifull in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
his bloud and ſpirit are powred
out in al abundance, his ſigns &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies
are but ſparingly ſhewed, and

depth of mercy! ſignes but ſhewed,
and prodigies but pointed at, limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
both feare and fire that it fall
not vpon vs before we repent, there
was never mercy either met it on
earth, or matched it in heaven, and
therefore I know not whether I ſhal

of the Lords preſence to fight their

it more diſaſterous to faile of ſignes

               <hi>Are not all things as they were in the
beginning:</hi> ſo ſaide a ſecure world in
the dayes of <hi>Peter,</hi> muſicke, mirth,

velvet, ſilke and ſables were on their
backes, their coffers were full of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
gold and pearle, their diſhes
were filled with dainties, their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
with graine, their ſtawles with
fatlings, and their Orchards with all
manner of fruit, their gardens and
fields diaperde with all variety of
fruites, they felt neither ſinne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
nor ſorrow without, no wonders
in heaven aboue, or tokens in the
earth beneath, bloud and fire, and the
vapour of ſmoake were vnneath
ſeene, and therefore no marvell if
they <hi>put farre away the evill day,</hi> and
ſuncke in their ſecurity.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Iſrael</hi> was full, then ſhee
kicked againſt the Lord, and her ſin
increaſed as the ſignes decreaſed, til
tokens from the Lord had taught
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150667:8"/>
her another diſcipline, the vapour of
ſmoake blaſted her garland, when it
was at the greeneſt, famine, ſword, &amp;
fiery Serpents, brake her heart to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

vpon their repentance.</p>
            <p>VVe thinke it goeth well with vs,
when our waters keepe the courſe
of their wonted Channels without

when neither Sunne nor Moon
laboureth of an Eclipſe, we deeme
the day bleſſed, when the ayre is
pure, and the windes are ſtill, when
the ſeas are calme, and no thunder
breaketh the cloudes; yet better it
were if thunder-clappes from aboue
did breake our hearts, and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
below plowed them vp for a

harueſt, when the Lord ſhall come
in the cloudes, with his fanne in the

heaven, and the chaffe for hell.</p>

            <p>To tel of the prodigies that fell out

if approued hyſtories may ſpeake, &amp;
Chronacles of elder times, may bee
admitted for Records of truth, that
bleſſed Babe, euen in his birth, by

be the vndoubted ſon of God, the

It cannot be denied which holy Writ
averreth, <hi>Fulget in terris lux nova de

their necks, as <hi>Dagon</hi> did before the
Arke. I might tell how Divels were
daunted at his comming, eſpecially
when the time of his appearance drew
neere, and I will here onely mention
two Oracles of <hi>Apollo</hi> concerning
this matter, one to a Prieſt, and the
other to a Prince.</p>
            <p>A Prieſt of <hi>Apollo</hi> demanding him of

Kings, deare, and onely ſonne, and of

            <p>The other Oracle was to <hi>Auguſtus

When it pleaſed him to ſwaddle vs in

            <p>From the wonders of his birth, it

nay more, it was a day of darkeneſſe,

when heaven was ſhut from it
ſhine, and the graue was ſhaken, when
that Kingdom of death and darkenes
was conquered by Chriſt, whereby
his death killed death, and by his life
gained vs life with immortality: nay
more, was it not a wonder to ſee how
the vayle of the Temple rent, when
mens hearts would not relent: In a

maruell then, if when all the ſinnes
of all the world lay ſo heauily vpon
our Chriſt, and preſſed him downe

all the creatures of God, to ſee and
behold ſo dolorous a ſpectacle: as
when the ſonne of God gaue his

ſinnes, who had no ſhelter but in the

            <p>And now ſpare we a while to paſſe

wrought ſithence, euen downe to

may gather the neare approach of
Chriſt his ſecond comming to iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

            <p>I might tell of that great day, and
it was the Lords day, when hee

their eares like the ruſhing of a

yeares after Chriſt his painefull
paſſion, who prophecied of their

not without prodigies, ſignes, and
wonders, as harbingers of his wrath;
whereof <hi>Ioſephus</hi> writeth much,<note place="margin">Lib. 7.</note> and
more then I can now ſtand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
<note place="margin">Cap. 12.</note> being preuented with time, but
reade his booke <hi>de bello Iudaico,</hi> and
there ye ſhall find<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how firſt, a blaſing
Starre was ſeene in the ayre like vnto
a ſword hanging ouer the Citie, for
more then a whole yeare together,
threatning nothing leſſe then fire
and deſolation, for their bloodie
ſinnes, the blood of the Prophets,
and of that Iuſt one, crying ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
to God in heauen, againſt
that bloodie Citie.</p>
            <p>2. Againe, at the feaſt of vnlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
bread in a great aſſemblie of
people, and at nine of the clocke
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:150667:16"/>
in the night, a bright light was
ſeene in the Temple ſhining, and
ſo continued for the ſpace of halfe
an houre, In token, that becauſe
they had quenched the holie lamps,
and put out the light of the world,
therefore the glorie of that houſe
ſhould be of no continuance.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, at the ſame feaſt,
and in the day time, when the High
Prieſt was offering an Heyfer for
the Sacrifice, ſhe brought foorth a
Lambe in the midſt of the Temple,
In ſigne, that though they thought
they had killed that Lambe of God
that taketh away the ſinnes of the
world, and that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould ſtill
haue liued when Chriſt was dead,
yet ſhould they ſee with their eyes,
that the truth ſhould riſe out of
that type, and when the Heyfer was
ſlaine, yet the Lambe ſhould liue;
yea, and that very Temple, ſtones
and all, ſhould turne to Greet, <hi>Ne
populus redirit ad Iudaizmum,</hi> Leſt
the people might goe backe to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daizme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:150667:17"/>
4. Fourthly, nay yet more the
great Braſon doore as the Author
ſaith, being at the Eaſt end of the
Temple, which twentie men could
hardly either open or ſhut at the
ſixt hower of the night flew open of
it owne accord, ſhewing a new way
and paſſage of Chriſt, to a better
place and being, euen vnto a Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
not made with hands, but
pitched in the high heauens, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it ſelfe, without helpe of any.</p>
            <p>5. Together with theſe as <hi>Ioſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
writeth in the 21. of May, a gaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpirit, of an vnſpeakable height
and bignes was ſeene in the citie, a
pregna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t prodigie of their imine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,
when <hi>Zim</hi> &amp; <hi>Ohim,</hi> Skritch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owles,
Fairies, &amp; Satyres, did haunt
their houſes, and faireſt habitations.
6. Chariotes in the ayre &amp; armed me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
fighting by troups amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the clouds
appeared throughout al the Land of
<hi>Iudea,</hi> &amp; marched towards the Citie
with fearce Encounters, all preſages
of their future fall, by the furie of
warre which was at their doores, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:150667:17"/>
yet they repented not. 7. Nay more, in
a ſolemn feaſt, when the Prieſts were
aſſembled by night, as their manner
was to ſacrifice, they heard this voice
<hi>Migremus hinc, migremus hinc,</hi> let vs
get hence, let vs get hence: the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
they heard ſell from heaven, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning
them ſilence, and a ceſſation
from all legall ceremonies and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
now ended, both Prieſt, place,
and offering, vpon the ſole ſacrifice
of Chriſt, whom they had cruelly
murthered, and therfore had need to
be gone before the fire of his fierce
wrath was kindled againſt that place,
people and kingdome.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, and of all other prodigies
to provoke their repentance, vpon
the Lords preſence &amp; neere approch,
now ready to ſtrike, it was not the
leaſt which fell out in one <hi>Ieſus,</hi> the
ſonne of <hi>Ananias,</hi> of the vulgar ſort,
who foureteene yeeres before the
ſiedge, &amp; when al was in quiet, peace,
and plentie, this ſonne of <hi>Ananias</hi>
comming to the feaſt of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi>
when the manner was, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:150667:18"/>
of the people ſhould doe their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
to God in the Temple, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
he cried out to the wonder of
them all, <hi>A voyce from the Eaſt; a
voyce from the Weſt, a voyce from the
foure windes, a voyce vpon Ieruſalem,
a voyce vpon the Temple, a voyce vpon
the Bride, and vpon the Bridegroome, a
voyce vpon all the people:</hi> Thus night
&amp; day he ran through euery ſtreet,
crying without thought of food, or
regard of any; inſomuch as when he
was beaten by the mighty (impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
of the prodigie,) I ſay beaten to
the bare bones, he neither ſhedde a
teare, or ſhewed himſelfe ſuppliant,
but at euery ſtroke ſtil cried out, Wo,
woe, to the inhabitants of <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi>
and thus continuing during all the
time of the ſiege, and eſpecially at
their ſolemne feaſts: At laſt, when
the ſiege was at the hoteſt, running
round about the walles of the City,
without feare hee vttered the ſame
voyce, and ſaid, <hi>Woe to Ieruſalem,
was to the people, and woe to my ſelfe;</hi> At
which laſt woe, <hi>Sagitta ictus occumbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:150667:18"/>
wounded with an arrow, hee fell
downe dead.</p>
            <p>The vſe is good, and for vs in the
height of this our ſecurity, all theſe
wonders and ſignes, euery man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
as the ſtory ſaith, <hi>Pro ſua li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidine,</hi>

their wickedneſſe was corrected, with
the deſtruction both of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

their Prophets, they beleeved not
Chriſt, whom when they had ſlaine,
and ſilenced, then was it time for
prodigies to ſpeake, and ſay, O blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
City, I dare giue remiſſion vpon
thy repentance, but I dare giue no

Prophets are deſpiſed; its more feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
when their Propheſies are ſet at

feares, when fire is a falling downe
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen, that is, when we with our
Prophets and propheſying prodigies
ſpeake, and wonders worke, and yet
wee repent not: ſo it was with <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
I pray God it bee not ſo with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſpeake of the ſignes, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

<hi>Et horret animus meminiſſe:</hi> my

that dreadfull day heretofore in two

portraiture of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> father of

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:150667:19"/>
in earth, to moue our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?
Haue not the heavens of late

            <p>It is ſome 40. yeeres agoe ſince

there was blood, fire, and

Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> with all of their

            <p>Next, it will bee remembred
whiles Chronicles can ſpeake, how

<hi>Thames</hi> was paved for cart and
carriage, for horſe and man, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in one day to ſupport a waight
of wonder, and vpon the other
diſſolved into weake Water. It
pierced deepe into the bowels of
the earth; and to this day, the
flowers, hearbes, plants and trees,
(nay more, man and beaſt, fiſh

the effects thereof; all to warne vs

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:150667:25"/>
to ſay, for <hi>Res eſt ſolliciti plena timoris

is it leaſt in obſeruance, though laſt

in Aprill laſt, and in the pariſh where
I dwell, and haue my paſteral charge,
witnes fiue hundreth more beſides
my ſelfe, who beheld with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that fearefull ſpectacle. To wit,
a dead childe, baſe borne, of lewd pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
hauing foure leggs, and foure
armes, all out of the bulke of one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
with fingers and toes proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable:
which bodie had two bellies
and two nauels forward, with one
plaine backe,<note place="margin">Buried at Standiſh Church in Lancaſtſhire Aprill. 17. 1613.</note> without ſeame or diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
it had but one head, and that
of a reaſonable proportion, with two
faces, the one looking forward, and
the other backward: either face had
two eyes, two eares, a noſe &amp; a mouth
perfect, nor was there in the ſeueral
members thereof, any blemiſh or

the ſexe was female, and the mother
was deliuered but halfe an houre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:150667:25"/>
this ſtrange birth of a perfect

what may follow, I cannot, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there

onely let it tax our miſhapen liues,
ſo farre degenerate from the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie

both virginall and coniugall chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
were prized with honour, where
now with many it is almoſt diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to be honeſt. <hi>Iudah</hi> with

themſelues, then ſorrow for that
ſinne, of which I may ſay, <hi>Lex Iulia

thou law of God? why ſleepeſt thou?
The many legges and armes may tax
our vntollerable pride, and aueriſe,
reaching heere, and treading there
yea in robbing well nere all Gods
creatures, to fil the belly &amp; cloath the
backe, with coſtly and gariſh ſutes,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:150667:26"/>
madding the minde, and making bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

riſe out of their graues, to behold
their children that tread vpon them,
they could not but deeme them of
a monſtrous birth. Two mouthes
taking in, &amp; two bellies caſting out,
taxe our inſatiable deſire of belly
cheere &amp; drunkennes, exoticall ſins,
and neuer but of late, a ſtaine to this
Engliſh Nation, <hi>In philtris philiſtinoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

vpon the doctrine of their maiſter
Chriſt, that the truth ſhal make them

fama, fides, occulus,</hi> that eyes honours

But to proceed yet further, and make
vſe of the prodigie, it is reſpectiue,
how when the Prince was dead this
birth was borne, It was in the Autum
of the yeare, when Prince <hi>Henry</hi> that
ſweet bloſſome was blaſted, with the
dampe of our ſinnes, and ſo as with
this faire flower, fell all the flowers of
the field, leaues of trees, and Roſes in
our garden, they would not flouriſh
while <hi>Henry</hi> was a falling, but fel with
him. Woe vnto vs that euer we ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
ſo faire a Prince, ſo pious and ſo
puiſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to fal in a day, was ſuch a ſtroke
as ſhooke the Cedars with the ſhrubs
and might yet well beſeeme our
ſacke cloth and aſhes: but this baſe
birth was borne in the ſpring fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
to tax vs, as with the growth
of our monſtrous ſinnes, ſo to teach
vs withall, that ſithence the faire fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

it is vſuall with God to puniſh our

vs of vnthankefulnes: for yet we are
bleſſed with the hopefull iſſue of
moe Princes, and with many drops
of much royall blood, and by the

ſo many cords, wil neuer be broken if
our ſinnes burſt it not, yet with this
caution, that we repaire the ruines of
this our late loſſe, with ſpeedie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and pray withall, that God
would eſtabliſh the remaine of our
religious hope, for his ſonnes ſake,
and <hi>Syons</hi> ſafetie.</p>
            <p>O but he hath left a deſolate court!
I anſwere, as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> did of <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
Non ſunt deſtituti, quos pietatis ſua

            <p>I might here obſerue as many moe
haue done, what preſages fell out vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the fall of this faire flower and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:150667:28"/>
peereleſſe Prince, how the two glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
creatures of God, both Sunne
and Monne were troubled, the Sunne
ſcarce ſeene of twentie daies before
his death, the Moone oppoſed with
a mightie Rainbowe, in the dead and
and darkenes of the night, bended
ouer that houſe of mourning where
he died. I might tell how the ayre,
earth, and clouds, ſeemed to be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of his fall, and to condole his
death, whiles ſtrange windes, ſtorms,
and tempeſts, with continually ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
raignes, and floods. Many darke
daies, Clouds, and foggie miſts, were
vpon vs, to warne vs of our woe, as
formerly hath beene obſerued of
<hi>Theodotius</hi> and Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
before their deaths. Nor can I paſſe
without paſſion, what fell out in the
ſommer before Prince <hi>Henry</hi> died, at
<hi>Chattam.</hi> Where and when a ſwarme
of Bees knit vpon the maine maſt of
that Royall ſhip, he had made for
Englands defence, tellng vs, that ere

there to raigne with God and
his Chriſt for euer. A bleſſed Bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliuered
from the ſting of ſinne
and death, to the endleſſe glorie of
life and immortalitie, neuer to ſin

haue yet ſaid,<note place="margin">Amos. 3. 6.</note> to make good <hi>that there
is not an euill in the Citie which the Lord

               <hi>Man that is borne of a woman, hath but

It was powerfull in the preacher, and

its thou that chaungeſt like the

            <p>O if I might ſay, we fooles chaunge

            <p>
               <hi>Illa velociter colligit quod amiſerat lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:

            <p>What ſhould I ſay more: <hi>Luna

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:150667:30"/>
               <hi>Grauior ergo tua quam lunae mutatio.</hi>
More dangerous therefore by much
is the eclipſe of thy ſoule, than is
the eclipſe either of Sunne or
Moone.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſome man will ſay:
doth neither Sunne nor Moone la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

doe, and that continually. For we
cannot denie but they labour with
other creatures, as the Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>and grone with vs, alſo trauelling in

the day of their deliuerance out of the
vanitie of corruption, wherein they are.</hi>
Leaue off therefore to looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the defects of thoſe glorious
lights, vnles thou looke vpon
the ſtaines and blemiſhes of thy
wicked life. For how is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the drunkard in his wine,
the wanton in his luſt, or the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous
man in his wealth, to looke
vpon the Moone, and ſee the things

Are there new Stars vncoth and

if thou wouldeſt be ſafe, flee from
thy ſinnes, if thou leaue off ſinning
the enemie is conquered. And how
is he conquered? <hi>Non Gladio Golias

of deuotion, in the hand of Gods

deliuerance in the daies of danger,
when ſignes from heauen, and Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
on earth, are on vs to
moue our repentance.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Acts. 2. 21.</bibl>
               <q>And it ſhall be, that whoſoeuer ſhall call
vpon the name of the Lord, ſhall be
ſaued.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>SIgnes in heauen, and prodigies on
earth (as I haue told you,) are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but drums of deuotion,
prouoking our prayer, in the ſweet
perfume whereof, whiles we walke,
the Lord will either deliuer vs from
deſerued iudgements, or giue vs
patience to abide the fyrie triall,
And therfore pardon me yet further
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:150667:33"/>
to ceaze vpon your religious eares,
and hearts, on Gods behalfe, and in
tender of your ſaued ſoules. Pardon
me to preſſe you to powerfull praier,
thereby to make the Lord propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
ayding, &amp; aſſiſting, when workes
of wonder, both aboue and belowe,
doe threaten our deſtruction.</p>
            <p>The wicked in that day ſhal wring
their hands, rent their garments,
teare their haire, and cry vpon the
mountaines to fall vpon them: but
the godly ſhall haue boldnes in that
day, they ſhall lift vp their heads, and
knowe that the day of their redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
draweth neere: yea, &amp; as it is in
my text, <hi>they ſhall call vpon the name of
the Lord, and be ſaued.</hi> I ſay, all ſuch as
feare God, ſhall feare no fire, but <hi>call
vpon the name of the Lord and be ſaued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet ſo, as the holy Ghoſt euer giues
the guſt, power, and ſpirit of prayer,
without which it is no perfume, but
a ſtinch in the noſthrills of the Lord
of Hoſt. And therefore as you may
here ſee the bleſſed Apoſtle clearing
the imputation of Drunkennes, both
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:150667:33"/>
in himſelfe, and the reſt his aſſociats,
euen in the height of that high feaſt
of Penticoſt, doth in ebriat the ſoules
of Gods Saints, with a pregnant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
of the abundance of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
which ſhould glad the hearts of
the godly in the latter daies. So then
I may ſafely ſay, that as the fire is
knowne by it heate, the Sunne by it
light, and the tree by it fruit, ſo may
you by prayer, know whether the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God be in you or no: As alſo
whether ye ſhall be ſaued when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies
are abroad, wonders in heauen
aboue, and tokens on earth beneath,
blood and fire and the vapour of
ſmoake. Much prayer, and much
paſſion, is euer from a powerfull ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and it argueth a Royall preſence
of the holy Ghoſt for euen as: <hi>in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
face anſwereth face,</hi> ſo in plea of
ſaluation, ſpirit anſwereth ſpirit, <hi>Gods
ſpirit anſwereth our ſpirit, that we are
his children,</hi> yea and the inſence of
our prayer; anſwereth the perfume of
his ſpirit, in which ſweet ayre we are
carried and breath vnto ſaluation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:150667:34"/>
VVhy then it may ſeeme, where
there is much prayer, there is much
ſpirit; where there is little praier, there
is little ſpirit; and where there is no
prayer, there is no ſpirit; and if who
ſoeuer ſhall call vppon the name
of the Lord, hath much ſpirit, and
ſhall bee ſaved; it will follow that
whoſoeuer ſhall not call vpon the
name of the Lord, hath no ſpirit, and
ſhall not be ſaved.</p>
            <p>And I cannot but wonder, that
ſith the viſion is for an appointed
time, and now is the time (euen in
the latter daies, which are the dayes
of Chriſt) wherein God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to power out his ſpirit vpon all
fleſh, <hi>euen the ſpirit of grace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
ſo as euery one ſhould weepe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
becauſe of him whom they haue
pierced;</hi> And yet our praier ſhould
be ſo ſcanted, and our ſpirits ſo dull,
as wee ſeeme to bee dead in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion.
Surely wee dire the Deity
with our ſinnes, wee quench the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
wee grieue it; wee deſpite it, and
therefore wee pray not, becauſe the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:150667:34"/>
ſpirit breathes not.</p>
            <p>Some few droppes of this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
fountaine diſtilled vpon the
Patriarkes and Prophets of old, but
the cundits of grace were neuer ſo
fully opened as in theſe latter dayes
of Chriſt, when with the effuſion of
his blood, hee vented out the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of his ſpirit, and powred it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all fleſh; and is it not ſtrange the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that men ſhould ſo liue, as if they
ſtood in doubt, whether there bee an
holy Ghoſt or no; and in theſe laſt
dayes of mans redemption, they
ſhould breath more weakly, and pray
more faintly then in the firſt dayes
of the worlds creation; when <hi>Abel</hi>
was ſlaine by <hi>Caine;</hi> it is of ſpeciall
obſervation, that vntill the dayes of
<hi>Enoch,</hi> men were ſilent in their deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and cared not for their God, for
then as it is in the Text, <hi>men beganne to
call vpon the name of the Lord; Caines</hi>
ſinne had ſo corrupted <hi>Seths</hi> ſeed &amp;
ſanctity, that till <hi>Enoch</hi> repaired the
ruines by his holy profeſſion, there
was little prayer, little ſpirit, litle pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:150667:35"/>
in that world. It is ſaid of <hi>Enoch,
that hee walked with God, and was no
more ſeene:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 5. 24.</note> It was his ſpeciall privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
ſo to bee rapt vp, elſe moe had
followed after, but they wanted his
ſpirit, his prayer, and the familiarity
hee had with God; it was a bad world,
for the ſpirit breathed not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men prayed not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When all fleſh had corrupted their
wayes,</hi> ſo as God looked down from
heaven, to ſee if there were any that
were good, and there was not one
good, no not one; then mans wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe
wallowed in the water of his
deſtruction; <hi>Noah</hi> prayed, and hee
was preſerved, the reſt called not
vpon the name of the Lord, and
therefore periſhed.</p>
            <p>I might tell of <hi>Abraham, Iſaacke,
Iacob, Moſes, Samuel and Ioſhua,</hi> how
plentifull the ſpirit was in them, and
how powerfully they prayed in their
dayes: yet from a ſparing ſpirit which
breathed but vpon few, beſides their
owne families. So might I ſpeake of
al the renowmed Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:150667:35"/>
               <hi>Iudah;</hi> of inſpired Prophets, holy
men, and godly Matrones, down to
the dayes of Chriſt, all of bleſſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
for feruent prayer, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent:
yea, and from a powerfull ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
yet limited to their peculiars,
and as it were confined within the
borders of <hi>Paleftine,</hi> till <hi>Siloh</hi> came,
meane our Chriſt, the <hi>Meſſias</hi> and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of all the world; who, as I haue
ſaid, with the effuſion of his blood,
powred out the abundance of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
vpon all fleſh; I ſay with <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
the ſpirit of prayer and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that the godly might mourne,
becauſe of him whome they had
pierced.</p>
            <p>The Iſſue is ſweet, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is Orthodoxall, taken from
the practiſes of the godly in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
neuer was it yet ſeen or heard,
that euer man prayed, preached, or
pray ſed aright, but as the ſpirit gaue
him vtterance. The holy Ghoſt is the
holie guide of all our holy actions, it
is the ſeaſoner of the ſoule, and the
moulder of all our ſanctity; it is the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:150667:36"/>
mother of piety, and it openeth the
doore to all true deuotion; where it
breathes, there is the perfume of
Prayer; where it breathes not, there
is ſinne in ſilence, without cry or
calling vpon the name of the Lord,
that they might be ſaued.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The creatures</hi> as it is in <hi>Paul, may
grone,</hi> wee may grieue and ſigh in our
ſelues, waiting for the adoption, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the redemption of our bodies,
in the ſalvation of our ſo ules: but
yet it is the ſpirite that helpeth our
frailety, and ſo, whereas wee know
not how to pray as wee ought, the
ſpirit it ſelfe maketh requeſt for vs,
with ſignes that cannot bee vttered;
for hee that ſearcheth the hearts,
knoweth what is the meaning of the
ſpirit, and he maketh requeſts for
the Saints, according to the will of
God.</p>
            <p>If the Apoſtles could haue tolde
how to haue prayed of themſelues,
they would neuer haue gon to Chriſt
to haue taken out the leſſon, nor ſaid,
<hi>Maiſter, teach vs how to pray:</hi> but
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:150667:36"/>
they knew that the holy Ghoſt and
he were all one, and therefore would
fetch that ſweet perfume from his
bleſſed breath, they knew that grace
was powdered in his lipps,<note place="margin">Pſ. 45. 2.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe God
had bleſſed him for euer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well then I ſay no more but this,
to preſſe out this ſweete perfume
of prayer, to be practiſed of all with
vnwearied diligence. 1. That there is
an houſe of prayer, and the Lord
hath purged it. 2. There is a day of
prayer, and the Lord hath ſanctified
it. 3. There is an heart for prayer, and
the Lord hath poſſeſſed it. 4. There is
a mouth for prayer, and the Lord
hath opened it. 5. There is a preſident
for prayer, and the Lord hath enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it. 6. There is a <hi>premiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> or reward
for prayer, and the Lord hath giuen
it, euen ſaluation to out ſoules: for ſo
ſaith the text, <hi>It ſhall be that whoſoeuer
ſhall call vpon the name of the Lord ſhall
be ſaued,</hi> Nay &amp; if none of theſe were,
yet becauſe we are fallen into the laſt
and worſt daies of the world, wherein
ſinne was neuer ſo ſinfull, deferued
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:150667:37"/>
iudgements, neuer more doubtfull,
nor Sathan ſo buſie to beſtir himſelf,
for that he hath but a ſhort time: It
might moue vs to be no leſſe feruent
then frequent in prayer, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for that wonders, ſignes, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies,
harbingers of Gods wrath are
vpon vs, yea <hi>Hanibal, ad Portas,</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
is at our doores: Oh, pray, pray,
pray, neuer more need to pray.</p>
            <p>But it may be ye know not how
to pray, and therefore ye aske and
haue not, becauſe ye aske amiſſe, ye
ſeeke and find not, becauſe ye ſeeke
amiſſe. For euery man ſeekes his
owne, either of pleaſure, or profit, but
fewe the things that are of Ieſus
Chriſt: and therefore ſpare me, while
I tender to your religious eares and
harts, a modell of prayer, where after
if you faſhion your deuotion, ye may
be ſure, both to haue audience, and
anſwere from the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Wherein, firſt conſider the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
how to pray, which is your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, remoue the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

            <p>Thirdly, reſpect the incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
ve haue to pray, becauſe of the
<hi>premium</hi> and rich reward which is
ſaluation: for it <hi>ſhall be that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
ſhall call vpon the name of the Lord
ſhall be ſaued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt for the manner, how
muſt I call, that I may be heard? how
muſt I be prepared that I may make
the Lord propitious, and readie to
helpe in time of need? how may I
make him to returne my prayers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my boſome, while I double my
plaints within my breſt?</p>
            <p>I muſt firſt call in faith, <hi>for without
faith it is not poſſible to pleaſe God:</hi> faith
is the ſalt of the ſacrifice that makes
it ſau<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rie: it is the Star guiding, it is

a paſſion from vs more ſweete
then Incenſe in the noſtrills of the
Lord of Hoſt. In my faith I haue full
aſſurance that I ſhall be heard, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
&amp; obtaine my deſires, for Chriſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:150667:38"/>
ſo promiſed when he curſed the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren

               <note place="margin">Mark. 11. 24.</note> 
               <hi>beleeue that ye ſhall haue it, and
it ſhall be done vnto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Iames the Sonne of thunder,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 21. 22.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the call of praier ſent out the fire
of faith, like lightning, before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> clap,
when he ſaid,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 5.</note> 
               <hi>If any man lacke wiſdome,
let him aske of God, which giueth to all
men liberally, and reprocheth no man, and
it ſhall be giuen him, but let him aske in
faith, and wauer not, &amp;c.</hi> Yea &amp; <hi>Dauid</hi>
was of this conſort,<note place="margin">Pſ. 145. 18.</note> when he ſung to
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſolace of his ſoule, <hi>The Lord is neare
vnto all that call vpon him, yea to all that
call vpon him faithfully.</hi> What ſhould I
ſay more, <hi>our faith is the victorie by
which we ouercome the world,</hi> it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with no difficulties, it paſſeth for
no impoſſibilities, it extent reacheth
far, euen from the nethermoſt hell
to the higheſt heauens.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> as I muſt call in faith
if I will be heard, ſo muſt I pray in
humilitie, if I will haue anſwere: <hi>for
he hath regarded the lowe degree of his
handmaid,</hi> it was her virginall voyce,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:150667:38"/>
and in the humblenes of her heart
ſhe was exalted with her God. O its
an excellent vertue, when honor is
humbled, and humilitie is honored
with the title of bleſſednes, as it was
with <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iudeths</hi> humilitie pulled downe
the Aſſirian pride, when powring
out her prayer to God for the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of her people,<note place="margin">Iud. 9. 11.</note> ſhe ſaid. <hi>Thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſtandeth not in the multitude,</hi> nor thy
might in ſtrong men, but thou O
Lord art the helpe of the humble
and little ones. <hi>Aron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> muſt
hold vp <hi>Moſes</hi> hands, leſt he might
ſeeme to be exalted in his owne
ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth. And when <hi>Heſter</hi> the Queen
was to deale with her God by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
ſhe put off her princely robes, but
when ſhe went to the Kings Pallace
ſhe put them on: to teach vs, that we
may not deale with God as with
men, for hee will be better pleaſed
with our pouertie then with our
pride: with our ſackecloth and aſhes,
then with our ſilke and ſables. I, and
the child will goe alone, ſo ſaid <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:150667:39"/>
of his beloued <hi>Iſaacke,</hi> I and my
miſerie will goe alone, ſo ſaith the
humbled ſoule vnto his mercifull
Sauiour. No plea with God like the
pore mans plea, and to goe <hi>informa
pauperis,</hi> is the beſt plea in heauen,
though it be the worſt on earth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> as the Lord muſt be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vpon in faith and humilitie, ſo
muſt he be applied with good zeale
and affection: no perfume of prayer
but from a paſſionate heart, a broken
and contrite heart God will neuer
deſpiſe, his eye and his anſwere is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
all ſuch, according to that of
the prophet,<note place="margin">Iſay. 66. 2.</note> 
               <hi>To him will I looke, euen
to him that is poore and of a lowly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
ſpirit, and trembleth at my words.
Moſes</hi> ſaid nothing, and yet he cryed
vnto the Lord, it was a paſſionate
prayer, not from <hi>Laodecean</hi> lippes,
but from a fyrie ſpirit, as with <hi>Anna</hi>
when ſhe powred out her ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord in the day of her bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dauids</hi> affection in his prayer, was
much kindled with the oole of zeale,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:150667:39"/>
when he cryed vnto the Lord, it was
more inflamed when he watered his
couch with his teares, for the ſinnes
of his ſoule, but moſt of all battered
when he rored within, for aflictions
without,<note place="margin">Oſeah. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Iacob wept &amp; prayed &amp; fou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

God at Bethel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſay. 39. 14.</note> So did good <hi>Ezekias</hi>
when he turned him to the wall and
wept, ſaying, <hi>Attenuati ſunt occuli mei
ſuspicientes in coelum, mine eyes are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
with watching vpon my God,</hi> and I
had fainted in my miſerie, had he not
turned to me in mercy, &amp; ſaid; <hi>I haue

               <note place="margin">2 King. 20 5.</note> 
               <hi>and ſeene thy teares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What ſhould I ſay more, <hi>Mardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che</hi>
in the midſt of the citie, cryed to
God with a great crie and a bitter,
and he was heard in that he deſired:
ſo was Chriſt vpon the tree, when
greeued in ſoule, he waſhed away our
ſtaines in blood &amp; teares. It was <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines</hi>
ſorrow, when thinking vpon
his vaine paſſions, he ſaid, <hi>flebam Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donem
morientem ob amorem Aeneae,</hi> I
wept for <hi>Dido,</hi> dying for the loue of
<hi>Aeneas.</hi> but alas and woe is me ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I ſeldome wept for my Sauiour
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:150667:40"/>
dying for my ſinne, nor yet for my
ſelfe liuing in my ſinne. Surely
teares and prayers are church wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
and I may conclude as <hi>Ambroſe</hi>
did with <hi>Monacha Auguſtines</hi> Mother,
when ſhe wept after his conuerſion,
<hi>vade a me ita viuas, fieri non poteſt vt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
iſtarum lachrimarum pereat,</hi> Goe
from me thou mournfull mother,
and doe as thou doeſt, it can neuer
be that a ſon of all theſe teares ſhould
euer periſh So dare I ſay of the Saints
of God, ſorrowing &amp; weeping, either
for their owne ſinnes or others, it can
not be that children of al theſe teares
ſhould euer periſh.</p>
            <p>I paſſe to the fourth,<note place="margin">4.</note> which is from
our feruencie in prayer, to our fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and often praying, thereby to
importune y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, to be propitious,
euer wraſtling as <hi>Iacob</hi> did, and neuer
leauing him without a bleſſing. Nor
as it is in the Prophet,<note place="margin">Iſay. 62. 7.</note> 
               <hi>giuing him no

as we are his by many allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:150667:40"/>
O that our prayer were with
more aſſiduitie, much and continual,
as euer needing, &amp; therefore alwaies
begging. <hi>Eliah</hi> when he prayed for
raine, ſent his ſeruant ſeauen times to

               <hi>Moſes</hi> meditations were mentall,

Soules would be ſecret in their ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie,

            <p>Thus haue I told you how to pray,
that yee may bee heard, how to call,

            <p>Now that which letteth firſt,<note place="margin">2. Part, &amp; firſt impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment.</note> is the

that beateth backe prayer, the

               <hi>He that turneth away, his

they pleaſe God if they pray &amp; heare

not the Lords preſence with ſo

make themſelues acceptable to God
for their much praying, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
not abhominable for their ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
hearing; they thinke to bee
heard, ſaith our Sauiour, for their
much babling; as and if hee ſhould

they ſhall bee anſwered for their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent

            <p>The ſame Prophet from the ſame

but he yeelds them a more ſolide rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

               <hi>The Lords hand is

            </p>
            <p>Sinnes? and what ſinnes? reade
the wordes that follow, ſinnes of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> then, ſinnes of <hi>England</hi> now:

for if wee blend in ſinne with <hi>Iſrael,</hi>

            <p>And theſe are the ſinnes of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
and <hi>Iudah,</hi> wherewithall they are

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:150667:44"/>
ſaith God by the Prophet, are defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with blood: crueltie is in your

            <p>Your lippes ſpeake lies, who can

            <p>7 No man calleth for iuſtice, truth
periſheth in the ſtreete, equitie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

The Lord ſaw this, and was diſpleaſed
with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and yet their greateſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
was in this, that they thought
their day of ſinning would euer
downe, they dread no iudgement till
it was at their doores, and fell vpon
them. Thus infected my deare bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
with ſinne, how ſhould wee
thinke not to be afflicted for our ſin?
how may we expect from the Lord
either audience or anſwere, when we
pray? <hi>Templum domini</hi> will ſerue no

ye ſhall find how Sathan found
him, when the Lord had left him, and
when the holy Oracle was ſilent, the

a diuell. <hi>Zim</hi> and <hi>Ohim</hi> wil haunt our

            <p>A third wall of ſeparation ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the paſſage of our prayer to
God,<note place="margin">3. Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> is the ſinne of vnmercifulnes
towards the poore: for as the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

               <hi>He that ſtoppeth his eare at

and not be heard,</hi> vnmercifulnes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the poore, was one of the ſins
of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and little doe I doubt but

euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fiftie to tenne mercifull
men not found in <hi>Sodome</hi> for whoſe

            <p>The vſe is good, I pray God the
teares of the poore hinder not the
prayers of the rich: many are oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
&amp; yet are not pittied: we can goe
to no pulpit, but they preſſe our harts
to prouoke our ſpeech, &amp; all I can ſay
is this, take heed, for as ye know, he
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> would not giue a crum of comfort,
was denied a drop of mercy, and not

            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> if you long after audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

and picke out that poyſon: you muſt
forgiue, that you may be forgiuen:
yea and which is yet more, you

that you may preuaile with your beſt

            </p>
            <p>

that ye might lay the ſame out on
your pleaſures:</hi> Its a fooliſh pleaſure
on earth, that beates backe a prayer
from heauen: Its a fooliſh paſſage
with man, that ſtops a paſſage with
God. And ſo for concluſion of this
poynt, be warned, that as you heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
your prayers vpward, ſo you leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
your ſinnes downward. And with
<hi>Siracides</hi> returne vnto the Lord,<note place="margin">Eccl. 17. 23.</note> and
forſake thy ſinnes, make thy prayer
before his face, and diminiſh the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>

               <note place="margin">5. Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
               <hi>as wickednes in our ſelues,
and proper ſinnes doe hinder our
prayers: So when ſinne is in thoſe
we pray for, it often ſtoppeth our
paſſage vnto the Lord, and maketh
him inexorable. As in</hi> Ieremiah <hi>the
Prophet, when the Lord ſaid,</hi> I will
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:150667:46"/>
caſt you out of my ſight, as I haue caſt out

for them, neither intreate me, for I
will not heare thee: Seeſt thou not what
they doe in the cities of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and in the

            <p>As and if he ſhould ſay, exemplarie
ſinnes, ſhall haue exemplarie iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for I will power my wrath vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

and vpon the fruit of the ground: it
ſhall burne ô <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> and thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſhall not quench it. Nay, and as it is
in an other Prophet,<note place="margin">Ezech. 14. 14.</note> 
               <hi>If theſe three
men,</hi> Noah, Daniel, <hi>and</hi> Iob, <hi>were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, they ſhould not but deliuer
their owne ſoules by their righteouſnes
ſaith the Lord God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All I haue ſaid is but this, if our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
be not heard, it is <hi>quia petimus 1.
indigné 2. indigna, 3 pro indignis:</hi> either
the thing is vnlawfull we pray for, or
we are vnworthie, who pray, or they
for whom we doe pray. The mother
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:150667:47"/>
of <hi>Zebedes</hi> childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, had not her boone
at the hands of Chriſt, for that her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
was not lawfull. <hi>Eſau</hi> had not
that he prayed for, becauſe he was
vnworthie. And if you poure out ten
thouſand praiers, either for the diuels
or damned, ye ſhall not be heard, for
their ſinnes are gone before them, to
their iuſt condemnation.</p>
            <p>And here ſpare me a while, and I
hope it ſhall not be vnprofitable to
the further ſanctifying both of your
will and skill in prayer, if I lay downe
certaine Rules whereby you may
know how diuerſly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord doth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
the requeſts of his Saints, &amp; yet
all to their endleſſe comfort, if they
can but be patient of his anſweres.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And firſt obſerue, and you ſhall find
it to be true, that God heareth ſome,
<hi>ad voluntatem &amp; non ad vtilitatem,</hi> he
anſwereth their pleaſure, but not
their profit, what they would haue,
but not what they ſhould haue. As
when the people luſted after fleſh in

God gaue them their fill, yet while
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:150667:47"/>
the fleſh was betweene their teeth,<note place="margin">Numb. 11 10. 30.</note> &amp;
before it was chewed, the wrath of the
Lord was kindled againſt the people,
&amp; the Lord ſmote the people with an
exceeding great plague, in ſo much
as the place of their buriall is called
vnto this day,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 8. 6. 7.</note> 
               <hi>kibroth hattauah,</hi> graues

it had beene better for them if they

all ſuch as pray for nothing
but for the pleaſures, and profites of
this world, beautie, wealth, and plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
wit, which oftentimes God put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
into their hands, like a ſword in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of a lunatike man, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
he endangereth himſelfe, and
ſo, the Lord anſwereth all ſuch, <hi>ad
voluntatem &amp; non ad vtilitatem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond rule is religious too,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
&amp; much to the ſolace of Gods Saints,
who often heareth, and anſwereth, <hi>ad
vtilitatem non advolu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tatem,</hi> anſwereth
I ſay our profit, and not our pleaſure.
As he did <hi>Paul,</hi> who praying thrice,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:150667:48"/>
that Sathans buffettings, which were
the prickes of the fleſh, might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from him: Chriſt anſwered, no
<hi>Paul</hi> not ſo:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 7.</note> 
               <hi>my grace is ſufficient for
thee, and my power is made perfect
through thy weakenes.</hi> And this made
the Saints of God to reioyce in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more then in the croſſe of
Chriſt, where by the world was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
vnto them, and they vnto the
world, they reioyced in their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
anguiſh, and perſecutions,
though buffettings of Sathan, and
prickes of the fleſh, yet purging fire
fyning them for their God, whiles
they were reſolued that all the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in this world, were neuer wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of that glorie which ſhould be

anſwere, <hi>ad vtilitatem non ad volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi>
whiles they ſeeme to ſhrinke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the burden of their afflictions.</p>
            <p>The third rule is not irregular
with God, who for the moſt part <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
doth anſwere all his Elect children,
<hi>ad voluntatem &amp; ad vtilitatem,</hi> making
them glorious by deliuerance in the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:150667:48"/>
daies of their afflictions, anſwering

who ſought a leader to <hi>Haram,</hi>

And <hi>Saul</hi> who ſought his fathers

well, but ſhe found, &amp; went away

is true, <hi>vberior gracia quam precatio,</hi>
Gods grace is more abounding then
either we can deſire or deſerue, the
