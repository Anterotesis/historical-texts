            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is the common fashion to make
some address to the Readers, but
we are bold to direct ours to you, who
will look on this publication with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
which others must welcom into the
world with Joy.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> comparing inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Authors to those who had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards
ill neighboured, advised them
to publish their own labours, lest o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
might steal the fruit: Had you
followed his example, or liked the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
we had not thus trespassed against
<pb facs="tcp:59204:3"/>
your consent, or been forced to an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology,
which cannot but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mply a fault
committed. The best we can say for
our selves is, that if we have injured
you it is meerly in your own defence,
preventing the present attempts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who to their theft would (by their
false copies of these Poems) have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
violence, and some way have woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
your reputation.</p>
            <p>Having been long engaged on
better contemplations, you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
look down on these <hi>Iuvenilia</hi>
(most of them the issues of your
youthful Muse) with some disdain;
and yet the Courteous Reader may
tell you with thanks, that they are,
not to be despised, being far from
<pb facs="tcp:59204:3"/>
Abortive, nor to be disowned, because
they are both Modest and Legitimate.
And thus if we have offered you a view
of your yonnger face, our hope is yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
will behold it with an unwrinkled
brow, though we have presented the
Mirrour against your will</p>
            <p>We confess our design hath been set
forward by friends that honour you,
who le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t the ill publishing might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure
these things from whence you
never expected addition to your credit
(sundry times endeavoured and by
them defeated) furnished us with some
papers which they thought Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick;
we may not turn their favour
into an accusation, and therefore give
no intimation of their names, but
<pb facs="tcp:59204:4"/>
wholly take the blame of this hasty
and immethodical impression upon our
selves, being persons at a distance, who
are fitter to bear it then those who are
neerer related. In hope of your pardon
we remain.</p>
