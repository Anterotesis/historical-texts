         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PUBLISHER
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>FOrtune, though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
my merit, and
beside my expectation so
propitious, as to give me,
not only the liberty of
reading the Original Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript
of this Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
<hi>Treatise,</hi> but also a
right of adjudging it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to perpetual Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb facs="tcp:64291:3"/>
in my Cabinet, or to
publick Light, as I should
think convenient: hath
yet been so reserv'd, or sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
as to deny me the
knowledge of the <hi>Author</hi>'s
Name and Quality; as if
it were favour great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
that she entrusted
me to dispose of anothers
Treasure, without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
from whom she
had receiv'd it; or as if
she design'd to make Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
of my Faith, whether
I would lay claim to what
seem'd to want an owner.
But this her <hi>Caprichio,</hi> as it
<pb facs="tcp:64291:3"/>
hath not deterr'd me from
divulging, so ought it not
to discourage you, <hi>Candid
Reader,</hi> from seriously per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>using
this <hi>Manual.</hi> For 'tis an
ancient and wise saying of
a Philosopher, <hi>Non tam quis
dixerit refert, quam quid di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum
sit:</hi> and if the Book be
good enough to commend
it self, what can it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
you or me to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive
who Compos'd
it? if not; certainly no
Name, how much soever
celebrated, can defend it
from neglect and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
Besides, when we
<pb facs="tcp:64291:4"/>
remain ignorant upon
whom to fix the blame of
our Frustrations, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
that Ignorance
turns to our advantage,
by mitigating our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments,
and keeping our
displeasure from trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing
the limits of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
and Moderation.</p>
            <p>This I speak, neither
out of dislike of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<hi>Curiosity</hi> by which all
Men are led to search into
things conceal'd, nor from
vain hope to restrain you
from using the liberty of
<hi>Conjecturing,</hi> that is equally
<pb facs="tcp:64291:4"/>
common to all: but only
from good <hi>Manners,</hi> which
forbid us to pry into the
Secrets of another, chiefly
of him who judges the
Communication of them
to be unsafe to himself, and
no way useful to us. If
therefore our <hi>Author,</hi> duly
conscious to himself of
Human Frailty, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of his own Learning
and judgment, fears to
come upon the Stage in
this Censorious Age,
wherein the <hi>Illiterate</hi> blush
not to condemn the
<hi>Knowing:</hi> we are at once to
<pb facs="tcp:64291:5"/>
acknowledge his <hi>Modesty,</hi>
and commend his <hi>Prudence,</hi>
not to envy him the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy
he affects. And this
is enough for me to say,
and for you to know con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>my self;</hi> If I, from
good will to all Mankind,
desire to make Common to
that benefit, which seems
have been at first intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be inclosed and kept
peculiar: I neither invade
the <hi>Authors</hi> propriety, nor
abuse the freedom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to me, but chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
dispense to many the
<pb facs="tcp:64291:5"/>
Wealth I might have kept
intirely to <hi>my self.</hi> And
this too, following the
<hi>Writers</hi> example, I choose
to do <hi>unknown;</hi> that my
Charity may be exempt
from all suspition of Osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and that I may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all thanks of those
that take it in good part.
So that in fine, all I ask of
you is, that you would
freely enjoy the pleasure
of his Studies, and of
my benevolence, without
thinking your self obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to either, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbing
the quiet we both
<pb facs="tcp:64291:6"/>
hope from our belov'd
obscurity. This, <hi>Good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
you cannot with Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
deny to Men, who leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Censure the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
wherein chiefly it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
do by concealing
the more expose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>It remains only, that I
add a short Advertisement
concerning the <hi>Book</hi> it self,
of the good reception
whereof by the <hi>Learned</hi>
and the <hi>Iudicious,</hi> I am not
a little Solicitous, and
from whose Fate I may
learn how rightly to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimate
<pb facs="tcp:64291:6"/>
the small Judgment
I have in Discourses of this
kind. Permit me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to inform you, That
it was Written by the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
to no other end, but
to confirm his <hi>Faith</hi> by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
into the <hi>Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>Purity</hi> of it, and to
augment his <hi>Piety</hi> toward
God. In a Word, That he
might offer to the Divine
Majesty, not the Sacrifice
of Fools, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
consentaneous to right
Reason: as appears from
the laudible Profession he
makes in the <hi>Fifth Article
<pb facs="tcp:64291:7"/>
of the Second Chapter of the
First Part;</hi> and from the
plainness and simplicity of
the <hi>Stile,</hi> such as serious
Men use, when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to Writing their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections
and Remarks for
their own private use; and
(what is yet more convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing)
from the <hi>Scope</hi> of
the whole Disquisition.
The <hi>Design</hi> then you will
(I presume) acknowledge
to be good, worthy a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
and a Christian.
And if he hath pursued it
so far as to satisfie his own
Reason, why may not I
<pb facs="tcp:64291:7"/>
hope from the same Cause
the like good effect also in
the Minds of others? From
this, and only this hope it
is, that I permit this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium
of <hi>Natural</hi> and
<hi>Positive Divine Laws</hi> to see
the Publick Light. If my
hope be by wiser Heads
found to stand upon an
infirm <hi>Basis;</hi> the charity of
my intention may at least
excuse, if not expiate the
Error of my understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>

This is consider'd in a twofold sense,
first as it is <hi>Obligative</hi> or binding,<note place="margin">2. distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed into <hi>Preceptive</hi> and <hi>Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive.</hi>
                     </note> and
then it is called also <hi>Preceptive</hi> or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded:
or secondly as it is only <hi>Permissive,</hi>
and then it is named also <hi>Concessive.</hi> In
the <hi>former</hi> sense it takes place in those
things that are commanded or forbidden, as
to give every man his due, not to swear

permitted; as in the act of Buying,
Selling, Manumission, in the conditions of
Contractors used to be added to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,
and in others of that kind.</p>
                  <p>But both these kinds of <hi>Right</hi> belong,
either to all Mankind universally,<note place="margin">3. What is Right <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> and What <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</hi>

The <hi>Natural</hi> is that which is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest

and by <hi>Iurisconsults, Ius Gentium Primae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum.</hi>
The <hi>Divine,</hi> that which hath been
ordain'd and declar'd by Divine Oracles,
committed to writing in the Holy Bible.
And this, as well as the Natural, deserves
to be acknowledged to be <hi>Ius Gentium Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versale,
seu omnium Commune.</hi> Because all
the Laws of Nature, are the Laws of God
Himself; because his Positive or Written
Laws are no other but Sanctions or Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of His Unwritten or Natural: and
because whatsoever is <hi>Obligatory</hi> in either
Natural or Divine Universal Right, either
from the Nature of the thing it self, or
rather from the auctority of the Author of
Nature, is by all men held to be immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
Whence that Maxime so often
asserted by Philosophers, Theologues,
Jurisconsults; <hi>Iura Naturalia esse immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilia.</hi>
Which cannot be truly said of Right
<hi>Permissive,</hi> whether Natural or Divine,
extending to all Mankind. For that this
is variously mutable, according to the
judgment of Governors, is manifest to
every man of common sense, even from
the name <hi>Permissive,</hi> and from dayly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
which teaches that Permissive
Right admits Obrogations, Abrogations,
Temperaments, and Limitations, <hi>i. e.</hi> Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
Whereas the <hi>Obligatory,</hi> tho' it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64291:11"/>
admit indeed of <hi>Increments</hi> or <hi>Additions</hi>
(namely such by which it may be either
more firmly, or more decently observed)
yet admits no <hi>Mutations,</hi> by which its
force or vertue may be in the least di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished.</p>
                  <p>From the <hi>Additions</hi> of <hi>Obligatory</hi> Right,<note place="margin">4. What is right <hi>Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> or <hi>Civil.</hi>
                     </note>
and the <hi>Mutations</hi> of <hi>Permissive,</hi> there
hath risen up that other Right, which
being of less extent, belongs not to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or to Mankind Universally, but
only to some parts of it, and is wont
rightly enough (as being <hi>put</hi> or founded,
whether by God, or by men) to be call'd
<hi>Positive,</hi> and sometimes also <hi>Civil,</hi> and an
additament of right reason natural.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">5. Civil right either <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar</hi> to one Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> This <hi>Positive</hi> Right may with good reason
be distinguished into that which is proper
and singular to some <hi>one Nation</hi> or People
coalescent into a Society; (such long ago
was that <hi>Patria potestas</hi> among the <hi>Romans,</hi>
and that which was in use at <hi>Athens,</hi>
mention'd by <hi>Demosthenes (in Orat. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
Aristocratem</hi>) and that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to many Nations. Which is again
distinguish'd into <hi>that,</hi> to the observation
whereof more Nations than one are at
once, equally, and in common obliged:
and <hi>that</hi> under which many Nations live,
not at the same time, equally, and from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64291:11"/>
any common Obligation, but singly and
by accident. Of this triple Species of
<hi>Positive</hi> Right the <hi>first</hi> may conveniently
be term'd <hi>Right simply Civil,</hi> as pertinent
to some one City or Commonwealth: The
<hi>Second, Common Right of many Nations,</hi>
because of the communion of obligation:
The <hi>third, Civil</hi> or <hi>Domestick Right</hi> of
some or many Nations, because the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
under which they are, is only
domestick and civil to each of them singly,
not common to all. For example, the
twelve Tables brought from <hi>Athens</hi> to
<hi>Rome</hi> obtain'd to be of equal force in both
Nations, the <hi>Attic</hi> and the <hi>Roman:</hi> But from
no communion of Obligation or Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Peoples. The Right of those Tables
therefore might much more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
have been call'd, the <hi>Civil Right</hi> of
these Nations, than simply the Right of
Both, because this later phrase indicates a
Communion.<note place="margin">6. Right com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and <hi>Interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</hi>
                     </note> But as for the <hi>Common Right</hi>
of more than one Nation founded upon
communion of Obligation; this likewise
is to be parted into two branches: <hi>viz.</hi>
that which is <hi>Imperative</hi> to many Nations
or Peoples, and that which is <hi>Intervenient.</hi>
By <hi>Imperative,</hi> we mean that Right of
Nations, which is or ought to be observ'd
by many Nations or Peoples, otherwise
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64291:12"/>
subject to divers Governments and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Powers, from an Obligation common
indeed to every one of them, and equal,
but deriv'd from the Command either of God
or of Man. Such was the Right of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopes,
Magnetes, Phthiotae, Thessali,</hi> and
other peoples of <hi>Graecia,</hi> who by a common
Obligation receiv'd from the Command of
<hi>Acrisius</hi> King of the <hi>Argives,</hi> were under
the jurisdiction of the Great <hi>Amphictyonic</hi>
Council at <hi>Athens.</hi> Such also was the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Right of War by God prescrib'd not
only to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but to the <hi>Canaanites</hi>
too, with whom they were to make War.
For both Nations were obliged though <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versimodè,</hi>
by the Authority of the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</hi>
And when divers Nations convene
in like manner into the same Right, by
the Authority and Command of the <hi>Pope</hi>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is to be call'd an <hi>Imperative
Right</hi> of those Nations. But we call the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervenient</hi>
Right of Nations, that which
ariseth, not from an Empire common to
many, but from intervenient pact or use of
Customs, and is wont to be call'd <hi>Ius
Gentium Secundarium.</hi> Heads of this Right
are remarkable in the Right of demanding
satisfaction for injury, of proclaiming War,
of Embassies, of Captives, of Hostages,
of Leagues, of Commerces, and other like
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64291:12"/>
things usually intervenient among divers
Nations. For what Right soever, in these
things, is made up of the Additions that
have come to the Universal Obligative
Right of Nations, and of the Mutations that
have come to the Universal Permissive
Right, among divers Nations; all that,
and not more, deserves the name of either
<hi>Imperative</hi> or <hi>Intervenient.</hi> The rest, 'tis
evident, retains the name of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
or most ancient Right of Nations. The
<hi>Caesarian</hi> Right also, which is so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
upon in the above-mention'd Heads
of <hi>Intervenient</hi> Right, when they come to
be discuss'd by Jurisconsults, so far forth as
it agrees with the Universal Right of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
whether Natural or Divine, is
also to be put under the same name: But
so far as the Heads and some Decrees of
it, which are not of Universal Right,
are made use of from the consent of
some Nations, with whom they are in
force; it is most fitly to be denoted by
the Title of Right <hi>Intervenient</hi> among
those Nations. And in fine, so far as
the same <hi>Caesarean</hi> Right is by some
single Nations receiv'd into their <hi>Forum</hi>
or Court of Judicature; it is to be
named the Civil Right of some Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or their Domestick Right.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:64291:13"/>
From this consideration of the nature,
various notions,<note place="margin">7. Right di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd from Law.</note> and differences of <hi>Right,</hi>
we may easily be able to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
those two things, which many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Writers confound, using the words
<hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> promiscuously. For from
the Premisses it may be collected, that
<hi>Right</hi> consisteth in liberty of doing or not
doing: But <hi>Law</hi> obligeth to do, or not to
do, and therefore Right and Law differ as
Liberty and Obligation, which about the
same thing are inconsistent.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may define <hi>Natural Right,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">8. Natural <hi>Right,</hi> and</note> to
be <hi>the Liberty, which every man hath of
using, according to his own will and pleasure,
his power to the conservation of his Nature;</hi>
and (by consequence) <hi>of doing all things
that he shall judge to be conducive thereunto:</hi>
Understanding by <hi>Liberty</hi> (what that word
properly signifies) Absence of external im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Natural Law,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">9. Natural <hi>Law</hi> defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> to be <hi>a Precept, or
General Rule excogitated by reason, by which
every man is prohibited to do that which he
shall judge to tend to his hurt, harm, or
wrong.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>Nature</hi> all Wise men understand the
Order,<note place="margin">10. That all the Laws of <hi>Nature</hi> are the Laws of <hi>God.</hi>
                     </note> Method and Oeconomy instituted
and established by God from the beginning
or Creation, for Government and Conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64291:13"/>
of the World. All the Laws of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
therefore are the Laws of God: And
that which is called <hi>Natural,</hi> and <hi>Moral,</hi>
is also <hi>Divine</hi> Law: as well because Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
which is the very Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> is
given by God to every man for a rule of his
Actions; as because the Precepts of living,
which are thence deriv'd, are the very
same that are promulged by the Divine
Majesty for Laws of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
by our most blessed Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
and by the Holy <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Apostles;</hi>
nor is there in Truth any one Branch of
Natural or Moral Law, which may not
be plainly and fully confirm'd by the Divine
Laws delivered in Holy Scripture: as will
soon appear to any man who shall atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
read and consider what our <hi>Master
Hobbs</hi> hath with singular judgment writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the 4<hi>th.</hi> Chapter of his Book <hi>de Cive:</hi>
where he confirms all the Laws of Nature
by comparing them singly with Divine
Precepts given in the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Whoever therefore desires clearly
to understand the Reasonableness, Equity,
Justice, and Utility of <hi>Moral</hi> Laws, and
the true Causes of the Obligation under
which he is to observe them, in order to
his Felicity, as well in this life, as in that
which is to come; ought most seriously
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64291:14"/>
and profoundly to consider the <hi>Divine</hi> Laws
or Precepts recorded in that Collection
of Sacred Writings call'd the <hi>Bible.</hi> Which
I, though of Learning inferiour to so
Noble an undertaking, and subject by
the Nature of my Profession and Studies
to various Distractions every day, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
with my self to attempt, according
to the Module of my weak understanding,
not for Information of Others, but for my

that it belongs not to the right of any Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Ruler, either <hi>to command what God

The reason is, because, as in Natural causes,
the <hi>Inferiour</hi> have no force against the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of the <hi>Superior;</hi> so it is in <hi>Moral</hi> also.
Upon which reason St. <hi>Austin</hi> seems to
have fixt his most discerning Eye, when
teaching that the Commands of Kings and
Emperors, so far as they contradict any
<hi>Divine</hi> Command, cannot impose an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to Obedience; advances to his
conclusion by the degrees of this Climax or
Scale. <q>If the Curator commands some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
it is not to be done if the Procon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul
forbids. Herein we contemn not the
Power, but choose to obey the Higher.
Again if the Proconsul bid one thing,
and the Emperor injoin the contrary,
without doubt you must give obedience
to the Emperor. Therefore if the Emperor
exact one thing and God another; what is
to be done? God is certainly the greater
Power: give us leave, O Emperor, to
obey Him. From the same reason that
most wise Emperor, <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> also
said, the Magistrates judge private men;

By the <hi>Civil</hi> I understand that which in the

<hi>The Kingdom of God,</hi> and which is most
properly call'd <hi>Kingdom,</hi> because constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

by express pact or covenant chose God to
be their King: He promising to give them
possession of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and they
promising to obey him in all things. But
this Kingdom being by Divine Justice, for
the disobedience and many rebellions of that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64291:15"/>
perverse people, long since extinct, they
now remain in the same state of subjection
with all other Nations, namely under the

also to all the Sons of Men of what Nation
soever. Which the Learned <hi>Cunaeus</hi> hath

judgment observ'd in words of this sense.
<q>The Laws of other Nations, inventions of

whom God had consituted His Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative

for us to assert the <hi>Vniversal Extent</hi> of
them from this reason, that the <hi>Divine</hi>
Law of the <hi>Decalogue</hi> is an Explication of
the Law <hi>Natural</hi> written in the mind of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
individual man from the beginning;
though we must at the same time acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that the very giving the same in
<hi>Precept</hi> to the <hi>Iews,</hi> added a new Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Obligation to the former; so that
the <hi>Iew</hi> doing the contrary, not only
offended in doing an act simply vitious, but
also in doing an act strictly <hi>for bidden;</hi> because
(as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 23.) <hi>by the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of the Law he dishonoureth God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this different Obligation of Laws
Natural and Divine may be yet more clearly
understood,<note place="margin">4. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Law <hi>natural</hi> &amp; <hi>positive</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, as to their <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</hi>
                     </note> we observe, that the <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
of human actions ariseth, either from
their <hi>own Nature;</hi> as to Honour and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God, is due; to lye, unlawful of it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64291:16"/>
self: or from the <hi>Positive Divine Law.</hi>
Those of the <hi>former</hi> sort are referr'd to the
Law <hi>Natural:</hi> Those of the <hi>Latter</hi> are such
as have been prescribed by God, some to
single persons, namely to <hi>Abraham, Isaac,
Iacob, Moses,</hi> and other servants of God:
among all People, to <hi>Israel</hi> alone God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
many Positive Laws pertaining to
their Religion, which was the same with
their Politie. To all mankind, some things
were commanded for a time; as the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> presently after the
Creation, as many of the most Learned
think; the Law of not eating bloud, or
the strangled, after the floud: Others
to last for ever, as the institutions of
<hi>Christ,</hi> concerning Excommunication,
Baptism, the Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if there be
any more of that kind. So that one and
the same vitious action is more or less offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
to God, according to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it to be so by Positive Law, or by
meer light of reason, <hi>i. e.</hi> by Law Natural.
Because though both Laws be Divine, yet
the Obligation of the former is double,
of the later single.</p>
                  <p>Having thus,<note place="margin">5. The impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Premisses, &amp; <hi>design</hi> of the subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse.</note> Briefly indeed, but plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
asserted Gods Right to the Monarchy of
the whole World; distinguish'd His Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Dominion from His Civil; defined what
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64291:17"/>
is Law Natural, what Positive Divine;
and shewn the difference betwixt that and
this, as to their Obligation: it seems to
me, that I have not only prevented all such
erroneous conceptions, which otherwise
might arise, either from <hi>Ambiguity</hi> of the
words, <hi>Right, Dominion, Government,
Law,</hi> and <hi>Obligation;</hi> or from <hi>Confusion</hi> of
various Notions of single things: But also
laid the Corner Stone as it were, of the little
structure I propose to my self to erect, in
order to the stronger defence of my mind
against allurements to do evil, <hi>i. e.</hi> to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
any of God's Laws. For in this illaborate
exercise of my pen, I have no other end or
<hi>design</hi> but this; to investigate and examine
the perfect <hi>Concordance</hi> betwixt the Laws of
Nature, and Positive Divine Laws, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
those of the <hi>Decalogue;</hi> to the end
that being at length fully convinced of the
double Obligation incumbent on me not to
transgress any one of the latter sort, I may
in the little remnant of my days do my best
devoir to live more inoffensively both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
God, and toward Men. For certainly
who is throughly conscious of the justice,
equity, and decency of Religious Duties, will
be so much the more solicitous to perform
them: because the more the <hi>understanding</hi>
is illuminate by the rays of Truth and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64291:17"/>
Evidence, by so much the less prone it is
to be imposed upon by the specious pretexts
of Passions, and by consequence the more
apt to direct its Handmaid the <hi>Will</hi> in the
right way to <hi>Felicity;</hi> which consists in the
Knowledge, Love, and Veneration of
God.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Method;</hi> the work in which my
thoughts are at present versed, will be in
bulk so little,<note place="margin">6. The <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi> and <hi>Heads</hi> of the same.</note> I need not be over curious
what <hi>Form</hi> to give it; the Materials so few,
I need not be solicitous in what <hi>Order</hi> to
range them to the best advantage. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
affectation therefore of ornament from
either of those two things, and without
farther amusing my self with variety of
distinctions (many times of more subtilty
than use) I will content my self with
tracing, as faithfully as I can, the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
of <hi>Time,</hi> or (to speak a little more
plainly) reciting and considering the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Moral</hi> Laws, whether meerly <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,</hi>

Which before I recite, three things not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together

there hath been no Age wherein these <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi>
have not obtained; therefore take
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64291:18"/>
them for the Natural and Common Right
of all men. Whence we may receive a
glimps of Light whereby to discern, both
what they thought of the Religion of the
Ancients before the Law, and upon what
condition it was lawful for Strangers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
in the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> after the Law.
For, while the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were <hi>sui juris, i e.</hi>
lived under no Laws but those of their own
Republick, within their territory no dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
was permitted to any Idolatrous Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile.
But the Stranger, who in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence

the seven Precepts of the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi>
and promised to observe them, was held to

promiscuous use with other utensils; nor
was it permitted, either to possess, or to
sell Victims, Oblations, Vessels, instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
consecrated to idolatrous uses. Nor
was any thing, whose use had been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,
to be retain'd; but either burned,
or broken in pieces, and thrown into the
Air, River or Sea: nay the very ashes or
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64291:22"/>
coals thereof were an abomination. But
an Idol it self, if melted or broken in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and applied to common uses by a <hi>Gentile,</hi>
before it came into the possession of an <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite,</hi>
might be kept, and among other
utensils commodious to life used: because
the liquation, comminution, and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
thereof to common uses by the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi>
was a manifest <hi>Resecration</hi> or Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Religion of it: and the Idol be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once resecrate, all furniture and uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils
belonging to it, are so too. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
has not been made by <hi>Man,</hi> as a
Mountain, Fountain, River, four-footed
Beast, and other Terrestrial things, the
works of Nature, tho' worship'd as an
Idol; the use and possession thereof was
not prohibited. A Grove or Tree planted
by a <hi>Gentile</hi> for Worship, or only to sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
or adorn an Idol was so abominable,
that to an <hi>Israelite,</hi> it was unlawful either
to shelter himself from heat, cold, rain or
wind under the boughs of it; or to pass
through it, if there were any other way;
or to eat the Eggs or Young of Birds build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their nest in the branches of it; to
bring home the wood for building, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of agriculture, or fewel, or to
eat any bread or meat dress'd with fire
made of the wood; or to wear cloth wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64291:23"/>
with a shuttle of the wood; or to
make use of the ashes. And yet the use
of herbs growing there, was not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
because the soil it self was unpolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Now of all these things, whatever
was unlawful to an <hi>Israelite</hi> to do, or pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess;
the same was equally unlawful to a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selyte</hi>
of the <hi>House.</hi> And this is a Summary

of their <hi>Rabbins</hi> judiciously remark'd, <hi>de
Iure Natur. &amp; Gent. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 10. The
more notable Interdicts of Idolatry, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide,
Unlawful Coition, were not to
be violated, tho' to avoid the danger of
imminent Death: for of a less danger no
account is made. In time of publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
life was not to be redeem'd by
violation of any Law. At another time,
it was sufficient to violation of the Law, to
obey the person impellent by menaces of
Death, rather than to be kill'd; at least
if the act turn'd to the emolument of the
impellent: as where work was to be done
for him upon the Sabbath, or if ten or
more <hi>Hebrews</hi> were not present. To a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64291:24"/>
sick man it was lawful to eat things prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,
to deliver himself from death. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
a sin against more establish'd customs
or manners and humane society, tho' not
against the Law, is a <hi>Prophanation of the
Holy Name.</hi> Nor is such Prophanation in
any case observ'd to have been fully remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to any man before the very moment of
death; according to that of <hi>Isai. cap. 22.

of the Divine Name,</hi> when any reproach and
audacious contumely is openly and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
thrown forth against God; such as was
cast forth by those most impious miscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
the son of <hi>Shelomith (Levit.</hi> 24.)
and <hi>Rabshakeh</hi>'s (<hi>Kings 2. ch. 18. v.</hi> 30.)
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64291:24"/>
Also when the Divine Majesty is understood
to be knowingly and proudly <hi>denied,</hi> from
the consequence of any Act or Profession:
as when any man, not from Ignorance,
but out of Malapertness and Pride, profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
and endeavors to perswade others,
that Idolatry is to be imbraced; this man,
tho' he hath himself worship'd no Idol,
denies God by consequence, and is to be
held a <hi>Blasphemer.</hi> And against this most
execrable impiety is turned the edge of
that Sacred Law (<hi>Numb. 15. 30.) But
the Soul that doth</hi> ought <hi>presumptuously,

and that Soul shall be cut off from among his
People.</hi> Upon which Law <hi>Maimonides</hi>
commenting (<hi>More Neboch. pa. 3. c.</hi> 41.)
saith; <q>No man so sinneth, but he into
whose Soul another opinion, that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the Law, hath crept. The
Scripture there speaks also <hi>de Cultu Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo,</hi>
because that is opposite to the very
foundation of the Law.</q> So that a Bals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer
is equal to an Idolater, both deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fundamental Principle of all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Other sins committed from error, or
ignorance, or force of concupiscence or
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64291:25"/>
pravity of manners, were to be expiated
by certain Sacrifices, or corrected by
other sorts of punishments: Idolatry and
Blasphemy always to be punished by <hi>Exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
or cutting off, to be inflicted by Divine
Vengeance; but Blasphemy also by <hi>stoning,
(Levit.</hi> 24. 16.) And these explications
of the <hi>Hebrew Doctors</hi> seem to me suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to evince the equal Obligation of these
two Precepts concerning Divine Worship,

even by slaying the Offender persevering in
his sin. By this receiv'd Right of Zelots,
<hi>Mattathias (Macchab. lib. 1. cap. 2. v.</hi> 24.)
kill'd a <hi>Iew</hi> going to sacrifice after the
<hi>Grecian</hi> rite: and our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>
himself, as a private Person, by whipping
drove out Money-Changers and Buyers and
Sellers Violating the Sanctity of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
without reprehension; because they
had prophanely made the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi>
a Den of Thieves: and his Disciples refer'd
this fact of their Lord to <hi>Zeal of thy House.</hi>
Under pretext of the same Right, the
<hi>Iews</hi> in their Assembly ran upon our Lord
Himself as guilty of Blasphemy, and smote
him on the Face with their hands: and a
Servant of the High Priest struck him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64291:28"/>
because he seem'd, by an irreverent
answer, to have violated the Sanctity of
the High Priest. In fine, under the same
pretext, St. <hi>Stephen</hi> was stoned to death,
and a Conspiracy undertaken against St.
<hi>Paul;</hi> and at length in the <hi>Iewish</hi> War
sprang up from the same root a power of
horrid Villanies and dire Mischiefs.</p>
                  <p>From this Universal Interdict of Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide,<note place="margin">7.

                     </note>
what we read of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s readiness
to immolate his Son <hi>Isaac,</hi> seems very
much to derogate: and some there
are, who think it to have been
lawful to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> from the
Sacred Law <hi>de Anathemate,</hi> of a
thing vowed or devoted, by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Consecration, to devote
to death their Sons and Servants whom
they had in their power; and they affirm,
that <hi>Iephtha</hi> offer'd up his devoted Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in Sacrifice. Yea <hi>Iosephus (Antiq. l.</hi> 5.
<hi>c.</hi> 9.) professeth himself to be of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but hath been clearly convicted of Error
therein by his Rival in the search of the
<hi>Iewish</hi> Antiquities, our incomparable
<hi>Selden;</hi> who (<hi>de Iur. Nat. &amp; Gent. lib. 4.
cap.</hi> 11.) from <hi>Rabbi Kimchi</hi>'s commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and the very words of the Sacred
Text, concludes most rationally, that
<hi>Iephtha,</hi> in accomplishment of his Vow,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64291:28"/>
built a house for his Daughter in a solitary
place, and brought her into it; where she
remain'd during life secluded from the Sons
of Men, and from all secular affairs; and
it was a Statute in <hi>Israel,</hi> that the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Israel</hi> should yearly visit her, to
condole her perpetual Virginity. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indeed is said to have deplored the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
of his Vow, and rent his Garments for
sorrow: but not because he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
thereby bound to immolate her, but
because he had cut off all hope of <hi>Issue</hi> from
her. So that she seems to have been rather
the first <hi>Nun</hi> in the World, not an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of a Right granted, by the Law <hi>de
Anathemate,</hi> to the <hi>Iews</hi> of consecrating
or devoting their Children to death. For
Humane slaughter was by no Right of the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> permitted, unless in case of legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
punishment, and of just War: and
then too the very Act of Killing was in it
self reputed so hateful and impure, that
it required solemn lustration of the Actor, by
virtue of this Command (<hi>Numb.</hi> 31. 19.)
<hi>Whoever hath kill'd any Man</hi> [Malefactor
justly condemned, or Enemy in War] <hi>and

That Uterine Sisters ought
not to be taken for Wives. Also <hi>Solon</hi> the
<hi>Athenian</hi> permitted the Marriage of Sisters
begotten by the same Father, not those
born of the same Mother; as <hi>Philo Iudae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
(de Spec. leg. p.</hi> 602.) delivers. And
he had reason, more perhaps than he or
any man else then understood. For if the
curious Observations of Dr. <hi>Harvey, De
Graaf, Swammerdam,</hi> and other Anatomists
of this our Age be true (as doubtless they
are) the Father contributes much less to
the generation of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> than the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth. He gives only <hi>fecundity</hi> to the
Egg, in and of which pre-existent in her
<hi>Ovary</hi> the <hi>Foetus</hi> is formed: she gives the
seminal matter, the Augmenting Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the cherishing Warmth, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Closet in which it is conserved and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64291:30"/>
brought to perfection. And therefore the
Consanguinity betwixt Brothers and Sisters
of the same <hi>Womb</hi> seems to be Naturally
greater than betwixt those born of divers
Mothers, but of the same Father: and
by consequence, the Interdict of Marriage
to those, is founded upon more of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Right. But this reason being occult
to <hi>Solon,</hi> I am inclin'd to think, that in
making this Law against Marriage of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Sister Uterine, either he follow'd
the example of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> or had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to this Proverbial saying, <hi>the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
is still the surest side.</hi>

the cause and mystery of this Marriage of

Means the Goods being easily found,
the Loser recovered what was his

Impossible, that all men should abstain
from Stealing, the Maker of this Law
found out a way, by which the whole

Theft, who made any Gain to himself by
Playing at Dice, Cockal, Tables, or
committing Wild or Tame Beasts, or Fowls
to fight together, to make sport for the
Spectators. For they judged no Gain to be
honest, that arose from a Contract depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon Fortune. But it was not Theft,
if a <hi>Iew</hi> contending with a <hi>Gentile</hi> won the
Prize or Wager: tho' that also, as a thing
Inutile or Unprofitable to Humane Society
were prohibited. By the same Ancient

Right, he also was a <hi>Thief,</hi> who so bred
up and taught Doves or other Birds,
or Beasts Wild or Tame, as that they
should fly or go abroad, and alluring or
decoying others of the same kind, bring
them home, to the gain of their Owner:
nor was it lawful to go a Fowling after
Pigeons in a place inhabited, or within
Four Miles thereof: because Pigeons were
reckoned among the Goods of other Men,
and were nourished by the Owners, either
for Sacrifices, or for food. Nor was it
lawful for any man to build a Dove-House
in his Field, unless he had Ground of his
own lying round about it, of Fifty Cubits

                  </p>
                  <p>It was told <hi>Iudah, Thamar thy Daughter

anger, is by no means to be accepted for
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64291:43"/>
a <hi>Iuridical Sentence.</hi> For by the Law of
<hi>Moses (Levit.</hi> 21. 9.) the Priests Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was for Fornication (the <hi>Masters</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand

to be burnt alive. But <hi>Thamar</hi>
was neither Priests Daughter, nor Wife,
but a Widow expecting to be Married to
the Brother of her Husband deceas'd; and
this Law was not then made. Others
think, that there was such a Law peculiar
to this Family, to which <hi>Iudah</hi> had respect:
which is in truth repugnant to the <hi>Ius No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>achidarum,</hi>
by which it was accounted no
Crime for an unmarried Woman, to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
her self to whom she pleas'd. Of
which Right <hi>Maimonides</hi> being conscious,
and speaking of this our <hi>Thamar,</hi> saith;

sicut coitus hominis cum Vxore suâ; hoc est,
licitus erat, nec homini fugiendus,</hi> [<hi>velut

of this ancient Right then obtaining, was
not to be held guilty. Whence other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters

not burning to death, but a <hi>Stigmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing</hi>
or Marking in the Forehead with an
hot Iron, by which she might be known
to be an Harlot. Again, when <hi>Thamar</hi>
was brought forth (not <hi>ad poenam,</hi> as the

any thing of detriment: and that they
might constitute these Judges, either by
electing them out of the Proselytes
themselves, or from among the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi>
at their pleasure. In another place
(<hi>viz. c.</hi> 9.) he saith, a <hi>Noachid</hi> is put
to death by the Sentence of one Judge,
and upon the Testimony of one Witness;
and that without Premonition and the
Testimony of Neighbours: but not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Testimony of a Woman. Nor
was it lawful to a Woman to give judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  <p>On the other side, by the <hi>Civil Right</hi>
of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> three Judges at least were
to hear and determine Causes Pecuniary,

not without Plurality of Witnesses,

of the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> the Violation of these
Seven Precepts was punish'd in a <hi>Proselyte</hi>
of the <hi>House,</hi> with death inflicted by a
Sword: but an <hi>Israelite,</hi> by his own Right,
was not to be punish'd with death, for Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the three latter. No <hi>Gentile</hi> that was
under Age of discretion, or Blind, or Deaf,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64291:45"/>
or Mad, was punish'd; because such were
not reputed Sons of the Precepts, <hi>i. e.</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable

was a Blasphemer, or an Idolater, or an
Adulterer with the Wife of a <hi>Noachid,</hi> and
after that made a <hi>Proselyte</hi> of <hi>Iustice,</hi> was
not to be call'd into Judgment, but was
free: but if he had slain an <hi>Israelite,</hi> or
committed Adultery with the Wife of an
<hi>Israelite,</hi> and were after made a <hi>Proselyte</hi>
of <hi>Iustice;</hi> he was to be punish'd, with the
Sword, for Homicide; with a Halter,
for Adultery; that is with the punishments
of the <hi>Israelites.</hi> By the vertue of Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytism,
which was Regeneration by the

Equals, yea also against God Himself, were
purged away: those committed against an

Form and Rites ordain'd in the <hi>Mosaic</hi> Law,
by which it was Enacted, under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of <hi>Excision,</hi> that all Sacrifices should
be Immolated at the Door of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle:
Whence some Learned Men infer,
that he lived before the Law was given.
Others affirm, that there never was any
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64291:46"/>
such Man, and the Book that bears that
name, is not a true History, but a Parable,
or Poem (for the Original is written in
Verse) concerning Providence Divine.
Which of these two Opinions is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd,
I pretend not now to enquire.
Certain it is however, that this Book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
many remarkable things pertaining to
<hi>Natural Law,</hi> principally these following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of Idolatry.</hi> (Chap. 31. v. 26.) If I
beheld the Sun when it shined, or the Moon
walking in brightness: and my heart hath
been secretly enticed, or my mouth kissed my
hand: this also were an Iniquity to be punish'd
by the Iudge: for I should have denied the
God that is above.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of Blasphemy.</hi> (Chap. 1. v. 5.) In
the Morning he Offer'd Burnt-Offerings ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the number of them all. For <hi>Job</hi>
said, it may be that my Sons have sinned,
and cursed God in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of Homicide.</hi> (Chap. 31. v. 29.) If
I rejoyced at the destruction of him that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me, or lift up my self when evil found him.
Neither have I suffered my Mouth to sin, by
wishing a curse to his Soul. If the Men of
my Tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of
his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of Adultery.</hi> (Chap. 31. v. 9.) If my
heart hath been deceived by a Woman, or
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64291:46"/>
if I have laid wait at my Neighbours door:
then let my Wife grind unto another, and
let others bow down upon her; <hi>or, as the
Vulgar Latin,</hi> Scortum alterius sit Vxor
mea. <hi>To turn about a Mill, was among
the ancient Services of Women.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of Theft, or the unlawful laying hands
upon the Goods of another.</hi> (Chap. 31.
v. 7.) If any blot have cleaved to my hands:
then let me saw, and let another eat; yea,
let my Offspring be rooted out.</p>
                  <p>Of Judgments he speaks in <hi>Chap. 29.
from v. 7. to the end,</hi> where he relates,
that Himself had in the days of his Prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
sate on the Tribunal, and been a Prince
among the Judges of his Nation.</p>
                  <p>Most evident it is then, that all these
Precepts of the Sons of <hi>Noah</hi> obtain'd
among, and were Sacred to the <hi>Idumeans,</hi>
who lived not under the Laws of <hi>Moses.</hi>

                  <head type="sub">Of not eating any Member of an Animal alive.</head>

which is the Fruit of a Tree yeilding Seed: to
you it shall be for Meat.</hi> After he said to

in the same form with the Immola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Son to <hi>Moloch. (Levit. 20. 3.)
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64291:47"/>
I will set my face against him that eateth
blood.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. The <hi>reason</hi> of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict.</note> Nor is this manner of speaking to
be found in any third Precept: which <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi>
well observes (<hi>in More Nebochim
part 3. c. 46. pag.</hi> 484.) because the eating
of blood gave occasion to the Worship of
Devils, and he fetcheth the reason of the
Interdict from Idolaters who thought blood
to be the meat of <hi>Daemons.</hi> Hence also it
is commanded (<hi>Levit.</hi> 17. 10.) that the
blood of Victims be sprinkled upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar;
and moreover that it be covered with
dust, or sprinkled upon the Ground as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Some of the <hi>Zabii</hi> used to eat the blood;
some others, who reckoned this to inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
at the killing of a Beast reserv'd the
blood, and put it into a Vessel or Trench,
and then sitting down in a Circle about it,
eat up the flesh, and pleas'd themselves with
an opinion, that their <hi>Daemons</hi> fed upon
the blood, and that this manner of sitting
at the same Table with their Gods, would
endear them to a nearer tie of Conversation
and Familiarity; and promising to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
also, that these Spirits would insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
themselves in dreams, and render them
capable of Prophesy and Predicting things
to come. Now in reference to these absurd
and Idolatrous ways of the <hi>Amorites</hi> it was,
that God expresly forbad his People to eat
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64291:48"/>
blood, for so some of the <hi>Zabians</hi> did; and
to prevent their imitation of others who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
it in a Vessel, he commanded that
the blood should be spilt upon the ground
like water. And with the same respect to
the <hi>Zabian</hi> Rites it seems to be, that it
was also forbidden (<hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 19. and
<hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 21.) to any man of <hi>Israel,</hi> to
<hi>Seeth a Kid or Lamb in his Mothers milk,</hi>
as our many-Tongued Mr. <hi>Gregory (in Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hum.</hi>)
hath Learnedly asserted.</p>
                  <p>The Law in another place (<hi>viz. Deut.</hi> 14.
21.) saith,<note place="margin">3. The <hi>Law</hi> against eating of any thing that died of it self, and of any Member torn off from an Animal alive: and the reason thereof.</note> 
                     <hi>Ye shall not eat</hi> [morticinum
ullum] <hi>of any thing that dieth of it self.
Thou shalt give it unto the Stranger that is
within thy gates, that he may eat it: or
thou mayst sell it unto an Alien.</hi> Whence
some collect, that the eating of blood was
not forbidden to either Proselytes of the
House, or the Sons of <hi>Noah;</hi> but only of
flesh torn from an Animal alive; as the
Stones of a Lamb cut out. <hi>Maimonides
(More Neboch. part 3. cap. 48. pag.</hi> 496.)
brings these reasons of the Interdict: both
because that is a sign of Cruelty, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Kings of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in that age
were wont so to do, upon the account of
Idolatry; namely they cut some Member
from a living Creature, and eat it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:64291:48"/>
Nor is this so strange a thing,<note place="margin">4. Examples of such cruelty &amp; carnage in <hi>Baccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.</hi>
                     </note> since <hi>Clem.
Alexandrinus (in Protreptico, p.</hi> 9.) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorates
the same execrable cruelty and
Bestial Carnage to have been practised in
<hi>Bacchanals: Bacchi orgiis celebrant Dionysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
Maenolem, crudarum carnium esu sacram
insaniam agentes, &amp; caesarum carnium di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsionem

Nay more inhumanity yet hath been So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
practised in the furious Devotion of
the Adorers of the same drunken Diety.
<hi>Prophyry (de Abstinentia l. 3. sect.</hi> 55.) saith;
<hi>In Chio sacrificabant Baccho</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

(as hath been said) first to Mankind in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and after revived in <hi>Mara</hi> (according

exercised my unequal Pen; Some
have subjoined <hi>another,</hi> of <hi>Honouring Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</hi>
But of this, tho' equally Natural
with the former, and among Moral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
principal, I defer to speak, until the
Thred of the Method I have prescrib'd to my
self in this disquisition, shall have brought
me to the first Precept in the Second Table
of the <hi>Decalogue:</hi> both because some of the
<hi>Masters</hi> do not reckon it in the number of
the Primitive and Genuine Precepts of the
Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> but affirm that it was not
given until the <hi>Israelites</hi> were encamped in
<hi>Marah;</hi> and because I would prevent repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of the same things in divers places.
Nor doth any thing more, concerning the
Seven Precepts precedent, occur to my mind
at this time, that seems of moment enough
to excuse me, if by insisting thereupon I
should longer defer to put a Period to this

                     <hi>Written</hi> Laws, such as were committed
to Writing, and consecrated to the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Observation of Posterity. Of this
sort, the <hi>Mosaic</hi> Laws certainly are, as
the best, so also the <hi>First</hi> of all known in
the World. The <hi>Grecians</hi> indeed, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
of the honour of being reputed Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

among many other benefits, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they boast themselves to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
other Nations, put <hi>Legislation</hi> in the
head of the Account. <hi>Lycurgus, Draco, Solon,</hi>
and other ancient Sages, are great Names
they glory in. But their Glory is altogether
vain. For all the pretensions and brags of
that arrogant Nation in this kind, have
been long since refuted and silenced by the
Jew <hi>Flavius Iosephus,</hi> in his <hi>Apology</hi> against
<hi>Apion,</hi> full of admirable Learning. There
he shews, that the <hi>Greek</hi> Legislators,
compar'd to <hi>Moses,</hi> are but of Yesterday:
for at what time their Father <hi>Homer</hi> liv'd,
they knew not the <hi>name</hi> of Laws, nor is
it extant in all his Poems; only the People
had in their Mouth certain common sayings
and sentences, whereby they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd;
to supply the defects whereof, the
unwritten Edicts of Princes were upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
added. And he had reason. For the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64291:50"/>
truth is, <hi>Moses,</hi> Senior to <hi>Homer</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ages, was the first Writer and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisher
of Laws, teaching the People what
was <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong, just</hi> or <hi>unjust,</hi> and by
what Decrees the Common-wealth was to
be established, which the Most High God
had commanded to settle in <hi>Palestine.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time of this <hi>Moses,</hi> no Written Laws
were known in the World. For although
Mankind liv'd not altogether without Laws
before, yet were not those Laws consecrated
and kept in any Publick Records or Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Of this sort were the afore-recited
Seven Precepts given to the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi>
concerning certain Rules of Righteousness
necessary to humane life. Wherefore they
were of so large extent, that whosoever
knew them not, those the <hi>Israelites</hi> were
commanded to destroy by War, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
them of all Communion with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
and justly; for they that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
no Law, seem'd worse than Beasts;
and (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath Divinely spoken)
<hi>Injustice strengthened with Arms and Power,
is most cruel and intolerable</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It must then be acknowledg'd,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Moses,</hi> the <hi>Wisest</hi> of all Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers.</note> that of
all Legislators <hi>Moses</hi> was the most Ancient:
nor can it be with truth denied, that he
was also the <hi>Wisest.</hi> For he ordain'd such
a kind of Government, which cannot be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64291:51"/>
so significantly stil'd, either Monarchy,
or Oligarchy, or Democracy, as <hi>Theocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi>
that is, a Common-wealth whose
Ruler and President is God alone: openly
professing, that all affairs were managed
by Divine Judgment and Authority. And
of this he gave a full demonstration, in as
much as although he saw all matters depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon him, and had all the People at
his Devotion; yet upon so fair an invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he sought no Power, no Wealth, no
Honour for himself. A thing whereby he
shew'd himself more than Man. Then he
ordered that the Magistrates should not be
Lords and Masters, but Keepers of the Laws,
and Ministers. An excellent Constitution
this. For seeing that even the best Men
are sometimes transported by passion, the
Laws alone are they that speak with all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in one and the same Impartial Voice:
which may well be conceiv'd to be the
sense of that fine saying of <hi>Aristotle, The
Law is a Mind without Affection.</hi> To these
Two undeniable Arguments of admirable
Wisdom in <hi>Moses,</hi> may be added a <hi>Third</hi>
no less considerable, <hi>viz.</hi> the Eternal <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
of his Laws: whereto to add, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from
to take ought away, was a most
high offence. So that, neither Old Laws
were abolish'd, nor new brought in; but
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64291:51"/>
the observation of the first was with rigor
exacted of all, even in the declination of
that Common-wealth. Which was not so
in other Common-wealths, most of which
have been ruined by Law-making. The
<hi>reason</hi> of this diversity cannot be abstruse
to him that considers, that the Laws of
other Nations were the inventions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Wit, and enforced only by penalties,
that by time, or remissness of Rulers, lose
their Terror: but those of the <hi>Iews,</hi> being
the Decrees of the Eternal God, not ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
by continuance of time, or softness of
Judges, remain still the same; mens minds
being still kept in awe by Religion, as I
have in the former part of this discourse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated.
Now if in these Three things
(to which I might here subjoin others, if
I thought it necessary) the excellent Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Prudence of <hi>Moses</hi> be not clearly

words that follow; yet ought we to hold
for certain, that He spake them not by
Himself, or Immediately, but by an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi>
sent as an Embassador, acting in the
Name of the Most High God: which ought
to be understood also of other the like Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
that have hapned to Holy Men in
old times. For it was an <hi>Angel</hi> that spake
to <hi>Moses</hi> and the People in <hi>Sinah;</hi> if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Writer of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi>
(<hi>chap. 7. v.</hi> 38.) And so thought the
Grave <hi>Iosephus</hi> also, when (<hi>Antiq. l.</hi> 15.)
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64291:53"/>
he said, <hi>Cum nos dogmatum potissima, &amp;
Sanctissimam Legum partem per Angelos à
Deo acceperimus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They err greatly, who here by Angel
understand the Second Substance of God,
or Second Person in the Trinity. For God
spake indeed in various and manifold man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to the Fathers of old; but in the last
times He began to speak to us by His Son,
(<hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. 1.) The Law was given by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
by the ministry of [<hi>Internuncii</hi>] an
Embassador or Mediator (namely of <hi>Moses</hi>)
that it might be of force, until the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Seed should come (<hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 19.) And
the Writer to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> prefers the
Gospel to the Law from this, that the
Gospel was given by our Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
the Law only by Angels. (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 2.)</p>
                     <p>In which places <hi>Angels</hi> are named in
the Plural Number,<note place="margin">6. Why the Angel that pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Law, said, <hi>I am the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</note> tho' St. <hi>Stephen</hi> saith
<hi>Angel</hi> in the Singular; because such is the
manner of Visions of that kind, that there
is One <hi>Angel</hi> sustaining the Person and
Name of God, and others present with
him as <hi>Apparitors,</hi> or Ministers. As in
<hi>Gen. 18. &amp; Luke</hi> 2. 13. conferr'd with
1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 16. and with <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 39. 41.
49. As therefore the Angel that pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Law, saith, <hi>I Iehovah,</hi> so also do
other Angels, that have been likewise sent
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64291:54"/>
from God, as Embassadors, to transact
affairs of great Importance, speak in the first
Person, just as the Crier of a Court pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the words of the Judge; as St. <hi>Austin</hi>
(<hi>l. 2. de Trinitate c.</hi> 2.) makes the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison.
So <hi>Moses (Exod.</hi> 3. 15.) saith,
that the God <hi>Iehovah</hi> spake to him in the
Bush: and he that then spake to <hi>Moses,</hi> had
newly said, <hi>I who am,</hi> which is an explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the word <hi>Iehovah,</hi> i. e. <hi>Existens,</hi> or
Being; for Being without Beginning, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
End, and without Dependence, is
Proper to God alone. But St. <hi>Stephen</hi>
(<hi>Acts</hi> 7. 30.) saith, that an Angel of the
Lord appear'd to <hi>Moses</hi> in a Flame of Fire in
a Bush: and that from the Authority of
<hi>Moses</hi> himself. (<hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 2.) Of which
St. <hi>Athanasius (Orat.</hi> 6.) saith; <hi>Et vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavit
Dominus</hi> Mosem <hi>exrubo, dicens: Ego
sum Deus Patris tui: Deus</hi> Abraham, <hi>Deus</hi>

erat Deus</hi> Abraham, <hi>sed in Angelo loque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur
Deus; &amp; qui conspiciebatur, erat
Angelus, &amp;c.</hi> Of the same judgment was
the Author of the Responses to the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Christians, when he said; <hi>Angelorum,
qui Dei loco visi aut locuti sunt hominibus,

then, that the words recited in this place
of <hi>Exodus,</hi> were pronounced by an Angel
in the Name of God: but we are not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to believe the same of those that are in

among the most Learned of the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Doctors, whether Angels or Magistrates
are to be understood. But whensoever

[<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>defective,</hi> no doubt is to be made, but that
<hi>He</hi> alone is to be understood, who with
Highest and most absolute Empire presides
over all both Angels and Magistrates. But
to that word, the <hi>Possessive</hi> Case is wont to
be added, whereby it is signified, that
to this Most High God, besides the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Right He hath of most absolute Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over all Angels and Men, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
also a certain peculiar Right of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over some particular Men or Nation,
by vertue of not common benefits conferr'd
upon them. For such is the nature of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
that it always gives to him who
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64291:55"/>
hath conferr'd a benefit, somewhat of new
Right over him that hath receiv'd it. And
this is the cause, why here no mention is
made of God's Creation of Mankind in the
beginning, but of those things that proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belonged to the Posterity of <hi>Iacob,</hi> nor
of all those neither, but only of the most
recent, the memory whereof sticks more
firmly and efficaciously in the minds of
Men. Compare with this, the cause of
keeping the Law, which Fathers are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to deliver down to their Children,
in <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 10. and following verses.</p>
                     <p>Now what is said in this place,<note place="margin">9. The <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> to a Law ought to be brief and full of <hi>Authority.</hi>
                        </note> is not
Law, but a <hi>Preface</hi> to the Law, <hi>Seneca</hi>
indeed approves not of a Law with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
because a Law is made, not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade,
but to command. But <hi>Zaleucus,
Charondas, Plato, Philo,</hi> and some other
Philosophers were of another Opinion.
Certainly the middle way is the best; let
the Prologue be brief and grave, such as
carries the Face of Authority, not of
disputation.</p>
                     <p>The Number <hi>Ten</hi> is to almost all Nations
the end of numbering;<note place="margin">10. Why God, in these Precept, chose the number <hi>Ten.</hi>
                        </note> for the numbers
that follow, are distinguished by compound
names, either by the sound, as <hi>Vndecim,

as an Hundred, a Thousand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:64291:56"/>
and certainly the most ancient way of Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration
was by the Fingers, of which
Man hath Ten. For which reason, also
in these Precepts, which were above all
other things to be imprinted upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers
memory, God was pleas'd to choose
this number, wherein that all diversities
of numbers, all Analogies, all Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical
Figures relating to numbers, are
found; <hi>Philo</hi> largely shews in his Enarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Ten Precepts. And <hi>Martia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus

Nor was it from any other reason,
that the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> and after them the
<hi>Peripateticks</hi> referr'd all kinds of things into
Ten Classes, vulgarly call'd <hi>Categories:</hi>
or that not only in the Law, but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, <hi>Tenths</hi> were devoted to God;
as may be collected from the History of
<hi>Camillus</hi> written by <hi>Livy</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
and from <hi>Herodotus,</hi> who speaks of that
Custom as most ancient.</p>

                        </note>
also exacts our notice. It was given in a
Wilderness barren and desolate; with design,
that the People remote from the contagion
of Cities, and purged by hardship and sore
afflictions, and by Miracles taught not to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64291:56"/>
depend upon things created, might be
well prepared for that Common-wealth
which God was about to found and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish.</p>
                     <p>Nor ought we without a remark,<note place="margin">12. Why it is here said, <hi>Thy,</hi> in the singular number.</note> to

not only here in the Preface, but in the

the Law commanding and forbidding
speaks to every individual Man in the

may declare, that here the condition of

to be a <hi>Pleonasm,</hi> or redundance of

1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 8. 4. and 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3. 1. and
the meaning is, that other Gods are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<hi>Abenesdras, Moses Maimonides,</hi> and

both by the Tradition of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who
is said to have abandoned his Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and travell'd into a strange Land,
meerly out of detestation of this kind of

that of <hi>Deut. (Chap. 4. v.</hi> 19. and
<hi>Chap. 17. v.</hi> 3.) Now that the Sun,
Moon, and other Lights of Heaven are
<hi>false</hi> Gods, is most evident, not only from
hence, that no great goods or benefits
come from them to Mankind; but also
from this, that they neither understand
Mens adoration and prayers, nor have the
liberty of doing good more to one Man
than to another: which two things are

(that there might be Deities forsooth of

by the cunning and pride of their Posterity,
what by the adulation of the Learned of
those darker times, Deified and Adored;
and that too under the names of eminent
Stars. And from this Antique Custom
St. <hi>Chrysostom (ad 12. cap. Secundae ad

<hi>Sic enim Idolorum cultus primùm obtinuerunt,

King of the <hi>Phenicians</hi> was by them
consecrated into that Star, which the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
taught by the <hi>Phenicians,</hi> call'd from his
name <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And he is the same to whom, by way of
excellency named <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> i. e. <hi>The King,</hi> the
<hi>Phenicians</hi> used to sacrifice their children:
a most inhuman and execrable custom, that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64291:58"/>
from them descended down to the <hi>Tyrians</hi>
(a Colony of theirs) and from them to
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and other peoples of
<hi>Africa.</hi> Thus was <hi>Astarte</hi> also consecrated
into the planet <hi>Venus;</hi> and not long after
among the <hi>Egyptians, Osiris</hi> was stellified
into the <hi>Sun, Isis</hi> into the <hi>Moon.</hi> Thus
was <hi>Hammon</hi> translated into <hi>Aries,</hi> the
Ram; <hi>Derceto</hi> into <hi>Piscis,</hi> the Fish. But
of the <hi>Moors,</hi> a People of <hi>Mauritania,</hi>
St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith; <hi>manifestè Reges colunt,
nec ullo velamento hoc nomen obtexunt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the deification of Stars,<note place="margin">5. Whence it was that <hi>Brutes</hi> came to be worship'd as Gods.</note> and stelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of Men, in process of time they
proceeded to yet a higher degree of madness,
Idolizing of <hi>Brute</hi> Animals. For, either
because the <hi>Asterisms</hi> or Constellations of
Stars had been before, by the curious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers
of them, formed into the figures of
divers Animals, from some similitude they
fancied in One or more Stars; or because
some Animals were believ'd to have, I know
not what, secret Natural Cognation with
certain <hi>Asterism,</hi> and to receive a more
vigorous influence and virtue from them;
or perhaps for both these causes: therefore
were those Animals supposed to have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of Divine in their Natures, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
number'd among Deities by the
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> who adored them as such.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64291:59"/>
Hence an Ox was call'd <hi>Apis,</hi> with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to <hi>Luna,</hi> or <hi>Lunus</hi> rather (for a great
part of the East call'd that Planet by a
Masculine name;) the <hi>Phoenix</hi> (tho' pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
there never was any such Bird <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
natura</hi>) was worship'd as a favourite
of the Sun; as also were the Lizard, Lyon,
Dragon, Falcon, for the same reason; the
Bird <hi>Ibis,</hi> out of respect to <hi>Mercury;</hi> the
Dog, in respect to <hi>Sirius,</hi> the Dog-Star:
and in like manner other Animals al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
betwixt which and the <hi>Asterisms</hi> (to
which notwithstanding the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> gave
Figures different from those the <hi>Persians</hi>
imagined, and the <hi>Indians</hi> different from
those that either of those two Nations had
fancied) they conceiv'd any resemblance
of shape, or cognation of Nature to be.
They proceeded yet farther. Without any
respect at all to Celestial Bodies, they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
as Gods all such living Creatures that
were highly useful and profitable unto men;
such as are reckon'd up by <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi>
cited by <hi>Eusebius (in praeparat. Evang.</hi>) by
<hi>Pliny (l. 8. c.</hi> 27.) <hi>Philo (ad Praecept. Secun.</hi>)
and <hi>Porphyry (de abstinentia l.</hi> 4.) Now
of all these Brutal Deities of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi>
we need say no more than what we said
just now of the Host of Heaven, to prove
them to be false Gods; <hi>viz.</hi> that they neither
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64291:59"/>
understand the prayers, nor have power to
do good to one man more than to another
of their stupid adorers, as wanting the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of reason and election.</p>
                  <p>The same cannot be said of <hi>Angels,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">6. Honor due to good Angels, and what.</note> who
are able, both to hear and understand pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
address'd to them, and from a certain
liberty of mind to confer benefits upon those
whom they are commanded to favour and
assist. He therefore that honours them
with due respect and reverence, also he
that hopes to obtain some eminent benefit
by their help and assistance; doth not sin
against this Law: but he doth, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
to them the things that are proper
to the Most High God. For the word <hi>God</hi>
in this Precept, is to be understood <hi>in sensu
summitatis, i. e.</hi> as signifying the God of
Gods. Examples will illustrate the thing.
They sinned not who as often as Angels
appeared to them, shewed great veneration
of them by falling down upon their faces,
as in <hi>Ioshuah (c. 5. v.</hi> 14.) since as much
of honour as that comes to, was given al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to Prophets, without sin; as to him
that was thought to be <hi>Samuel</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.
15.) to <hi>Eliah</hi> (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 13.) to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
(2. 46.) Who forbids Offerings and
Sacrifices, doth not forbid a sign of simple
reverence. Nor did the Angel in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:64291:60"/>
refuse that honour, because there
was ought of unlawful in it, but because
he would shew that the Apostle was equal
to him, both being Ministers of Christ,
now head of the Angels, (see <hi>Coloss.</hi> 1.
16. 18.) and that an <hi>Apostolick</hi> Legation
designed for Mens salvation, was in no
part inferior to an <hi>Angelick:</hi> and Equals
are not wont to usurp such signs of submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
one of the other. Nor is this explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that place new, but delivered down
to us by St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great.</hi>
Nor do I think that Man would sin, who
should beseech an Angel appearing to him,
to recommend him before God; to the
proof of which Point <hi>Maimonides</hi> brings
what is in <hi>Iob</hi> (33. 23.) with whom
<hi>Philo</hi> consents, often calling Angels [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>]
Mediators. But in both exhibiting signs
of reverence to Angels, and in imploring
their commendation, it highly concerns us
to see, that he that appears to us under the
form or shape of an Angel, be not an evil
<hi>Daemon</hi> come to delude and seduce us; a
cheat not seldom practised by the Prince of
Impostors <hi>Satan,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> observes
(2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11. 14.) and <hi>Porphyry (de
Abstinentia l.</hi> 2.) in these words; <hi>aliorum
Deorum velut vultum induti, nostra impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia
fruuntur;</hi> and <hi>Iamblicus (de Myster.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64291:60"/>
Aegypt. l. 3. c. 32, &amp; l. 4. c.</hi> 17.) Nor is
it difficult to discern betwixt good and evil
Angels appearing to us. For those that
endeavour to seduce Men from the Worship
of the True God, or pretend themselves to
be Equal to Him; are most certainly Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
[<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] of the Devil, and to be
resisted.</p>
                  <p>True it is nevertheless,<note place="margin">7. Signs of honour proper to God, not to be exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to good Angels.</note> that there are
many signs of honour that cannot be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
even to good Angels, without mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
violation of this Holy Precept. First
if those signs of singular veneration be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
to them, which the consent of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
hath made proper to Divine Worship,
as Sacrifices, Oblations, Incense, expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declined by the Angel that appear'd to
<hi>Manoah, (Iudg.</hi> 13. 16.) and mentioned
in <hi>Daniel</hi> (2. 46.) Secondly if we so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
Vow or Swear by them, or beg of
them those things, which by God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ought to be petitioned for from God
alone, or now under the new Covenant
from God and Christ, such are Remission
of Sins, the Holy Spirit, Eternal Life.
For this is, as <hi>Philo</hi> rightly observes,
<hi>Aequalia dare inaequalibus, qui non est infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorum
honos, sed superioris depressio;</hi> nor
is it less than <hi>crimen laesae Majestatis
summae,</hi> High Treason against the Divine
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64291:61"/>
Majesty, to give His Honour to His
Ministers.</p>
                  <p>To petition Superiors,<note place="margin">8. Civil Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Kings, not unlawful.</note> principally Kings
and Princes, who are Presidents of human

against this Law. Nor are we by the same
forbidden to honour them by kneeling or
prostrating our bodies in their presence,
where Custom of the Place or Nation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires

But if this prostration of the body be in any
Nation used only in Divine Worship; then
is the case quite alter'd, and to use it in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the King himself, will be unlawful.
For this very reason the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who
were not accustomed to prostrate themselves
unless <hi>in Sacris,</hi> refus'd to venerate the
King of the <hi>Persians</hi> in that manner: and
some <hi>Macedonians,</hi> tho' eminent in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
and Court of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi>
could not either by flattery or terror be
brought to prophane the Religious gesture
of Procumbency, by using it before him
even when he affected to be thought a God.
Particularly <hi>Callisthenes</hi> and <hi>Polypercon:</hi> the
former of whom, in the close of his free
Oration to <hi>Alexander,</hi> fear'd not to say;
<hi>non pudet Patriae, nec desidero, ad quem
modum Rex mihi colendus sit discere,</hi> the
other openly derided one of the <hi>Persians</hi>
that, from veneration of the same Mighty
King, lay with their Faces upon the
ground, jeeringly advising him, <hi>ut vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentius
caput quateret ad terram,</hi> as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64291:62"/>
                     <hi>Curtius (lib. 8. cap.</hi> 5.) relates. There
were times when the Christians thought it
not alien from their Religion, to humble
themselves by such prostration before the
Statues and Images of Emperors. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Iulian</hi> had commanded, that Images
of false Gods should be added to his own
Images, the more Prudent of the Christians
held themselves obliged in conscience to
suffer the worst of torments, rather than
to fall down before them; as <hi>Gregorius
Nazianzenus</hi> hath recorded. And hither
may we refer that of <hi>Tertullian</hi> to <hi>Scapula;
Colimus ergo Imperatorem sic, quomodo &amp;
nobis licet, &amp; ipsi expedit, ut hominem à
Deo secundum, &amp; quicquid est à Deo consecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
&amp; solo Deo minorem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto we have enquir'd, what Gods
are falsely and without just cause so called;
and who are sometimes not without cause
named Gods; and how far these of the
latter sort may, without offence of the Most
High God, be honour'd. It remains only,
that we enquire, what is the <hi>Grand Scope</hi> or
Principal Design of this first Precept.</p>
                  <p>The most Learned <hi>Iew, Philo,</hi> and the
Christians following him,<note place="margin">9. Extirpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism,</hi> the principal design of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</note> rightly call this

                     </gap>] <hi>of the Empire of
One,</hi> or also [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of a multitude of Gods.</hi> For no
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64291:62"/>
doubt is to be made, but that the chief
purpose of this Law is to extirpate <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism;</hi>
and that too, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> wisely
observes, not for God's sake (for what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
can he receive from humane worship?)
but for Man's, whose felicity consisteth
only in this; that he be advanced from
things sensible to that Insensible God, from
things subject to decay and destruction, or
such as had a beginning, to that Eternal
<hi>Ens.</hi> Nor is any thing so useful, as the
belief of one God, to conjoin and bind
Men together in Peace and Mutual Amity.
Whence that memorable Sentence of the
Greek Author of the Book (<hi>de Monarchia
l.</hi> 1.) <hi>Amatorium vehementissimum, &amp; vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum
insolubile benevolentiae atque amoris,
cultus unius Dei.</hi> Whereto he adds, for
confirmation, or that he might inculcate
the same as a Maxime of perpetual truth,
and universal too; <hi>Causa concordiae &amp; sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
&amp; maxima, de uno Deo persuasio, a quo
velut fonte procedit amicitia firma &amp; insolubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
hominibus inter se.</hi> To this great verity
<hi>Tacitus</hi> seems to have had respect, when
speaking of the Religion of the <hi>Iews,</hi> he
saith; <hi>Honor Sacerdotii firmamentum poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae
assumitur.</hi> For if the honour of the
Priesthood be the Grand Sanction of the
Power and Authority of the Civil Magistrate
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64291:63"/>
in all Common-wealths (as is confest by
that common Axiom, <hi>sublato sacerdotio
tollitur simul &amp; Lex</hi>) and Religion be the
Basis upon which the honour of the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
stands (which is by all Men acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd)
and the persuasion of One God be
the firmest fundament of Religion (which
cannot be denied) then it will of necessity
follow, that <hi>the perswasion of One God, is
the firmament of Empire,</hi> because the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
ligament whereby the minds of Men
are combin'd and disposed to live, both in
obedience to Governors, and in peace and
mutual amity among themselves. Admirable
therefore is the Goodness shewn by God to
the <hi>Israelites,</hi> in this: that having selected
them before all other Nations to be his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
People, and being now about to
constitute a new form of Government or
Republick, wherein Himself was to preside:
He gave them this first Precept, as the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Law upon which the stability of
their Empire, and their Felicity was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend;
and to which the Light of Nature
or Right Reason would oblige them to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
For the Agnition of <hi>One, Eternal,
Infinite, Omnipotent God,</hi> is to a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Man, without much difficulty of
thoughts, inferrible from any one of these
subsequent reasonings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:64291:63"/>
1. He that from any natural effect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,<note place="margin">10. The <hi>Unity</hi> of God, manifest by the Light of Nature.</note>
which he hath seen, shall reason to
the next cause thereof, and thence proceed
to the next cause of that cause, and then
immerge himself profoundly into the order
of causes; will at length find (with the
Philosophers of clearest understanding)
that there is one <hi>first Mover, i. e.</hi> one Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Cause of all things, which all Men
call <hi>God:</hi> and this without all cogitation of
his own fortune, the solicitude whereof
both begets fear of evil to come, and averts
the mind from the inquisition of natural
causes, and at the same time gives occasion
of imagining many Gods.</p>
                  <p>2. God <hi>is</hi> necessarily, or by Himself;
and whatsoever is so, is consider'd, not
as it is <hi>in genere,</hi> but <hi>in actu;</hi> and <hi>in actu</hi>
things are single. Now if you suppose more
than one God, you shall find <hi>in singulis</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
wherefore they should be necessarily
or by themselves; nothing wherefore two
should be believ'd to be rather than Three,
or Ten rather than Five. Add, that the
multiplication of singular things of the same
kind is from the fecundity of Causes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which more or fewer things are
bred out of them: but of God there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
original, nor any cause. And then
again in divers singulars, there are certain
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64291:64"/>
singular proprieties, by which they are
distinguish'd among themselves; which to
suppose in God, who by his Nature necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
is, is not necessary.</p>
                  <p>3. Nor can you any where find signs of
more than One God. For this Whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
makes One World; in the World
is but one Sun; in Man also but One mind
governs.</p>
                  <p>4. If there were Two or more Gods;
acting and willing freely; they might will
contrary things at the same time, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
one might hinder the other from
doing what he would; but to imagine
it possible for God to be hinder'd from doing
what He wills, is to imagine Him not to
be God. Evident therefore and necessary
it is, that there is but <hi>One</hi> God. Evident it is
also, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> were under a <hi>double</hi>
obligation to obey this Precept: <hi>One</hi> from
God's express Command; the <hi>other,</hi> from
the Light of Nature, which alone is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to teach Men, both that there is but
<hi>One</hi> God properly so call'd, and that to <hi>Him
alone</hi> all Divine Worship is due.</p>

many Gods only make and set up Images to
them,<note place="margin">2. That Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry was founded upon an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that Images Magically consecrate were ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by <hi>Daemons,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>vocal.</hi>
                     </note> but thought also that by Magical

(whoever he was that impos'd that
mighty name upon himself) with <hi>Asclepius,</hi>
and in <hi>Maimonides</hi> in many places of his
Book intituled <hi>Ductor dubitantium,</hi> as also
in <hi>Abenesdras</hi> upon this Precept. The same
is noted by <hi>Tertullian (l. de Idololatria</hi>) in
these words, <hi>Rapere ad se Daemonia &amp; om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
Spiritum immundum per consecrationis
obligamentum;</hi> and (<hi>in l. de spectaculis</hi>)
he saith, that Demons operate in Images:
and <hi>Minutius Felix, Isti impuri Spiritus
sub statuis &amp; imaginibus consecratis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litescunt.</hi>
That such were the Images
which in <hi>Iacob</hi>'s History are named <hi>Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim,</hi>
is the opinion of <hi>Abenesdras, Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides,</hi>
and <hi>Kimchi:</hi> tho' the word it
self be of good and bad signification indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently,
and is sometimes (as in <hi>Iudg.</hi> 17. 5.
and <hi>Hosea</hi> 3. 5.) taken for <hi>Cherubins.</hi>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:64291:65"/>
Such also was the <hi>Gamaheu</hi> or little Image
that <hi>Nero</hi> had, or at least was willing Men
should believe he had, by the suggestions
whereof, he pretended to be premonished
of things to come, as <hi>Suetonius</hi> relates.
That many Images, telesmatically made for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,
and erected have been vocal, yea,
and Oraculous too; many grave Writers
have made no scruple to affirm; and <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides
(parte 3. cap. 29. Ductor dubitant.</hi>)
tells us, That he had read two Books of
speaking Images. These Authors perhaps
had from others heard of such Statues, and
believ'd what they had heard to be true:
but to me (I freely profess) it seems more
probable, that either they gave credit too
easily to fabulous relations, or that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators
themselves had been imposed upon
by frauds and impostures of Heathen Priests
speaking in, and pronouncing enigmatick
Oracles from the hollow of Statues, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
the Credulous, and at the same time
propagate the honour of the False Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by those Idols; than that evil <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
should as it were animate a Statue,
and cause it to express articulate Sounds,
without vocal Organs. And as for <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>'s
Statue or <hi>Colossus</hi> made of black Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
set up in that magnificent Temple of
<hi>Serapis</hi> in <hi>Thebes,</hi> and for the Musick it
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64291:66"/>
made upon the striking of the beams of
the Sun upon it, so much celebrated by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Writers as well <hi>Latine</hi> as <hi>Greek;</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it was meerly a piece of <hi>Art,</hi> a kind
of <hi>pneumatic</hi> Machine contrived by the
<hi>Theban</hi> Priests, Men of not vulgar skill in
Astronomy and all other Philosophical Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
<hi>Athanasius Kircher</hi> (I remember)
in his <hi>Oedipus Aegyptiacus (Tom.</hi> 2.) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his usual credulity, conceives it
was a <hi>Telesme,</hi> or made by Talismanic Art;
and that the Devil was conjur'd within the
hollow of it, to perform that Effect, because
it continued Musical for so long a time,
namely to the days of <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus,</hi>
which from the first Erection of it was
about Eleven hundred Years. But yet he
shews, that such a Musical Statue may be
made by Mathematical and Natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
upon the ground of <hi>Rarefaction;</hi>
saying, <hi>Magnam enim vim in natura rerum,
rarefactionem obtinere, nemo ignorat;</hi> and
subnecting various other pneumatical devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
among the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                  <p>But whether it were the Devil or the
Priest that spake in those Consecrated Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;<note place="margin">3. <hi>Teraphim</hi> used chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination.</hi>

or whether the vulgar, in all Ages
easie to be gull'd by Men of more Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and cunning, were only deluded into a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64291:66"/>
belief that they spake: certain it is however,
that the opinion of some Spirit or other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
within them, so far advanced their
Reputation, that they were now no longer
lookt upon as Representations of Gods, but
as real Gods themselves, and accordingly
Worshiped and Consulted about future
Events. From this Opinion it was, that
<hi>Laban</hi> (in <hi>Genesis</hi> 31. 30.) expostulating
with <hi>Iacob</hi> about the <hi>Teraphim</hi> or Images
that <hi>Rachel</hi> had secretly taken from him,
saith, <hi>Wherefore hast thou stolen my Gods?</hi>
That these <hi>Teraphim</hi> were fram'd by Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers,
for Divination sake, and that they
might Predict things to come; is the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Rabbi Kimchi:</hi> and that they were
also made of Human Form, so as to be the
more capable of Coelestial Influence, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
to us by <hi>Rabbi Abraham Ben-Ezra,</hi>
the greatest Theologue and Astrologue of
the <hi>Iews.</hi> Who adds, That <hi>Rachel</hi> stole
the Images from her Father <hi>Laban</hi> for this
reason alone, lest from the inspection of
them he might learn what way <hi>Iacob</hi> had
taken in his flight, and so pursue him. And
St. <hi>Austin (quaestion 94. in Genes.</hi>) grants
that <hi>Laban</hi> consulted these Idols for Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
saying, <hi>Quod Laban dicit, quare fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus
es deos meos, hinc est illud fortasse quòd
&amp; augurari se dixerat. Capite enim prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedenti,

ad</hi> Jacobum <hi>dixit, Auguratus sum,</hi>
(not as our Translation, I have learned by

Interpret <hi>Nichasti;</hi> and the <hi>Hebrews</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that place (<hi>ver.</hi> 27.) of fore-knowing
or conjecturing. But whether or no these
<hi>Teraphim</hi> were worshiped as Gods, though
they were call'd so, is an old Controversie
among the <hi>Masters,</hi> as appears from <hi>R. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon
Ben-joachi (in libro</hi> Zohar <hi>fol.</hi> 94.)</p>
                  <p>As for the dismal <hi>manner</hi> how these <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphim</hi>
were made,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Teraphim,</hi> how made &amp;</note> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> (from <hi>R. Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in Thisbi</hi>) describes it thus: <q>They
killed a First-born Son, twisted or wrung
off his Head from his Body, then Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balm'd
it with Salt and Aromatick Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and wrote upon a thin Plate of Gold
the Name of an Unclean Spirit; which
Plate being put under the Embalm'd Head,
they placed it in a niche of the Wall, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Candles, and adoring before it. And
with such <hi>Teraphim</hi> as these <hi>Laban</hi> used to
Divine.</q> If this be a true Description, I
wonder why the Author of it, and <hi>Onkelos</hi>
too, in this place of <hi>Genesis</hi> Translate <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphim</hi>
by <hi>Tzilmenaia;</hi> when <hi>Tzilmenaia</hi>

Of <hi>Micha</hi> also we read (<hi>Iudg.</hi> 17. 5.)
That he <hi>had a Temple of Gods, and made an
Ephod and Teraphim, and Consecrated one
of his Sons,</hi> (that is, <hi>filled his hand with
Sacrifices;</hi>) which ancient Rite used in the
initiation of Priests, we find mention'd in
<hi>Exod.</hi> (29. 24.) and <hi>Levit.</hi> (8. 27.) <hi>and he
became his Priest.</hi> Upon which Text
Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> according to his wonted sagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
well observes, That this <hi>Micah</hi> did ill
to mix the Worship of the True God, with
that of Idols and Demons; for doubtless he
Consecrated the <hi>Ephod</hi> and <hi>Levite</hi> to the
True God, but the <hi>Teraphim,</hi> the <hi>Molten,</hi>
and the <hi>Graven Image</hi> to <hi>Demons:</hi> from
which the <hi>Danites</hi> soon after obtain'd an
Oracle, as if it had been from God Himself;
as appears in the Chapter following. Nor
did the Idolaters give credit to the <hi>Ephod,</hi>
which they referr'd to God; or to the <hi>Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim</hi>
of <hi>Demons,</hi> singly or apart: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they foolishly and impiously thought,
that both together were to be Consulted,
both to be Worshiped, and conciliated by
the same Divine Worship. It seems by the
History, That the <hi>Molten Image,</hi> and the
<hi>Graven Image</hi> of <hi>Micah</hi> were the Gods to
whom the <hi>Teraphim</hi> were Consecrated.
But yet the <hi>Teraphim</hi> also, in respect to
their egregious use in Divination, were held
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64291:68"/>
to be Gods. Hence arises somewhat of
Light to us for our clearer discerning of
what is meant by that darksome place in
<hi>Hosea (3. 4.) For the Children of Israel shall
abide many days without a King, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Prince, and without Sacrifice, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an Image, and without an Ephod, and
Teraphim.</hi> For the Sacrifice and Ephod are
referr'd to Divine Worship of the True God;
the Statue or Image and Teraphim, to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry:

by that <hi>Hermes Trismegistus</hi> in his

                     </gap>, and
by him under a secret name worshiped; of
which Magical Practice being accused, he
wrote an Elegant Apology. The same is to
be thought of that Head of a Statue, which
<hi>Gerebert</hi> Arch-bishop first of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> and
after of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and at last <hi>Pope,</hi> by the
name of <hi>Sylvester the Second,</hi> taught by the
<hi>Saracens</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> to the satiety of Humane
Curiosity, made into an Oracle for his own
use; as our <hi>William of Malsbury (de gestis
Regum Angliae,</hi> lib. 2. cap. 10.) relates. <q>This
Head, saith <hi>William,</hi> would never speak,
but when interrogated; and then it fail'd
not to speak Truth, either affirmatively,
or negatively. For instance, when <hi>Gerebert</hi>
asked, <hi>Shall I be Apostolick?</hi> the Head
would Answer, Thou shalt. <hi>Shall I dye
before I have sung Mass in</hi> Jerusalem?</q> 
                     <hi>No.</hi>
But by this Answer, the <hi>Pope</hi> (as is well
observ'd by <hi>Selden, de Diis Syris.</hi> l. 1. c. 2.)
was deceived, as to the time of his Death:
for he understood it of the City <hi>Ierusalem;</hi>
but the Oracle meant a Church so called in
<hi>Rome;</hi> in which, immediately after his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
had upon the Sunday call'd <hi>Statio ad

by this Precept to interdict all Graven Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

the <hi>Iews</hi> were unquiet and mutinous,

up certain Trophies, was in danger of being
outraged by the fury of the <hi>Iews,</hi> until by
exposing them uncover'd, he shew'd, that
no Images lay conceal'd under them. In
like manner the Golden Eagle set up by the

was thrown down, as repugnant to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Law; as <hi>Iosephus (Antiq.</hi> l. 17.) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.
Nor was this Law unknown to <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,</hi>
who speaking of the <hi>Iews,</hi> saith, <hi>Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la

the <hi>Jews</hi> unlawful. To endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
himself from the obligation of this

was criminal to any Man, from the Prince

                  <p>He by his right commanded <hi>Cherubins,</hi>

knowing, that there was nothing of <hi>Divine</hi>

the actions of God in rewarding Good
Men, and in Punishing the Disobedient, are
winged and swift; or (as <hi>Maimonides</hi> and
others conjecture) that God uses the most

execute all His Commands. Of this His

mentioned in the Holy Bible. As for <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s
adding the Images of Oxen and Lions,
to the Brazen Laver; either he did it by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret

also Images of the <hi>Caelestial Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries,</hi>

Liquido,</hi> in the AEthereal spaces or Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64291:72"/>
is the most ancient Opinion of
the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as the <hi>Gemara</hi> teaches at the
beginning of <hi>Genesis,</hi> saying, <hi>Orbes fixi,

Figure, either the form of some single Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,

Living Creature. Wherefore Images of this
kind also fall under the interdiction of this
Law. It appears nevertheless, that the
Images and Figures here interdicted, are in
the number of things in their own Nature
neither good nor evil, but indifferent, and
consequently not unlawful; and which are
prohibited only for caution of some Evil
that may arise from the abuse of them. And

excellent use of this interdict of Images, <hi>viz.</hi>
to admonish men that <hi>God is most remote

God is not to be Worshiped by Images,
Symbols or Representations. <hi>Ye saw not,</hi>

ye might make to your selves any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Image.</hi> And <hi>Seneca (Nat. Quaest.</hi> 8. 30.)

by putting the Hand to the Mouth; which

from that Expression of <hi>Iob</hi> (31. 26) <hi>If

have offended by extraneous Worship. But
what hath hap'ned to many other Words,
that they remain not in the sense of their

                     </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> a sign
of Love and Reverence towards men emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and honourable for Sanctimony; was
a question long disputed and not without
Seditions in the East. To <hi>Germany</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> this seem'd not to be free from Evil,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64291:79"/>
or an appearance at least of Evil: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from the <hi>Synods</hi> of <hi>Francfurt,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
which were held in the times of <hi>Charles
the Great</hi> and his Children. But yet it is
to be remark'd, that in those Synods the
<hi>Greeks</hi> were more harshly treated, because
the <hi>Western</hi> Bishops Interpreted the sentence
of the <hi>Greeks</hi> express'd in the Second <hi>Nicen
Synod,</hi> in a harder or more rigid Sense, than
it was intended, or than the words could
well bear: being deceiv'd by the Acts of
that <hi>Nicen Synod,</hi> translated into <hi>Latine</hi> so
unfaithfully, as that sometimes they exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a sense contrary to the <hi>Greek;</hi> which
may be observ'd, as in other places, so chiefly
in those things which <hi>Constantine</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Constantia</hi> in <hi>Cyprus</hi> had spoken about Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
The Errours of which Translation, so
far as they concern this question, have been
particularly detected, and by comparing the
<hi>Latine</hi> with the <hi>Greek</hi> Copy Corrected by
the incomparable <hi>Hugo Grotius (ad Exod.</hi>
cap. 20.) of whom I borrow'd much, and
the best of what is here said. But to end
this digression; that there was somewhat of
danger in this Honour exhibited to the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Saints; St. <hi>Augustin</hi> in his time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
when speaking of the Christians, he
saith, <hi>Novi multos esse Sepulchrorum &amp; Pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum
adoratores.</hi> At this day the <hi>Greeks</hi>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:64291:79"/>
prefer Pictures to Images, as thinking that
in those is less of danger. The <hi>Armenians</hi>
abstain'd from both. And as for the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bessines,</hi>
the most Learned <hi>Iobus Ludolfus
(Hist. Ethiopic. Lib. 3. cap. 5. num.</hi> 82.)
speaking of the singular Honour and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
they have for the Blessed Virgin
Mother, saith, <hi>Eam tanto prosequuntur affectu,
ut parum illis videatur, quidquid Ecclesia Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana
in ejus honorem excogitavit: tantùm
nullas ei statuas erigunt, Picturis contenti.</hi>
So that being in all things true <hi>Iacobites,</hi>
they follow the example of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who
judged <hi>Pictures</hi> of Saints more innocent
than Images. Of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> who yet
boast themselves to be the only true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in the world, since they only are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
whereas others are but sprinkled;
<hi>Olearius</hi> assures us, That they Universally
give their Saints and their Images the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
due to God alone; and that the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
among them place all Religion in the
Honours and Veneration they exhibit to
Images, teaching their Children to stand
with profound respect, and to say their
Prayers before those Images for which the
Parents have most Devotion. Herein there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they have degenerated from the
<hi>Greek</hi> Christians, from whom they pre<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

If by this Law God permitted not the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

                     </gap> is indeed of ample signification, but

wont to signifie particularly those things,

which the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Masters will have to be

should say, that this Cessation of God from
His work of Creation was the cause, why
after in the time of <hi>Moses</hi> the Celebration
or Sanctification of the Seventh day was
ordained. But the righter interpretation
is that, which distinguishes the precept of
keeping holy the Sabbath, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of resting from Labour, as by the causes,
so also by the times. And to this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<hi>Moses</hi> himself seems to have had respect,
when in <hi>Duternomy</hi> to these words, <hi>Observe
the Sabbath day to sanctifie it,</hi> he adds, <hi>as
the Lord thy God hath Commanded three;</hi>
namly long ago from the very beginning
of the World, as <hi>Grotius</hi> conceives; or, as
<hi>Selden,</hi> from the time when the <hi>Israelites</hi>
were encamp'd in <hi>Mara</hi> (a part of the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
so call'd from the brackish bitterness
of the Waters) where the observation of
the Sabbath was first instituted, about forty
days before that institution was renew'd in
the <hi>Decalogue.</hi> For he refers the first word
of this Precept (<hi>Remember</hi>) to the first
Sabbath there instituted. And true it is,
that the first Sabbath was celebrated by the
<hi>Israelites</hi> in their tenth Mansion or encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>Alush,</hi> part of the desert of <hi>Sin.</hi> They
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64291:88"/>
came from <hi>Elim</hi> into the desert of <hi>Sin</hi> upon
the Fifteenth day of the Second Month from
their beginning to march. Six days <hi>Manna</hi>
was gathered, and one the Seventh the
People Sabbatized. So that the first obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Sabbath fell upon the 22. day
of the same Month; which being the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Month from their Exit out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
was after named <hi>Iiar</hi> (for the names of the
Hebrew Months were then unborn) and
that 22. day of this Month answers to the
23. of May in the Julian year. The <hi>Seder
Olam</hi> makes this Month <hi>Hollow,</hi> i. e. of
but Twenty nine days; not <hi>Full,</hi> i. e. of
Thirty days. Whence in computing the
<hi>feriae</hi> or Holy days of these Months, there
hath risen up a discrepancy of one day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
that <hi>Chronicon,</hi> and the <hi>Talmudist's.</hi>
But that alternate distinction of Months,
as our most Excellent Chronologist <hi>Sir
Iohn Marsham (in Chronic. Canon. pag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 184.)
observes, doth not well agree with the antick
Chronology of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How then shall we reconcile these two<note place="margin">2. The differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> of the word <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,</hi> reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note>
different opinions concerning the respect
of the word <hi>Remember,</hi> the one asserted by
<hi>Grotius,</hi> the other by <hi>Selden?</hi> By granting,
that the Precept <hi>de observando Sabbato,</hi> in
commemoration of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Servitude,
was first given to the <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Mara,</hi>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:64291:88"/>
and a little after renewed at the promulgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> as pertinent particularly
and only to them; and consequently that
so far <hi>Selden</hi> is in the right: but that the
institution of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> in grateful memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Worlds Creation by God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
all Mankind were equally concern'd, was
as ancient as the World it self, and extended
to all Nations universally; and therefore
<hi>Grotius,</hi> who seems to have consider'd this
general institution and the cause of it, is so far
in the right too. For,</p>
                  <p>That some knowledge and veneration of<note place="margin">3. Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Sabbath observ'd anciently by <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> also.</note>
the Sabbath was by Tradition of highest an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
derived to other Nations beside the
<hi>Hebrews,</hi> and remain'd among them for
some ages; <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus (Stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat.
l.</hi> 5.) and <hi>Eusebius</hi> (in <hi>Praepar. Evang.</hi>)
have clearly shewn, as by other Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
so particularly by the Verses of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siod,</hi>
where [<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>] the Seventh
day is call'd <hi>Holy.</hi> And in <hi>Iosephus, Philo,
Theophilus,</hi> and <hi>Lucan,</hi> are places that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
attest the same long-liv'd Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>And upon this account it was,<note place="margin">4. Why the primitive <hi>Christians</hi> held their Assemblies upon the Sabbath day.</note> that the
Primitive <hi>Christians,</hi> who believ'd that by
<hi>Christ</hi> all things were reduced to the same
State wherein they had been constituted
from the beginning, Piously celebrated the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64291:89"/>
Sabbath, and therein held their Solemn
Assemblies, in which the Law was publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
read and expounded, as appears from
that of the <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 21. Which Custom
flourished until it was antiquated by the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odicen</hi>
Synod, which judged it more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
and profitable to Christians, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of the Law, the Gospels should be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that day read to the People assembled.
So Sacred in those more Pure and Pious times
was the memory of the Sabbath originally
instituted, that Men might with glad and
grateful hearts acknowledge and celebrate
with Praises the Infinite Wisdom, Power,
and Goodness of God shewn in the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Universe; that they equall'd the
Sanctity thereof to that of the Lord's day
consecrated to the perpetual remembrance
of that greatest Seal of our Faith, and pledge
of our hopes, the Resurrection of our
Redeemer from the dead. Hence <hi>Balsamo</hi>
most appositely said; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
i. e.
<hi>By the Holy Fathers the Sabbath days were
held in all respects equal to the Lords days.</hi>
Hence also <hi>Gregorius Nyssenus</hi> calls these two
days <hi>Brethren,</hi> as worthy of equal Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Solemnity: and the Ancient Book
of the <hi>Constitutions</hi> of <hi>Clement (l. 7. c.</hi> 24.)
gives this in Precept; <hi>Diem Sabbatti &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em

Dominicam festas habete, quoniam illa
Creationis, altera Resurrections memoriae di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata
est.</hi> Nor was it from any other cause,
That by the most ancient Church was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the Custom of <hi>not fasting</hi> upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
because it was a day of joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
as appears from the Epistle of St. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
ad Philippenses,</hi> where he saith, <hi>Si quis
aut Dominicâ aut Sabbato jejunet, excepto
uno Sabbato, is Christum occidit.</hi> The same
may be inferr'd from that memorable place
in <hi>Tertullian (advers. Marcionem) memi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat
enim &amp; ille hoc privilegium donatum
Sabbato à primordio, quo dies ipse compertus
est; veniam jejunii dico.</hi> Where we cannot
but observe, that this Custom is deduced
from the beginning of the World. From
the same reason it came, that <hi>Constantine</hi>
the Emperor, permitting to Christians the
free use of their Worship, at the same
time forbad their being compell'd to appear
before any Tribunal or Court of Judicature
upon the Sabbath, no less than upon the
Lords day: which Edict is yet extant in
<hi>Eusebius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These things being known are sufficient<note place="margin">5 The Lords day not Surrogat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the place of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</note>
to refute those who think that [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>]
the Lord's day was surrogated into the
place of the Sabbath; of which men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is no where made by Christ, no
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64291:90"/>
where by any of the Apostles. And St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
when (<hi>Colossi.</hi> 2. 16) he saith, that the
Christians are not to be condemned for their
Sabbaths and New Moons; sheweth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that they are free from that Law of rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from labour, which liberty would sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
nothing, if, the Law remaining, the
day were changed. That the Christians
therefore appointed and held their Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
upon that day, wherein their Lord
had risen from the dead; was not from any
Precept either of God, or of the Apostles,
but they did it by vertue of the liberty gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them, and by voluntary consent
among themselves. And to violate such
Consent, after it hath passed into a Custom,
is not the part of men living in Society.
But this Custom obliged not to rest from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
farther than was necessary to the
holding their Assemblies.</p>
                  <p>Having thus briefly shewn the difference<note place="margin">6. why the Greeks and Latins use the word <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bata,</hi> not <hi>Sabbatum.</hi>
                     </note>
betwixt the Precept instituting a Sabbath
in memory of the Creation, which was
from the beginning given to <hi>Adam</hi> and his
whole Posterity; and the Precept given
particularly to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> both in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi>
and soon after at the promulgation of
the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> whereby they were obliged
to celebrate the Sabbath, by resting from
dayly labours, in remembrance of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64291:90"/>
from the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> servitude;
and assigned to each its proper cause and
time: it will not perhaps be impertinent,
if we subjoin a line or two concerning the
Word <hi>Sabbata</hi> here used in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
This Word among the Greeks is list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Catalogue of those, which tho'
pronounced in the number of Multitude,
are yet notwithstanding often contented
with the signification of Unity. And so is
it often found in the <hi>Greek Pentateuch;</hi> so
also in <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 1, 5, 10, 11, 12. and <hi>c.</hi> 28. 1.
in <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 21. and 2. 23, 24. in <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 16.
On the contrary St. <hi>Iohn</hi> every where speaks
it in the singular, as do also the Greek In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
of the other books <hi>extra Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuchum.</hi>
The <hi>Latines</hi> often exprest it, as

the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Priests, in their purifications
observ'd the Seventh days. We may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
acquiesce in this persuasion, that the
weekly Cycle of days was taken from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematick
discipline, and from the most
secret treasury of <hi>Egyptian</hi> Antiquity: but
that the sacred observation of every Seventh
day, and the Feast of the Hebdomadical
Sabbath, constituted by this <hi>Mosaic</hi> Law,
in memory of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> servitude, was
now first receiv'd into the Religion of the

was by the miracle of <hi>Manna</hi> ceasing to rain

had from the beginning sanctified. Nor is it
to be doubted but that this Precept of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

His reason this; <hi>Natura Parentum videtur
esse confinium immortalis &amp; mortalis essentiae.</hi>
Immortal, because a Father by begetting
resembles God the Genitor of all things:
and in the violation of it he puts the highest
inhumanity, most detestable to God and
man; <hi>feritatis primas ferunt, qui Parentes
negligunt.</hi> And in truth this Law is the
cement of human society. For he that
loves and reveres his Parents, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
their care with good education of his
Children, love his Brethren and Sisters as
branches of the same Stock with himself,
cherish and assist all his kindred as descendent
from the same progenitors: whence flows
that whole Series of consanguinity and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
relation; and whence was the most
ancient Original of Nations, Cities, and
Towns, when Tribes and numerous Families
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64291:101"/>
conjoyn'd themselves into Societies under the
Government of their Heads. After this, when
men conven'd from many places, they began
by common consent to constitute Kings and
Governours, by the example of Parents, to
whom the ancients therefore gave the most
proper and obliging name of Fathers. For
which reason in the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, and in those
of other nations, the crime of Majesty, which
we call High Treason, is put before all other
crimes, as most pernicious to the peace and
safety of the Common-wealth: and for the
same reason is this Precept of Honouring
Parents put before the rest that respect hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
society.</p>
                  <p>Here God hath been pleased to name
(and certainly as He is the Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">6. The right of <hi>Mothers</hi> to honour and rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note>
and maker of all Children in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Womb, so is He the most equal
Judge) the <hi>Mother</hi> as well as the Father.
Whereas the Laws of this kind made by
Men, provide almost for <hi>Fathers</hi> only; as
the <hi>Persian</hi> Law commemorated by <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi>
and the <hi>Roman</hi> described in the <hi>Digests</hi>
and <hi>Institutions,</hi> mentioned first by <hi>Epictetus,</hi>
then by <hi>Simplicius,</hi> and <hi>Philo (de legatione)</hi>
And though (<hi>in collisu</hi>) the right of the
Father be the better, by reason of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency
of his Sex, for which God gave the
Husband dominion over the Wife: yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64291:101"/>
obedience and reverence, which are
here signified by the word Honour, are
from Children due to both. In the same
word is comprehended also the duty of
<hi>Thankfulness</hi> and a grateful requital, as
much as in Children lyeth; for indeed a
full requital can never be made to Parents
for the great blessing of existence and life
given by them to Children; as both <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
and <hi>Philo</hi> have observ'd: <hi>quomodo enim
ab aliquibus genitus eos vicissim generare
possit?</hi> And as God was pleased, for mans
imitation, to impress upon mute Animals
visible characters of almost all virtues, of
justice, clemency, chastity, fidelity, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> not of all in all, but of each in
particular species: so hath He given for an
example of filial love and piety, to men the
<hi>Storks</hi> which sustain and nourish their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
when they are grown old and weak.</p>
                  <p>For this also is comprehended in the first
word of this Precept [<gap reason="foreign">

that text in <hi>Numbers 22. 17. I will
promote thee unto very great honour. So Cicero
(Officior. 1.)</hi> treating of duties to Kindred
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64291:102"/>
and near relations, saith, <hi>Necessaria praesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia

                  <p>Here I cannot but take notice of a
strange distinction made betwixt Sons and
Daughters, by the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in their Law
of nourishing Parents labouring of old age
or poverty, and recorded by <hi>Herodotus (l.
2. 35.) Nulla est necessitas filiis alendi paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
nolentibus: sed filiabus summa, etiamsi
nolint.</hi> 
                     <q>Sons are under no necessity to
feed and sustain their Parents, against
their own will: but Daughters are most
strictly bound to nourish them, though
against their will.</q> An odd Law this, to
impose the burden upon the weaker Sex,
and exempt the stronger; and the more
admirable to me, because no reason is added
to it by <hi>Herodotus,</hi> nor can I fix my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
upon any that is probable.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>IN the <hi>Hebrew</hi> this Precept is placed next
after that against Murder, and the <hi>Greek</hi>
Copies also now keep the same order in the
rehersal of the Decalogue in <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi>
But lest any should think this transposition
of these two Precepts a thing recent, I
must observe, that <hi>Philo</hi> in his time read
them, as we now do; and that he gives
this reason for it [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>]
that among unjust facts Adultery is the
greatest. And again after he hath with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
eloquence described the many evil
consequents of this crime, he saith, <hi>Meritò
Deo &amp; hominibus exosa res adulterium inter
crimina ordinem ducit,</hi> meaning the crimes
that are injurious to men. Nor did the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Christians read them otherwise, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the <hi>Greek</hi> Codes; as appears from
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64291:104"/>
                     <hi>Tertullian (de pudicitia)</hi> who saith, <hi>Eo
amplius praemittens, Non maechaberis, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jungit,

whenever the Ancients bring in these
Precepts in another order, they bring them
out of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> not out of this place of
<hi>Exodus.</hi> Let us then, since we may do so
without injury to the diligence of the <hi>Maso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets,</hi>
follow the <hi>Greek</hi> Edition, which we
have taken into our hands, and which may
be defended not only by its antiquity, but also
by this probable reason, That many of the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Women preferr'd Chastity to life;
and that in the judgment of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the
crimes that proceed from the desire of <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi>
are more hainous than those that
come from <hi>anger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abenesdras</hi> thinks, that by the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>he hath committed Adultery,</hi> all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Venery; and simple Fornication is
signified: but we find, that among the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi>
that word is every-where taken on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the sense of <hi>Adultery,</hi> and so transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in this and other places, by the <hi>Greek,
Latin</hi> and other Interpreters. True it is
indeed, that in the <hi>Mosaic</hi> Law there is an
interdict, that there should be no Whores
in the People of <hi>Israel;</hi> and that Incests,
and Marriages with strange Women that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64291:104"/>
worshipped false Gods, and the <hi>Portenta Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris</hi>
or unnatural lusts, are also strictly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited.
But there was nothing of necessity
that in so brief a <hi>Decalogue</hi> all the crimes
that were afterward to be interdicted,
should be mentioned, when it was enough
that those were toucht upon, that might
most hurt either piety, or human society. So
there is no mention made of wounds inflicted,
but of murder, which of all kinds of violence
offer'd to the bodies of men is the greatest.
In these words therefore is properly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
both the Wife that yields the use
of her body to any other man besides her
Husband, and the man that polutes anothers
Wife. Both are condemned to suffer death,
<hi>Levit.</hi> 20. 10. Which punishment the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Emperors, <hi>Constans</hi> and <hi>Constantius</hi>
long after introduced into the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,
as appears from the <hi>Theodosian Code.</hi> Nor is
this capital punishment to be thought more
severe than Equity requires, if we well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that Common-wealths arise from, and
are conserv'd by marriages, that their very
foundations are shook by Adultery, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal
love is converted into mutual hatred,
that inheritances are alienated to a spurious
issue, while the right Heir is supplanted;
that whole houses are fill'd with reproaches
and feuds, which descend to posterity; and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64291:105"/>
not seldom break forth into publick mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and destruction. Of these dire mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
and a hundred other (too many to
be here in this brief and desultory discourse
particularly mentioned) sad and tragical
examples occur in almost all Histories,
whether ancient or modern: and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of them made <hi>Epicurus,</hi> in the
<hi>Moral</hi> Sentences ascribed to him, to say,
<q>What evil doth it not draw upon a man,
to desire to have to do with a Woman,
whose company is interdicted to him by
the Laws? Doubtless a wise man must be
deterred from admitting such a design in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his thoughts, if not by the manifest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
thereof, yet at least by the great
solicitude of mind requisite to obviate the
many and great dangers that threaten him
in the pursuit of it: it being found true by
daily experience, that those who attempt
to enjoy forbidden Women, are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rewarded with wounds, death, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment,
exile, and other grievous pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishments.
Whence it comes, that for a
pleasure which is but short, little, and not
necessary to nature, and which might
have been either otherwise enjoy'd or
wholly omitted, men too often expose
themselves to very great pain, danger, or
at best, late and bitter repentance.</q>

he who commits Homicide, is guilty also of
Sacriledge, in that he violates the Image of

Society, to which all Men are born, and
which cannot consist, if Innocency be not

a certain Cognation betwixt us, it
is a genuine consequence, saith <hi>Florentinus</hi>
most wisely, that for one man to lye in

Crime against the Law of Nature. Then
again, he that assumes to himself that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

excited to give true Testimony in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                     </gap>] <hi>Give Glory

some Learned Men with good Reason Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
That <hi>Achan</hi> was not without hope,
That the Souls of Men survive their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,

For by what other hope could he be brought
to confess himself guilty of a Crime, which

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64291:108"/>
nor could he be ignorant of the common
perswasion of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and Death, full forgiveness of such
Crimes might be impetrated or obtain'd
from God. This form of Adjuration was
used by the Prophets and Judges of the

Verity, which is as it were another

are against the rules of Justice. In fine,

Phantasie exciting the Mind, as <hi>Philo</hi> speaks,
but the Passion or disease of the Mind call'd
Lust, when a Man resigns up the conduct
of his Will to that sensual desire, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues
the Object of it; or as the <hi>Poet</hi> pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
expresses the Passion, <hi>Vulnus alit
venis, &amp; caeco carpitur igne. Seneca (de
ira Lib. 2. cap.</hi> 4.) calls the former, a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not voluntary, a stroke of the Mind
that cannot be declin'd by Reason: the
latter he saith, arises from judgment, and
is by judgment to be taken away. Of this
moreover he makes two degrees; one, that
is not yet obstinate, but vincible by reason;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64291:110"/>
the other, that already Triumphs over the
Understanding, and leads the Will captive
in Chains of impotent desire.</p>
                  <p>In the Old Testament also we find the<note place="margin">2. Acts indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly tending to the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of lusts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted by this Precept.</note>
                     <hi>Hebrew</hi> words here used to express <hi>Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence,</hi>
most frequently to denote, not those
first and indeclinable Motions alone, but
the permanent study and fixt purpose to
obey, cherish, and gratifie them; as in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaea</hi>
2. Yea, more in this place seem to be
noted, the <hi>Acts</hi> by which the Wife or House
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> of another man is indirectly coveted;
such are the sowing or fomenting of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
and animosities betwixt Husband and
Wife, whence follows Divorce; promoting
Suits at Law, and other Artifices of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
iniquity. And this to me seems to
be the reason why St. <hi>Mark</hi> (10. 19.) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
this Precept by [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] <hi>ne frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem

                     </gap>] <hi>Thou shalt not Steal,</hi> went
before.</p>
                  <p>But although this may seem to be the
sense of this Precept [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] in a
grosser Interpretation;<note place="margin">3. As also the simple <hi>purpose</hi> to fulfil them.</note> yet have Philosophers
of the soundest judgment always held, that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64291:110"/>
the meer <hi>purpose</hi> in Lust or Coveting, though
it never proceed to act, is sinful. <hi>Aelian</hi>
said wisely, <hi>non solùm malus est, qui injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
fecit, sed &amp; qui facere voluit, me qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
judice.</hi> Nay, <hi>Ovid</hi> himself, though
no example of Chastity, could say;
<q>
                        <l>Quae quia non licuit, non facit, illa facit</l>
                        <l>Vt jam servaris benè corpus, adultera mens est.</l>
                     </q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Seneca</hi> the Father saith the same thing,
and with equal Elegancy; <hi>Incesta est etiam
sine stupro, quae cupit stuprum.</hi> The Son;
<hi>Non immeritò in numerum peccantium refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
quae pudicitiam timori praestitit, non sibi:</hi>
and in another place, of Crimes in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
<hi>Omnia scelera etiam ante effectum ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,
quantum culpae satis est, perfecta sunt.</hi>
So <hi>Typhoninus</hi> the Lawyer Affirms, That
a Man is call'd an Adulterer <hi>Ex animi pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positione
sola,</hi> though he hath never actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
corrupted any Mother of a Family.
So also <hi>Porphyry (de Abstinentia lib. 1.)
Postquam factis abstinueris, abstinendum &amp;
motibus, ac maximè ipsis animi morbis. Quid
enim prodest factis absistere, si causis unde
ea proeedunt astrictus maneas.</hi>

These Philosophers then saw farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Nature of concupiscence,<note place="margin">4. Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence without effect, no Sin, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins.</hi>
                     </note> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
greater purity of mind, than the
<hi>Iewish</hi> Masters that were in our Saviour's
time, and a little before and after; who
finding in the <hi>Mosaic</hi> Law no penalty or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
for thoughts and desires of intervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Wife or Goods and possessions of
another man, therefore deny that any sin
is committed by the Will alone, without
any overt Act, unless in the case of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
false Gods, because to such
thoughts, Counsel, and purpose, a penalty
was assign'd, and to no other. And that
this was the judgment of most Rabbins,
<hi>Abenesdras</hi> noteth at the beginning of the
Decalogue: and <hi>Iosephus</hi> certainly was
of the same, when treating of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
designed by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> he said;
<hi>non erat paenae obnoxium consilium sine
effectu.</hi> Nor would <hi>St. Paul,</hi> educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
under such Masters, have believed
otherwise, had not a more exact and more
Spiritual consideration of the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
him, and brought him to write
(<hi>Romans</hi> 7. 13.) that the Law being Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
makes concupiscence in thought,
though it proceed no farther, sinful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:64291:111"/>
But what shall we <hi>Christians</hi> say of
what our <hi>Saviour</hi> prescribes to us in the
Gospel of <hi>St. Matthew</hi> (5.) that this
Law,<note place="margin">5. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> who are obliged to purity of mind.</note> which we now consider, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
only vindicated from an erroneous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation;
or that somewhat was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto it? The latter is more probable;
<hi>viz.</hi> that Christ prohibited not only a firm
purpose and design to gratifie our lusts,
but also the assent or yielding to the
motions of them; which He commands
us to suppress and extinguish so soon as
they are felt and perceived within us, and
to avoid all occasions that may foment
them, which He teacheth very significant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
though in parable, by the casting
away of Hand, Eye, and Foot, <hi>i. e.</hi> by
the loss of those things that are dear to us.
Nor content to have taught this purer
Doctrine, He addeth a more grievous pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
to offenders, than any found in the
old Law, namely that of <hi>Hell;</hi> whereas
for such delicts the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
no punishment at all, as the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>
rightly observe. Certainly the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Christians held, that in the Gospel
somewhat more perfect is exacted, than
what the Law expressly treats of. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>Tertullian. Nos ergo soli innocentes?
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64291:112"/>
quid mirum, si necesse est? Enimvero necesse
est: innocentiam à Deo edocti, &amp; perfectè
eam novimus, ut à perfecto Magistro reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latam;
&amp; fideliter custodimus, ut ab in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contemptibili
dispectore mandatam.</hi> Let us
for example take that Precept of not lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after a Woman, which the Ancients
thus explicate. <hi>Iustin</hi> writing to <hi>Zena</hi>
and <hi>Serenus,</hi> saith that [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>]
the first fume of this appetite is interdict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Christ. <q>
                        <hi>Athenagoras</hi> saith; we
are so far from thinking such things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
that it is not permitted to us
to look upon a Woman with desire.
<hi>Tertullian (de velandis virginibus</hi>) a
Christian beholds a Woman with safe
Eyes: in mind he is blind toward lust.
And <hi>Minutius;</hi> ye punish wicked Acts;
to us, but to think an ill thought, is to
sin.</q> This more refined precept deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
by Christ, with some other of like
perfection, seem'd so new, and so heavy
withal to the <hi>Iews,</hi> that <hi>Tryphon,</hi> the most
learned and eloquent among them, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to say to <hi>Iustin; Your Precepts
in the Evangel I know to be so great and
admirable, that no man is I think, able to
observe them:</hi> not considering what had
been taught by Christ (<hi>Matth. 19. 26.)
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64291:112"/>
With men this is impossible; to God all
things are possible.</hi> Namely Christ hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
for those that believe in him, a more
certain faith of eternal life, and a Spirit
much greater, than had ever before been
given to men: and then by His sufferings
upon the Cross He gave us an example
most absolute; and that nothing is so hard
at first, which may not by exercise and a
willing mind be made easy and familiar;
as most of the Fathers have noted upon
that in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> (12. 30.) By this
custom of repugning it comes to pass,
that those lustful motions by degrees sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued,
dare no more rise up within us.
This is that noble and glorious victory
by faith, of which <hi>St. Iohn</hi> speaks in his
Epistle. <hi>c. 5. v.</hi> 45.</p>

thou shall covet nothing that belongs
to another; not the <hi>least</hi> things ought to be

                  <p>From this Harmony of the Mosaic and
Evangelic Laws, I might take occasion to
enquire also into the things in which <hi>these</hi>
differ from and excel <hi>those;</hi> and thence to
shew, how incomparably more noble in it
self, and more agreeable to the Spiritual
Nature and proper affections of a Rational
Soul, the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion is, than the
<hi>Iudaic,</hi> or any other hitherto known in the
World. Which would not be difficult to me
to do, since various Arguments offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to every considering man, from the
excellency of the <hi>Reward</hi> by God Himself
promised and infallibly assured to all true
and sincere Professors of <hi>Christianism, viz.</hi>
eternal Life and immutable Felicity after a
joyful Resurrection: from the singular
<hi>Sanctity</hi> of its Doctrine and Precepts, as well
concerning the true and most congruous
Worship of God in Spirit, and from pure
Love, as concerning all the Offices of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity</hi>
due from us to our Neighbour,
though our Enemy; the <hi>Mortification</hi> of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64291:118"/>
all sensual Lusts and unjust desires, nay the
contempt of all <hi>temporal</hi> goods in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
with <hi>eternal;</hi> from the Divine Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
inculpable life, miraculous works, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
sufferings, and certain Resurrection of
<hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> of it: and in fine,-from
the wonderful <hi>Propagation</hi> thereof, whether
we consider the <hi>infirmity, simplicity,</hi> and <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity</hi>
of the Men that in the first times
taught and diffus'd it, or the mighty <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments</hi>
that retracted their Hearers from
embracing, or deterr'd them from professing
it. From all these Heads I might (I say)
fully evince the <hi>Excellency</hi> of our Religion.
But because this matter is alien from my
present Theme, and principally because the
same hath been already treated by many
others of much greater ability than I can
pretend unto, more professedly with Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophic
subtility by <hi>Raimundus de Sebunde,</hi>
with variety of Dialogues by <hi>Ludovicus

gravity of judgment by <hi>Grotius:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I restrain my unworthy Pen from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning
a verity so Sacred, and as well from
its own splendor as from the Light it hath
receiv'd from those Illustrious Writers, so
conspicuous; and acquiesce in the full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion
thereof, wishing equal conviction of

               <p>HAving in the precedent shadow of
a Book often cited the <hi>TALMVD</hi>
or <hi>Pandects</hi> of the <hi>Iews;</hi> and now
presuming it to be possible, that those Papers,
of how little value soever in themselves,
and however secretly kept by me in my life
time, may yet, after my Death, come into
the hands of some men, who are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
so conversant in those <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
Authors who have written of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and Canonical Laws, and Traditions of
that Nation, as to know from what Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
of what Antiquity, and of how great
Authority among them that <hi>Talmud</hi> is:
therefore I am inclin'd to hope, that the
more Learned will not condemn me, either
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64291:119"/>
of Vanity or Impertinence; if for Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the less Learned, I here add a
brief History thereof, not without some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of diligence and Labour, Collected
from Writers of excellent Erudition and
undoubted Faith.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Macedonians</hi> had spread their
Victorious Arms over the <hi>East,</hi> and the
<hi>Hasmoneans</hi> with equally successful Courage
asserted the Liberty of their Country; there
arose out of the School of <hi>Antigonus So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus</hi>
two mighty Sects among the <hi>Iews:</hi>
the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> so call'd from their <hi>Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
and the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who deriv'd their name
from <hi>Sadocus</hi> their Head and Ring-leader.
The former deliver'd to the People, many
Precepts receiv'd by Tradition from their
Ancestors, which were not written in the
<hi>Pentateuch</hi> among the Laws of <hi>Moses;</hi> the
<hi>Latter</hi> directly opposing the admission and
sanction of those Traditions, maintain'd
that the Precepts recorded in the Books as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd
to their Legislator <hi>Moses,</hi> were all of
Sacred Authority, and therefore to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
observ'd; but those taught by the
<hi>Pharisees,</hi> from tradition only by word of
Mouth, were not obliging; as <hi>Iosephus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
(<hi>Antiquit.</hi> l. 13. c. 18.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:64291:119"/>
From this division of the disciples of
<hi>Antigonus,</hi> in a short time it came to pass,
that the whole Nation of the <hi>Iews</hi> also was
divided into Sects; of which there is no
memory in any of their monuments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Government of <hi>Ionathan,</hi> who
succeeded his Brother <hi>Iudas Machabaeus,</hi>
(whose History we have in the Books of
the <hi>Maccabees</hi>) in the year of <hi>Nabonassar</hi>
588. and of the <hi>Iulian</hi> Period 4553.
At which time, as the same <hi>Iosephus</hi>
commemorates (<hi>Antiquit. l. 13. c.</hi> 9.)
there grew up three Sects or Heresies
of the <hi>Iews,</hi> which delivered divers Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
not of religious duties, but of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
affairs, principally <hi>de Fato;</hi> one, of
the <hi>Pharisees;</hi> a Second, of the <hi>Sadduces;</hi>
a Third of the <hi>Essens,</hi> who lived an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
life, different from the others. So
<hi>Philo (de vita contemplativa</hi>) distinguishes
them from the <hi>Theoretics,</hi> whom he call's
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: and so <hi>Photius</hi> (in <hi>Bibliothec.
n.</hi> 104.) interpreting <hi>Philo,</hi> saith; <hi>Lectae
sunt philosophantium apud Iudaeos vivendi
rationes, &amp; Contemplativa, &amp; Activa:
quorum hi Esseni, illi Therapeut ae appellantur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These <hi>Esseni</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
from their Sanctity, retiring from
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:64291:120"/>
the noise and crowds of populous Cities
into solitary Villages, affected solitude;
<hi>gens sola, sine ulla faemina, sine pecunia,
socia palmarum,</hi> &amp;c. No wonder then, if
all the Four Evangelists be silent concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, since they lived strangers; and
unknown even to the inhabitants of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
nor is any mention of them to
be found in the writings of any Rabbins
before <hi>Zacuthius,</hi> a late writer, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the year of our Lord 1502.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and their Antagonists
the <hi>Sadduces</hi> made a great bustle and noise
in the Court of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> where they
lived in mutual Emulation, drawing
mighty parties after them: the rich for
the most part patronizing the <hi>Sadduces,</hi>
and the common people adhering to the
<hi>Pharisees;</hi> as we read in <hi>Iosephus (Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit.
l. 13. c.</hi> 18.) And in truth those
[<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] unwritten traditions
asserted by the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> grew more
and more Authentic in the Schools,
were openly taught by the <hi>Rabbins</hi> by
word of mouth to their disciples, and
studiously propagated as sacred verities;
but not published in writing. Yet at
length, after the City of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had
been sack'd and demolish'd by <hi>Titus,</hi> and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:64291:120"/>
repair'd by <hi>Hadrian</hi> in such sort, that
the poor <hi>Iews</hi> retain'd neither their name,
nor nation, nor religion; while by the
sedition of one <hi>Barchocebas,</hi> almost all <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi>

(in vita Hadriani</hi>) reports; and while
the <hi>Iews</hi> were dispers'd, and in exile, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
to set a foot upon their native soil;
and the Schools that had been design'd to
promote the Pharisaic discipline failed;
one <hi>Rabbi Iehuda,</hi> whom they call <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kadosh,</hi>
i. e. the <hi>Saint,</hi> with vast Labour
collecting all the Traditions, Judgments,
Opinions, and Expositions, that the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
of all ages precedent had deliver'd
upon the whole Law; composed of them
the Book of the MISHNA, and read it
publickly. And this he did, lest the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of their Ancestors might otherwise
be lost and forgotten. He lived under the
three <hi>Antonins, Pius, Marcus,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus,</hi>
and finished this Syntagm of the
<hi>Mishna,</hi> in the Reign of the Last, and (as
<hi>De Gantz</hi> computes) in the year 120.
from the destruction of the Temple, but
of the Christian Aera 190. This <hi>Mishna</hi>
is their [<gap reason="foreign">

Of Christian writers, the first that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
this Book of the <hi>Mishna,</hi> seems
to be the Emperor <hi>Iustinian</hi> (a greater
Collector of Ancient, but civil Laws and
Constitutions) who in the year of Christ
551. gave leave to the <hi>Iews</hi> to read the
Holy Scriptures publickly in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues;
but interdicted the like use of
the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or Second Edition of their
Law, the <hi>Mishna,</hi> as neither conjoyn'd
to the Pentateuch, nor deliver'd down
from the old Prophets, but invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by men that had nothing of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Spirit in them: as appears from <hi>Novel</hi>
146. pag. 295. But since neither <hi>Origen,</hi> nor
<hi>Epiphanius,</hi> nor St. <hi>Ierom</hi> (who all make
mention frequently of the Judaic traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
takes notice of any such Book as
the <hi>Mishna;</hi> and since St. <hi>Austin (contra
adversarios Legis &amp; Prophetarum</hi> l. 2. c. 1.)
saith expressly, <hi>Habere, praeter Scripturas le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimas

probable, that the <hi>Mishna</hi> was, either not
written, or at least not well known in the

Among these <hi>Maimonides (in praefat. ad

For his extraordinary Wisdom and

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Iews</hi> at length passing from the
Subjection of the <hi>Romans</hi> to that of the
<hi>Persians,</hi> about 100 years after, Rabbi <hi>Ase</hi>
in the Land of <hi>Babylon</hi> composed another
<hi>Gemara</hi> or Complement of the <hi>Mishna;</hi>
which from thence was denominated the
<hi>Babylonic Gemara,</hi> and which contains
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:64291:122"/>
many ridiculous fictions, and fables in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible.
And this, with the <hi>Mishna,</hi> makes
the <hi>Babylonian Talmud,</hi> which is now most in
use; nay doctrinal to all the <hi>Iews,</hi> as if
all their discipline, all Law both Divine
and Human were therein comprehended:
in which notwithstanding the <hi>Sadduces</hi>
are never remember'd, but under the name
of <hi>Hereticks</hi> or <hi>Epicureans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Mishna</hi> if self were contain'd, not

also a Collection of all the Traditions
which they call the Law <hi>Oral,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to have been originally receiv'd from
the mouth of <hi>Moses</hi> himself. And to give
more credit and authority to these tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Precepts, Rabbi <hi>Eliezar (in Pirke
cap. 49. editionis Vorstianae pag.</hi> 123.) tells
us, that during the 40 days absence of
<hi>Moses</hi> on the Mount, he spent the days
in reading the Scripture, and the nights
in composing the <hi>Mishna:</hi> and in the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonic
Gemara</hi> is a formal story of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
manner (forsooth) how <hi>Moses</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
and explain'd the Oral Law to
<hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons and the Elders. The

Elders (saith the <hi>Pirke Aboth,</hi> i. e. <hi>capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula
Patrum,</hi> a Talmudic treatise) deliver'd
the same to the Prophets, and the Prophets
to the men of the Great Synagogue, and
they again handed it down to their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors.
But these things being too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiously
spoken, to evince the successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
through so many ages, the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Rabbins have put their wit upon the
Rack to explicate the matter more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</p>
               <p>After the finishing of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> for
an age or two, there is nothing but thick
darkness in the Histories of the <hi>Iews:</hi> but
then they being expulsed out of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
and their Schools left empty and desolate,
about the year of our Lord 1040. a great part
of the Rabbins and People came for refuge
into <hi>Europe,</hi> and chiefly into <hi>Spain:</hi> there
appearing to us no Memorials of European
<hi>Iews</hi> before that time. Since that, innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Rabbins men of great Learning &amp; skill
in all Sciences, nor addicting themselves
and studies to the extravagant and absurd
dreams of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> as their predecessors
had done; have written copiously: and the
succession of the <hi>Cabbala</hi> hath been sought
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:64291:123"/>
for in the East. Rabbi <hi>Moses ben Maimon,</hi>
vulgarly <hi>Maimonides</hi> and <hi>Rambam,</hi> born at
<hi>Corduba,</hi> in the year of Christ 1135. died
at the age of 70. after he had written
Commentaries upon the <hi>Mishna;</hi> in the
preface to which he gives a long series or
list of those who had propagated the Oral
Law successively. Which yet appearing
imperfect and interrupt to Rabbi <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
Zacuth</hi> of <hi>Salamanca,</hi> who wrote
<hi>Iuchasiin</hi> in the year of Christ 1502. he and
his contemporany <hi>Don Isaac Abarbinel</hi>
an exiled <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and after them, <hi>David
Ganz</hi> (who brought his Chronology down
to the year of Christ 1592. in his Book
entitled <hi>Tzemach or Germen Davidis</hi>)
found, or made that Catalogue of the
Propagators of the Traditional Law more
perfect and continued. Herein <hi>Zacuth</hi>
indeed follow'd <hi>Maimonides;</hi> and <hi>Ganz</hi>
trod in the steps of <hi>Abarbinel:</hi> but <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiel.
Vorstius</hi> (in <hi>observat. in Ganz, pag.</hi>
213.) comparing these successions each
with the other; from the diversity of
computation from the interruption and
gaping conjunction thereof, argues the
Catalogue to be plainly fictitious. There
are nevertheless even among our Christian
Divines some, who lay hold upon that
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:64291:123"/>
continuation of Traditions, and use it to
serve their turn: how prudently, let
others judge. For I have not underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
curiously to examine that series and
the nine classes of <hi>Iewish</hi> Doctors: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
my self at present with these few
collections concerning the Original and
Antiquity of the <hi>Talmud.</hi>
