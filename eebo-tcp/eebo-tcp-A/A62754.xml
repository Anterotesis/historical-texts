            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

curſed be he which fears to die in a iuſt cauſe, truth we love, but falſhood contemne.</p>
            <p>One better minded Souldier then all the reſt anſwered moſt wiſely after this maner: Do but give me the hearing and you ſhall ſoone grant how rediculous this uprore is; wiſe men never attempt impoſſibilities; tis more eaſie and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any ſingle arme to quell an army, as to effect with loyalty your intented enterpriſe. We come hither to fight for our King, &amp; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our country from ſlavery, but not to raiſe civill wars amongſt our ſelves, which of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion is the worſt: then turning to his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine he ſpeaked thus:</p>
            <p>What Magick hath transform'd thee from thy ſelf? Where is thy wonted valour? How haſt thou loſt thy boaſted freedome? What new fire burn'd up thy ſcorched entrayles? What unknowne deſires invade and take poſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thy ſoule? All vertuous obiects vaniſht? Haſtthou ſtood the ſhocks of fierce encounters? Stopt thine ears againſt all ſyren notes moving to the leaſt diſtemper againſt thy Souldiers? What monſter is it, which hath drawne thy barke of clemencie, (that which wonder hath kept, an honoured and conſtant courſe:) into the gulfe of a deſerved ill fame? and in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with thine own hands dig up a grave to bury the momumentall heape of all thy yeares imployd in noble actions: I ſorrow for thy fate: we obey thee, and willingly put our

owne fetters on to grace thy triumph, it were therefore more then cruelty in thee to uſe us as a tyrant uſeth to doe his ſervants, for ſo we are, but not your ſlaves; wherefore I deſire your worſhip to take conſideration.</p>
            <p>The Captaine with ſterne look anſwered thus: Hang conſideration.</p>
            <p>When you are hanged all, England is able to furniſh me with more I have courage to fetch them in. How durſt you only entertaine a grumbling ſyllable in my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand? In me great Mavors ſpake, my voyce did eccho in your eares his thunder, and whilſt you like ſo many ſeaborne Tritons armed onely with the trumpet of our iniunction you thinke you are ſafe now: who durſt but diſpute it or make it queſtionable, if this moment I charge ye from yon hanging cliffe that glaſes his rugged fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head in the neighbour lake to throw your ſelves downe head long: Or like fagots to fill the ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of defended forts while on your backs I march up to the breach.</p>
            <p>One ſtout ſouldier anſwered, that would not I, (which forc'd the captaine for to frown) but yet ſaid the ſouldier: I dare as much as any of great Brittaines boldeſt ſouldiers.</p>
            <p>At which the Captaine anſwered, Adde one ſyllable more, thou doſt pronounce a ſentence that Earthquake-like will ſwallow thee: but yet obey mee according to my minde and I am yours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:93623:4"/>
With a unanimus conſent they thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered:</p>
            <p>Thy flatteries we diſpiſe, thus ſpit at them, and ſcorne them, and being arm'd in the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our innocent vertue, wee ſtamp upon all doubts, all feares, all tortures, thy barbarous, cruelty, or villany can ſhewe upon us: thou art falſe, falſer than Romiſh religion, more ſavage than the beat or ſhe Lyon would of her whelps, we have been long burthened with the yoke of your tyrannizing command, and now at length are reſolved to ſhake it off, we doe intend to make no Idol of you, nor as our late Tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers did to the Altar, bow and bend to you any more upon theſe tearmes, for ſince you ſeeme to forget your love to us, we ſcorne to tender our ſervie to you: At which like ſo many raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wolves to devour a ſheepe or lamb, ſo ran they upon him and tooke away his life.</p>
            <p>He exerciſed Tyrannie over them, and they inhumanity over him, they acted their parts tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically, and he died moſt miſerably. Alas! who knowes whither with his body they ſlew his ſoul alſo. Commanders of what degree ſoever, mark this my admonition, Let not your rage, excell reaſon let not pride overſway you which is a vice by which many fall. Let not your thought be lifted up higher than it becomes.</p>
            <p>If men be your ſervants, make them not your ſlaves, for fierie ſpirits are not ſoon quenched witnes the fierce fire which was kindled againſt
