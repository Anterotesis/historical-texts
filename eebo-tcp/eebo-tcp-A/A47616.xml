         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

FIRST SCOVTS
DISCOVERY.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Came to <hi>Dover</hi> in a Flemiſh Botom,
where (after a dayes reſt) I went to
ſee the Caſtle, but I was forced to
faine my ſelf one of Madam <hi>Nurſes
kindred,</hi> &amp; ſpoke nothing but french,
or elſe I had not been admitted.</p>
            <p>This Caſtle is called the Key of the Land, but
its growne ruſty for want of exerciſe, for moſt of
the Ordnance are diſmounted, their carriages ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
one halfe in the ground, and the other out;
here lay one wheele, and there lay another: In the
Eaſterne out-worke lay one Peece all over-grown
with graſſe, and hard by that lay another along by
the wall on two Logs of Tymber; I wondred to
ſee ſuch a confuſion in ſo eminent a place; but I
was told that the laſt great wind was the cauſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65352:4"/>
thereof; and if the Lieutenant were once able to
walke round the wals to ſee it, all would bee made
good and mended; but till then it muſt ſtand as it
doth: Their Lord is at London to be cured of the
Gout, the Deputy Lieutenant was at <hi>Downs</hi> ſeeing
the Kings ſhips, and moſt of the men were at
bowles on the greene Beach: I came downe to the
Towne, and left the Caſtle with a <hi>Memento</hi> to look
to it ſelfe, leſt the French doe it for them; this I
obſerved, that if the French had beene as provident
as the Dutch, to have ſeated themſelves in <hi>Dover,</hi>
then the moſt Chriſtian King might have had this
Caſtle at his Command, and ſo might have beene
Maſter of the narrow Seas, and have had <hi>Calice</hi> and
<hi>Dover</hi> for two <hi>Bul-workes,</hi> and <hi>Block-houſes,</hi> and ſo
kept the <hi>Dunkirke</hi> from domineering on the ſeas.
All the newes I could learne here, was that ſixe of
the Kings ſhips lay ready for a Convoy of ſixtie
Veſſels with proviſion for <hi>Dunkirke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day I came to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where I
went to view the glaſſe windowes, and ſee Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
a Beckets</hi> Tombe, to which the people had
prayed ſo often, as they had made two holes in the
ſtones with their knees: the next day being ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
I went to heare a Sermon where (they ſaid) the
Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrewes</hi> was to preach, I was
in amaze to ſee him there; but the noyſe of the
Organs ſoone put mee out of my dumps. Now
(thought I) hee is in his Kingdome, for hee hath
danced a long time after this muſicke: when ſervice
was done; I thought to have heard him tell the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65352:4"/>
people ſome newes out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but the old
Carle ſpake not one word thereof. The next
morning I tooke a Charcoale, and drew on the
white wal in the Church Porch theſe three words,
<hi>(Archi: Cant: Auli)</hi> and ſo departed out of the town,
leſt I ſhould have beene apprehended for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of it: All the newes that I could learne in
the Towne, was that the Archbiſhops Grace was
too great to dwell amongſt them, that hee loved
<hi>Croyden,</hi> better then <hi>Chriſt-Church.</hi> That hee had
ſome Engineers to ſee if they could remove <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church</hi>
to <hi>Croydon</hi> by land, or to <hi>Lambeth</hi> by water,
for hee meant it ſhould ſtoope to him, and not hee
to it: But leſt it ſhould fall to bee forfeited; for
non Reſidency he hath put the other Archbiſhop
there for his Deputy.</p>
            <p>As I came through <hi>Kent,</hi> I ſaw much muſtering,
and preparing of men and Armes to ſend into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
This had almoſt made a mutinie amongſt
them; ſome ſaid it was done purpoſely to weaken
the Country, others ſaid it was an il example for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ages: And an old 88. Captaine ſaid they
might well retaine the name of <hi>Kentiſh Long-tayles,</hi>
but to be called any more men of <hi>Kent,</hi> they could
not clayme it.</p>
            <p>As I came a long, I ſaw the Kings Store-houſe at
<hi>Chatham,</hi> and ſome of the Kings ſhips which are of
ſuch bigneſſe, as a ſmall ſhip may be built, ere they
can be rigged, and brought to the ſea to doe any
ſervice. When I came to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> I ſaw the
great Fleet ryding in the <hi>Hope,</hi> ready to carry the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65352:5"/>
Marqueſſe and his men for <hi>Scotland:</hi> But there fell
out a foule fray betweene the Parſon of the Pariſh,
and the Purſers, for demanding double duties, for
burying ſuch ſouldiers as dyed on ſhipboard. On
the way towards <hi>London,</hi> I ſaw <hi>Stone-church</hi> which
was burnt downe with thunder laſt winter: And
<hi>Erith, Micham,</hi> and many other Churches (for all
their high Altars) did not ſcape ſcot free.</p>
            <p>The next Sunday I went to <hi>Lambeth</hi> to heare a
Sermon, and ſee what forme of worſhip was uſed
there; when I came, I was in hope to have ſeen
the little good man of <hi>Lambeth</hi> there, but I ſaw no
ſuch man in all the <hi>Kirke;</hi> for I could have kend
him by his white ſleeves from all the men there:
but I well wot, there hee was not. I ſpeerd for him,
and ſome ſaid, he was either at <hi>White-hall</hi> or <hi>Somerſet</hi>
houſe, others ſaid that he was at home chooſing of
a new Church-warden, becauſe the old one had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
him for not comming to Kirk theſe 7. yeares.
After preaching was paſt, I went up the River ſide
to ſee <hi>Guy Faux</hi> his Mannor houſe, the fatalleſt
houſe, that ever was built; for there was the plot
laid, and powder provided for blowing up the
Prince and Peers of the Realme, in the Parliament
houſe by the Papiſts conſpiracie. There was the
Leather Ordnance invented, there was the white
ſoape and blew ſtarch firſt made, there was the moſt
part of the projects and Monopolies hatched, which
have ſo much troubled the whole Kingdome.
There was a new rare invention, lately ſet on foot
for blowing up of Caſtles and Forts, but for a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65352:5"/>
it was firſt blowne up it ſelfe: And now an
Engineere hath begged it of the King, and hath
new built it, for which hee hath promiſed to
blow up all the Ilands in the Frith in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
that the Kings ſhips may have ſea-roome to beſiege
<hi>Leeth:</hi> from thence I came croſſe the River, where
a Dutcheſſe like a Dive-dapper was a ſwimming,
but the water was ſo cold, as it made all her body
ſhiver, and put her in ſick a fit of a feaver, as no
Phyſician could cure her, but a German. On the
Sunday before Eaſter I went to St. <hi>Margarets</hi> anent
the Abbey, where the Miniſter miſtooke himſelfe,
and inſtead of a Prayer read a Preface, forbidding
all people to begge at <hi>White-hall,</hi> for the King was
gone to <hi>Yorke Welaway</hi> (thought I) now, I have miſt a
<hi>mandy,</hi> which I thought to have had, to have carried
me againe home into <hi>Scotland.</hi> Well, I could hardly
eate my dinner for griefe thereof: But a country man
of mine would needs have me in the after-noone be
Goffer to a Girle, where when I came the women
fel to quarrel for the name; one would have it <hi>Maud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
&amp; another would have it <hi>Mary,</hi> now out upon't
ſayes another, we have too too many of that name
already; pray let us have old <hi>Elizabeth</hi> again: by my
ſoule ſays another, if this were ſpoken in <hi>Scotland,</hi> it
would be counted reaſon wh<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n I heard that, I ſtole
away, and left them to look another Goffer: upon
good Friday as I came through <hi>White-hall,</hi> a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
man had me in to give me a diſh of drink, and to
ſhew me the dancing Barn, &amp; then afterwards carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me to the Kings Quire to hear a me<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of matins,
when I came there the people were al groveling on
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65352:6"/>
the ground as though they had bin picking pearles
out of the pavement: Well, downe I was driven
on my maribones amongſt the reſt, and about halfe
an houre after they al ſtood up againe, turning their
arſes to the Eaſt, and their ſnouts to the Weſt to
heare an Anthem, which being done a tall ſlim
Carle in a long Gowne made the people turne their
faces to the Eaſt, where I ſpied a curious wrought
Crucifix hanging over the high Altar, with two
women kneeling to it, to teach the reſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
their duties: Upon Eaſter day I went thither
againe, and then the Crucifix was taken downe, and
the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> ſet up in the ſame place, the <hi>Muſicke</hi>
went ſo loud, and the old droaning dunces, and
young fry of <hi>Quiriſters</hi> made ſuch a noyſe as I
could not heare, nor underſtand one word was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and ſo came away for feare of deaffing: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a week after my Countrey-man would needs
have mee goe thither againe, and then I ſaw in the
ſame place over the Altar a fine old man riding on a
bonny Nagge, hunting a wild Beaſt, many a long
legge, and low courteſie was made to the man on
horſe-backe: I askt what hee was, and my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-man
told me, it was St. <hi>George,</hi> and they were
all praying to him to make haſte, for they had need
of him in the North, when I ſaw him ſo ready on
horſe-back with his ſpeare in his hand, and his ſpurs
on his heels: Well St. <hi>George,</hi> thought, I, ride as faſt
as you can, I will be in <hi>Scotland</hi> before you, and ſo
I departed, and left him to end his quarrell with
the Beaſt hee had before him: When I was gone
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65352:6"/>
out of the Court, my Countrey-man told mee, I
had ſome reaſon to be afraid. For St. <hi>George</hi> having
formerly broke his Speare with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and
rebated his ſword at a foyle with the <hi>French;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee had now his hands bound by the one, and
his tongue by the other: And having taken a truce
with them both, hee had vowed to be revenged
on St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> whom hee threatens to turne into
a Wind-will, where his Croſſe ſhall ſerve for the
ſweapes: Alas, and woes me (quoth I) poore
St. <hi>Andrew</hi> is ſo weary with carrying his Croſſe on
his back, and a Biſhops Bonnet on his head, as hee
will never be able to encounter this man, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo bravely mounted, will run over him before
he come at him. This made me ſo afraid, as I went
home to ſupper for feare of fainting; the next
morning I got up betimes, and went to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
to meet our Intelligencer; when I came the
newes was at an end: For their Packets were
opened, and their Letters taken away, which made
a mighty muttering amongſt them, in ſo much as

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Went out in a Dunbarre Boat, and
ſayled all along the Northern coaſts,
where wee met two ſhips laden with
Ammunition for <hi>Barwicke,</hi> and fixe
Colliers with proviſion for New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle.
When I came to <hi>Hull,</hi> I went on ſhoare
to ſee the mighty Magazin there, from thence wee
were driven to the <hi>Downes,</hi> where the Kings Fleet
lay at Anchor: in which the <hi>Mermaid Marqueſſe,</hi>
(being changed from true blew to all the colours
in the Raine-bow) was there cabbined up with
a Cable for feare of the French, where like a Kite
in a windy day with ſeventeene ſmaller birds at her
tayle, hee was hovering up and downe the ſeas to
ſurpriſe all ſuch ſhipping as ſhould paſſe for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we came neere unto <hi>Dover,</hi> a Dunkirke
ſet upon us with two French, and a Fleming relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65352:7"/>
us, or elſe (for all the ſhip money paid in, for
guarding of the ſeas) wee had beene carried to
<hi>Dunkirke</hi> inſtead of <hi>Dunbar:</hi> But having ſcapt that
ſcouring, wee landed in <hi>Suſſex</hi> neare old <hi>Arundell,</hi>
where wee went to ſee the Caſtle, the ſtrongeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
whereof, is the number and greatneſſe of the
owners titles; It's kept by foure Prieſts, two Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and a Ratcatcher, but it hath above a hundred
Watchers and Warders belonging to it; who (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ever we came neare it) came flying over our
heads crying, <hi>Ka, Ka, Ka, Ka,</hi> which made us ſo
afraid of being clapt up in the Caſtle, that we retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and left them to looke to their charge.</p>
            <p>The people of the Towne were all crying, every
teare as big as a Mill-ſtone, leſt their Lord ſhould
love the North Countrey better then theirs: And
becauſe hee is gone to conquer an other Countrey,
and left his owne to the mercy of his enemy, I
quickly left this place of mourning, and ſayled by
the Ile of <hi>Wight,</hi> where they were very hot at their
Muſters, in ſo much as the ſmoake thereof made
ſuch a miſt on the ſea, as we miſtooke our courſe,
and landed at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> inſtead of <hi>New-caſtle,</hi>
where wee heard, thoſe Ilanders are as hot in their
Barrels, as the French in the Breech: ſo as if they
come there, it will prove a hot peece of ſervice,
ere they can enter: <hi>Portſmouth</hi> is but meanely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
with Ammunition, and therefore they were
all in amaze, for feare the French ſhould come
in a Fog.</p>

at, and there the Aldermen were buſie begging a
benevolence for the warres: But becauſe I had
none for them, I thought it better to ſhew them my
backſide, then to bee called Rebell for refuſing:
From thence I came to <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> where I was
afraid of a Gooſe.</p>
            <p>This Towne I left and came to <hi>Bagſhot,</hi> and ſo to
<hi>Baſing-ſtoke,</hi> where a lordly Lowne ſware me out
of ten ſhillings with his merry conceits of his

            <q>What hunting is moſt in uſe?</q>

            <p>Covetouſneſſe of the Clergy, and contention

            <p>I left this place, and tooke my way to wards <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
in hope to have ſeene <hi>Arundels</hi> Earle, but hee
was gone to Court; yet I did not looſe my labour,
for there I ſaw the fineſt and beſt govern'd Almeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe

            <p>The next day I came to <hi>Croydon,</hi> thinking to have
ſeene the little man, that makes ſo mickle matter,
but he was at <hi>Lambeth;</hi> whereupon I came along
towards <hi>London</hi> with a Colliers Cart of <hi>Croydon,</hi>
where after ſome whiſtling and merry tales, I heard
theſe myſticall Novelties.</p>
            <p>That of late ſome are ſo much for Church Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
as they doe nothing in true fincerity:
And that others are altogether for pride and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality,
and nothing for love and charity; That
the Owle counterfeits the Eagle, the Buzzard the
Blackbird, the Cuckow the Nightingale, and the
Wren would fly with the Faulcon, but for feare
his wings ſhould fayle him.</p>
            <p>That the Fox would faine lap himſelfe in the
Lions skin, the better to terrifie the other Beaſts.</p>
            <p>Thus the Wolfe would faine bee chiefe Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
that he might the better feed his flock, and the
Aſſe muſt have the Harts skin on his backe, to keepe
him from the Northerne ſtorme.</p>
            <p>When they had made an end of their Parables,
they fell to ſinging: And askt mee if I could helpe
them to ſing a three mans ſong: I told them I would
doe my beſt, then they began, and the bearing of

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Came in <hi>Kirke Patricks</hi> Boat, all
about the <hi>Iriſh ſeas,</hi> where we ſaw
ſome ſouldiers ſent from thence, to
the Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> at <hi>Carlile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee landed three of our men
in <hi>Wales</hi> (being Papiſts) but they
were quickly ſnapt up for Covenanters, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Rebels, for refuſing the oath of Supremacie,
and ſhortly after were learned Traytors by open
Proclamation.</p>
            <p>Wee viewed all the Engliſh Ilands as wee paſt
along, as <hi>Man, Garnſey, Silly,</hi> and the like: The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
had need be honeſt, for they are entru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
with keeping of the three greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Clergie, <hi>viz.</hi> Divinity, Law,
and Phyſicke: In all our voyage wee ſaw
but only two of the Kings ſhips, which were ſent
to ſcoure the ſeas, wee did vaile our Bonnets unto
them, and bid them good day, and ſo departed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered.</p>
            <p>Wee put in at <hi>Portſmoth,</hi> where there is a good
Harbour, and good Forts, but ſorrily kept; their
Governour (that Baggage Bag) having taken a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65352:9"/>
of a Star-chamber ſuite, and being a little over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed
with the Moone, gave them the bagge
and dyed, whoſe Succeſſor will never fill the bags
hee hath left empty behind him.</p>
            <p>As I came through <hi>Somerſet-ſhire,</hi> I ſaw great muſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:
They are notable windy fellowes, and ſtrong
breath'd, with eating of Beane-bread, they meane to
ſhew you a Taunton trick, and fart in your faces:
you may ken them from all the Campe, by the
Beanes ratling in their bellies, a mile before they
come at you.</p>
            <p>In all the Countrey as I came along, there was
a great complaint of the decay of Trading: The
Farmers and Sheep-maſters blame the Clothiers,
the Clothiers the Merchants and Drapers, and they
lay the fault on the troubles in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
their traffick, but ſome of them ſay, they
could find it out nearer home, if they durſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

            <p>I came downe by <hi>Reading,</hi> where little <hi>Laud</hi> was
borne, his Father was a Clothier, his Mother a
Spinſter (hee being the worſt thred that ever ſhee
ſpunne in her life:) Hee was from his Cradle or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to be a Puniſher of poore people: For hee
was borne between the ſtocks, and the cage, which
a Courtier one day chanced to ſpeake of; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
his Grace thought himſelfe ſo diſgrac't, as he
removed them thence, and pull downe his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
thatcht houſe, and built up a faire one in the

he was diſcended of ſo meane a houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65352:10"/>
The next day I came to <hi>Windſor,</hi> which is the
worſt place that ever I came in. For the Knights
are poore, and the Prieſts rich, the Prebends proud,
and the Deane deafe, for a poore man hath called
a long time to be releaſed, and cannot be heard.</p>
            <p>Away I came towards <hi>London,</hi> and landed at
<hi>Hampton</hi> Court, in hope to have ſeene the Prince
and Duke <hi>Iemmy,</hi> but the Dupper Doctor had
carried them to St. <hi>Iames</hi> to ſee the Queene Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
where hee left them, untill hee himſelfe went
to <hi>Lambeth</hi> for <hi>Canterburies</hi> bleſſing to a better
Biſhoprick, in which if hee behave himſelfe well,
and pleaſe his Patron, in bringing up his pupill, he
ſhall be promoted to a better Biſhoprick.</p>
            <p>When I came to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> a countrey man of
mine had mee to ſee the Tombes, where (amongſt
many other Kings and Queenes) I ſaw King <hi>Iames,</hi>
and Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> conferring about the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which they ſaid was plotted in
<hi>Spaine,</hi> ratified at <hi>Rome,</hi> and agitated by the Ieſuits
in <hi>England,</hi> to be acted in a tragicall proceſſion in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> but it was not ſo in their dayes, and they
hoped it would not long continue as now it is.</p>
            <p>The next morning I got up betimes to goe to our
Intelligencer; but ere I came at <hi>White-hall,</hi> I was
preſt for the Kings ſervice: whereupon I preſently
fell lame of my left legge, and with a pittifull look
I ſaid, <hi>Meſſe Conſtable</hi> I am a poore lame Paſſenger,
I pray you let me paſſe, but if I muſt have your
money, then change me one ſhilling for an other;
with that I bleſt my ſelfe with a good Angell, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65352:10"/>
then gave it him for his ſhilling, which he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
put it up, and ſo out of pure love let me paſſe.</p>
            <p>When I came to the <hi>Exchange,</hi> our Intelligencer,
and two or three more of my countrey men went
to dinner, where I was relating my <hi>Reading</hi> Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

            <p>The next Terme after this, the Biſhop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne</hi>
came to his ſentence in the Star-chamber,
where hee received a ſharpe ſenſure, but hee may
thank himſelf for it, in keeping two prime places in
his hands, when others want preferment. But hee
ſtood too much upon his trumps, thinking that
King <hi>James</hi> his Patents had beene now as
good, as when hee had them: Alas good man,
though hee be a great Scholler (not a better in the
Kingdome) yet hee had forgot the little Mans
Motto <hi>(Sic volo, ſic Iubeo)</hi> The originall cauſe of
this was never heard; but this I learned, that two
fleſh flyes having fed at his Table for a long time
together, had purpoſely laid a traine to intrap him,
and then they combined with one <hi>Kilvert</hi> (A Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball)
who having devoured his owne Maſter (Sir
<hi>Iohn Bennet)</hi> undertooke to doe the like with him,
and hath hunted him ſo hard, that the Tower is
become his Tabernacle, where he is like to remain,
unleſſe hee will pull off his Miter, and give it for
his Ranſome.</p>
            <p>Long hee had not laine there, ere he was rouſed
up againe for a ſecond courſe, pretending that hee
had given a falſe expoſition on the great <hi>Leviathan,</hi>
(falſe Mediator) and the like: whereupon (through
the meanes of a falſe Steward, a faithleſſe Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
and a fooliſh Scribe) he was (<hi>Acteon</hi>-like) puld
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65352:12"/>
down with his own hounds, which he had fed at his
trencher in his proſperity, but had now fallen upon
himſelfe in his adverſity, yet his owne patience, and
the peoples prayers may one day be a comfort to
him.</p>
            <p>That when the newes came firſt of the troubles
in <hi>Scotland, Archie</hi> the Kings Foole was queſtioned
for ſomething againſt the Prelates, whom hee
thought was the cauſe of it. For which hee had
beene had up in the Star-chamber, but that the Fool
told them hee would plead the priviledge of his
Coat. For (quoth hee) if neither Foole nor wife
man muſt ſcape this Court, I will be neither. But
for all this <hi>Archie</hi> could not ſcape ſcot free, for hee
was led to the Porters lodge, where (albeit hee
found favour in his laſh) yet he loſt both his Coat
and his place by it.</p>
            <p>That about a weeke after <hi>I</hi> met <hi>Archie</hi> at the
Abby all in black: Alas poore foole (thought I)
hee mournes for his countrey; I askt him about his
Coat, O quoth he, my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
it from mee, becauſe either he, or ſome of the
<hi>Scots</hi> Biſhops may have uſe for it themſelves: But
hee hath given me a black coat for it, to colour my
knavery with, and now I may ſpeake what I pleaſe
(ſo it be not againſt the Prelates) for this Coat
hath a farre greater Priviledge then the other had:
when I heard him ſay ſo, albeit (thought I) a Fooles
bolt is ſoone ſhot, yet perhaps hee may hit the
marke: whereupon I went and bought me a cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
Coat, and put my ſelfe into an Arminian
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65352:12"/>
habit, which hath kept mee freer from danger, then
if I had beene all clad in buffe.</p>
            <p>That about Chriſtmas laſt, all the paſſages of
your Aſſembly were preſented to the King, and all
the names of the Lords and others that had ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
the Covenant, or conſenting to the putting
downe of the Prelates were given in: wherupon
a Convocation of the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> was
once reſolved to be called, and to have the matter
diſputed, but the Biſhops were buſie, and could not
attend it, and adviſed that <hi>(ipſo facto)</hi> you ſhould be
proclaymed Rebels, and all your Lands ſhould be
confiſcate to the King, which made ſome of the
Courtiers mouthes ſo water (in hopes of a Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip)
that they lookt as if they had beene troubled
with the ſcurvie.</p>
            <p>That about <hi>Candlemas</hi> the newes was nothing
but warre, and that the King would goe in perſon
into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and had promiſed to gratifie thoſe
that adventured with them, for cutting off the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters:
And therefore to make them the more
contemptible to the Engliſh, Proclamation <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
made in all market Townes, and read in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
That you were baſe fawning fellowes, and
people of broken fortunes, and would faine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
your ruined eſtates, by the ſpoyles of the good
ſubjects of <hi>England;</hi> which Proclamation (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the faire and true declaration of your

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65352:13"/>
(but knew not when) and they may returne, but
know not how.</p>
            <p>That of late every man at <hi>London</hi> hath beene in
his humours. The Courtiers were learning how to
toſſe tennis bals, inſtead of Bullets. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
were preparing to ſee the tragedy of tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
the Clergy were ſtudying a Maſque for a
Myter; the Miniſtry were drawing the map of
miſery, the Ieſuits were at wilie baguilie, and the
Scots Biſhops were at Boe peepe with the Kirke.</p>
            <p>That one day I went to ſee the Tower, which is
newly rapaired, there are forty new beds and lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings
provided for entertainment of the Scots
traytors: well, let me adviſe yee to looke to your

next newes after will bee your comming out to
Tower-Hill, where either your heads muſt lop,
or your Crags crack.</p>
            <p>I came home by the cuſtome Houſe, where there

them, who came ruffling into their offices with ſuch
violence, as (for feare of <hi>Goring)</hi> it made al the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian
Merchants to run away, and leave their
Plantations. For Tobacco was growne ſo cheape,
as the Kings cuſtomes came to more then the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
had for it. For it was taken by a worſe
name, and ſold by the meaſure of <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſtaffe,
whereupon, when the old <hi>Pinder</hi> ſaw ſuch ſhavers,
come to ſhare in his office, he gave over, and left

the <hi>Dawes,</hi> to ſhift among the Rooks, which

Court Cuſtomer might dye drunke in his new

might break as faſt as doth his glaſſe beads.</p>
            <p>Whilſt I ſtayed at Cuſtome-houſe, I heard a

under colour of a peece of Veniſon ſent to the

That all Lent long His Majeſties Chaplaines,

            <p>That the caſe of ſhip-monie was fully argued,
firſt by foure Councellors, and afterwards by the

and five punies paſt for the King, and five Seniors,
(whereof two were capitall) ſtood for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,

would faine have had another aſſay at the matter,
but could not be heard.</p>
            <p>That about Mid-lent, the names of all ſtrangers,
as well French and Dutch, as Scots, were collected
in and about <hi>London,</hi> and ſent to the King, <hi>viz.</hi>
60000. French, 40000. Dutch, and 900. <hi>Scots,</hi>
but if Prieſts, Friers, Ieſuits, and the reſt of the

would have exceeded the number of the Scots, and

Dutch had beene likewiſe collected, the number of

            <p>The voice went that all the Proteſtant ſtrangers
ſhould have beene ſent into <hi>New England</hi> (if the

for calling a Parliament, the great Phyſician
of the Kingdome, to cure their infinit infirmities.</p>
            <p>That all men muſt contribute to this holy, and
zealous expedition; whereupon the Citie of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
having made a collection of, at leaſt 6000. l.
preſented it to the King, who thankt them for their
loves, but would not receive it, becauſe ſome ſay,
it was too little, others ſay, that he will come home
by them, and then they muſt preſent him with a
golden Calfe, and a greater gift for a peace offring:
But in the meane time its ſaid, that <hi>Yorke</hi> muſt bee

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65352:15"/>
when no man knowes, yet the Merchants care not
if both Court and Towne bee carried thither, ſo

For if their wives loved Courtiers no better then
they doe, their roomes were farre better then their
company.</p>
            <p>That the King being reſolved upon his Iourney,
wrote his Letters to all Noble-men in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
to attend his Royall Standard at <hi>Yorke.</hi> The

20000. Iriſh 20000. choſen Catholikes, all in
compleate armour, and that the King of Spaine
would ſend him 20000. of his old ſouldiers (if he
had no uſe for them himſelfe:) The King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke</hi>
would ſend him 20000. of his Drunkards, if
he could ſpare them: The King of <hi>Morocco</hi> would
ſend him twenty tun of Barbary Gold, if <hi>Argier</hi>
and <hi>Tunnis</hi> ſtood not in his way, and the Pope
would ſend his Benediction, if he thought it would
doe him any good.</p>
            <p>That the King was by the Prelates ſo exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and made ſo eager on the buſines, as he tooke
his Iourney on his <hi>Coronation</hi> day, which ſome think

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65352:20"/>
the other mentions onely three, being ſomewhat
unequall too.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe the former forgets the Kings
ſhips: whereupon depends the hopes of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
and honour of the Kingdome, which the
latter obſerving he ſhall therefore write the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but hee muſt not begin untill hee heare the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of the firſt Battell, which if it proves unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
then it ſpoyles a Poet.</p>
            <p>That the newes at <hi>London</hi> is ſo uncertaine, that
no man believes it, ſometimes we heare of Peace,
and then the Papiſts ſtorme and fret, ſaying, the
King is too mercifull. For my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> (not the
chiefe of the <hi>Howards)</hi> hath three ſonnes, all Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
newly come over from the Cardinals Campe,
who threaten, if the King will give them leave,
they will pluck the Scots out of their trenches by
the eares; but when newes come they muſt fight,
and that wee ſhall have blowes for blowes, then
they tell us, that the Kings forces are two weak
for the Covenanters, but as ſoone as the Iriſh
will come over <hi>Dunluce,</hi> and his Dimilances will
drive them all into the Mountaines.</p>
            <p>That ſuch newes as this comes out by owlelight
in little Bookes or Ballads to be ſold in the ſtreets.
And I feare its held a prime peece of policy of ſtate,
For otherwiſe, how could ſo many falſe Ballads,
and Bookes be tollerated: yet the next morning
Sunne exhales all their vaine Evening vapours:
As that newes of taking <hi>Leſley</hi> Priſoner, killing of
Colonell <hi>Crayford,</hi> and impryſoning moſt of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65352:20"/>
Nobility, but I never beleeved it, becauſe if it had
beene true Ballads, would have beene ſung by day
light, Bookes printed, Bonefires made, and a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
Proceſſion with a <hi>Te Deum,</hi> at leaſt, had not
beene wanting at <hi>Lambeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I went one day to the Star-chamber to
ſee what Lords where left at home, where I heard
Colonell <hi>Crosby</hi> and others fined, for reporting
that the Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland</hi> going to Knight
a poore man, Sir <hi>Knave,</hi> with a <hi>Cane,</hi> hee hit him
ſo hard as hee kill'd him, when in truth, hee died not
untill three dayes following.</p>
            <p>At which ſentence, little <hi>Laud</hi> made a Sermon
of an houre long, telling them how the Deputy
had cozened the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> of all their armes,
and was providing men to weare them into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
againſt their owne Countrey-men; And that
it was a fortune that followeth all men in high
places and authority to bee evill ſpoken off.</p>
            <p>But it was not ſo of old, for then the man
whom the King did honour ſhould ride in his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,
bee apparelled with the Kings Roabes, and
eſteemed the ſecond perſon in the Kingdome; but
now, if the people might have their wils (quoth
hee) thoſe whom the King honoureth, ſhould have
<hi>Hamans</hi> reward: with this hee concluded, keeping
the application to himſelfe; whereupon, I went
out and wrote theſe Verſes following, and left
them in the window:
<q>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:65352:21"/>
                  <l>Now wicked <hi>Will</hi> doth raigne as King,</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Finch</hi> ſing ſweet by <hi>Windybanks,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>The Prieſts <hi>placebo</hi> ſtill doe ſing,</l>
                  <l>But the <hi>Scots</hi> if croſt, will play mad prancks.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The next day, I tooke my journey home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and left one to take notice of paſſages in
my abſence; And a firſt night I lay at <hi>Ware</hi>
where my hoſt ſhewed mee the great bed and told
mee that 24. Captaines lay altogether in it, and
named it the bed of honour; If (ſaid I) honour
could bee goe with lying in fether-beds few would
bee without it. But ſure (ſaid I) they will lye both
worſe and further aſunder before they returne
home againe.</p>
            <p>When I came at <hi>Yorke,</hi> I heard the King was
bravely entertained there, and that the Recorder
had ſo tickled his eares with flattery and fables
that both hee and the Major were knighted, well
thought I this makes good the old Proverbe; Some
may better ſteale a gooſe, then others ſtick downe
a feather; For if the <hi>Scots</hi> had done ſo, they had
beene called fawning fellowes by open Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>When I came to <hi>Durham,</hi> all the Drummers were
drunke, for the Biſhop had beſtowed good ſtore
of wine upon them to forbeare beating, becauſe
the noiſe of the Drummes ſhould not drowne the
ſound of the Organs.</p>
            <p>I needed no guide to <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> for whole
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65352:21"/>
troopes of ſouldiers lay lame by the way; This
Towne is now called little <hi>London</hi> albeit it hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſerve the name of <hi>Coale-Caſtle.</hi> I went round
their Towne to ſee the workes, and thought to
have ſeene a Caſtle in it, but mine hoſt told mee
that the <hi>Scots</hi> had long agoe laid the Caſtle
levell with the ground, and leaſt they ſhould doe
the like with the Towne, the King had ſent a gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to defend it.</p>
            <p>When I came firſt to the Campe, I was exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
what I was, I told them, I was Chaplaine
to the Lord High Crown'd <hi>Howard,</hi> and was come
on a meſſage to his chiefe. Upon this, I had a faire
paſport, but never came neere him.</p>
            <p>The firſt newes I heard there was, that the
Marqueſſe was ſent to find out the floting <hi>Iſlands,</hi>
and that hee had beene round about <hi>England,</hi> and
moſt part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but could not find them, and
in the Interim, moſt of his men falling Sea ſick;
A pinke was diſpatcht to <hi>Apolloes</hi> Oracle, to know
their deſtinies. Anſwere was made, that they were
all unſanctified people, and not fit to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in ſo holy a warre, untill they had done
penance, and made their confeſſions in ſome fitting
Land. This made them more amazed then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
untill a ſubtile <hi>Sphincks</hi> expounded the rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
and told them it was meant by the holy <hi>Iſland,</hi>
unto which hee would prove their Pylot and
bring them thither, where if their men died as faſt
on Land as they did at Sea, then they might ſave
a labour of digging of Graves, and bury them in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65352:22"/>
conyborowes; unto this they all agreed and
weighed anchour, hoiſed up ſailes, and in ſhort
time arrived in the harbour where they landed
their men. And the Marqueſſe himſelfe after hee
had made his Orizons at Saint <hi>Cutberts</hi> ſhrine, hee
poſted to <hi>Apollo</hi> for further direction.</p>
            <p>That when I came to the Campe, I ſaw diverſe
troopes of voluntaries, who (like ſo many prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals)
having got their patrimonies, are come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſpend them in hope to returne richer. They
have taken with them three horſes a peece, one
to carry the Aſſe himſelfe, an other to carry a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
if hee can take any; and the third, to carry
his proviſion.</p>
            <p>But its commonly ſeene in all Lotteries (this
being the like) that there are above ten Blancks to
one prize.</p>
            <p>I met with a great many Gamſters there, and
with ſome Players and Poets, but all out of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
yet a Poet told mee, that becauſe hee
would keepe his hand in ure, hee made every day
a few lines in Verſe; a parcell whereof hee gave
mee as followeth:
<q>
                  <l>No enemies face yet have wee ſeene</l>
                  <l>Nor foote ſet on your ground,</l>
                  <l>But here wee lie in open feild</l>
                  <l>With raine like to bee drown'd.</l>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:65352:22"/>
                  <l>The Earths my Bed, when I am laid</l>
                  <l>A Turfe it is my Pillow,</l>
                  <l>Our Canopy is the skie above,</l>
                  <l>My Lawrell turn'd to willow,</l>
                  <l>Then mighty <hi>Mars</hi> withhold thy hand</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Jove</hi> thy fury ceaſe,</l>
                  <l>That ſo wee may, as all doe pray,</l>
                  <l>Returne againe in peace.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>About the end of <hi>May,</hi> either a Foole, or an
unskilfull Phyſitian, told the King, that the <hi>Scots</hi>
Campe had ſuch ſtinking breaths, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
durſt not come within tenne miles of them for
feare of infecting, whereupon a Proclamation was
made, that the King did reſpect the ſafety of his
ſubjects of <hi>England.</hi> So as the <hi>Scots</hi> Campe under
paine of diſpleaſure, ſhould not come within tenne
miles of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> borders, or Campe, whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it lay; but if they did, then the <hi>Generaliſsimo</hi> was
to kill all they could catch, wherein they ſhould
doe his Majeſty good ſervice and honour.</p>
            <p>Shortly after this; a vaine man perſwaded the
King, that all the <hi>Scots</hi> were retired above 14. miles
from <hi>Barwick,</hi> and that 5000. would bee able to
take them all in their trenches. This being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
upon <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> day, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> army went out
of <hi>Barwick</hi> very early to put this deſigne in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but ere they had marched two miles, newes
came, that Generall <hi>Leſley</hi> was comming towards
them, whereupon, they returned, ſaying, they went
out but onely to goe in proceſſion round about
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65352:23"/>
the bounds belonging to the Towne of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About two dayes after, there happened a great
miſtie morning, in which the Cowes comming
down the Hill towards <hi>Barwick</hi> ſeemed like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men, and the white horſes like ſo many colours,
which put the Towne in ſuch a fright that the <hi>Scots</hi>
were comming, that they barrocaded their Gates,
ranne up their Rampires, mounted their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and made ready for a defence: But when
the day grew cleere, and that they heard Cowes
low for their Calves, they opened their Gates, and
let them in to <hi>Suckling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I obſerved in the Campe, that both the
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> factions (like to <hi>Caiphas</hi> and
<hi>Pilate)</hi> are now agreed to your overthrow in this
expedition, who were alwayes, oppoſite enemies
one to another, even in their very apparrell, which
I will decipher unto you, becauſe if you ſee them,
you may know them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French-men</hi> bee knowne by their Curld
Perriwiggs, <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Cap, ſhort waſted Dublet,
long arſed hoſe, and curtall Cloake, with boots as
though they meant to bee buried in them. And
the other may bee knowne by his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> hat, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi>
band, long bellied Dublet without a belt,
trunke hoſe, ſtart up ſtockings, buskin bootes, and
large cloakes, which is the generall faſhion now
in the Army.</p>
            <p>That when I was in the Campe, Proclamation
was made, that every man upon paine of death
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65352:23"/>

warre, which all the Campe were ſworne to as

            <p>Hereby you may perceive there is no great Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

many of the beſt Nobility, and prime

I may truly tell you, that though nature have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided

               <l>Our conſcience that doth perfect witneſſe beare us,</l>
               <l>That what we doe, is for the generall good,</l>

            <p>The next morning theſe verſes were taken down,

me: And about noone, a Comptroller came and
put up an Anſwer to them, as followeth:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Thou Rebell Scot, wee feare thee not,</l>
               <l>Our quarrell is to fight:</l>

                  <hi>Laſhley</hi> wee'l laſh, deare <hi>Sandy</hi> ſlaſh,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Douglas</hi> put to flight.</l>
               <l>By Kings command, we have your land,</l>
               <l>As ſoone as you are ſlaine,</l>
               <l>Then with all ſpeed wee'll doe the deed,</l>

            </lg>
            <p>By this you may perceive they thinke it a won
game, yet I ſee no miracles they have done, ſince
they went out; only I obſerved a wonder, that is, to
ſee their pride and patience have agreed ſo long to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
expecting an end of this action.</p>
            <p>That I ſaw the Regiment of Gyants ſent out of
Yorke-ſhire, under the command of <hi>Don Quickſot,</hi>
who threatens, that after they have carbonadoed
the Scots like ſo many capons, then <hi>Sanco Panco</hi> his
Page ſhall cut off their heads, and carry them to
the Prelates for a preſent; but the Enterpriſe will
prove worſe, then the Wind-mills was, that the
third day after, all the forces were drawne into Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia,
where the Welſh-men had the Vauntguard
the Iriſh the Reere, and the Engliſh the maine
Battell, and the Papiſts were purpoſely backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
placed, to ſee that none forſooke their colours,
and the Biſhops could willingly have deſired to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65352:26"/>
beare the Banner; but that they feared their white
ſleeves were ſuch faire markes, and the Scots ſuch
good Markſmen, as they could not miſſe them.</p>
            <p>That when the Muſter roll was caſt up (of their

Cotholikes) it was found <hi>in toto</hi> not above 1600. If
I be miſtaken in the numbers, <hi>London</hi> newes miſled
me: Now if all theſe, with the helpe of three bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
counties, after three dayes Battery with the
great Ordinance, and three moneths labour of the
Engineers cannot make a breech big enough for
the Generals greatneſſe to enter <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and
cut off all the Covenanters, then they meane to
take an other courſe with you, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt they
meane cunningly, under the colour of a parley to
catch you in a purſe-net, and if that fayle, then
they meane to yeeld to a Parliament; and in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim
poſſeſſe themſelves of all the ſtrong Caſtles,
and then on the ſuddaine to catch you all napping,
as <hi>Moſſe</hi> caught his Mare: But if your wiſdomes do
prevent that, then they meane to ſtarve you by
land, and by ſea; for which purpoſe the Marqueſſe
hath ſurrounded the ſeas, &amp; hath entred the Frith;
where like Swallowes after Flyes hee wil
ſo fight with the Fiſher-boats, as you ſhall
not have a Whiting, a Haddock, nor a Herring to
relieve you: And all the frontier Townes between
<hi>Carlile,</hi> and <hi>Barwick</hi> ſhall be laid full of ſouldiers to
keepe you from catching any thing out of <hi>England:</hi>
But here's your comfort, winter will come, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65352:27"/>
then our rough rocks, and ſhelvy ſeas will force the
ſhips to retire homewards, and our cold clymate
will quickly coole their courages, if they continue
their intended courſes.</p>
            <p>That upon the firſt of <hi>June,</hi> newes was brought
to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Campe, that all the <hi>Scots</hi> Army was
blowne as farre as <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> with the wind of the
laſt Proclamation: whereupon order was given
for an Inroade into <hi>Scotland,</hi> within two dayes after
thinking to have taken in the two market Townes
of <hi>Kelſey</hi> and <hi>Duns,</hi> but they proved dunces in their

as ſome of their Commanders had put on Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwigs

when they came towards <hi>Kelſey,</hi> there appeared
400. Horſe on the top of a Hill; whereupon the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Commanders gave order for a charge,
which the other perceiving retyred downe the hill
on the other ſide, and then wheeling about with a
foot Army, they encompaſſed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army
round about ere they knew of it. And after ſome
ſmall pawſe on the buſines, a Trumpetter was ſent
to the Scots to ſubmit, who returned anſwer, that if
they meant to fight, they ſhould ſee their ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and demanded of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the cauſe of
their comming to invade them in ſuch hoſtile
manner, who replied, that they came out to ſee

how the <hi>Scots</hi> Markets were furniſhed with fleſh,
for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſouldiers were almoſt ſurfeited
with eating of freſh Salmon, to which a <hi>Scots</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
replied:</p>
            <p>Moſt Gentle Generall, our Markets are well

you may ſee almoſt 5000. <hi>Engliſh</hi> Calves, which
our friends have ſent us for a Prey this morning,
but wee never meane to hurt them, but intend to
ſend them ſafe back againe for a preſent to his
Majeſty, as a token of our Loyalty to him, and our
loves towards you. When the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
how the caſe ſtood with them, they fell to
a parley and parted loving friends, and ſo ſounded
a retreat, and returned homewards againe; every
man carrying in his hand, inſtead of a (Roſemary,

                  <l>Wee found their love, and know they meane no ill,</l>

            <p>When the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army ſaw their fellowes
