            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOV are pleas'd to ask my Opinion concerning the time of the Birth and Death of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and of the chief Passages of his Life; and also of the Lives of other famous Men his Contemporaries. I am sure you know these things better than I; and therefore you need not come to me for Information. But if you have only a mind to know my opinion of these matters, I can't deny you that: and in truth that is all I can tell you of that great Philosopher. Not but that I have by me every thing that I observ'd concerning <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi> when I read the old Greek and Latin Authors; and to satisfie your desire, I have put my Collections in order to draw out a Chronological Account of his Life, if it were possible. But now they are here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, I know not well what to make of them; they look like Moon-shine in rough Water, all over Discord and Confusion: Out
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:107134:3"/>
of which I am so far from making out that which I design'd, a perfect Account of his Life, that I must confess, I can't do any thing towards it. There is not in all my Collection, any one certain year in which any thing happen'd to him, or was done by him.</p>
            <p>Yet I cannot lament that great Man's mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune in this, nor ours neither: for as he was a perfect Iugler, so his Life, being all fast and loose, I must needs say, is written worthy of himself: and it is not only come intire into our hands, notwithstanding those defects I have mention'd; but with many Improvements by later Writers, who have striven to out-do one another in Stories to his Honour and Praise.</p>
            <p>Of those <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Jonsius de Script. Hist. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los.</hi>
               </note> many eminent Writers that have employ'd their Pens on this Subject, there are three that have given us his History at large; <hi>Diogenes Laertius, Porphyry</hi> and <hi>Jamblichus.</hi> These three, I believe, have cull'd out all that was remarkable in any of the rest: and the two last were his great Admirers who would not omit any thing that might make for his Glory.</p>
            <p>They describe him as a very extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Person, for his Parts and Inventions for the good of Mankind: they tell us what Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries he made in natural Philosophy: how much he advanced the Mathematical Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as well by his Studies as his Travels. But
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:107134:3"/>
above all, they magnifie his knowledge of the Gods, and of the things of Religion.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>VIII,</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>Laer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> tells us, he was initiated in all the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Rites, as well of the Greeks, as Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. Those other Writers of his Life take particular notice of this in every Stage of his Travels. And yet <hi>Porphyry</hi> will not let his Reader be ignorant, that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was a <hi>Deist,</hi> as well as himself; and took both <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> for no other than deify'd Men, which he shew'd by the Verses that he made in those places where he was to see their Sepulchres. Indeed by those Verses one cannot but think that he despised those made Gods in his Heart: and so did proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly those Philosophers that tell us these things; though, according to the latitude of their Principles, they were nevertheless as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as he was for the propagating of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Idolatry.</p>
            <p>What Notions men have of a Deity, one cannot better judge than by their Morals. For every one that hath any sense of Religion will endeavour to conform himself to the God whom he worships: At least he will avoid any thing that he knows to be contrary to his God. If we judge this way of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> according to the accounts they give of him, we have reason to believe, that as the Apostle tells us of them whom the Heathens worship'd) his Gods were no better than Devils. It
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:107134:4"/>
could be no otherwise, if there be any truth in the stories they tell, of his impudent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolical Fictions, and of the fraudulent ways that he took to make the people admire him: which they also that tell us these things seem to think were no lessening of his Moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
            <p>Particularly, they shew how he persuaded his Hearers to receive that Doctrine of the Transmigration of Souls. That it was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Doctrine we are told by <hi>Herodotus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herod</hi> 11. <hi>Diod. Sic. Philostr. vit. Apoll. Ty. iii.</hi> 6.</note> But if lying <hi>Philostratus</hi> may be believ'd, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> had it from the <hi>Bramins.</hi> It is agreed, that <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> was he that first brought it into <hi>Greece</hi>; and there it seems he had a mind to be thought the first Author of it.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Porph. p.</hi> 188.</note> To make the people believe this, he told them an impudent Lye, that his Soul was in <hi>Euphorbus</hi> at the time of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War; and in the six hundred years between that and his Birth, his Soul had pass'd through several other bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it came into his. He faced them down that he knew this by a singular gift of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring all the Stages through which his Soul had pass'd in its Travels.</p>
            <p>First, When <hi>Euphorbus</hi> was kill'd by <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelaus,</hi> (which was in the year before Christ 1185) then his Soul, as he said, came into <hi>Aethalides</hi> the Son of <hi>Mercury.</hi> After his death, it came into <hi>Hermotimus:</hi> then into
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:107134:4"/>
one <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> a Fisherman;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Porph. p.</hi> 201.</note> and at last it came into <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> This is <hi>Porphyry</hi>'s way of telling the Story.</p>
            <p>But from others we have it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Schol. in Sophoclis Electram.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> himself used to say, That his Soul was in <hi>Aethalides</hi> before it came into <hi>Euphorbus.</hi> And for this, they give us the Authorities of them that had reason to know things of him much better than <hi>Porphyry</hi>; namely, <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>og. Laertius</hi> saith it from <hi>Heraclides,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Diog. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert VIII,</hi> 4. <hi>Schol. in Apoll. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonaut I.</hi>
               </note> that lived near the time of <hi>Pythagoras</hi>; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Pherecydes,</hi> the mòst intimate Friend of <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> They tell their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with particulars worth knowing, if there were any truth in it. As namely, How <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> came by the gift above-mention'd: They tell us, that <hi>Mercury,</hi> whose office it was to carry Souls into <hi>Hades,</hi> gave the Soul of his Son <hi>Aethalides</hi> in its way thither, the privilege not to drink the Waters of <hi>Lethe,</hi> the drinking whereof makes Souls forget all that pass'd in this world; and so it is plain,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>D. Laert. VIII,</hi> 4.</note> how, as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> used to say, <hi>Euphorbus</hi> remembred his Soul had dwelt formerly in the body of <hi>Aethalides</hi> and <hi>Hermotimus,</hi> that his Soul was in both these, and the Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that his Soul was in those three, and <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that his Soul was in them all. They also tell us, how it came to pass, that in six hundred years that Soul of his was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in two bodies, namely, of <hi>Hermotimus</hi>
               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:107134:5"/>
and the Fisherman: for <hi>Mercury,</hi> as <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> himself used also to say, gave the Soul of his Son <hi>Aethalides</hi> leave to rest some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in <hi>Hades,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>D Laert. VIII.</hi> 14.</note> and at other times to travel above-ground; and so <hi>Pythagoras</hi> himself said, that after the Fisherman's death, his Soul had rested 207 years in <hi>Hades,</hi> before it came into that body of his.</p>
            <p>But what of all this? The Doctrine of Transmigration of Souls is sufficiently proved, if the Soul of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was at any time formerly in the body of <hi>Euphorbus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Porph. p.</hi> 191.</note> And that, as <hi>Porphyry</hi> tells us, was positively affirm'd by <hi>Pythagoras</hi> himself,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jambl. c.</hi> 28.</note> and prov'd beyond dispute; as likewise his Scholar <hi>Jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blichus</hi> tells us in the very same words. But these Philosophers were wise; they took care to hide that part of their Ware which would haue disgrac'd all the rest.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herod. II. Diog. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert</hi> from <hi>Heracli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi>
               </note> It was the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> Doctrine, that Souls pass'd out of men into Beasts, and Fishes, and Birds. This also, according to <hi>Heraclides, Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> used to say of himself; that he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, not only what Men, but what Plants, and what Animals his Soul had pass'd tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gh. And, tho' this was more than <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> gave to <hi>Aethalides, Pythagoras</hi> took upon <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to tell many others how their Souls had lived before they came into their bodies. One particularly that was beating a Dog,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Porph. p</hi> 191.</note> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd to forbear, because in the yelping of

that Dog, he heard a Friend's Soul speak to him. So <hi>Empedocles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>D. Laert. VIII.</hi> 36.</note> that lived in the next Age after <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and was for a while the Oracle of his Sect, declared of himself, that he had been, first a Boy, then a Girl, then a Plant, then a Bird, then a Fish. <hi>Apollonius</hi> had the same Impudence, if <hi>Philostratus</hi> may be believed:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philostr.

There is more than idle Fancy in them. They shew plainly a pernicious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilish design, to confound those two Doctrines that have so great an influence into Men's minds, to make them do good, and eschew evil: the Doctrines of the Immortality of the Soul, and of the Resurrection of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. For if those Fictions were true, there would be no difference between the Soul of a Man, and the Soul of a Brute, or a Plant; and there would be many more Bodies than there would be Souls to animate them at the Resurrection. What would not the Devil give to have these things believ'd by all Mankind?</p>

They were, as one may properly call them, the Artifices of an Impostor. <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the greatest that ever was of that sort, when he set up to be a Prophet, though it is not likely that he had ever heard of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> yet took the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same Methods that He did to impose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mankind. This will appear in several of the following Instances, if any one will take the Trouble to compare them with those that are in <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Life.</p>
            <p>The first thing, we read <hi>Pythagoras</hi> did, to make way for the Authentical publishing of his Doctrines,<note place="margin">

For this purpose, he provided himself a Cell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground; and then, giving out he was dead, he retir'd into that Hole: and there for a long time together, seven Years, as some tell us, he lived unknown to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Only his Mother was in the Secret, for she was to supply him with Necessaries: but of these, he took in no more than just what would keep him alive. Then at last, he came forth like a perfect <hi>Skeleton:</hi> and shewed himself as one that had been all this while in another World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:107134:6"/>He that was so greedy of vain Glory, that he could afford to purchase it at this Rate, would not spare his Pains, or refuse any Help, to get into Possession of his Purchase. And for this, it being requisite he should do things above the Power of any Mortal, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of such things, true or false, they tell us not a few in his Life.</p>
            <p>Some of the Fathers have said that he wrought them by Compact with the Devil.<note place="margin">

               </note> But I see no Necessity of that; for he had other ways by which other Men have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fame of working Miracles. He was doubtless both a natural Philosopher, and a great Mathematician. He understood all the Secrets of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Chaldae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> And having many Disciples on those Accounts, it seems very likely that he might act in Confederacy with them. This at least they could do for him; they might help de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise Stories of the Miracles that he wrought: and then, for their own Credit as well as his, they would be industrious to spread them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People.</p>

But if this were true, being an invisible Miracle, and impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be proved, it could not be made use of to prove any thing else.

Another time seeing some Fisher men at their draught, he foretold them the exact Number of Fishes that their Net should bring up; and when they were told, threw them in again. How by stroaking a Bear, and whispering a Bull in the Ear, he brought them both to the Pythagorean Diet: the Bear to eat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that had life; and the Bull to crop no more Bean-tops. How he spoke to a River that he was passing over with many of his Friends,

and it answer'd him again in all their Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Good morrow</hi> Pythagoras. But this goes beyond all the rest, if there be any Truth in it; that when <hi>Abaris</hi> had been all over <hi>Greece</hi> to beg Money for the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his God <hi>Apollo Hyperboreus</hi>; at last, in an evil hour for himself, he came to <hi>Pythagoras</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> where the cunning Philosopher rooked him of his Money, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading the poor Man that he was his God. And to convince him of the Truth of it, they say, That <hi>Pythagoras</hi> shewed him his golden Thigh; and then, which was worst of all, made him swear the People into a Belief that he was <hi>Apollo</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>If any other Author mentions any of these wonderful Things, he declares that he hath it only from report, or by hearsay, and so leaves the Reader to judge of the Truth of it.

But why should these Philosophers either be so wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to abuse the Faith of Mankind in devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing such Stories? Or why should they take the Pains to Collect them, and Pawn their Faith to give them Credit in the World?

Such great Men as they were, had no doubt great Reason for this.

            <p>It is certain that these Men had a vehement Hatred against the Christian Religion; not only through the Prejudices of their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but much more on the account of that way of Philosophy, by which they so much valu'd themselves, and had got so great a Fame in the World. They had no Patience to see that sort of Learning, that had been so long in Possession of Glory among all civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd Nations, now to be brought in Disgrace by a Religion, which they accounted to be no better than Folly and Nonsense, and yet pretending to Divine Revelation, would shew that they by all their Wisdom knew not God.

            <p>They laid the chief Stress of their Proof upon his Resurrection from the Dead: Of which, not only his Apostles were Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,

The Apostles especially took it on themselves, as their Office, to be Witnesses of his Resurrection. For the faithful Discharge whereof, as they could expect nothing but Sufferings in this Life, so they desir'd nothing more than to finish their Course by dying for it. And they were not deceiv'd in this Expectation; all of them being continually persecuted as long as they liv'd, and many of them suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Death for the Testimony of Christ. They were charged with no other Crime in this World.</p>
            <p>As for what they write of his Miracles; and also of their own, which they profest they wrought only by a Power derived from him; the truth of the matters of Fact, we do not find was ever question'd by any that lived in that Age. On the contrary, we see it was acknowledged by the <hi>Pharisees,</hi>

No doubt it puzled their Wise heads to think how' such wonderful Works should be wrought by such simple illiterate Men. For one cannot think they could satisfie themselves with the account which they gave others, of
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:107134:9"/>
the way that Christ had to cast out Devils, when they said that he did it by the Prince of Devils; for, as he there answer'd them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat. IX.</hi> 34. <hi>XII.</hi> 24.</note> it was visibly against the Devil's Interest to do this; the Miracles of Christ being plainly in those Instances to dispossess the Devil of Men's Bodies; and by that, and other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial Works, to oblige them, and others, to receive a Doctrine that would also dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess him of their Souls. But besides the absurdity of this, it is plain the <hi>Jews</hi> did not believe themselves in this Accusation of Christ. For if they had, they would have insisted on this; as being a Capital Crime, not only by their Law, but also the <hi>Roman:</hi> And therefore to be sure, they would not have been to seek for other Crimes,<note place="margin">

            <p>But that which the <hi>Pharisees</hi> said then, of that one sort of Miracles; though it was against all Reason, and against their own Conscience; yet, for want of a better Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for their unbelief, the <hi>Jews</hi> in after times have alledged against all the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Christ, and his Apostles and Followers.

            <p>But how could <hi>Celsus</hi> answer this to his own Conscience? that whereas of the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought by Christians in his own time, he saw there was no denying the matters of fact;<note place="margin">

            <p>Whether it was before, or after these Books, that he writ the life of <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> we cannot certainly know: for the life it self is imperfect, both at the beginning, and the end; and the whole Book is but a part of his History of the lives of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers.

In this piece <hi>Hierocles,</hi> having magnified <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus</hi> for the great things that were recorded of him by <hi>Philostratus</hi> in his life; and having vilified our Lord Iesus Christ, whom the Christians, as he saith on the account of his doing a few <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:107134:14"/>
eminent for their Learning, and lovers of truth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What a <hi>Lover of Truth Hierocles</hi> himself was, we are to judge, not by the title of his Books, but by the things contained in them. And though his Books against the Christians have been lost many Ages since, (as those blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Books of <hi>Porphyry</hi> were,) yet here we have a kind of Summary of them in this Fragment. For here we see in short, what he had to say against the Apostles of Christ, and what to say for the Evangelists of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius,</hi> whom he sets up against him: and it cannot be denied that, on either side, the truth of the matters of fact is to be judged of chiefly by the sufficiency and the honesty of the Witnesses. Therefore knowing what he has to say of them, we know in effect the validity of all that is contained in his Books.</p>
            <p>First, In his charge against the Apostles of Christ, to say that <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>Illiterate,</hi> this was certainly an impudent Calumny. For beside his knowledge of the Greek, that was his native Language,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.11.</note> wherein also we see he writ a large Epistle with his own hand, and quotes the Greek Poets in several of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; I say, beside this, he had the Hebrew Learning in great perfection, being brought up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 22.3.</note> a Doctor in great fame among the Iews to this day. And he
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:107134:14"/>
gave such proofs of his Learning before the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour and King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> that the Governour said,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 26.24.</note> 
               <hi>too much learning had made him mad.</hi> So far was He from cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him an <hi>illiterate</hi> Man.</p>
            <p>Then to call him and <hi>Peter, Liars,</hi> and <hi>Impostors,</hi> what occasion did they give him for this? Only by their Preaching and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the Christian Religion. But did they believe that Religion, or not? If they did, suppose they might err in this, yet they could not be <hi>Liars</hi> and <hi>Impostors</hi>; for they both knew, and writ, that all such are in a state of Damnation,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3.</note> according to the rules of their Religion. But if they did not believe it, then indeed they might do wicked things for their Religion, if that would recommend them to the Emperour's favour; and so to get preferment, as <hi>Hierocles</hi> did. But they were so far from that, the Government be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against their Religion, that they could get nothing by it but Dangers and Sufferings. Those they met with in all places wheresoever they preach'd. And they look'd for nothing else in this world, but Sufferings, and those to end in a cruel Death, for Christ's sake.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim</hi> 4.6. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14.</note> This both of them declared in the last Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples they writ. And in this we see they were not mistaken. For both of them suffer'd Martyrdom, as <hi>Clemens</hi> tells us in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which he writ
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:107134:15"/>
within two or three years after their death, the truth of which Epistle hath never been question'd by any learned man whatsoever.</p>
            <p>But what shall we say of a man that was perfectly Blinded, with Prejudice and Malice, or with Ambition and Covetousness? If <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erocles</hi> had not been so, he could not but have seen that those two Apostles of Christ had nothing about them that would suit with those two ugly characters of <hi>Liars</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors.</hi> But he had those in his eye that would certainly have been taken by those marks, if there had been a hue and cry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them. I can't think any learned man in his Age, being asked, Of all the Writers, whose Works were then extant, which was the greatest <hi>Liar?</hi> would name any other than <hi>Philostratus.</hi> I am sure he could not, if he would speak impartially. And yet this <hi>Philostratus,</hi> and his two Authors, <hi>Maximus,</hi> and <hi>Damis,</hi> known to none but himself, are the men whom <hi>Hierocles</hi> calleth <hi>Learned Men,</hi> and <hi>Lovers of Truth.</hi> And for an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor,</hi> if such a one had been enquired for, I know not whom a learned man, that had no design to serve with a Lye, would have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus</hi>: whom yet <hi>Hierocles</hi> so much admires, that he thinks himself modest for saying only this, He was <hi>a Favourite of the Gods;</hi> whereas the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians say, that <hi>Christ</hi> was <hi>God</hi> himself,
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:107134:15"/>
for those few strange things that are told of him.</p>
            <p>First, For <hi>Philostratus,</hi> on whose single word all the credit of this story of <hi>Apolloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> depends; of what value his word is, must be judged by considering how he was quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for an Historian. To begin with the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities he had to inform himself; it is certain, he could say nothing of his Own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For as himself tells us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philost. VIII.</hi> 12.</note> 
               <hi>Apollonius</hi> died a few weeks after the Emperour <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>: that was in the year of our Lord 96. But <hi>Philostratus</hi> did not write this till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a hundred years after. How came he then by all the stuff with which he hath filled a large History? He tells us, that while he lived in the Court of <hi>Julia,</hi> that most infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Empress, the Mother and Wife of that horrible brute <hi>Caracalla,</hi> the Minutes of <hi>Apollonius</hi>'s Life, written by one <hi>Damis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philost. I.</hi> 3.</note> that lived with him, were presented to her by one of <hi>Damis</hi>'s Relations; and she being a Lover of fine Language, delivered them to this Sophist <hi>Philostratus,</hi> to put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a handsome dress. But that we may not think these Minutes were all that he had for the furnishing of his History, he tells us, he had besides,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ib.</hi>
               </note> an account from one <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> of <hi>Aegae,</hi> how <hi>Apollonius</hi> past his time in that Town, for the two or three years that he lived there, being then about 20 years
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:107134:16"/>
of Age, <hi>almost a Boy,</hi> as <hi>Hierocles</hi> words it. And this is all the help he had from these two <hi>Lovers of Truth,</hi> as <hi>Hierocles</hi> calls them. But there was besides, one <hi>Moe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragenes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Ib. I,</hi> 3.</note> that writ <hi>IV</hi> Books, <hi>On</hi> or <hi>Against Apollonius</hi>; but he is not to be heeded, saith <hi>Philostratus,</hi> because he was <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> of many of our Stories; so he lost the Honour of being recorded by <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> for one of the <hi>lovers of Truth.</hi> In short, except the little things that hapned in the short time that <hi>Apollonius</hi> was at <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gae</hi>; for any thing else of his Life, <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus</hi> doth not pretend to have any Author but <hi>Damis.</hi> Yet all that he had of <hi>Damis,</hi> was no more than a Table-book of Minutes, as <hi>Philostratus</hi> owns. And those might be written by any one else, for ought he knew. For it was a hundred years after <hi>Damis</hi>'s death, before he saw or heard of them. Till then they were <hi>not known.</hi> And then a Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less man, pretending to be a relation of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi> brought them, and said they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Damis.</hi> Th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s is all the Authority we have for <hi>Philostratus</hi>'s Legend.</p>
            <p>But he saith in the Chapter before, he had some things from <hi>Town-talk,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>I,</hi> 2.</note> in the places where <hi>Apollonius</hi> had been; and some things he had that <hi>other men said</hi> of him: and some things from <hi>Epistles</hi> that <hi>Apollonius</hi> had written to <hi>Kings, &amp;c.</hi> As for the <hi>Talk</hi> of things
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:107134:16"/>
done a hundred years ago, that is very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; but of what Authority were these <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles?</hi> There may well be a doubt of this. For the Epistles in <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally forged by Sophists.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philostr. Soph. II. p.</hi> 617. He writ a book of Love-E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles. <hi>Suid.</hi>
               </note> And <hi>Philostratus</hi> being a Sophist, and one that knew how to write <hi>to Kings,</hi> might be the very man that forged the Epistles now extant. We have reason to like them the worse, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing too well with his History. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, he seems to doubt that his Reader might suspect these Epistles, and therefore question his History. To fence against this, he saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I,</hi> 1.</note> he took things that were <hi>more certain</hi> from the Authors that he names af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards: <hi>Damis, &amp;c.</hi> Of how little credit those Authors were, we have seen. And if things taken out of them were <hi>more certain,</hi> as he himself tells us, then there is no credit at all to be given to his Epistles.</p>
            <p>So much for the Authority: now for the Matters of his History. Some of them, I dare say, were such as <hi>Lucian</hi> had never heard of, and yet He liv'd mid-way between <hi>Apollonius</hi> and his Historian. Particularly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>IV,</hi> 3.</note> I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he ever heard of that Story of <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> how he made the people at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> stone an old Beggar; who, as He told them, was a <hi>Daemon</hi>; and when the Stones had made a Hillock over his body, he bad the people remove the Stones, which they did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and found under them, not a man, but
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:107134:17"/>
a Mastiff, as big as the biggest sort of Lion, and foaming at Mouth, as if he had been mad. So likewise he tells how <hi>Apollonius</hi> being invited, with many other Guests, by his Friend <hi>Menippus</hi> to his Wedding; he found that the amiable Bride was a <hi>She-Devil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> 8. <hi>Empusa.</hi>
               </note> that was in love with <hi>Menippus,</hi> and pretending to be a great Fortune, had provided the Wedding Dinner, with a noble Antendance, and all manner of Delicacies: but, upon his telling his Friend what she was, she, together with her Attendance and Dinner, vanisht, leaving <hi>Apollonius</hi> to make her Excuse to the Bridegroom and his Company. Here were Subjects for <hi>Lucian</hi> to have bantered upon, beyond any that are in his Book; so that, because they are not There, I say again, one may be sure he never heard of them.</p>
            <p>He that could thus descry Devils, might as well ken Souls, one would think, and tell what Bodies they had passed through; especially being a <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Philosopher. I have shewn <hi>Apollonius</hi> could do that,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P. ix.</hi>
               </note> as well as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> himself; though <hi>Philostratus</hi> doth not tell us, that ever his Soul dwelt, as that of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> did, in the Body of a Son of <hi>Mercury,</hi> that had that Gift from his Father. But he was not to be measur'd by <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> being as <hi>Philostratus</hi> tells us, far the greater Man of the two.

in this, that he could call up the Souls of any of the Heroes, and entertain himself with them at his Pleasure. Particularly, at the Tomb of <hi>Achilles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> 3.</note> where that Heroe appear'd sometimes frightfully to others, who therefore warn'd <hi>Apollonius</hi> not to come near him; he laught at them, and spent a whole Night there in Conversation with <hi>Achilles,</hi> till the Cocks-crowing, which, it seems, warns the Sprights away.<note place="margin">

He called <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> by his Name: And told him, I am glad you are here, for I have long lookt for such a one as you to tell them of this.

                  </gap>mis</hi> said nothing of the manner of his Death. But then, delivering the opinions of others,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>VIII,</hi> 12.</note> he saith, <hi>Thus died</hi> Apollonius; adding, <hi>if he Died at all.</hi> O rare Historian! that, having not only assured us he was Born, but having given a particular account, of his Father, and his Mother, and the Green Chamber he was Born in; comes at last to make a Doubt whether he ever Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or no. What would this man have the Reader think of his <hi>Apollonius</hi>? that he was greater than <hi>Apollo?</hi> or than <hi>Jupiter</hi> himself? So it seems. For both these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as we have shewn from <hi>Pythagoras</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P. v.</hi>
               </note> who own'd it was after their Deaths that they were made Gods: and <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> could not but Know this; for, as this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tells us, <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was Among them

sometimes; and <hi>Apollo</hi> came to him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I,</hi> 1, 2.</note> and own'd that it was He that spoke to him. Yet here, <hi>Philostratus,</hi> that told us all this, though he durst not speak out, that <hi>Apollonius</hi> did Never die; yet he intimates this was his Opinion, and would incline his Reader to believe it: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly your <hi>Tzetzes</hi> did not exceed in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him the <hi>most lying Philostratus.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Writers that I know, there is scarce a greater <hi>Liar</hi> in the world.</p>
            <p>Nor was there a greater Impostor than <hi>Apollonius</hi>; whom, on the sole credit of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lostratus</hi>'s History, <hi>Hierocles</hi> so much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolls, as the great <hi>Favourite of the Gods,</hi> and fitter to be called a <hi>God,</hi> than our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour. But to shew more particularly what <hi>Apollonius</hi> was, we must not wholly reject his lying Historian. For, if we do, we are quite in the dark: there being no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that writ of <hi>Apollonius</hi> within two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after his death, <hi>Lucian</hi> only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. And therefore to make the best of what we have in these two Writers, I shall begin with <hi>Philostratus,</hi> and take the best Information we can get of him.</p>
            <p>Now according to this Historian, <hi>Apolloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was bred up at first among the <hi>Pythagore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and always affected to be thought a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher of that Sect.

but much out did him in his Travels. And according to the way of that Sect, which was much addicted to the Worship of <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s, he made it his b<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>siness, wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he went, to restore the <hi>Gentile</hi> Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which was then much sunk by the preaching of the Christian Religion. This, no doubt, might entitle him to the Devil's especial Assistance, by which he might do Wonderfull things; and might, as he Boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he did, know more than all the men in the world. That was nothing to him. He would be thought to be a God, and therefore he boasted of things which no Man could know or do.<note place="margin">

Others that saw his Tricks, and heard such things from him, soon found both what he was, and what he would be at. They saw, he was either a Magician or a grand Cheat. This was the common Opinion they had of him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I,</hi> 2, 3.</note> according to <hi>Philostratus,</hi> who notably fenceth against it. They also saw what he drove at, even to be thought a God. Of this he was accused to the Government:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>VII,</hi> 1.</note> and that by Philosophers even by <hi>Euphrates</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

of them in his Age. These learned men, no doubt, had seen the Books that he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd; namely,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III,</hi> 13.</note> his four Books of Iudicial Astrology, and his Books of Sacrifices, to shew what sorts of them would best please e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very God. I find no other Books that he writ. And these could not but confirm those Philosophers in their opinion of him. We have these things, and much more of this kind, from <hi>Philostratus</hi>; whom we have reason to believe in these things, though not in many other; for in these he agrees with him that lived nearest <hi>Apollonius</hi>'s time.</p>
            <p>Of all the Writers now extant, the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to the time of <hi>Apollonius</hi> was <hi>Lucian,</hi> as I have shewn.

we have of <hi>Apollonius</hi> from <hi>Lucian.</hi> And we had not known so much of him as this, but that <hi>Lucian,</hi> having occasion to speak of a <hi>Companion</hi> of his, that set up at his Trade, and took Apprentices at it; thereupon brings him in, as the Master-workman of his Age in all that way of Diabolical Practice.</p>
            <p>This was the Reputation he had, as it seems, till above a hundred years after his Death. Then outcomes this Book of his Life; compos'd, as I have shewn, out of <hi>unknown Memoirs,</hi>

            <p>But when God<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:107134:22"/>
the visible hand of God; the Iustice whereof two of them at their death did acknowledge. Then the Devil being thrown out of Heaven, all his Angels fell with him. Christianity came to be the establish'd Religion. And Then, (to use the Phrase of a Gentleman that had more Wit than did him good,) Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on having taught the people to <hi>say Grace,</hi> there was no more danger of <hi>the crooked Pin in the Pudding</hi>: those palpable Lyes of <hi>Apollonius</hi> would not go down; and so, for ought I find, <hi>Hierocles</hi> quite lost his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>Next, <hi>Jamblichus,</hi> who, as <hi>Eunapius</hi> saith in his life, was a greater Scholar than his Master <hi>Porphyry,</hi> and who was no less a Hater of Christians; yet living under Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Emperors, a she did all the time of his age for writing Books, he durst not write Professedly against the Christian Religion. But taking this to be a safe way, he went on with his Masters design of setting up <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> to be a Rival to our Saviour. In order to this, he took up all the stuff that <hi>Porphyry</hi> in his life of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd ready to his hand. He worked it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again his own way, oftentimes making use of <hi>Porphyry</hi>'s words. Then, for far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Embellishment, he added out of his own Invention, whatever he thought would either adorn his Subject, or promote the design of
<pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:107134:23"/>
his Writing. His design was plainly to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Christian Religion. But so, as not to run himself in any danger on that account: and therefore, without ever mentioning Christ or Christians; which he could not do in this Book without seeming to make some kind of reflection upon them; he only endeavours to make <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and those of his Sect, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine them in the Lustre that he gives them with his Eloquence, such as it is.

               </note> if <hi>Pythagoras</hi> himself may be believ'd. But <hi>Jamblichus</hi> was aware that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> overshot himself sometimes, and did it particularly in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Stages that his Soul pass'd thro' in it's Travels. Therefore <hi>Jamblichus</hi> takes notice of no other but <hi>Euphorbus,</hi> in whom that Soul formerly dwelt. He smuggles all the other Names we have mention'd,<note place="margin">

               </note> as we have shewn) that he was the very God himself: and proved it by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him his Golden Thigh, such, as it seems <hi>Abaris</hi> had told him that the Image of his God had in <hi>Scythia.</hi> But then, lest <hi>Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> should ask him what he made Here? <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> added,<note place="margin">

            <p>Such stuff as this runs through his Book; which, being written for the deifying of an Impostor, plainly shew'd that the design of it was to Banter the Gospel of Christ. He
<pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:107134:24"/>
begins like one of the Heathen Poets, with invoking the Gods, and <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> to assist him in the Work. How he ended it, we cannot tell; for his Book is imperfect. But probably he continu'd it with an account of this Impostor's Disciples, in imitation of the <hi>Acts of the Apostles.</hi> In short, as well for History, as for Doctrinal matters, from one end to the other, it hath so much of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in it, that it seems to have been wholly written by his Inspiration.</p>
            <p>But all this I do acknowledge to have been a Digression, as well as all the rest of what I have written, that doth not concern the Writers of <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s Life. For it was my proper business to shew of what credit They are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to matter of History. Now the two chief of these, being <hi>Porphyry</hi> and <hi>Jamblichus,</hi> who were great Philosophers themselves, and such great Admirers of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi> as they shew in the writing of his Life; one ought to expect they would have taken care to gather all that was True of him out of all the former Historians, and to have mingled nothing with it that was Inconsistent with the truth of History. How well they have perform'd this in other respects, I shall not take upon me to examin. But I shall take account of it only as to matter of Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology. And that I think sufficiently shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how much at random it is that <hi>Jambli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
               <pb n="xlviii" facs="tcp:107134:25"/>
pretends to give the <hi>Years</hi> of <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi>'s Life, and his chief Actions and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents: and also how grosly both He, and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry</hi> before him, have abused their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the accounts that they give us of his <hi>principal Disciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the years of <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s Life, <hi>Jamblichus</hi> tells us, that it was much about his <hi>XVIII</hi> year that he set out to Travel: and that after some time,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 31. <hi>l.</hi> 5.</note> (which I take to be <hi>IV</hi> years) spent in other Countries, he came into <hi>Aegypt,</hi>

            <p>So Distinct an account as this is of the years of <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s Life, whereof there is not the least Item in any of the ancienter Writers, did, I confess, not a little rejoyce me, when I first met with it: and so much the more, because of two <hi>Certain</hi> Notations of time, by which, if they were true, all those years might be reduced to the like cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.
<pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:107134:25"/>
There is nothing better known in ancient History, than the year of <hi>Camby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>'s conquering <hi>Aegypt.</hi> We are certain it was in the end of the third year, or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the fourth of Olymp. <hi>LXIV.</hi> So that according to <hi>Jamblichus,</hi> this was the very year of <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s being carry'd to <hi>Babylon.</hi> And the time of his going into <hi>Italy</hi> is as certain, according to <hi>Jamblichus,</hi> who saith it was Olymp. <hi>LXII</hi> wherein <hi>Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xias</hi> was Victor. There is plainly <hi>VI</hi> years distance of time between these years that are here mention'd. And the same, one would think, there should be between his being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd to <hi>Babylon</hi> and his going into <hi>Italy.</hi> But that cannot be <hi>Jamblichus</hi>'s meaning. For he saith, it was <hi>XII</hi> years that <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> stay'd at <hi>Babylon;</hi> and then, to make up his life very near <hi>C</hi> years, as <hi>Jamblichus</hi> reckons it, there must be three or four years more that he stay'd in <hi>Crete,</hi> and at <hi>Samos,</hi> before he went into <hi>Italy.</hi> Add these to the <hi>XII</hi> years before mention'd, and they make some <hi>XV</hi> or <hi>XVI</hi> years. And yet here <hi>Jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blichus</hi> makes his going into <hi>Italy</hi> to be in Olymp. <hi>LXII,</hi> that is, to be <hi>VI</hi> or <hi>VII</hi> years before the certain time of his being carry'd to <hi>Babylon,</hi> which must be in the third or fourth year of Olymp. <hi>LXIII,</hi> if he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd thither by the Forces of <hi>Cambyses,</hi> as <hi>Jamblichus</hi> tells us. So in short, he brings
<pb n="l" facs="tcp:107134:26"/>
               <hi>Pythagoras</hi> Captive to <hi>Babylon</hi> some <hi>XV</hi> or <hi>XVI</hi> years before his going to <hi>Italy</hi>; and yet he makes his going into <hi>Italy VI</hi> or <hi>VII</hi> years before his being carry'd to <hi>Babylon.</hi> Here are two of the chief accounts of time in his History which so manifestly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict one another, that to believe him in both is impossible.</p>
            <p>Th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s is a great disappointment, but it will make us some part of amends, if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny truth in either of them. To begin with that which he saith of <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s being taken in <hi>Aegypt</hi> by the Soldiers of King <hi>Cambyses;</hi> that must be in the third or fo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rth year of Olymp. <hi>LXIII,</hi> as I have shewn. But as herein he contradicts himself in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Notation of time, so in this he doth not agree with the ancienter Writers; who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally speak of <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s coming from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Samos,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o <hi>Italy,</hi> before the Reign of <hi>Cambyses.</hi> Now that he that lived near <hi>DCCC</hi> years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter those times, should presume to publish this to the World, without naming any Author for it, but as if he said it of his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; this I cannot look upon as any other than a very imp<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dent Fiction. As for that which he said of <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s going into <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi> in Olymp. <hi>LXII,</hi> it is very likely he had Authors that said something like it. There are enough that say he was there in Olymp.
<pb n="li" facs="tcp:107134:26"/>
               <hi>LXII</hi>; and it is very likely <hi>Jamblichus</hi> might mistake them, and that might occasion him to say that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> went thither at that time. This is the best I can say of it. And so in short, I have lost all the joy that I had of both his Discoveries. For having exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd them, I see the last is a mere Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the former a bold Fiction, and they both contradict one another. What credit can one give to such an Historian?</p>
            <p>For his account of the Disciples of <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> he takes what he will out of the rude heap that his Master <hi>Porphyry</hi> had thrown together, and much more he adds very la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishly out of his own head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zamolxis</hi> the Lawgiver of the <hi>Getes,</hi> they will have to be one of <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s Disciples. <hi>Porphyry</hi> makes him one of the First.

And yet he had reckon<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herodot. IV,</hi> 56.</note> that liv'd among them who remember'd <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> saith,
<pb n="lii" facs="tcp:107134:27"/>
               <hi>Zamolxis</hi> was much Ancienter than he. And therefore <hi>Jamblichus</hi> was once in the right, though perhaps it was through forgetfulness, when he left him out of the Catalogue of <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s Disciples.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zaleucus</hi> and <hi>Charondas</hi> he hath in the Catalogue; for which, he hath not only <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry</hi> on his side, who tells us from <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi> that by these he gave Laws to their people; but also in <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> there is a mention of them to this purpose.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>c</hi> 23. <hi>p.</hi> 103. <hi>l.</hi> 11, 15.</note> But <hi>Jamblichus</hi> of his own head reckons both these among them that came Young to be <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s Disciples when he was Old: which is no truer of them than of <hi>Zamolxis;</hi> for these also were much ancienter than <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras. Zaleucus</hi> lived Olymp. <hi>XXIX,</hi> according to <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s <hi>Chronicon.</hi> Of <hi>Charondas</hi> you have shewn that he was the Scholar of <hi>Zaleucus,</hi>

            <p>Now this is so fine a Romance, that it

is pity there should be no truth in it; but only that there was such a City, and that there were such Persons. It is civil to grant that in the time of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> there was such a one as <hi>Abaris</hi> living, though Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors differ much about the time of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Greece.</hi> For as <hi>Harpocration</hi> tells us, <hi>Hippostratus</hi> placed it in Olymp. <hi>III,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in Olymp. <hi>XXI. Pindar</hi> in the time of King <hi>Croesus;</hi> and <hi>Euseb. Chronicon</hi> hath it twice, namely there, and in Olymp. <hi>LXXXII.</hi> But granting that <hi>Abaris</hi> was in <hi>Greece</hi> in <hi>Croesus</hi>'s time, which is the only time that consists with <hi>Jamblichus</hi>'s story: Then, according to <hi>Euseb. Chronicon,</hi> his coming was in Olymp. <hi>LIV,</hi> 2. that was while <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was abroad in his Travels, according to <hi>Jamblichus</hi>'s Account, which makes his coming into <hi>Italy</hi> to be in Olymp. <hi>LXII</hi>; that is, full <hi>XXX</hi> years after. By this time <hi>Abaris,</hi> though he came out of <hi>Greece</hi> with him, must needs be <hi>very well stricken in years:</hi> much more, if he came after <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> was setled in <hi>Italy.</hi> But what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of <hi>Phalaris</hi> the mean while? See in my account, 572 before Christ. There it appears, the latest we can bring <hi>Phalaris</hi> to die, is in Olymp. <hi>LVII,</hi> 4. that is <hi>XVI</hi> years before <hi>Jamblichus</hi> makes <hi>Pythagoras</hi> come into <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> After this, <hi>Phalaris</hi> could neither kill, nor

               </gap>d, but in a Romance; and I take all this Story of <hi>Jamblichus</hi> to be no other.</p>
            <p>For the rest of the 218 Names of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in his Catalogue,<note place="margin">

There are scarce two more of them that ever saw <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> for ought that appears in any good Author: though here are the names of several more that were Philosophers of the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Sect. Yet even these, together with them before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, will not make up the odd number of eighteen. For the other two hundred, I take them to be insignificant Names, inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Jamblichus</hi> only out of vain Ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I do not lay any weight at all upon the Testimony of <hi>Jamblichus,</hi> nor much on that of his Master <hi>Porphyry,</hi> where he doth not mention his Author.

The accounts of his death are various. The likeliest is that which we have in the <hi>Excerpta</hi> of <hi>Diod. Sic. Porphyry,</hi> and <hi>Jambl. c.</hi> 35. They tell how one <hi>Cylon</hi> of <hi>Croton,</hi> a rich, ambitious, boisterous man, having offer'd himself to be taken into the College, and being refus'd, was thereby so enraged, that he got the Mob together, and fell upon <hi>Milo</hi>'s house, when <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and his Disciples were all there together, and burnt the house, and all that were in it, except two or three that narrowly escaped. Some say <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was one of them that were burnt there. Others say, he escaped out of the Fire, and was kill'd in pursuit. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that he fled to <hi>Caulonia,</hi> thence to <hi>Locri,</hi> thence to <hi>Tarentum</hi>; but being no where receiv'd, at last he went to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapontum,</hi> and there got into the <hi>Muses</hi> Temple, where being kept from Victuals 40 days, he was starved. <hi>Hermippus,</hi> whom <hi>Josephus</hi> calleth the most eminent Writer of <hi>Pythag.</hi> Life, hath a most unlikely story
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107134:39"/>
of his death. He saith that being ingag'd with <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he <hi>Agrigentines</hi> against the <hi>Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans,</hi> and his Party, being worsted, he was taken in Flight because he would not run over a Bean Plot, and so was kill'd by the Enemy. <hi>D. Laert.</hi> hath an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram on his Death, according to this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which I think indeed is fitter for a Poet than an Historian.</p>
            <p>After his Death, those of his Disciples that were living, are said to have been dispersed into <hi>Greece,</hi> and the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Countries. And yet his Family is said to have continued at or about <hi>Croton.</hi> His Wife <hi>Theano</hi> was born there, according to <hi>Clem. Alex.</hi> from <hi>Didymus,</hi> and <hi>D. Laert.</hi> and <hi>Suidas.</hi> But <hi>Porphyry</hi> says she was of <hi>Crete.</hi> Some say that she, and her Son <hi>Telauges,</hi> revived or continued his School. Others say it was done by <hi>Aristaeus</hi> of <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> that married his Daugh. <hi>Theano.</hi> His Son <hi>Arimnestus</hi> is mention'd by <hi>Porphyry</hi> from <hi>Duris Samius,</hi> and said to have taught <hi>Democritus</hi> the famous Philosopher. <hi>D.
