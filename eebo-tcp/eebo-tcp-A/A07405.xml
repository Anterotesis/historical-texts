            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

doo they cite the ſaying of <hi>S. Auguſtyne,</hi>
which is this: <hi>I woulde giue no credit vnto the

muſt not ground our beliefe vpon the autority
of the church, for the churche doth not inſtitute
<hi>The articles of the fayth,</hi> ſhee doth only teach,
and admoniſh vs. But for the woorde of God
muſt we beleeue, when namely; we being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed

But the hearer beeing admoniſhed of the

               </p>
               <p>Finally they altogither knowe not what

               <p>So all men are burdened with the

               <p>It is not onely to be deliuered from cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies

knewe that euen the ſame ſinne, and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie

examine and way ſuch ſayinges of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
as this is, which erewhyle I haue recited? He
witneſſeth <hi>Paule</hi> meaneth this, that <hi>Abraham</hi>
was pronounced iuſt, bycauſe hee beleued, not
only touching the promiſe of God concerning
his poſterity, but alſo touching the forgiuenes

               <p>Such lyke ſentences ſhal a man meete

ſhew, that he beleued touching Grace
&amp; faith, the very ſame which we do teach. Like
as in his booke <hi>De Spiritu &amp; Litera,</hi> he ſaith
thus: <hi>By meanes of the lawe wee feare God but
by fayth wee flee vntoo the mercy of God.</hi> Loe
heere doth he manifeſtly diſcerne betwene the
Lawe and the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>And although nowe and then in his wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges

dooth not ſo allowe the ceremonies of

thinges then receaued in the Church, which
in deede himſelfe dooth not at all allowe of:
Nay rather hee woulde thoſe too bee founde
faulte withall, and reformed: And certayne
other thinges there were, which after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his tyme hee obſerued: So that wee all
doo yeelde much vntoo preſent manners or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions

               <p>In this mannes tyme ſpeeches of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory

declareth, ſaying there were certaine perſons
which ſo thought that the ſoules of the godly
were purged, after that they departed out of
their bodyes: But in his 9. booke of <hi>Confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
hee requyreth of God in his prayer for his
mother departed, in theſe words, <hi>Lorde inſpire
thy ſeruauntes, that they may remember my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>And there were vowes accuſtomably vſed

whether marriages after vowes contracted
might bee diſſolued, yea or no. Touching this

ought not returne vntoo the vowe again with
the iniury of the other. Neither is the bonde
made fruſtrate betweene both perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea
although one of them haue brought with him
the chaunging of his former purpoſe. Theſe
thinges briefly dooth hee ſpeake in that
texte. But the error of vowes was then
of more valure, then this mitigation of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtyne.</hi>
Therefore the conſtitutions which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes
folowed in the church did ſeparate

               <p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
which was a more obſcure and darke
thing to be diſcerned. For hee was ouercome
with vulgar opinions of his tyme: Now was
the cuſtome receaued of making vowes: A

errors wrapped in them, they were accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for woorſhipping of God, for a ſingular
merite of righteouſnes, for perfection, alſo to
a great many they were impoſſible. Theſe if

that is, in a peaceable and bleſſed life,

the Soules of the iuſt doe not goe downe too

and peace. In this life the godly are ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
with horrible afflictions, bycauſe
GOD by a woonderfull determination wil
haue his Churche Subiecte vntoo the croſſe
and too taſte ſuch afflictions as Chriſte hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
did. So <hi>Adam, Iſaack, Iacob, Ioſeph,
Dauid, Eſayas, Hieremias, Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and

<hi>Peter</hi> ſayeth: <hi>Humble your ſelues vnder the

                  </hi> 5. For although
ſuche are the afflictions which the Godlye
ſuffer in this life, whyle they are in the fleſh,
yet notwithſtanding this, after they be once

               <p>But after death, there is then no place
of repentaunce: Like as <hi>Paule</hi> playnelie

               <p>If our Aduerſaryes doe ſay, That thoſe

them, that thereby repentaunce might grow:
but that they ſhoulde bee as ſatiſfactions for

deale more too be refuſed. For the doctrine
of Satiſfactions, which the Sentenciaries

may the more appeare that <hi>Gregories</hi> faulte

               <p>VVhich thing ſeeing it is ſo, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
alſo of the Maſſe (as they call it) is to be
reprehended, wherin is mentioned, That ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

this to tranſferre the Sacrament for the dead?
when the inſtitution therof ſpeaketh ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>

Chriſt; and let vs alſo knowe, that vntoo this

               <p>And let vs not onely thinke, that this
Churche is ſuch a Citie as that whereof <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>

wherein ſhyneth the ſincere and pure doctrine
