            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

twa ſpeciall meanes: It is brought about be the mean of the word, &amp; preaching of the goſpell: &amp; it is brought about be the meane of the Sacraments and miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thairof. The word leads vs to chriſt be the ear: the ſacraments leads vs to Chriſt be the eie; Twa ſenſes of al the reſt, quhilk God hes choſen, as maiſt meete for this purpoſe to inſtruct vs, and bring vs to Chriſt. For that doctrine mann be maiſt effectuall and mouing, that walkens and ſteirs vp monieſt of the outward ſenſes: that doctrine that walkens not onely the eare, bot the eye, the taiſt, the feeling, and all the reſt of the outwarde ſenſes, mann moue the hart maiſt, mann be maiſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall and pearcing in the ſaul: Bot ſa it is, that this doctrine of the Sacraments mouis, ſteirs vp, &amp; walkins monieſt of the outward ſenſes; Therefore it mann be (gif we cum weil prepared to it) maiſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to ſteir vp the inward ſenſes of the dull hart. But thair is a thing, that ȝee mann euer remember; Thair is na doctrine, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſimple word, nor ȝit of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, gif Chriſt abſtract his haly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that is able to moue.

it be of the Sacraments, or of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple word: craue of God, that hee wald be preſent be his haly Spirit, or vtherwais al the doctrine in the earth will not availe ȝou.

               <p>Then to lat ȝou ſee, quhat the worde Sacrament meanis: and to remooue the<note place="margin">The diuers taking of the word Sacrament.</note> ambiguitie of it; It is certaine, and out of all queſtioun, that the Latine Theologs, quha were maiſt auncient, did interprete the Greeke worde <gap reason="foreign">

<pb facs="tcp:6260:6"/>
ſchort, ȝee will not finde in the booke of God, a word mair frequent, nor the word Myſterie. But as to the word Sacrament, quhairby they ſignifie the Greeke word, we find not this word be the ſame Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logs to bee tane ſa largelie: nather is it tane ſa largely in ony pairt of the booke of God. Alwayis, the word Sacrament, is very ambiguous in it ſelf, and there raiſe about the ambiguitie of this word, many tragedeis, quhilke are not ȝit ceaſed, nor wil not ceaſe, quhil the warld laſts: quher vtherwais, gif they had keeped the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles words, and called thame as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle callis tham, ſignes and ſeales: all this digladiatioun, ſtrife and contention, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearandly had not fallen out. But quhere men will be wiſer nor God, &amp; giue namis to thinges beſide God, vpon the wit of man, quhilk is but meere folly: all this cummer fallis out. Weill than, to come to the purpoſe. The auncient Theologs, tooke the worde Sacrament, as wee may perceaue, in a fourfauld maner. Somtime they tooke it for the hail actioun, that is, for the haill miniſterie of the Elements. Somtime, they tooke it not for the haill actioun: but for the outward things, that
<pb facs="tcp:6260:6"/>
are vſed in the action of Baptiſme, and of the Supper, as they took it, for the water and ſprinckling of it: for the Bread and Wine, breaking, diſtributing, and eating therof. Thirdly againe: they tooke it not for the hail outward things, that are vſed in the actioun; but onely for the material and earthly thinges, the Elements: as for Bread and Wine in the Supper, and water in Baptiſme. And efter this ſort, ſayis AV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GVSTINE: The wicked eats the body of our Lord, concerning the Sacrament on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that is, concerning the Elements one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Laſt of all: they tooke it not onely for the Elements, but for the things ſignified be the elements. And efter this maner, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RENEE ſayis, that a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of twa things, the ane earthly, the vther heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The auncients then, taking the worde efter thir ſorts, na queſtion, all thir wayis they tooke it rightly.</p>
               <p>But leuing the ambiguitie of the word, I take the worde Sacrament, as it is tane and vſed this day in the Kirk of God, for a haly ſigne and ſeale, that is annexed to the preached word of God, to ſeale vp and confirme the truth, contained in the ſame word, in ſick ſort, that I call not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

the ſeale ſeparated fra the word, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: For as there cannot be a ſeale, but that quhilk is the ſeal of ane euident, &amp; gif the ſeal be ſeparated fra the euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it is not a ſeal; Bot looke quhat it is be na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, it is na mair: ſa ther can not be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, except it be hung to the euident of the word; Bot look what the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was be nature, it is na mair. Was it a com mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peece bread, it remains co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon bread except it bee hung to the euident of the word. Therfore the word only cannot be a Sacrament; nor the eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t only cannot be a Sacrament; bot word &amp; element con iunctly man make a Sacrament: &amp; ſa AV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GYSTINE ſaid weill, lat the word come to the element, &amp; ſa ȝe ſal haue a ſacrament: in ſick ſort, that the word mann come to the element, that is the worde preached diſtinctly, and al the parts of it opned vp, man ga before the hinging to of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, and the Sacrament, as a ſeale mann follow and be appended therefter. Then I call a Sacrament, the word and ſeal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctlie, the ane hung to the vther.</p>
               <p>It is without all controuerſie, and there is na debait in it, that all Sacraments are ſignes. Now gif a Sacrament be aſign, as
<pb facs="tcp:6260:7"/>
the ſign is in a relation, in that Category; for ſawe man ſpeake it: Sa the ſacrament man be placed in that ſame Categorie of relation. Now euery relation again man ſtand of force betwixt twa things, for an thing cannot be the correlatiue of it ſelf: but in a lawfull relatioun, of force there man be twa things, quhilk twa, hes euer a mutual reſpect, the ane to the vther. Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore in every ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that hes a relation, thair man be twa things, quhilk twa hes euer a mutual reſpect the an to the vther. Take me away ane of thir twa things fra the Sacrament; ȝe tine the relation, &amp; ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the relation, ȝe tyne the Sacrament. Confound me ane of thir twa, with the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: make ather a confuſion or permixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of tham, ȝe tine the relation, &amp; tyning the relation, ȝe tine the ſacrament. Turne me over the an into the vther, ſa that the ſubſtance of the ane, ſtarts vp and euani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhis in the vther: ȝe tyne the relation, and ſa ȝe tyne the Sacrament. Than as in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſacrament, ther is a relation, ſa to kepe the relation, ȝe man euer kepe twa things ſeuerally in the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Now for the better conſideration and vnderſtanding of thir twa diuers thinges
<pb facs="tcp:6260:8"/>
quhilk are relatiue to vthers, we ſal kepe<note place="margin">The heads to be entre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this Sermon.</note> this ordour by Godis grace: Firſt, we ſal lat ȝou ſee, quhat is meaned be a ſigne in the Sacrament.

Fourtlie, and laſt of al; we ſall let ȝou vnderſtand, quhither ane and the ſelfe ſame inſtrument, geuis the ſigne and the thing ſignified or not, quhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be geuin in ane actioun or twa, quhither they bee offered to ane inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or twa, or gif they be giuen efter a maner or twa to baith the inſtruments. Mark thir diuerſities, the diuerſe maner of receauing, the diuerſitie of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the diuerſitie of the geuaris: and ȝee ſall finde litle difficultie in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
               <p>Now to begin at the ſignes: Seeing all<note place="margin">1</note> ſacraments ar ſignes, quhat call wee the<note place="margin">The ſignes in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> ſignes in the ſacrament? I call the ſignes in the Sacrament, quhatſoeuer I perceaue and takis vp be my outwarde ſenſes, be myne eie eſpecially. Nowe ȝee ſee in this Sacrament, there is twa ſortes of thing is
<pb facs="tcp:6260:8"/>
ſubject to the outward ſenſes, and to the eie eſpecially; ȝe ſee the eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of bread and wine are ſubject to myne eie: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they man be ſigns. Ȝe ſee again, that the rites and ceremonies quhereby thir elements are diſtributed, broken and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, are ſubject to myne eie alſo. Then I mann mak twa ſortes of ſignes, ane ſorte of the breade and the wine, and wee call thame elementall: ane vther ſorte of the rites and ceremonies, quhereby thir are diſtributed, broken and giuen, and we cal thame ceremonial. Be not deceaued with the word ceremonie, think not, ſuppoſe I call the breaking of the breade, the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the breade, and drinking of the wine ceremonies, think not that they are vayn, as ȝee vſe that word ceremonie for a vayne thing, quhilk hes na grace, nor profit following efter it: na, ſuppoſe I cal thame ceremonies, there is neuer a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie quhilk Chriſt inſtituted in this ſupper, but it is als eſſential as the bread and the wine are, and ȝee cannot leaue a jote of thame, except ȝe peruert the hail inſtitutioun. For quhat euer Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be done, quhat euer he ſpake or did in that hail actioun, it is eſſentiall
<pb facs="tcp:6260:9"/>
and mann be done, and ȝe cannot leaue a jote thereof, but ȝee will peruert the hail actioun.</p>
               <p>The reaſoun, quherefore I call thame<note place="margin">Quhy they are called ſignes.</note> ſignes, is this: I call thame not ſignes, be that reaſon that men commonlie call is thame ſignes: becauſe they ſignifie only, as the bread ſignifies the body of Chriſt, &amp; the wine ſignifies the blood of Chriſt. I call thame not ſignes, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent only, but I call thame ſignes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue the body and blood of Chriſt conjoyned with thame, ȝee ſa tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie is the body of Chriſt conjoyned with that breade, and the blood of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with that wine, that als ſoone as thou receauis that bread in thy mouth, (gif thou bee a faithfull man or woman) als ſone thou receueſt the body of Chriſt in thy ſaull, and that be fayth. And als ſoone as thou receauis that wine in thy mouth, als ſone thou receauis the blood of Chriſt in thy ſaul, and that be faith. In reſpect of this exhibitioun cheiflie, that they are inſtruments to deliuer, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite the thing that they ſignifie, and not in reſpect onely of there repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioun, they are called ſignes. For gif they
<pb facs="tcp:6260:9"/>
did nathing bot repreſented or ſignified a thing abſent; Then ony picture or dead Image, ſuld be a Sacrament: For there is na Picture, as the Picture of the King, but at the ſight of the Picture, the King will come in ȝour minde, and it will ſignifie to ȝou, that that is the Kings Picture. Sa, gif the ſigne of the Sacrament did na fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; all Pictures ſuld be Sacraments; but in reſpect the Sacrament exhibites and deliuers the thing that it ſignifies to the ſaul and hart, ſa ſone as the ſigne is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to the mouth: for this cauſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie, it is called a ſigne. There is na Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the King, that will deliuer the King vnto ȝou: there is na vther Image that will exhibite the thing quhair of it is the Image: therefore, there is na Image can be a Sacrament. Then in reſpect, the Lorde hes appointed the Sacraments, as hands to deliuer and exhibite the thing ſignified: for this deliuery and exhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oun chieflie, they are called ſignes. As the woorde of the Euangell is a mighty and potent inſtrument to our euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſaluatioun: ſa the Sacrament, is a potent inſtrument appointed bee God, to deliuer to vs Chriſt Ieſus, to our euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb facs="tcp:6260:10"/>
ſaluatioun. For this ſpirituall meate is dreſſed, and geuen vppe to vs in ſpirituall diſches, that is, in the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the word, and in the miniſtery of the Sacraments. And ſuppoſe this Miniſtery be externall, ȝit the Lord is ſaid, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſpiritual and heauenly things, be thir externall thinges: Quhy? Becauſe he hes appointed thame as inſtruments, quhair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, he wil deliuer his awin Sone to vs. For this is certaine, that nane hes power to deliuer Chriſt Ieſus to vs, except God and his halie Spirit: and therefore, to ſpeake properly, there is nane can deliuer Chriſt bot God be his awin Spirit: he is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red be the Miniſtery of the halie Spirit: it is the halie Spirit that ſeals him vp in our harts, and confirmis vs mair and mair in him: as the Apoſtle geuis him this ſtile 2. COR. 1. 22. To ſpeake properly: there is nane hes power to deliuer Chriſt, bot God the father, or himſelfe: there is nane hes power to deliuer the Mediatour, bot his awin Spirit: Ȝit it hes pleaſed God to vſe ſum inſtruments and meanis, quhair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee will deliuer Chriſt Ieſus to vs: the means are thir: the miniſtery of the word and the miniſtery of the Sacraments: and
<pb facs="tcp:6260:10"/>
in reſpect hee vſes thir as meanis to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Chriſt, they are ſaid to deliuer him. But heir ȝee haue to diſtinguiſh, betwixt the principall efficient deliuerer, and the inſtrumentall efficient, quhilk is the word and the Sacraments: Keeping this diſtinction, baith thir are true, God be his worde, and God bee his Spirit, deliuers Chriſt Ieſus to ȝou. Then I ſay, I cal tham ſignes, becauſe God hes maid thame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent inſtrumentis to deliuer that ſame thing quhilk they ſignifie.</p>
               <p>Nowe I ga to the thing ſignified, and I call the thing ſignified bee the ſignes in the Sacrament, that quhilk IRENEE, that auld writer, call is the heauenly and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall thing, to wit: haill Chriſt, with his hail giftes, benefites and graces, applied and geuen to my ſaul. Then I call not the<note place="margin">2</note> thing ſignified be the ſigns of bread and<note place="margin">Quhat is the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Sacrament.</note> wine: the benefits of Chriſt, the graces of Chriſt, or the vertue that flowis out of Chriſt onlie; But I cal the thing ſignified, togidder with the benefites and vertues flowing fra him, the verie ſubſtaunce of Chriſt himſelf; quherefra this vertue dois flow: The ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, with the vertues, gifts and graces, that flowes fra the ſubſtance,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:11"/>
ar the thing ſignified heere. For as to the vertue &amp; graces, that flows fra Chriſt: It is not posſible, that thou can be partaker of the vertue, that flowes fra his ſubſtaunce, except thou be firſt partaker of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it ſelfe: For how is it posſible, that I can be partaker of the iuyce that flowes out of ony ſubſtance, except I bee parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the ſubſtance it ſelfe firſt. Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that my ſtomach can bee refreſhed with that meat, the ſubſtaunce quhairof, come neuer in my mouth? Is it posſible, that my drouth can be ſlokned with that drinke, that paſſed neuer ouer my halſe? Is it posſible, that I can ſowck ony vertue out of onye thing, except I get the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance firſt: Sa it is imposſible, that I can get the iuice and vertue, that flows out of Chriſt, except I get the ſubſtance, that is, himſelfe firſt. Sa I call not the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, the grace and vertue that flowes fra Chriſt onelie, nor Chriſt himſelfe and his ſubſtance, without his vertue and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces onelie: But ioyntly the ſubſtance with the graces, haill Chriſt, GOD and man, without ſeparatioun of his natures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcretioun of his ſubſtaunce fra his graces, I call the thing ſignified, bee the
<pb facs="tcp:6260:11"/>
ſignes in the Sacrament. For quhy? Gif na mair bee ſignified bee the bread, bot the fleſch and bodie of Chriſt onelie, and na mair be ſignified be the wine, but the blood of Chriſt onelie, thou can not ſay, that the bodie of Chriſt is Chriſt, it is but a cowpon of Chriſt: thou cannot ſay that the blud of Chriſt, is hail Chriſt, it is bot a part of him, &amp; a cowpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thy Sauiour, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thee not, a part of thy ſauior wroght not the wark of thy ſaluation: and ſa ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thou get a cowpon of him in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that cowpoun wald do thee na good. To the end therfore, that this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment may nuriſh thee to life euerlaſting; thou man get in it thy haill Sauiour, haill Chriſt God &amp; man, with his haill graces &amp; benefits, without ſeperation of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance fra his graces, or of the ane nature fra the vther. And how get I him? Not be my mouth. It is a vaine thing to thinke, that we will get God be our mouth: but we get him be faith: As hee is a Spirit, ſa I eat him bee faith &amp; beleif in my ſaul: Not be the teeth of my mouth, that is a vaine thing. I giue the, that thou might eat the fleſh of Chriſt with thy teeth, &amp; this were a cruel maner of doing: ȝit thou may not
<pb facs="tcp:6260:12"/>
eat the God head with thy teeth: this is a groſſe faſchioun of ſpeaking. Sa, gif euer ȝe get good of the Sacrament, ȝee mann get haill Chriſt, and there is not ane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to gripp him, bot be faith one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: therefore come with a faithfull hart.</p>
               <p>O! but ȝe will ſpeere at me, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randlie the definitioun layd doun of the thing ſignified, giues a ground to it; gif the fleſch of Chriſt, &amp; the blood of Chriſt be a pairt of the thing ſignified: how can I call his fleſche a ſpirituall and heauenly<note place="margin">Queſtion.</note> thing, and Chriſt in reſpect of his fleſche a heauenly thing? Ȝe will not ſay that the ſubſtance of Chriſts fleſch is ſpirituall: or that the ſubſtance of his blood is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, quherefore then cal ȝe it ane heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſpirituall thing? I will tell ȝou: the, fleſch of Chriſt is called a ſpiritual thing, and Chriſt is called ſpiritual, in reſpect of his fleſh, not that his fleſhe is becomd a ſpirit, or that the ſubſtance of his fleſh is becomd ſpirituall: Na, it remaned true fleſhe and the ſubſtance of it is ane; as it was in the wombe of the virgin, his fleſhe is not called ſpirituall nather, in reſpect it is glorified in the heauens at the right hand of the father: be not deceaued with
<pb facs="tcp:6260:12"/>
that, for ſuppoſe it be glorified; ȝit it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains true fleſh, that ſame fleſh quhilk he tooke out of the wombe of the Virgin. It is not ſpiritual nather, becauſe thou ſeeis it not in the Supper, gif thou war quhere it is, thou might ſee it: but it is called ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, in reſpect of the ſpirituall ende, quherunto it ſeruis to my body and ſaul:<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> becauſe the fleſch and bloode of Chriſt, ſeruis to nuriſh mee; not to a temporall life: but to a ſpirituall and heauenly life. Nowe, in reſpect this fleſh is a ſpirituall food, ſeruing me to a ſpirituall life; For this caus it is called a ſpiritual thing. Gif it nuriſhed me, as the fleſh of beaſts dois, but to a temporall life, it ſuld bee called but a temporall thing: But in reſpect, it nuriſhes my ſaull, not to ane earthlie and temporall life, but to ane heauenly, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall, and ſpirituall end: In reſpect of this end, the fleſh of Chriſt, and Chriſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his fleſhe, is called the ſpirituall thing in the Sacrament. It is called alſo, the ſpirituall thing in the Sacrament, in reſpect of the ſpirituall inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, quher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is receiued. The inſtrument quhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the fleſh of Chriſt is receaued, is not a corporal inſtrument, is not the teeth and
<pb facs="tcp:6260:13"/>
mouth of the body; but it is ſpirituall, it is the mouth of the ſaull, quhilk is faith: and in reſpect the inſtrument is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: Therefore Chriſt, quha is receaued, is alſo called ſpirituall. In reſpect alſo, that the maner of receauing, is a heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, ſpirituall and celeſtiall maner, not a naturall, nor externall maner, in reſpect that the fleſh of Chriſt, quhilk is giuen in the Sacrament, is receiued be a ſpirituall and ſecreet maner, quhilk is not ſeene to the eies of men. In all thir reſpects, I call Chriſt Ieſus the heauenlye and ſpirituall thing, quhilk is ſignified be the ſignes in the Sacrament.</p>

Quhat auails it me, to ſee my ſaluatioun afar off, gif it be not applied to me? Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore it is not aneugh to vs to ſee Chriſt: bot he mann be giuen vs; or els hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not work health and ſaluation in vs. And as this ſaluatioun is giuen vs; wee mann haue a mouth to take it. Quhat auails it me to ſee meat before me; except I haue
<pb facs="tcp:6260:13"/>
a mouth to take it? Sa, the thing ſignified in the Sacrament, mann bee giuen vs be God, be the three perſons of the Trinity, a God, be Chriſt leſus, quha mann giue himſelfe, and as he giues himſelfe; ſa wee man haue a mouth to take him. Suppoſe hee preſents and offers him ſelfe: ȝit hee can profite or auaile nane, but thame, quha hes a mouth to receaue him. Then ȝee ſee, quhat I call the thing ſignified: haill Chriſt applied to vs, and receaued be vs: hail Chriſt God and man, without ſeparatioun of his natures, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretioun of his ſubſtance fra his graces, all applied to vs. Then I ſay, ſeeing wee come to the Sacrament, to bee fed bee his fleſh, and refreſhed bee his blood, to be fed to ane heauenly and ſpiritual life: and ſeeing there is na profite to bee had of this Table, without ſome kynd of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratioun: Therefore lat na man preaſe to ga to that halie Table, except in ſome meaſure hee be prepared. Some will bee prepared in a greater meaſure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vthers. Alwayis, lat na man preſume to ga to it, except in ſome meaſure his hart bee ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified. Therfore my exhortation concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the way, quhairby euery ane of ȝou
<pb facs="tcp:6260:14"/>
ought to prepare ȝour ſelfis, that ȝe may dreſſe ȝou the better to the table, is this: There is neuer ane of ȝou, that comes to the Table of the Lorde, to caſt before the Lord, ȝour integritie, iuſtice and vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: But quhaſoeuer gais to the Table, he ought to ga with the acknowledging and confesſioun of his miſerie: hee ought to ga with a ſorrowfull hart, for the ſinnes quhairin he hes offended God: he ought to ga with a haitrent of thay ſins; not to proteſt, that he is halie, iuſt, and vpright: But to proteſt and confeſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, and of all creatures, the maiſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. And therefore, he gais to that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to get ſupport for his miſerie, to get a gripp of mercie at the throne of grace: and to get remisſioun and forgiuenes of his ſinnes; to get the gift of repentance, that mair and mair, he may ſtudie to liue vprightlie, halilie and ſoberlie in all time comming. Therefore, except ȝee haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in this courſe, and are of purpoſe to continue in this courſe, to amend your life bigane, to repent ȝou of ȝour ſinnes, and be the grace of God, to liue mair vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightlie and ſoberlie, nor ȝee haue done, for Gods cauſe ga not to the Table. For
<pb facs="tcp:6260:14"/>
quhere there is not a purpoſe to do weil and to repent, of necesſitie, there mann be a purpoſe to doe ill: and quhaſoeuer coms to that Table, with a purpoſe to do ill, and without a purpoſe to repent: hee comes to mocke Chriſt; to skorne him in his face, &amp; to eat his awin preſent conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Sa, lat na man come to that table, that hes not in his hart a purpoſe to doe better: that hes not a hart to ſorrow for his ſinnes bigane: and thinks not his bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane folie and madnes ouer meekle. Lat na man come to that table without this, vnder the paine of damnatioun. But gif ȝe haue in ȝour hart, a purpoſe to do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſuppoſe ȝour bigan life hes bene diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and looſe: ȝit gif ȝe be tuitched in ȝour hart, with ony feeling or remorſe of ȝour bigane life, ga not fra the table, but come with a proteſtatioun of thy miſerie and wretchednes, and come with a hart to get grace. Gif with a diſſolute life, I meane not of open ſlaunders, thou haue alſo a purpoſe not to amend, but to doe war, for Gods ſake abſteine. This far for the thing ſignified.</p>
               <p>Into this generall conſideration, there reſts thir thinges ȝit to bee maid plaine
<pb facs="tcp:6260:15"/>
vnto ȝou. Firſte, howe the ſignes and the thing ſignified are coupled togidder, and how they are conioyned. Nixt, it reſts to be tauld ȝou; how the ſigne is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and how the thing ſignified is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and how baith are receaued, als weill as they are deliuered. This being done, I fall ſpeake ſhortly of the vther part of the Sacrament, quhilk is the worde: And laſt of all, wee ſall lat ȝou ſee, quhat ſort of faultes they are, that peruerts the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and makes it of na effect. And gif time ſall ſerue, we ſall enter in particular, to this ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, quhilk we haue in hand.</p>
               <p>Then to come backe againe. In the third roume, it coms in to be conſidered;<note place="margin">Howe the ſigne and the thinge ſignified are jovned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidder.</note> how the ſigne and the thing ſignified are coupled: For about this conjunction, all the debait ſtandes: all the ſtrife that wee haue with thame, that varies fra the ſtreight trueth, ſtandes about the maner of this coniunction. Some wil haue tham conioyned efter ane way, and ſome efter ane vther way; and men ſtriues verie bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie about this mater, and continues ſa in ſtrife, that thorow the bitternes of con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tention, they tyne the trueth. For quhen the heat of contentioun riſes, and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

in diſputation, they take not tent to the trueth, but to the victorie: Gif they may bee victorious, and it were but be a multitude of words, they regard not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they tyne the trueth. Reade their works, and books about this coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oun, and ȝee ſall craue, rather conſcience nor knawledge: ȝea, gif they had the quarter of the conſcience, that they haue of knawledge: na queſtioun, this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie might bee eaſilie tane vp; but men laking conſcience, &amp; hauing knawledge, an euil conſcience peruerts the knawlege and drawes thame to ane euil end. To tel ȝou now, how thir twa are conioyned: it will be farre eaſier for me, and better for ȝou to vnderſtand, to tell ȝou firſt, howe they are not conioyned: for I ſall make it very cleare vnto ȝou, be letting ȝou ſee how they are not conioyned: but it is not posſible, to make it ſo cleare, by telling ȝou the maner how they are conioyned. Ȝee may perceaue clearelie be ȝour awin eies, that the ſigne &amp; the thing ſignified are not locally conioyned, that is, they are not baith in ane place. Ȝee may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue alſo be ȝour outwarde ſenſes, that the body of Chriſt, quhilk is the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nified,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:16"/>
and the ſignes are not conioyned corporallie: their bodies tuitches not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Ȝee may perceaue alſo, they are not viſiblie conioyned, they ar not baith ſubject to the outwarde eye. Sa it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to lat ȝou ſee, howe they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned. For gif the ſigne and the thing ſignified were viſiblie &amp; corporally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned, Quhat miſterd vs to haue a ſign? Quherefore ſuld the ſigne in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſerue vs? Is not the ſigne in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament appointed to lead me to Chriſt? Is not the ſigne appointed, to point out Chriſt to me? Gif I ſawe him preſent be mine awin eye, as I doe the bread, quhat miſter had I of the bread? Therefore ȝee may ſee clearlie, that there is na ſik thing as a corporall, naturall, or ony ſiclike phyſicall coniunction, betwixt the ſigne, and the thing ſignified. Sa I ſay, it is eaſie to let ȝou ſee, howe they are not conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Then come on, how are they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned? We cannot craue here any vther ſort of coniunctioun, nor may ſtand and agree with the nature of the Sacrament: For na thing can be conioyned with ane vther efter ane vther ſort, nor the nature of it will ſuffer. Therefore there cannot
<pb facs="tcp:6260:16"/>
be heir ane vther ſort of coniunction, nor the nature of the Sacrament will ſuffer. Now the nature of the ſacrament, wil ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ane ſacramentall coniunction. O but that is als hard ȝit: Ȝe are neuer the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this: but I ſall make it cleare bee Gods grace. Ȝee knaw, euery Sacrament is a myſterie; there is not a Sacrament, but it conteinis a high and diuine myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. In reſpect then, that a Sacrament is a myſterie, it followes that a myſticall, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete and ſpirituall coniunctioun, agreis weill with the nature of the Sacrament. As the coniunctioun betwixt vs &amp; Chriſt is full of a myſterie, as the Apoſtle lets ȝou ſee, EPHES. 5. 32. as it is a myſticall and ſpiritual coniunction; Sa na dout, the coniunction betwixt the Sacrament, and the thing ſignified in the Sacrament, man be of that ſame nature, myſticall and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall. It is not posſible to tell ȝou be na ocular demonſtratioun, how Chriſt and we are conioyned. But quha euer wald vnderſtand that coniunctioun, his minde mann be enlightned with ane heauenlie eie, that as he hes ane eye in his head to ſee corporall things: Sa he mann haue in his minde and hart, ane heauenlie eye, to
<pb facs="tcp:6260:17"/>
ſee this myſticall coniunction. A heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie eye to take vp this ſecret coniunction, that is betwixt the Sonne of God and vs, in the Sacrament. Sa I miſter not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; Except ȝee haue this heauenlie illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, ȝee can neuer vnderſtand, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ȝour awin coniunction with Chriſt, nor ȝit the coniunction betwixt the ſigne and the thing ſignified in the Sacrament. But I keepe my ground: As the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a myſterie: Sa the coniunctioun that is into the Sacrament, na dout, man be a myſtical, ſecret and ſpiritual coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Beſide this, I lut ȝou ſee, be the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall deduction, that in euery Sacrament there is twa things: quhilk twa, hes a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latioun, and a mutuall reſpect the ane to the vther. Sa that a relatiue coniunction, agrees weill with the nature of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Then ſpeirs thou quhat kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction it is? I giue thee the coniunction that agrees with their nature, to wit, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue and a reſpectiue coniunction, ſik a coniunction, quhairin the ſign hes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall reſpect to the thing ſignified, and the thing ſignified to the ſigne. Then crauis thou in a worde, the ſort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, that is betwixt the ſigne &amp; the
<pb facs="tcp:6260:17"/>
thing ſignified? I call it a ſecret and a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall<note place="margin">This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctioun is maid cleir, be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the word, and the thinge ſignified thereby.</note> coniunctioun, that ſtands in a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall relatioun, betwixt the ſigne and the thing ſignified. There is ane vther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, beſide the coniunctioun that is betwixt Chriſt and vs, that may mak this coniunctioun betwixt the ſigne and the thing ſignified in the Sacrament mair cleare: and this is the coniunction quhilk is betwixt the word that ȝe hear, and the thing ſignified be the ſame word. Looke quhat ſort of coniunction is betwixt the word quhilk ȝee heare, and the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified that comes in ȝour mind: the like coniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is betwixt the ſign that ȝe ſee, and the thing ſignified in the Sacrament. Ȝee may perceaue eaſilie: there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction be the effect, ſuppoſe ȝee cannot knaw the ſort of coniunction. For quhy? Ȝee heare not the word ſa ſone ſpoken be me, but incontinent, the thing, quhilk my worde quhairof I ſpeake ſignifies, comes in your mind: ſpeake I of things bigane, of things to come, or of thinges that are neuer ſa far abſent: I cannot ſa ſone ſpeak to ȝou of thame in this language, but the thing ſignified comes in ȝour minde; Na doubt, becauſe there is a coniunction
<pb facs="tcp:6260:18"/>
betwixt the worde &amp; the thing ſignified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sa, euery ane of ȝou may eaſily perceaue, that there is a coniunctioun betwixt the word, &amp; the thing ſignified be the word. As for example, ſuppoſe Paris bee far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant fra vs; Ȝit ſpeake I of Paris, the word is not ſa ſone ſpoken, but the toune will come in ȝour mind: Speak I of the King, ſuppoſe he be far diſtant fra vs, the word is not ſa ſoone ſpoken, but the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified will come in ȝour minde. Sa this comming of the thing ſignified in the hart and mind, lats ȝou ſee clearlie, that there is a coniunction betwixt the word, and the thing ſignified bee the word. To tell ȝou of this ſort of coniunctioun, it is not ſa eaſie: Becauſe the thing ſignified is not preſent to the eye, as the worde is to the eare. Gif euery thing ſignified, war als preſent to ȝour eye, as the word is to ȝour eare; it were eaſie to ſee the coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But ſeeing the coniunction is my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, ſecrete and ſpirituall: therefore it is hard to make ȝou to vnderſtand it. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways looke quhat coniunction is betwixt the ſimple word, &amp; the thing ſignified be the word: that ſame ſort of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction is betwixt the ſacrament and the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
<pb facs="tcp:6260:18"/>
bee the Sacrament. For the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is na vther thing, but ane viſible word. I call it a viſible word, quhy? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it conuoyes the ſignificatioun of it, be the eie to the minde. As this is ane audible worde, becauſe it conuoyes the ſignification of it be the ear to the mind, in the ſame ſacrament, ſa oft as ȝee looke on it, ȝee ſall not ſa ſoone ſee that bread with ȝour eie, but the bodie of Chriſt ſall come in ȝour mind: Ȝee ſall not ſa ſoone ſee that wine, but efter the preaching &amp; opning vp of the parts of the Sacrament, the bloode of Chriſt ſall come in ȝour mind. Now this coniunction betwixt the ſigne and the thing ſignified in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſtands chiefly, as ȝe may perceaue, in twa points: Firſt in an relation betwixt the ſign &amp; the thing ſignified, quhilkriſes of an likenes &amp; proportion, betwixt thir twa: for gif there were na proportion &amp; analogie, betwixt the ſigne and thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified be the ſigne; there could not bee a Sacrament or ane relatioun. Sa the firſt pairt of this coniunction ſtands in a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, quhilk riſes vpon ane certaine ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude &amp; likenes, quhilk the ane hes with the vther. And this likelines may be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb facs="tcp:6260:19"/>
perceaued. For looke howe able the bread is to nuriſhe thy body to this life earthlie and temporal, the fleſh of Chriſt, ſignified be the bred, is als able to nuriſh baith body and ſaull to life everlaſting. Sa ȝee may perceaue ſome kinde of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betwixt the ſigne and the thing ſignified. The ſecound point of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, ſtands in a continuall and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual concurring of the an with the vther, in ſik ſort, that the ſigne, &amp; the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, ar offered baith togither, receaued togither, at ane time and in ane actioun: the ane outwardelie, the vther inwardly, gif ſa be that thou haue a mouth in thy ſaull, quhilk is faith, to receaue it. Then the ſecound point of the conjunctioun ſtands in a joynt offering, and in a joynt receauing, &amp; this I call ane concurrence. Then ſpeere ȝee, quhat ſort of conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is betwixt the ſigne and the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified? I ſay, it is a relatiue conjunction, a ſecret and a myſtical conjunction, quhilk ſtands in a mutuall relatioun.</p>
               <p>There is na farther to be obſerued heir, except only this: that ſuppoſe ȝe conjoin thir twa, be war that ȝe confound thame not, bee war that ȝee turne not over the
<pb facs="tcp:6260:19"/>
ane in the other: but keepe every ane of thame in their awin integritie, without confuſion or permixtion of the ane with the other, and ſa ȝee ſall haue the lawfull conjunctioun that ſulde bee in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There is not a leſſoun that can be learned of this, at leaſt that I can marke or gather, except onely the leſſoun of the kindenes and goodnes of the everliuing God; quha hes invented ſa mony won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull ſortes of conjunctioun, and all to this purpoſe, that wee might be conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to aduance this great and myſticall conjunctioun, betwixt the God of glorie and vs: In the quhilk conjunctioun, our weil, felicity and happines in this life, and in the life to come, dois only ſtand: That he is ſa cairfull to conjoine himſelfe with his worde and Sacraments, that wee, in his word and Sacraments might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with him. Gif wee were moued with the care and loue of God, vttered in thir conjunctiones, and it were neuer ſa litle on our pairts: aſſuredly we wald not defraud our ſelfs, of the fruit of that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py conjunction, nor bring it in ſik a loath and diſdaine as wee do this day: for wee be folowing and preferring of our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb facs="tcp:6260:20"/>
to Chriſt and his counſell, hes made the ſtomachis of our ſaules ſa foule and ill diſpoſed, that ather they receiue him not at all, or gif he be receaued, he is not able to tary: And quhy? becauſe ane foul ſtomach is not able to keepe him, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent we chok him ſa, ather with the luſtis of the fleſh, or with rhe cares of this warlde, that hee is compelled to depart: &amp; gif Chriſt be not baith, deuoured and digeſted, hee can doe vs na good: And this digeſtion can not be quhere there is not a gredy appetite to the receit of him; for gif thou be not hungry for him, he is not ready for thee. And I am aſſured gif all the men in this countrie were exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned efter this rule, that there were nane that receuis Chriſt, bot he that hes a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and is hungrie for him, it fearis me that few ſuld bee found to receaue him. It fears me, that we haue tane ſik a loath and diſdaine of that heauenlie food, that there is not ſick a thing, as ony kinde of hunger, or appetite of it in our ſaules. And quhat is the cauſe of this? I will tell ȝou: Suppoſe wee haue renounced the corporall and groſſe Idolatrie, wherein our fathers were drowned and plunged
<pb facs="tcp:6260:20"/>
of before, and quhilk men in ſome parts gais about to erect now: Ȝit as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of this countrie, and the behauiour of every ane of vs teſtifies, there is neuer a man that hes renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced that damnable Idol, that he hes in his awin ſaul, nor the inviſible Idolatry, that he hes in his awin hart and mynd. There is neuer a man but to that ſame Idoll quherewith hee wes conceaued and borne, and wherevnto he addicted himſelfe and wes a ſlaue off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but to that Idoll he geuis his ſeruice ȝit: and therefore meruell not, quhen thou hes addicted thy ſeruice: ſet thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, &amp; powred out thy hart vpon that pleaſure of thine awin, vpon that Idoll of thy awin, vpon that luſt &amp; miſchief of thy awin: meruell not, ſuppoſe thou haue na appetite of Chriſt, nor of that heauenlie food. Quhen thou hes thy ſaull powred furth on ſome villany &amp; wickednes, &amp; hes ſend it far a feild: how is it posſible to the, to retire it, or draw it hame againe, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it quhere thou ſuld on Chriſt Ieſus? Then let euery ane in his awin ranck, tak heed to his awin domeſtik Idoll, that lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges within his awin heart, and preaſe to cleare him of it, or vtherwayis, ȝe cannot
<pb facs="tcp:6260:21"/>
ſee the face of Chriſt, nor be pertakers of his kingdome. There is not ane vther leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoun in chriſtianitie but this: this is the firſt and the laſt leſſoun; to ſhake off ȝour luſtis and affectiouns, peece and peece, and ſa peece and peece renounce thy ſelf, that thou may embrace Chriſt. I grant, there is greater progreſſe in this point, in ſome nor in vthers, ſome leſſe, ſome mair profites in this; But except in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ȝee caſt of ȝour ſelfe, or quhatſoeuer in ȝour awin eies, ȝee compt maiſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to come be Chriſt; ȝee are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of him: And this is verie hard to be done. It is verie eaſie for a man to ſpeake it, to bidd a man renounce his awin I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll, quhilk I call his affections; but it is not ſa ſone done. Aſſuredly the ſtronger mann come in, to ding out the affection: ȝea the ſtronger nor the deuil, man come in to ding out the deuill, quha makes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence in the affection; or els hee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine there for euer. Therefore, there are not mony that hes renounced thame ſelfis, and examin thine hart quhen thou will, gif there be ony thing in the warld, that thou louis better nor chriſt, gif thou bee not content, to leaue father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:21"/>
to leaue wife and children, or quhat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoeuer is deareſt to thee in this warld, for Chriſt, thou art nor worthie of him. Gif thou be not content to caſt off, quhatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer maks thee a ſtranger to Chriſt, thou art not worthie of him. And is this onie little matter, ſeeing there is na part nor power of our ſaul, but it is enemy to this, and repines to this heauenlie coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Is this onie litle mater, to caſt off and renounce our ſelfis, that we may come to Chriſt? Ȝe ſaw neuer a greater matter nor this. It hes not entred into euery hart to conſider of this, for this wark of our new creatioun, is ten thouſand times greater nor the warke of our firſt creation. And therefore it were very neceſſary, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man tooke tent to himſelfe: For the Deuill is ſo craftie in this point, that hee erects euer ane Idoll or vther in our ſaul, and ſometimes vnder the ſhew of vertue, quhilk of all is maiſt dangerous: And in euerie wark that is in our hand, gif it war neuer ſa halie, hee is at our right hande, and maks him to haue intereſt in it. And hee contents himſelfe not with this, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhewe of vertues to diſſaue ȝou: But he is ſa walkrife, that euen in the beſt
<pb facs="tcp:6260:22"/>
turne, and quhen ȝe are beſt occupied in ȝour maiſt vertuous actions, hee mixes thame with ſinnes, and ſa dois the thing that lies in him, to make ȝou tine ȝour profit, and looſe ȝour reward. For quhen ȝee are beſt occupied, hee gais about to engender in ȝou an opinion of ȝour ſelfis and ſa defraud God of his glory. Or v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayis in doing of good turnes, hee makes ȝou ſa ſlacke and negligent, that gif ȝe do thame, ȝee do thame caldlie, or ſa indiſcreetly, that he maks ȝou begin at the laſt firſt, and makes it that ſuld be firſt laſt; and ſa as MARTHA wes, to be occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ouer bisſie in thay things, quhilk are not ſa neceſſar, as the things quherin MARIE wes occupied. For ſhe ſuld haue preferred firſt the hearing of the worde, to the preparing of Chriſts Supper. This is but to giue ȝou ane inſight, and to lat ȝou ſee, that the deuil is ſa craftie, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he caſts in a falſe conceat of our ſelfs in doing ony turne, or els makes vs to do that laſt quhilk ſuld be firſt, or then maks vs altogidder ſa ſluggiſh and ſa negligent that we do the warke of the Lord caldly, and ſa ane way or vther, he halds vs euer in a continuall buſines. Sa that we cannot
<pb facs="tcp:6260:22"/>
be halfe walkrife: For we haue to do with principalities and powers, with ſpirituall wickednes, quhilk are aboue vs, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs alſo. For he is not, that hes corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion within him, but Sathan is in him: Sa wee cannot bee halfe walkrife, euer ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to caſt out the Deuill, to renounce our ſelfis, and to ſubmit vs to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt. This farre concerning the coniunction.</p>
               <p>Now, ſeing that the ſigne and the thing<note place="margin">Howe the ſigne and the thing ſignified are giuen and receaued.</note> ſignified, are diuers: it reſts to bee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered how the ſign is deliuered, and how the thing ſignified is deliuered; and efter quhat manner they are receaued: And<note place="margin">Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> therefore of this conſideration, ȝee haue thir things to wey. Ȝee haue firſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, quhidder baith the ſigne, and the<note place="margin">1</note> thing ſignified, be deliuered to ȝou be ea man or not. Secondly ȝee haue to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">2</note> quhidder the ſigne and the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, be deliuered to ȝou in ane actioun or not. Thirdly, ȝee haue to conſider,<note place="margin">3</note> quhidder baith thir things bee giuen to ane inſtrument or not. And fourtly, ȝee<note place="margin">4</note> haue to conſider, quhidder the ſigne and the thing ſignified, be offered &amp; receaued efter ea maner or not. Now efter that ȝee
<pb facs="tcp:6260:23"/>
haue conſidred all thir, in the ende ȝee ſal find that the ſign &amp; the thing ſignified, ar not giuen be a man; ȝe ſal find nixt, that they are not giuen in a ſort of actioun. Thirdly, ȝe ſal find, that they ar not baith offered and giuen to ane inſtrument. And fourtly, ȝee ſall finde, that they are not baith giuen and receaued efter ane ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Sa finding this diuerſitie, ȝee haue this to doe: Marke mee the diuerſitie of the propiners and giuers: Marke me the diuerſitie of the actions: Mark me third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the diuerſitie of the inſtruments, and marke fourtly, the diuers manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing. Mark me all thir diligently, and ȝee ſall finde litle difficultie in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For firſt to mak it cleare vnto ȝou, I ſay, that the ſigne, and the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be the ſigne, are not baith giuen be ea man; and this ȝee ſee clearely. For as to the ſigne, that bread, and that wine, ȝe ſee ȝour ſelfe, that the Miniſter offers vnto ȝou the ſigne, hee giues ȝou that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: as that ſign is ane earthly and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall thing, ſa it is ane earthly and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall man that giues it. Now the thing ſignified is of ane vther nature: For it is ane heauenly and ſpirituall thing; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:6260:23"/>
this heauenly thing, is not giuen be an earthly man, this vncorruptible thing, is not giuen be ane naturall and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible man; But Chriſt Ieſus hes locked vp and reſerued the Miniſterie of this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly thing to himſelfe onely. Therefore there is twa giuers in this ſacrament: The Miniſter giues the earthly thing, Chriſt Ieſus the Mediatour, giues ȝou the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie thing in the Sacrament: For Chriſt in giuing the earthly thing, will not vſe his awin Miniſterie immediatlie, nor the Miniſterie of ane Angell: but onelie the Miniſterie of ane earthlie man. And as to the diſpenſatioun of his awin bodie and blood, hee will not giue it to na hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie creature, lat be to ane earthly man; but he hes keeped this Miniſterie to him ſelfe, and he diſpenſes his awin body and blood, to quhom &amp; quhen he pleaſis: For quhy? gif ony man in the warld, had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to giue Chriſts body &amp; blood, na que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion this man ſuld haue power, to cleanſe the hart and conſcience; For the blood of Chriſt hes this power with it: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſuld haue power to forgiue ſins. Now it is onely GOD that may forgiue ſinnes: and therefore it is not posſible,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:24"/>
that the Miniſterie of the heauenly thing, can be in the power of ony man. Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we haue in IOHN the Baptiſt, MAT. 3. 11. Sayis he not, the miniſtery that I haue is of the element, I am commaunded to Miniſter the eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of water only: but as to the Miniſterie of the fire &amp; of the ſpirit, Chriſt hes reſerued it to himſelfe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore looke not to get the ſpirit at mans hand, but at the hands of Chriſt himſelfe onelie, and without this inward Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, I wil not giue a ſtraa for the outward Miniſterie. For my outward Miniſterie: Ȝea, ſuppoſe it were the Miniſterie of ane Angell, and ſuppoſe Chriſt were preſent in his fleſh, to miniſter vnto ȝou thir out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things: except he conjoyne the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward miniſterie of his ſpirit therewith, it auailes nathing: It may weill make vp a dittay &amp; proces againſt ȝou, againſt the day of that generall aſſemblie: but to ȝour ſaluation, it will neuer profite ȝou. Therefore this ȝee ſuld ay craue, that the Lord wald water ȝour harts bee his halie ſpirit, as he waters ȝour eares be the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word. Then there is twa offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: the Miniſter offers the ſigne, Chriſt Ieſus offers himſelfe, the thing ſignified.
<pb facs="tcp:6260:24"/>
The three perſons, ea God, offers the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, or the Mediator offers himſelfe, and that bee the power and vertue of his awin ſpirit.</p>
               <p>As there is twa propiners, twa perſons<note place="margin">The ſigne &amp; the thing ſignified are offered in twa actions to twa in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and efter twa maners</note> that offeris and geuis the Sacrament, and the thing ſignified be the Sacrament: Sa thir twa ar offered and giuen in twa acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Chriſt, quha is the heauenlie thing is offered &amp; giuen to ȝou, be ane inward ſecreet and ſpirituall actioun, quhilk is not ſubject to the outward eie. The ſigne againe is offered and giuen, in ane out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actioun, efter a corporal and viſible maner. As there is twa ſortes of actions, ſa there is twa ſortes of inſtrumentes, quherevnto the ſigne and the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified are offered: for the thing ſignified, that is, Chriſt: is neuer offered to the mouth of my body. The blood of Chriſt, the fleſh of Chriſt, haill Chriſt, or the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt is not offered, nather in the word nor in the ſacrament to the mouth of my body, get me that in ony parte of the Bible, that there is ony vther maner of receauing of Chriſt, bot be faith, and tak it to thame. Sa there is not an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as I taulde ȝou, nather hand nor
<pb facs="tcp:6260:25"/>
mouth to grippe Chriſt, bot faith onely. As Chriſt, quha is the thing ſignified, is gripped be the hand and mouth of faith: ſa the ſigne that ſignifies Chriſt, is grip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped be our awin naturall mouth &amp; hand. Ȝee haue a mouth in ȝour head, and in ȝour body, als proper to gripp the ſigne, as fayth is to grippe Chriſt. Swa the ſigne and the thing ſignified ar offered and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, not to ane inſtrument, but to twa: the ane to the mouth of the bodie, the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the mouth of the ſaull. Now look be quhat way thir things are offered and giuen, be the ſame way they ar receaued. As the ſigne is corporall, and naturally offered to a corporall inſtrument: ſa is it receaued efter a corporall and naturall maner. For thou man tak the bread and the wine, ather bee thy hand, or bee thy mouth: the thing ſignified is not tane ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a corporall maner, bot efter a ſecreet and ſpirituall maner: and as it is offered, ſa it is tane: there cannot be a thing clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, the ane is tane efter a natural maner, the vther efter a ſecret and ſpirituall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Sa in this laſt part ȝe haue thir things to mark: diſtinguiſh me betwixt the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward action and the inward, betwixt the
<pb facs="tcp:6260:25"/>
ſigne and the thing ſignified, and keepe mee a proportion and analogie, betwixt the inwarde and the outward actions: Thinke weill with ȝour ſelfe, that gif ȝee bee a faithfull man, Chriſt is als bisſie working inwardlie in ȝour ſaull: as the Miniſter is working outwardlie toward ȝour bodie. Looke how bisſie the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is in breaking that bread, in powring out that wine, in giuing that bread and wine to thee; als bisſie is Chriſt in brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his awin body to thee, and in giuing thee the iuyce of his awin bodie, efter a ſpirituall &amp; ane inuiſible maner. Sa keepe me this diſtinction, and thinke weill with ȝour ſelfs, that be faith, Chriſt is als weill ocupied towards ȝour ſaul to nuriſh it, as the Miniſter is outwardly towardes ȝour body. Keepe me this, &amp; thou hes the hail ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Then of this diſcourſe &amp; dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: ȝe maytak vp a doble mater, quher of the Sacrament ſtands. It ſtands of twa ſorts of materials: that is, of ane earthlie mater, and of ane heauenly mater: The ſign and the thing ſignified; And as there is a double mater in the Sacrament, ſa the Sacrament mann bee handled efter a double maner, be ane outward actioun,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:26"/>
and ane inward action. Keepe the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in thir things, betwixt the ſign and the thing ſignified, &amp; ȝe ſal not eaſilie ſlip in the vnderſtanding of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>This being ſayd, concerning the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall<note place="margin">of the vther parte of a Sacrament quhilk is the worde.</note> conſideration of the elements (for al this apperteins ȝit to the elements.) It reſts that wee ſpeake ſomequhat concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the word, quhilk I cal the vther part of the Sacrament. Quhat we meane and vnderſtand be the word, I take the word quhairvnto the elements are annexed, for that thing, quhilk quickens this haill action, quhilk ſerues as it were a ſaul, and giues life to the haill actioun. For be the worde, and the appointment of Chriſt in the worde, the Miniſter knawis quhat is his part, the hearer knawis quhat is his part, and euery ane is prepared, howe to deliuer and how to receaue: the Miniſter how hee ſuld deliuer, and the hearer how hee ſuld receaue. Sa the inſtitutioun of Chriſt, is the quickning of the haill acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For all the action hes the warrand fra the inſtitution ſet down in his word. In the inſtitution of Chriſt, there is twa things chieflie to be conſidered. Ȝee will finde in the inſtitutioun of Chriſt a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:26"/>
and ȝee will finde in it a promiſe: The commaund is this, quhere hee ſayis, <hi>take eat:</hi> the command obliſhes ȝou to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, and craues obedience. There is a promiſe alſo in the inſtitution, and it is conteined in thir wordes, <hi>This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</hi> The promiſe craues faith. As the command craues obedience; ſa the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe craues beleife: Therefore come not to the Sacrament, except ȝee bring baith faith and obedience with ȝou. Gif thou come not with a heart minded to obey Chriſt, at leaſt, mair nor thou was wont to doe, thou comes to thine awin dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And gif thou bring a hart alwais voyd of faith, thou comes to thine awin damnation. Sa, lat euery ane that comes to the Sacrament, bring with him a hart minded to do better, that is, to obey and beleiue Chriſt, better nor he did off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Except ȝee bring thir twa in ſome meaſure, come not to the Sacrament: for whatever thou do, except it flow of faith, can profite nathing. This far concerning the word ſhortly.</p>
               <p>Nowe there reſts onely this, and it wald bee ſpeered, quhat miſter is there, that thir Sacraments and ſeales ſuld bee
<pb facs="tcp:6260:27"/>
annexed to the worde? Quherefore are they annexed, ſeeing wee gat na mair in the Sacrament, nor we get in the worde: and we get als meekle in the very ſimple word, as we gat in the Sacrament: Seeing then wee get na newe thing in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the ſame thing, quhilk wee gat in the ſimple word, quherefore is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament appointed to bee hung to the word? It is true certainly, we get na new thing in the Sacrament: nor wee get na vther thing in the Sacrament, nor we gat in the worde, for quhat mair walde thou craue, nor to get the Sonne of God, gif thou get him weill? Thy hart cannot wiſh nor imagine a greater gift, nor to haue the Sonne of God, quha is King of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth. And therefore I ſay quhat new thing walde thou haue? For gif thou get him, thou gettis all things with him, thy hart cannot imagine a newe thinge beſide him: quherefore then is the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> appointed? Not to get thee a new<note place="margin">I</note> thing. I ſay it is apointed to get thee that<note place="margin">Be the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment wee poſſeſſe Chriſt mair fully nor be the ſimple word.</note> ſame thing better, nor thou gat it in the word. The Sacrament is appointed, that we may get a beter grip of Chriſt, nor we gat in the ſimple word, that we may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
<pb facs="tcp:6260:27"/>
Chriſt in our harts and mindes mair fullie and largely, nor wee did off before in the ſimple worde. That Chriſt might haue a larger ſpace, to make reſidence in our narrowe hearts, nor hee could haue be the hearing of the ſimple worde: and to poſſeſſe Chriſt mair fullie, it is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing. For ſuppoſe Chriſt be ea thing in him ſelfe: ȝit the better grip thou haue of him, thou art the ſurer of his promiſe. The Sacramentes are appointed, that I might haue him mair fullie in my ſaull, that I might haue the bounds of it enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that hee may make the better reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in mee: This na doubt is the cauſe, quherefore thir ſeales are annexed to the<note place="margin">2</note> euident of the ſimple word. They ſerue to<note place="margin">They ſerue to confirme the trueth contained in the word.</note> this end alſo, to ſeale vp and confirm the trueth, that is in the word; for as the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the ſeale hung to the euident, is not to confirme ane vther trueth, nor that quhilk is in the euident; and ſuppoſe ȝee beleeued the euident off before; ȝit be the ſeales ȝee beleeue it the better. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſa, the Sacrament aſſures mee of na vther trueth, nor is conteined within the word: Ȝit becauſe it is a ſeale annexed to the word, it perſwades mee the better of
<pb facs="tcp:6260:28"/>
the ſame, for ay the maa &amp; the mair that the outward ſenſes be walkned, the mair is the inward hart &amp; mind, perſwaded to beleif. Now the ſacrament walkens al the outward ſenſes, ſick as the eie, the hand, and all the reſt: And the outward ſenſes beeing mooued, na queſtion, the ſpirit of God concurring therewith, mooues the heart the mair. The Sacraments are then annexed to the word, to ſeal vp the truth conteined in the worde, and to confirme it mair and mair in thy hart. Then quhat haue ȝee to doe, the worde is appointed to worke beleife, and the ſacrament is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to confirme ȝou in this beleife: but except ȝee feele the trueth of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in ȝour harts, except ȝe haue ȝour harts als readie as ȝour mouth, think not that ony thing will auaile ȝou; All the ſeales in the warld will not worke, except<note place="margin">Exhortation</note> the ſpirit of God concurre, and ſeale the ſame trueth in ȝour harts, quhilk the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ſeales outwardlie. Except hee mak cleare the ſight of thy mind inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and worke a feeling in thy hart, baith word and Sacrament, ſall tyne their fruit and effect quhilk they ſuld haue. All the Scriptures are full of this. The hail Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb facs="tcp:6260:28"/>
of GOD are but a ſlaying letter to ȝou, except the ſpirit of God concurre to quicken inwardlie. Sa ȝour haill endeuor ſuld be, to preaſe to feele Chriſt quicke in ȝour awin harts: that finding him in ȝour harts, and ſeing him in ȝour minds, baith word and Sacraments may be effectuall: gif not, ȝour ſauls remaines dead, ȝee are not tranſlated fra that death quhairin ȝe were conceaued. Therefore all the ſtudy of a Chriſtian ſuld be, quhen they ſee the Sacraments, and heares the worde, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to find and feele in their hearts and mindes, that, quhilk they heare and ſee, and this I cal to find Chriſt quick in ȝour awin ſauls. This cannot bee, except ȝee ſanctifie his ludging: For gif al the nukis of thy ſaul remaine a midding, Chriſt can not dwell there. And ſa, except ȝe ſtudy to a continuall ſanctification, and ſeuer ȝour ſelfe fra euery thing that ſeuers ȝou fra Chriſt; It is not posſible, that hee can liue or dwel in ȝou. This is a great leſſon, and it is not posſible to doe this, except, as I haue ſaid, a ſtronger come in &amp; poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe vs, &amp; make vs to renounce our ſelfs. Then, the ſeals had not bene annexed to the word, except for our cauſe. For there
<pb facs="tcp:6260:29"/>
is na necesſitie on Gods part, that God ſuld ather ſweare, or confirme bee ſeales, the thing that hee hes ſpoken. For his word is als good as ony aith or ſeale: but the necesſitie comes of vs. There is ſick a great weaknes in vs, that quhen hee hes ſworne, and ſet his ſeales to his word, wee are als new to beleife, as gif he had neuer ſpoken a worde. Sa to helpe our beleife, our weaknes and inhabilitie that is in vs: For wee are ſa vnable be nature, that wee can beleeue nathing, but that quhilk is of our ſelfis, and the mair wee leane to our ſelfis, the farther we are fra God. I ſay, to helpe this wonderfull weaknes, quhairby wee are readie to miſtruſt God in euerie word, he hes hung to his ſacraments, and beſide his Sacraments, hee ſweares the things that concerns maiſt our ſaluation; As ȝee hard in the Prieſthead of Chriſt, PSAL. 110. 4. Hee will not ſpeake onely, but he ſweares, and that for our weaknes and infirmitie; but gif hee abſtract ȝit the Miniſterie of his ſpirit, all thir means will do na good.</p>

thereof. Twa ſort of faults peruerts the Sacrament, &amp; defrauds vs of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and vſe thereof, and thir faults are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the forme or in the perſon: In forme, gif the eſſential forme be ſpoyled, we get nathing: for quhen the ſacrament is ſpoyled of the eſſentiall forme, it is not a Sacrament. There is ane eſſential forme in Baptiſme, and ane eſſentiall forme in the Supper, quhilks gif they bee tane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ȝee tyne the vſe of the Sacrament. The eſſentiall forme of Baptiſme is, <hi>I bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize thee in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the halie Ghaiſt:</hi> Leaue ȝee out ane of thir three, or do ȝee it in the name of ony ane of the three perſons onely, ȝe tyne the eſſentiall forme of Baptiſme: In the Supper, gif ȝee leaue out the leaſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie, ȝe tine the eſſentiall forme; and ſa it is not a Sacrament: I ſpeake of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall forme, in reſpect of the Papiſts, quha keeped the eſſentiall forme in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; ſuppoſe they haue broght in trifles of their awin &amp; mixt with it: ȝit in reſpect they keeped the ſubſtantiall forme: It is not neceſſar, that they quha were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized vnder thame, be rebaptized. Indeed gif the vertue of regeneration flowed fra
<pb facs="tcp:6260:30"/>
the perſon, it were ſome thing: but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, Chriſt hes this to giue to quhome, and quhen he pleaſis, the eſſentiall form being keeped; it is not neceſſare, that this Sacrament be reiterated. Now quhat are the faults in the perſon that peruerts the ſacrament? The fault may be, ather in the perſoun of the giuer, or in the perſoun of the receauer. (I ſpeake not of they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faults, quhilk are common to all: but of ſik faults as inhables the perſon of the giuer, to be a diſtributer of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; taks the office fra him.) Sa quhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the perſon of the giuer, is this way inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, na queſtion, it is not a Sacrament. Then againe, in the perſon of the recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, the fault may bee, gif their children be not in the couenant, but out of it, they get not the Sacrament. Indeed, if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents efterward comes to the couenant, the children, ſuppoſe they be gotten out of the couenant, may be receaued. Sik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in the Supper, gif a man be ladened with ony burthen of ſinne, without ane purpoſe to repent, hee aught not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue it. Sa then, gif ȝee lack a purpoſe to repent, ȝe tine the vſe of the ſacrament. It is only this purpoſe to repent, that maks
<pb facs="tcp:6260:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
me, quha receauis the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to get the fruit and effect thereof. Therefore euerie ane that gais to that Sacrament, looke quhat purpoſe hee hes in his heart: Hes thou a purpoſe to ſhed blood, to ga to harlatry, or to commit ony vther ill vice, or ill turne that is in thy heart, and is not of purpoſe to repent: in ſhewing thee to be without repentance, thou ſhewes thee to be without faith: And conſequentlie thou coms to thy damnation, and not to thy ſaluation. Now take heed quhat is ȝour purpoſe, for gif with a diſſolute life ȝee haue a diſſolute purpoſe, ȝee come to ȝour damnation.</p>
               <p>I wes of mind, to haue entred particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly<note place="margin">Concluſion with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horration.</note> to this ſacrament, quhilk we haue in hands: but becaus the time is paſt, &amp; ſom of ȝou (I dout not) are to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly this: Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that ȝe addres not ȝour ſelfs to that table, except ȝee finde ȝour harts in ſom ſort prepared. The firſt gree of preparation ſtands in contrition, in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing for ſin, in a feeling of ȝour awin ſins, quhairin ȝee haue offended God.

But gif thou want all thir, and hes thame not in ſome meaſure: thou lacks all the grees of preparation: Therfore lat nane ga to the table, except hee haue thir in ſom meaſure.

And therfore ſuppoſe that ſaul, be far fra the thing that he ſuld be at: lat him not refuſe to ga to the table, but lat him ga with a profesſioun of his awin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity &amp; weaknes, &amp; with a deſire of the thing that he wants. Euery an of ȝou that finds ȝour ſelfs this way diſpoſed, lat him ga in Gods name to the Table.

and ane prophane Supper: for this is the Lords Supper, a halie Supper, not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane nor common Supper; a Supper ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the increaſe of halines, for the foode of the ſaull in halines, to feede the ſaul to life euerlaſting. Not a Supper appointed for the belly, for he had ended that Supper, that was appointed for the bellie, or euer hee begouth this Supper, quhilk was appointed for the ſaul. A ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, na doubt, hauing reſpect to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtaunce of time, be reaſon it was firſt inſtituted in the article of that time, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they vſed to ſuppe. It is called alſo in the Bible, the Table of the Lord: It is not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Altar of the Lord, but the Apoſtle cals it a Table to ſit at, and not ane altar to ſtand at, a Table to take and receaue, and not an Altar to offer &amp; propine. It is called alſo the Communion, &amp; participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the bodie and blood of Chriſt: We haue thir names giuen to it, beſide ſome vthers in the Scriptures of God.</p>
               <p>The auncients of the Latine, and of the Greeke Kirks, gaue it ſundry names, for ſundry reſpects: They called it a publict action. And this was a very general name; Sometimes they called it a thankſgiuing:
<pb facs="tcp:6260:33"/>
Sometimes they called it a Banquet of loue: &amp; ſometimes they gaue it ea name, and somtimes ane vther. And at the laſt, in the declining eſtait of the Latine Kirk, and in the falling eſtait of the Romane Kirk, this Sacrament begouth to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, and with this decay, there comes in a peruerſe name, and they called it the Maſſe. They trouble thameſelfs meekle concerning the deriuation of this name, quherefra this worde is driuen: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they ſeeke it fra ane Hebrue ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: Somtime fra an Greeke, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time fra ane Latine origine. But it is plaine, as the word ſounds, that it is tane fra ane Latine origine. And it is a worde quhilk might haue bene tolerable, quhen it was firſt inſtituted: For na doubt, the Sacrament at the firſt inſtitutioun of this word, wes not then halely peruerted: but now, ſeeing that be the proceſſe of time, corruption hes preuailed ſa far, that it hes turned over our Sacrament in a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: And quhere wee ſuld take fra the hand of God in Chriſt, they make vs to giue: This is plaine Idolatry: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quhere the word was tolerable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; Nowe it ought not to bee tolerable
<pb facs="tcp:6260:33"/>
in ony way; It aught not to bee ſuffered. And out of queſtioun, gif wee had eaten and drunken, als oft the body and blood of Chriſt in our harts and ſaules, as wee haue eaten that bread, and drunken that wine, quhilk are the ſignes of his bodie and blood: wee wald not haue thoiled this word of the maſſe; lat be the very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, to be ſa rife in this Countrey: But in reſpect, wee haue but played the counterfait, and defrauded our ſauls of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, and tooke onely the outward Sacrament: Therefore it is, that our zeale decayis: Therefore it is that our loue decayis: Therefore it is that our knawledge and light decayis. And for fault of zeale, loue, and knaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the worde of the maſſe is become cuſtomable vnto ȝou, and not onely the word, but the very action. I will not run out heir, I am onely tell and ȝou, quhat comes of the abuſe of the hearing of the worde, quhat iudgement followes vpon the abuſe of the perception of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

The corporal, viſible, and outward things, they are the thinges that are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, to ſignifie the ſpiritual, heauenly and inwarde things: And quhy? Nathing without a reaſoun. Thir corporall ſignes are appointed to ſignifie the ſpirituall things, be reaſoun wee are corporall, we are earthlie bodies, wee haue our ſaull ludging within ane carnall body, in a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of claye, a groſſe tabernacle, quhilk cannot be walkned nor mooued, except bee the things that are like to it ſelfe: It cannot be induced to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of heauenlie things, except, be gros, temporall and corporal things. Gif wee had beene of the nature of the thing ſignified, that as the thing ſignified is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and heauenlie, ſa wee alway had bene ſpirituall and heauenlie; we had not miſtered a corporal thing. Siclike, gif the thing ſignified had bin as we are, corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, earthlie and viſible; wee had not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered a ſigne, to cary vs to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. But be reaſon the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb facs="tcp:6260:35"/>
is ſpirituall, and wee are corporall; therefore to bring vs to the ſight of thir ſpirituall things, he vſes a corporal mean and an outward ſigne. This is the reſoun quherefore thir corporall ſignes are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, to ſignifie the ſpirituall thing. The ſpirituall thing in baith the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is ane &amp; the ſelfe ſame Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ſignified in baith the Sacraments: Ȝit in diuers reſpects, he is the thing ſignified in Baptiſme, and he is the thing ſignified in the Supper. This Chriſt Ieſus in his blood chiefly, is the thing ſignified in the Sacrament of Baptiſm; for quhy? be reſon that be his blood hee weſchis the filth of our ſauls; bee reaſon that be the vertue of his blood, he quickens vs in our ſauls, with a heauenlie life; be reaſoun that bee the power of his blood, he ingrafts and imps vs in his awin body: for that ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a teſtimonie of the remisſioun of our ſinnes; that is of the cleanes of our conſcience, that our conſciences be that blood, are weſchen inwardly. It teſtifies ſiklike, of our new birth, that wee are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſpiritually to a heauenly life: It te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies ſicklike, of the joyning of vs in the body of Chriſt. As it is a teſtimony, ſa it is
<pb facs="tcp:6260:36"/>
a ſeale; It not only teſtifies, but ſeales it vp in our harts, and maks vs in our harts, to feele the taiſt of that heauenly life begun in vs; that we are tranſlated fra death, in the quhilk we war conceaued, &amp; imped in the body of Chriſt. Tak heed then, Chriſt in his blood, as he is the lawer of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, is the thing ſignified in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. In this ſacrament of the Supper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane, this ſame Chriſt, is the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ane vther reſpect; to witt, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as his body and blood ſerues to nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh my ſaul to life everlaſting; for this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is na vther thing, but the Image of our ſpirituall nuriture, God teſtifing howe our ſauls are fed, and nuriſched to that heauenly life, bee the Image of ane corporal nuriture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Swa, in diuers reſpects the ſame thing; that is, Chriſt Ieſus, is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in baptiſme, and is ſignified in the Supper. In this Sacrament the fruits of Chriſts death, quhereof I ſpake, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his ſacrifice, the vertue of his pasſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oun: I call not thir fruits nor thir ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues onely, the thing ſignified in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Supper; but rather I call the thing ſignified, that ſubſtance, &amp; that perſon, out of the quhilk ſubſtance, this
<pb facs="tcp:6260:36"/>
vertue, and thir fruits dois flow and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. I grant to thee, and it is maiſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that bee the lawfull vſe and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Sacrament, thou art parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all thir fruites, ȝit thir fruites are not the firſt &amp; cheife thing, quherof thou art partaker in this ſacrament; but of force thou man get ane vther thing firſt. It is true, that na man can be partaker of the ſubſtance of Chriſt, but the ſame ſaul mann be alſo partaker of the fruites that flowis fra his ſubſtance: Ȝit notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, thou man diſcerne betwixt the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and the fruits that flowis fra the ſubſtance, and thou mann be partaker of the ſubſtance in the firſt roume. Then in the nixt roume, thou mann bee partaker of the frutes that flows fra his ſubſtance. To mak this clear in baptiſme, the frutes of baptiſme, are remisſion of our ſinnes, mortification, the ſlaughter of ſinne, and the ſealing vp of our adoptioun to life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting. The ſubſtaunce, out of the quhilk thir fruites dois flow, is the blood of Chriſt: Ȝe mann heir of force diſcerne betwixt the blud quhilk is the ſubſtance, and betwixt remisſioun of ſinnes, weſch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and regeneratioun, quhilk are the
<pb facs="tcp:6260:37"/>
fruites that flowis fra this blood. Sicklike in the ſacrament of the ſupper. The fruits of the Sacrament, ar the growth of fayth and the incres in halines. The thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, is the ſubſtance; that is, the body and blood of Chriſt is the ſubſtance, out of the quhilk, this growth in faith &amp; hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes dois proceed. Now ſee ȝee not this; ȝee mann diſcerne then betwixt the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and the fruits, and ȝe mann place the ſubſtance in the firſt roume, ſa that the ſubſtance of Chriſt, that is, Chriſt him ſelfe is the thing ſignified in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for ȝour awin experience makis this cleare vnto ȝou: or ȝour ſtomach be filled with ony foode, ȝee mann eat the ſubſtance of the food firſt, or ȝee bee fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with bread, ȝee man eat the ſubſtance of that bread firſt: Or ȝour drowth bee quenched with ony drinke, ȝee mann of force, drinke the ſubſtance of the drinke firſt. Euen ſa, efter this ſamemaner, or the hunger of ȝour ſaules bee ſatisfied, and the thirſt thereof quenched, ȝee man eat the fleſh of Chriſt, and drinke his blood firſt, and that be faith. Sa conſider the ane be the vther; looke to quhat vſe bread &amp; wine ſerues to thy body, to the ſame very
<pb facs="tcp:6260:37"/>
vſe, the body and blood of Chriſt ſerues to thy ſaull, and hee that appointed the ane to ſerue for thy body, the ſame God appointed the vther to ſerue for thy ſaul. Swa look how imposſible it is to thee, to be fed with that foode that coms neuer in thy mouth, or to recouer helth of that drog quhilk wes neuer applied, nor come neuer out of the Apothecaries booth: It is als imposſible to thee, to bee fed vpon the body of Chriſt, and to get thy health of the blood of Chriſt, except thou firſt eat his body and drinke his blood. Then ȝe ſee, that the thing ſignified in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, is not the fruit ſa meekle, as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die &amp; blood of Chriſt Ieſus, quhilk is the fountaine and ſubſtaunce, quhairfra thir fruits dois flow and proceed.</p>
               <p>Now I ſay, ſuppoſe Chriſt quha is the<note place="margin">The thing ſignified in baith the ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>craments is an, the ſigns are not ane.</note> thing ſignified, remaine ay ane, and the ſame in baith the Sacraments: ȝit the ſignes quhairby this ane Chriſt is ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Sacraments are not ane, nor of ane equall number nather: for in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, the thing that repreſents Chriſt, is water: Into the ſupper, the things that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents Chriſt, are bread &amp; wine. Water is appointed to repreſent Chriſt in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:38"/>
and quhy? Hee hes choſen out water, becauſe it is meeteſt to repreſent the blood of Chriſt, to repreſent our we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing with the blood of Chriſt. For quhat is meeter to weſh with, nor water? Sa there is nathing meeter to weſh the ſaull, nor the blood of Chriſt. Into this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he hes appointed bread and wine; quhy? Becauſe there is nathing meeter to nuriſh the bodie, nor bread and wine. Sa the Lorde hes not choſen thir ſignes without a reaſon. As the ſignes in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are not alwayis ane; ſa the ſame in baith, are not of ane number: For in Baptiſme, wee haue but ane element, into this Sacrament wee haue twa elements. Now quhat is the reſon of this diuerſity,<note place="margin">Qahy in bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſme there is but ane ſigne, and in the Supper twa.</note> that the Lord in the ane Sacrament, hes appointed twa ſigns, and in the vther but ane ſigne? I ſall giue ȝou the reaſon: hee hes appointed only ane ſigne in Baptiſm, to wit, water: becauſe water is ſufficient aneugh to doe the haill turne. Gif water had not beene ſufficient to repreſent the thing ſignified, hee wald haue appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ane vther ſigne: but in reſpect, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dois the turne, and repreſents fullie the weſhing of our ſauls, with the blood
<pb facs="tcp:6260:38"/>
of Chriſt: quhat miſter then haue wee of ane vther ſigne? Now in this Sacrament, ane ſigne will not ſuffice, but there mann be twa: for quhy? Wine cannot be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient alane, nor breade can not bee ſufficient alane: For hee that hes bread onely, and wine onely, hes not a perfite nuriture corporall; therefore, that they might repreſent and lat vs ſee, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite nuriture, he hes giuen vs, baith bread and wine: (For the perfite nuriture cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, ſtands in meat and drinke) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the full and perfite nuriture of the ſaul. Looke how full and perfite a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riture, he hes to his bodie, that hes ſtore of bread and wine; ſa hee that hes Chriſt, laks nathing of a full and perfite nuriture to his ſaul. Then ȝe ſee the reaſon, quher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is twa ſignes appointed in this Sacrament, and onelie ane ſigne in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>

Thinke weill with thy ſelfe, that Chriſt is als bisſie doing al thir thinges ſpiritually to thy ſaul; hee is als bisſie giuing to thee his awin bodie, with his awin hand: hee is als bisſie giuing to thee his awin blood, with the vertue and efficacie of it: Siclike in this actioun, (gif thou bee an faithfull communicant) looke quhat the mouth dois, and howe the, mouth of the bodie is occupied out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardelie: Sa is the hand and mouth of the ſaul (quhilk is fayth) ocupied inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.
<pb facs="tcp:6260:41"/>
As the mouth takis that bread and that wine, ſa the mouth of thy ſaull takis the bodie and blood of Chriſt, and that bee faith: for bee faith, and a conſtant perſwaſioun, is the onely way to eat the bodie, and drinke the blood of Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlye, and doing this, there cannot but followe a fruitfull manducatioun. This farre, for the conſideratioun of the ſignes.</p>
               <p>Nowe comes in the matter, quherein greteſt difficultie ſtandis, quhereof I ſpak<note place="margin">Howe the ſignes and the thing ſignified are conjoyned in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> the laſt day as God gaue me the grace, ȝit in the particular wee man ſpeake, as weil as in the generall, but ſomequhat mair ſchortlie. Then ȝee haue to vnderſtande for the better informatioun of ȝour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and for the better preparation of ȝour ſauls: ȝee haue to vnderſtand how that bread and that wine, quhilk are the ſignes, are cowpled with the bodie and blood of Chriſt, quhilk are ſignified ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; quhat ſort of conjunctioun is this, &amp; quherefra flowes this conjunctioun, I ſall be ſhort in it, becaus I ſpak of it at great length the laſt day. Take heede, for and ȝee giue not attendance, it is not posſible that ȝee can take vp this conjunction. As
<pb facs="tcp:6260:41"/>
to this ſort of conjunction, how thir twa are cowpled, wald ȝee knawe it? Doe this firſt. Take tent firſt of all, to the nature of the ſignes, and to the nature of the thing ſignified, ȝe man take tent to baith their natures, and quhy? Be reſon nathing can be coupled nor conjoined with an vther, but in ſa far as the nature of it will ſuffer: gif the nature of it wil not ſuffer ane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctioun, they cannot be conjoyned: or will the nature of it ſuffer a conjunction, looke how far it will ſuffer a conjunction, ſa far are thay conjoyned. Nowe mann I looke to the nature of the things that ar conjoyned? Ȝis: Firſt of all then, looke to the thing ſignified, quhat is the nature of the thing ſignified; looking to this, thou ſeeis that the thing ſignified is of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall nature, of a heauenlie and miſticall nature; Then conclude, na queſtioun this ſpirituall thing wil ſuffer a ſpirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, a myſticall and ſecreet conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Looke over agane to the ſigne: The ſigne of his nature, as I taulde ȝou in the beginning, hes a relatioun to the thinge ſignified. And the thing ſignified of his nature, hes a relatioun to the ſigne. Swa then the ſigne and the thing ſignified wil
<pb facs="tcp:6260:42"/>
ſuffer to be conjoyned be ane mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latioun: Baith the ſign and the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, in reſpect they haue a mutuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latioun the ane to the vther, they wil ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thame ſelfes to be conjoyned be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue conjunction. Now ſpeer ȝe at me, quhat ſorte of conjunctioun is betwixt that bread and that wine, and the bodie and blod of Chriſt. To tel ȝou in a word, I ſay it is a ſecreet and ſpirituall conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioun, ſick a conjunction as ſtands in a mutuall reſpect, betwixt that bread and the bodie of Chriſt, &amp; betwixt that wine, and the blood of Chriſt. Then I ſay, it is a ſecreet and a ſpirituall conjunctioun. Thou wald not bee ſa inquiſitiue of this conjunction, gif it were corporal, viſible, or local, gif thou ſaw thame baith before thine eies, thou wald not ſpeer how they are conjoyned: Or gif thou ſawe thame baith in an place; but in reſpect thou ſees but the ane with thine eie, &amp; the vther is hid: this makis the conjunction the mair difficill to be vttered and vnderſtanden. And howe is it posſible that ȝee can take vp this ſecreet and hid conjunctioun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ȝee haue the eies of ȝour mind illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat bee the ſpirit, quhereby ȝee may
<pb facs="tcp:6260:42"/>
come to the right vnderſtanding of it: But gif ȝee haue ony inſight in thir ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall maters that comes bee fayth, this conjunction ſall apeare als cleirly be the eie of ȝour faith, as the Phiſicall conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctioun dois to the eie of ȝour body. Now will ȝee haue this mater maide plaine. There is ane vther conjunctioun quhilk ſerues to make this conjunctioun very clear: To wit, the conjunction betwix the worde quhilk I ſpeake, and the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified bee that ſame worde. Speake I of things to ȝou in a language that ȝee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand: As be gods grace ȝe vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this language now; ſpeake I of things bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane, and it were neuer ſa lang ſyne: ſpeake I of things to come, and they were neuer ſa far off: ſpeake I of things abſent and they were neuer ſa far diſtant: Ȝit ſa ſone as I ſpeake the word; quhither it be of things bigane or to come, the thing it ſelfe will come in ȝour minde. The word ſtreiks not ſa ſoone in ȝour eire, but the thing ſignified be the ſame worde come in ȝour mind. Quhat maks the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, ſuppoſe it be abſent, to com in my minde? This could not be, except there were a conjunction betwix the word and
<pb facs="tcp:6260:43"/>
the thing ſignified bee the worde: As for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, ſpeake I of the King, quha is now a good peece diſtant from vs, (I pray god ſaue him) ȝee will not ſa ſoone hear the word, but the King quha is the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified bee this worde, will come in ȝour mynd. Speake I of things bigan, ſuppoſe they be already expired, ȝit the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified wil ay com in your mind: Sa there is a conjunction ȝe ſee, betwixt the word and the thing ſignified be the word. Tak heed to this conjunctioun, and ȝe ſal get the nature of the conjunction, and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling of the ſign with the thing ſignified in the Sacrament: for looke quhat ſorte of conjunctioun is betwixt the word and the thing ſignified be the word, that ſam ſort of conjunction, is betwixt the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, quhilk is ſene to the eie of ȝour bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>die, and the thing ſignified bee the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, quhilk is ſeene to the eie of ȝour ſaull onely. As for example, ſa ſoone as thou ſeeis that bread tane in the hand of the Miniſter, thou ſeeis it not ſa ſoone, but incontinent the bodie of Chriſt man come in thy minde: thir twa are ſa con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, that thay come baith togither: the ane to the outwarde ſenſes, the vther
<pb facs="tcp:6260:43"/>
to the inward ſenſes. This is not aneugh now, but becaus in the inſtitution, ȝe are commanded to ga farther, and not only to look to that bread and that wine, but to take that bread and that wine: Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent as ȝour hand taks the ane, ſa ȝour hart taks the vther: as ȝour teeth eats the ane, ſa the teeth of ȝour ſaull quhilke is faith, eats the vther, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> applies Chriſt to ȝour ſaull. Swa ȝee ſee, there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctioun heir, ſecreet and myſticall: and therfore Chriſt cannot be conjoyned but be a ſecreet and myſticall conjunctioun. The conjunction betwixt Chriſt and vs, is a ſecret and myſtical conjunction, quhilk the Apoſtle EPHES. 5. cals that ſpirituall conjunctioun, full of ane high myſterie. This conjunctioun cannot be tane vp at the firſt: Sa ſeeing the conjunctioun is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and ſpiritual, and not perceaued but be the ſpirit of God: All is for nocht, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ȝee haue ſome portioun and meſure of his ſpirit; Al that is taught in the word and ſacraments, will neuer do you good; will neuer cary ȝour ſaull to heauen, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ſpirit of GOD illuminat ȝour mindes, and make ȝou to finde in ȝour ſauls, the thing that ȝe hear in the word.
<pb facs="tcp:6260:44"/>
Then learne this, ſeeing the worde can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee vnderſtand, but bee the ſpirit of God: craue that the Lord wald illuminat the eies of ȝour mindes be his ſpirit: and be ȝee als cairfull to get the ſpirit, as ȝee are cairfull nowe in the hearing of the word.

As that bread, and that

The thing ſignified bee the bread and wine, is not receaued be the mouth of the body: Na, the Scriptures denies that plainelie; but hee is receaued, be the mouth of the ſaull. Then there is twa mouthes; that bread, &amp; that wine, quhilk are the ſigns, are receaued be the mouth of the bodie: Chriſt, quha is the thing ſignified, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued be the mouth of the ſaul; that is, be a true faith. Swa, bring me not to the Table, ane mouth onely (for gif ȝee bring the mouth of ȝour body only, al is wra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g) but bring with ȝou alſo, the mouth of the ſaull, a conſtant perſwaſion in the death of Chriſt, and all gaies weill. Now, as to the maner, how the ſigns are receaued, &amp; the faſhion how the thing ſignified is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued: Ȝee may eaſilie knawe, that thir corporall and naturall ſignes, mann bee receaued efter a corporall and naturall maner: They mann bee taken, with the hand or mouth of the bodie.

Swa, as the ſignes are corporall, &amp; receaued efter a corporall maner, with the hand, or the mouth of the bodie: ſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, the thing ſignified is ſpirituall, and receaued efter a ſpiritual maner, with the hand and mouth of the ſaull; quhilk is true faith.

I will giue thee to deuiſe, and imagine with thy ſelfe, quhat newe thing wald thou haue: Lat the heart of man deuiſe imagine, and wiſh; hee durſt neuer haue excogitat, to haue ſik a thing, at the Sonne of God, he durſt neuer haue preſumed, to haue pearſed the clouds, to

Quhat better thing can thou wiſh? Hee is equall with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ane in ſubſtaunce with the Father, true God, and true man; quhat mair can thou wiſh? Then I ſay, wee get na vther thing in the Sacrament, nor we get in the word; content thee with this: But ſuppoſe it bee ſa; ȝit the Sacrament is not ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous.

Then ſpeers thou, quhat newe thing wee get? I ſay, we get this new thing, wee get Chriſt better nor we did before, wee get the thing that we gat, mair fullie, that is, with a ſurer apprehenſion, nor we had off before; wee get a better grippe of Chriſt nowe: For be the Sacrament, my faith is nuriſhed, the bounds of my ſaull is enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and ſa, quhere I had but a little grip of Chriſt before; as it were, betwixt my finger and my thoumbe; nowe I get him in my haill hande, and ay the mair, that my faith growes, the better grip I get of Chriſt Ieſus. Sa the Sacrament is felloun neceſſarie, and it were na mair, but to get Chriſt better, and to get a faſter appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of him be the Sacrament, nor we culd haue off before: For gif it were true, that the Sacrament is ſuperfluous: be the ſame reaſon it ſall follow alſo, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the Sacrament, is ſuperfluous; for quhen ȝe come to the Sacrament the ſecond time, ȝee gat na vther thing, nor ȝee did the firſt time: quhen ȝee come to the Sacrament the third time, ȝee gat na vther thing, nor ȝee did the firſt time: and ȝit na man wil ſay, that the third and ſecond comming is a ſuperfluous thing;
<pb facs="tcp:6260:47"/>
and quhy? Becauſe in the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, my faith is augmented: I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand better, I grow in knawledge, I grow in apprehenſioun, I grow in feeling; and getting the grouth of all thir, als oft as I come: There is na man will ſay, that the oft comming to the Sacrament is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, and it were, ilk day ains; Sa their firſt inconuenient, availes not; wee get na newe thing in the Sacrament: Ergo, the Sacramentis ſuperfluous. This farre for the firſt.</p>
               <p>Then there comes on ane vther thing on the ſame ground: Gif Chriſt bee not perceaued but be faith; then ſay wee, na wicked bodie can perceaue him; hee that lacks faith, cannot perceaue him; he that lacks faith, may perceaue that Sacrament of that bread, and that wine, and may eat of that bread, and that wine; but he that lacks faith, may not eat of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, ſignified bee that bread, and be that wine. Sa there is the ground: Na faithles people can perceaue Chriſt,<note place="margin">Second in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient</note> nor eat the bodie of Chriſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Againſt this ground, they delaſh their artillerie ſiclike, and they bring their argument out of the ſame wordes
<pb facs="tcp:6260:47"/>
of the Apoſtle quhilk I haue read. The words are thir: <hi>He that eats of this bread vnworthely,</hi> ſayis the Apoſtle, <hi>and drinks of this cup vnworthely, is guiltie of the body and blood of Chriſt:</hi> Theris their ground; Sa that their argument will ſuffer this forme, as gif they wald ſay, efter this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Na man can bee giltie of that thing, quhilk hee hes not receaued; they haue not receaued the bodie and blood of Chriſt: therefore they cannot be giltie of the bodie and blood of Chriſt: but ſa it is; the Apoſtle ſayis, they are guilty: therfore they haue receaued the bodie and blood of Chriſt. I anſwere to the propoſition,<note place="margin">Refutation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, quhere in, are ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry reaſons giuen, quhy the wicked are counted guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> and I ſay, it is very falſe: They could not be giltie of that bodie and blood, except they had receaued it: For they may bee guiltie of that ſame bodie, and of that ſame blood, ſuppoſe they neuer receaued it, but tak heed to the text. The text ſayis not, that they eat the bodie of Chriſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthelie, but it ſayes that they eat that bread, and drinks that wine vnworthely. And ȝit becauſe they eat that bread, and drinks that wine vnworthelie, they are compted before God, guilty of the body
<pb facs="tcp:6260:48"/>
and blood of Chriſt. Now quherefore is this? Not becauſe they receaue him, for gif they receaued him, they culd not but receaue him worthelie, for Chriſt cannot be receaued of any man, but worthelie. But they are compted guilty of the body and blood of the Sonne of God, becauſe they refuſed him: For quhen they did eat that bread, and drinke that wine, they might, gif they had had fayth, eaten and drunken the fleſh and blood of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: Now becauſe thou refuſes the bodie of Chriſt offered to thee, thou contemns this body offered to thee, gif thou haue not ane eie to diſcerne and judge, vpon this bodie that is offered: For gif they had had fayth, they might haue ſeene his bodie offered with the bread, bee fayth they might haue tane that ſame bodie, &amp; be faith they might haue eaten that ſame bodie; therefore lacking their ſpowſing garment, lacking faith, quhereby they ſuld eat the bodie, and drinke the blood of Chriſt: lacking faith quhilk is the eie of the ſaul to perſeaue, and the mouth of the ſaull to receaue that bodie, quhilk is ſpiritually offered, they ar compted guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of that ſame bodie and blood. Nowe
<pb facs="tcp:6260:48"/>
come on, this may be made mair clear be a ſimilitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ȝe ſee amangs warldly prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, their cuſtome is, they will not ſuffer their majeſtie to be intereſt in the ſmaleſt thing that they haue: Quher can there be a ſmaller thing, that concernis the maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of a Prince, nor a ſeall, for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it is but wax, ȝit gif thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully vſe that ſeall, and contemne it, and ſtampe it vnder thy feete, thou art compted als guiltie of his bodie &amp; blood as hee that puttis hand in him, and thou wil be handled efter ea way: meikle mair, gif thou come as ane Sow, or as ane Dog to handle the ſeals of the body &amp; blood of Chriſt, mekle mair may thou be comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be guiltie of his body, and of his blood. This far for the eating of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Chriſt: The wicked cannot eat the bodie of Chriſt, but they may be guiltie of it. The Apoſtle maks this ſpeach mair clear ȝit, bee ane vther ſpeach quhilke I haue ſometime handled fra this place: I remember that in the 6. Heb. 6. it is ſaid, that Apoſtats, they that makis filthie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, they crucifie the ſonne of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane, and their falling away, maks thame as guilty as they wer quha crucified him.
<pb facs="tcp:6260:49"/>
Hee is now in the heauens, they cannot gett him out of the heauens to crucifie him, ȝit the Apoſtle ſay is they crucifie him: Quhy? Becauſe their malice is als great as theirs that crucified him, becaus they match in malice with thame that crucified him; ſa that gif they had him in the earth heir, they would doe the like: therefore they are ſaid to crucifie the ſon of GOD: Sicklike in HEB. 10. 29. there is ane vther ſpeach, the wicked are ſayd to ſtramp the blood of chriſt vnder their feet: Quhy? becauſe their malice is als great as theirs that ſtramped his blood: Now, they ar compted for this reaſon to be guilty of the bodie &amp; blood of Chriſt, not becauſe they eat his bodie, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they refuſe it, quhen they might haue had it. Now the time remaines ȝit, quherein wee may haue the bodie and<note place="margin">Exhortation</note> blood of Chriſt, this time is very preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the diſpenſation of times is very ſecreet, and hes their awin boundes: Gif ȝee take not this time now, it will away. This time of grace, and of that heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie foode, hes bene diſpenſed to ȝou very lang, but how ȝee haue profited, ȝour life and behauiour teſtifies: Take vp there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>They will not leaue this mater ſa, but<note place="margin">Thrid in con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenience</note> they inſiſt ȝit, &amp; they bring ma argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to prooue that the wicked are partakers of the bodie and blood of Chriſt. That bread, ſay they, ȝee will grant, quhilk the wicked man eats, is not naked bread, but is that bread, quhilk is the Sacrament: Now they make their argument: the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament hes ever conjoyned with it, the thing ſignified: but the Sacrament is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to all, therefore the thing ſignified is giuen to all. Quhat gif I grant to thame all this argument? There ſuld na inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient followe: for the thing ſignified may be giuen to all, that is, offered to all, as it<note place="margin">Refutation of ths thrid inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> is offered to all men, and ȝit not recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all: Giuen to all, therefore recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all, it followes not. I may offer ȝou
<pb facs="tcp:6260:50"/>
twa things, ȝit it is in ȝour awin wil, quhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ȝee will take thame or not, but ȝee may take the ane and refuſe the vther, &amp; ȝit hee that offers, offered ȝou the thing that ȝee refuſed, as truely as the thing quhilke ȝee tooke. Sa God deceauis na man nor woman, but with the word and ſacraments, aſſuredly he geuis twa things gif they wald take thame: Into his word, hee offers the word to the eare, he offers Chriſt Ieſus to the ſaull: Into his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; he offers the Sacraments to the eie, he offers Chriſt Ieſus to the ſaul. Now it may be, that quhere twa things are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and conjointlie offered, a man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the ane, and refuſe the vther, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauis the ane becauſe he hes ane inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to take it, hee refuſes the vther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he lacks ane inſtrument: I hear the word, becauſe I haue ane eare to heare it with: I receaue the Sacrament, becauſe I haue a mouth to receaue it with: but as to the thing, quhilk word and Sacament repreſents, I may refuſe it, becauſe I haue not ane mouth to take it, nor ane eie to perceaue it; and therefore the falt is not vpon Gods part, but vpon our part. The wicked gets the bodie &amp; blood of Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:6260:50"/>
offered to thame conjointlie, with the worde and Sacraments: but the faulte is vpon their parte, they haue not a mouth to take him, and GOD is not bound to giue them a mouth: (Take heed to that) And were not of his ſpeciall grace and mercie, hee geuis me ane eie to perceaue him, and a mouth to receaue him, I wald refuſe him, as weill as they do. Sa this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument dow not, Chriſt is offered to all, ergo, he is receaued of all, happy were they, and they receaued him. This far for the third argument.</p>
               <p>Quhat reſts nowe for the full vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding<note place="margin">Howe the ſaul is ſaid to eat the body and drinke the blood of Chriſt.</note> of the Sacrament? There reſts ȝit ſome things, we man vnderſtand now the ſacramental ſpeaches, that are vſed in the ſacrament: for ȝe ſee, we vſe to ſpeake of thame, God vſes to ſpeake of thame, and the Ancients vſes to ſpeake of tham: Wee vſe to ſay, that the ſaull eats the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, and drinkes the blood of Chriſt. Thir ſpeaches wald be opened vp to ȝou, howe the ſaull is ſaid to eate the bodie, and drinke the blood of Chriſt. Thir ſpeaches are ſacramentall; ȝee are not the wiſer ȝit, but I ſall make it cleare to ȝou, bee Gods grace. They are ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:51"/>
quhat is that? ȝe know it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the bodie to eat and drink, thir ar the proper actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the body only: Now he aſcriues them to the ſaul, be ane tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, be ane figuratiue maner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that quhilk is proper to the bodie, is aſcriued to the ſaul, and it is ſaid that the ſaull eats and drinks. The eating of the ſaull man reſemble the eating of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: then the eating of the ſaul is na vther thing, but the applying of Chriſt to the ſaul, to beleue, that he hes ſhed his blood for me, that he hes purchaſed remisſioun of ſinnes to me. Nowe come on, quhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cal ȝou this ane eating? Quhat cal ȝe the eating of the bodie lat ſee? Eats thou not the bodie, quhen thou applies the meat to thy mouth? Gif then the eating of the bodie bee na vther thing, but the applying of meat to the mouth, the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſaull mann be na vther thing, but the applying of the nuriture to the ſaull. Then ȝe ſee quhat is meaned be the eating and drinking of the ſaul: Na vther thing, but the applying of Chriſt to my ſaull, and the applying of his death and paſſion to my ſaull, and this is only done be faith: therfore he that lacks faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

eat Chriſt. This far for the eating and drinking of the ſaull, quhilke are ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall ſpeaches.</p>
               <p>Quhat reſts now of al thir great things,<note place="margin">Obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> &amp; of al this doctrine that hes bin taught? learne me but this ane leſſon, learne me to apply Chriſt rightlie to thy ſaull, and thou hes win all, thou art a great Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log, and thou haue learned this weil. For in the right application of Chriſt, to the ſicke ſaull, to the wounded conſcience, &amp; diſeaſed hart; heir beginnes the fountain of all our felicitie, and the welſpring of al our joy. And I ſall tell ȝou, quhat this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication workes, looke quhat the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of thy ſaull within thee, (ſuppoſe thou want Chriſt in thy ſaull) dois to this earthlie bodie, to this lump of clay, as be the preſence of the ſaul, it liues, it moues, it feiles, as the ſaull giues to the bodie, life, mouing, and ſenſes: that ſame verie thing dois Chriſt to thy ſaull. Hes thou ains gripped and applyed him to thee? As the ſaull quickens the bodie: ſa hee quickens the ſaull, not with an earthly or te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral life, but with the life quhilk he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues in heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: he maks the to liue that ſame life quhilk the angels liues in heauen: he
<pb facs="tcp:6260:52"/>
maks the to moue, not with warldly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but with heauenly, ſpirituall, &amp; ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: Again, he inſpyres in thee, not outward ſenſes, but heauenly ſenſes; he warks in thee a ſpirituall feeling, that in thine awin heart and conſcience, thou may find the effect of this word. Swa, be the conjunction of Chriſt with my ſaull; I get a thouſand times a greater benefit, nor the bodie dois bee the ſaull: For the bodie, bee the preſence of the ſaull, gets onlie ane earthly and temporall life, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to continuall miſerie; but be the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt in my ſaull, I ſee a bleſſed life, I feele a bleſſed life, and that ſame life takes daily, mair and mair increas in me. Then the ground of all our perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and bleſſednes, ſtands in this conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; &amp; ſa, ſuppoſe thou liued METHVSA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEMS daies, &amp; were euer crauand: Ȝit, gif in the laſt houre, thou get this conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thou may thinke thy traueill weil wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, thou hes gotten aneugh: Sa ſuld ȝee not bee bisſie in crauing, gif ȝee were to liue a thouſand yeare: for gif ȝe get him in the laſt houre, ȝe haue gotten aneugh: gif ȝee haue gotten Chriſt, ȝee haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten all with him: Sa the aplying of Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:6260:52"/>
to my ſaul, is the fountaine of all my ioy and felicitie.</p>
               <p>And how get we this conjunction, lat ſee? This is a ſpirituall conjunction; a conjunction, hard and difficile to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, obtained, and gotten of vs: How then is this conjunction brought about, quhilk ar the moyaners of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>juncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vpon the part of God; and quhilk are the moyaners vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the part of man; to get me Chriſt, to put Chriſt Ieſus in my ſaul, and to make Chriſt Ieſus ane with mee? There is ane moyaner vpon the part of God, that helps to get vs Chriſt; and ther is ane vther vpon our part: vpon the part of GOD, there is the halie ſpirit: quhat doth he? He offers the body and blood of Chriſt to mee. Nowe vppon our part, there mann be a moyaner; or els, ſuppoſe he offer, we will not receaue: Therefore, of necesſitie, there mann bee faith in our ſauls, to receaue that quhilk the halie ſpirit offers, to receaue that heauenlie foode of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, quhilk the halie ſpirit offers. Then faith and the halie ſpirite, are the twa moya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of this ſpirituall and heauenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction. Be thir twa moyaners; be faith,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:53"/>
and be the halie ſpirit; I get the bodie of Chriſt; the bodie of Chriſt is mine, and he is giuen to my ſaul. Now heere coms in the queſtioun: how can thou ſay, that the bodie of Chriſt, is giuen or deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to thee, ſeeing the bodie of Chriſt, is ſittand, at the right hand of God the Father? and looke how great diſtance, is betwixt heauen and earth; als great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is ther, betwixt the body of Chriſt, and thy bodie: how then ſay ȝee, that the bodie of Chriſt is giuen to ȝou? The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes cannot get this vnderſtoode; and therfore they imagin, ane groſſe and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall conjunctioun: except the ſpirite of God reueale thir things, they cannot be vnderſtand; the ſpirit of God, mann illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate our minds, and be bisſie in al our hearts, or we come to the vnderſtanding of this. Then wald thou vnderſtand, how Chriſt is giuen thee? This ground is true, that the bodie of Chriſt, is at the right hand of the Father, the blood of Chriſt, is at the right hand of the father: Ȝit not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, ſuppoſe there be als great diſtance, betwixt my bodie, and the body of Chriſt, as is betwixt heauen and earth, Ȝit Chriſts body is giuen to me: and how
<pb facs="tcp:6260:53"/>
is he giuen to me? Be reaſon, I haue ane title of his body giuen to mee: the right and title, quhilk is giuen to me of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and blood, makes mee to poſſeſſe his bodie and bloode: The diſtaunce of the place, hurts not my title, nor my right: For gif ony of ȝou, haue a peece of land, liand in the fardeſt part of Orknay; gif ȝee haue a good title to it; the diſtance of the place cannot hurt ȝour title. Sa I ſay, the diſtance of place, hurts not my title, and my right, that I haue to Chriſt: But ſuppoſe, he be ſitting at the right hand of the Father; ȝit the title and right, that I haue to him, makes him mine; ſa that I may ſay trulie, this man is my propertie: Then Chriſt is not made mine, becauſe I pike him out of the heauens: but hee is mine, becauſe I haue an ſure title &amp; right to him, and hauing a ſure title, and a juſt right to him, the diſtance of place, howe far ſoeuer it be, can on na ways hurt my title, nor my right; but quhaireuer he be, he is mine, becauſe I haue a right and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to him. Ȝea, not onely, haue I a title to him, but this title is confirmed to me: for as I get a title to him in the worde, (and gif I gat not a title to him in the word; I
<pb facs="tcp:6260:54"/>
durſt not come to the Sacrament.) Sa in the Sacrament, I get the confirmation of my title, I get the ſeale quhilk confirmes my title. Then to come to the point: Chriſts bodie is ſittand at the right hand of the Father; and ȝit hee is mine, and is deliuered to me, becauſe I haue right to his bodie, be quhere it will; he was borne for me, giuen to me, and deliuered to me. Swa diſtance of place, hurts not the ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my title, as propinquitie of place, helps not the ſurety of the ſame. I giue thee, that Chriſt wald bow the heauens, and twitch thee with his body, as he did IVDAS: Ȝit this could not helpe thee a quhit; for gif thou had not a title to him, thou durſt not call him thine. Swa it is not the nearenes, nor proximitie of places, that makes Chriſt mine: It is onely the right that I haue to him. I haue right to him, onelie be faith: Sa bee faith onelie, Chriſt is made mine. But they think they haue gotten a great van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of vs, gif wee bee ſa far fra Chriſt, as the heuen is fra the earth; but that ſal be tane fra tham alſo, be gods grace. I haue a title to his bodie; his bodie is diſtant fra my bodie; ȝit his bodie is not diſtant
<pb facs="tcp:6260:54"/>

Be true faith, chriſt ſuppoſe he be in the heauens, is coupled and conjoyned with mee, quha am heere on earth: How can this be? I ſall ſhew ȝou<note place="margin">Similitude tane fra the ſunne.</note> how: Is not the bodie of the Sunne in the lift? It is imposſible to ȝou, to twitch the bodie of the Sunne; ȝit the bodie of the Sunne and ȝee are conjoyned: howe? Be thay ſame beames that ſhines on ȝou, be that light that ſhines on ȝou: Quhy may not the bodie of Chriſt then, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it be in the heauens, be conjoyned with me that am in the earth, to wit, bee the beams, be the light and gladnes, that flowis fra his bodie? my bodie and the body of Chriſt, are conjoined be the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power that flowis fra his bodie; quhilke vertue and power quickens my dead ſaull, makis mee to liue the life of Chriſt, to begin to die to my ſelfe, and ay the mair I die to my ſelfe, the mair I liue to him. This conjunctioun nowe is the

ground as I tauld ȝou, of all our felicity and happines, and I haue made it clear to ȝou for the preſent, ſa far as God hes ȝit giuen me inſight, gif he geuis ony far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heirafter, as he communicats it, ȝee ſall haue it. Alwaies ȝee ſee this conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is moyaned, be twa ſpeciall moyans, be the moyan of the halie ſpirit, and bee the moyan of faith: Gif there bee na v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moyaner, but thir twa, quhy craues thou a carnall or a viſible conjunctioun? Faith is inviſible, and the ſpirit is inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: therefore thou cannot ſee it nor tak it vp with the eie of thy bodie, the power of the halie ſpirit is ſa ſubtill, ſecreet, and inviſible, that thou cannot perceaue it, nor take it vp with the eie of thy bodie, and he wil work great effects in thy ſaul, or ever thou take vp his working. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect therefore, that the moyaners of this conjunctioun are ſa ſubtill, ſecreet, &amp; ſpiritual, quhy thinks thou to get a ſight of this conjunctioun with the eie of thy bodie?

Firſt, in calling to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, the bitter death and pasſioun of Chriſt, the blood that hee ſhed vpon the Croſſe, the Supper quhilk hee inſtituted in remembrance of him, before hee gaid to the Cros. The commandement quhilk he gaue: <hi>Do this in remembrance of me:</hi> I ſay, we eat his fleſh, &amp; drinks his bloodſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritually. Firſt, in this point, in recording and remembring faithfully, how he died for vs, howe his blood was ſhed vpon the Croſſe. This is the firſt point; a point that cannot be remembred trulie, except it be wrought be the mighty power of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſpirit. The ſecond point of the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all eating, ſtands in this; that I, and euery ane of ȝou, beleeue firmlie, that he died for me in particuler: That his blood was ſhed on the Croſſe, for a full remisſioun
<pb facs="tcp:6260:59"/>
and redemptioun of mee, and my ſinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the cheife and principall point of the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Chriſt his fleſhe, and drinking of his blood; ſtandes in beleeuing firmlie, that that fleſh was deliuered to death for my ſins, that that blood of his, was ſhed for the remisſioun of my ſinnes: and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept euerie ſaull come neere to him ſelfe, and firmly conſent, agree, and be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that Chriſt died for him, that ſaull cannot be ſaued; that ſaull cannot eat the fleſh, nor drink the blood of Chriſt. Then the eating of the fleſhe, and drinking of the blood of Chriſt; ſtands in ane faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full memorie, in ane firme beleife, and in ane true applying of the merites of the death and pasſioun of Chriſt to my awin conſcience in particular.</p>
               <p>There was ſundrie things objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this kind of perception; and I will not inſiſt to repeat thame, but beſide all the objections, quhilk ȝee heard obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted againſt this kinde of ſpirituall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptioun bee faith: They ſay, gif Chriſt his fleſhe, nor his bloode, bee not perceaued, nor receaued but be the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; bee faith in the ſpirite, then ſay they, ȝee receaue him but be ane imagination.
<pb facs="tcp:6260:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Gif he be not receaued carnally, nor cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally, but onely bee the ſpirite, and bee faith: then is he not receaued, but be way of imagination, conceat, and fantaſie. Sa they count faith, ane imagination of the mind, ane fantaſie and opinion, fleeing in the harnes of man. I cannot wite thame to think ſa of faith: for as nane can judge of the ſweetnes ofhony, but they that hes taiſted of it: Sa, there is nane can diſcerne nor judge vppon the nature of faith, but they that hes felt, &amp; taiſted in their harts quhat it is. And gif they had taiſted and felt in their ſauls, quhat faith brings with it; alace, they wald not call that ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all iewell, and onelie iewel of the ſaul, ane imaginatioun; they call it ane imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Apoſtle deſcriuing it HEB. 11 1. cals it ane ſubſtance, and ane ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall ground: Looke howe weill thir twa agrees, an imagination, and ane ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall ground; they call it ane vncertaine opinioun, fleeting in the braine and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie of man: He cals it ane euidencie and demonſtration in the ſame definition. See howe plat contrary, the Apoſtle and they are in the nature of faith. Vpon this, they inferre, that as it is true in the generall,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hee cannot bee deliuered nor giuen, but that ſame way that hee is receaued; and looke quhat way, any thing is receaued, that ſame way it is giuen &amp; deliuered: ſa efter thame, he being receaued be way of imagination, hee is alſo in their fantaſie giuen and deliuered, be way of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For gif he be not giuen, ſay they, to thy hand, to thy mouth, nor to thy ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach corporall; hee cannot be giuen, but be ane imaginatioun, and fantaſtical opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. The reaſoun that mouis thame to thinke, that Chriſt cannot be theirs, nor giuen to thame truly, in effect and really, except he be giuen carnally, is this: that thing quhilk is ſa far abſent, and ſa far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant fra vs: as the heuen is fra the earth; cannot be ſaid, to be giuen to vs, nor to be ours: But with ȝour awin confesſion, ſay they to vs, Chriſt his bodie, is als far abſent from vs, as the heauen is from the earth: therefore Chriſt his bodie, nor his fleſh, cannot bee giuen to vs, except bee way of imaginatioun, and ſo not truelie nor in effect. This argument framed in this ſort, wald appear to haue ſome force, and moment in the entrie: Ȝit let vs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the propoſition of it. The propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:6260:60"/>
is this: that thing quhilk is ſo far ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from vs, as the Heauen is from the Earth; cannot be ſaid to be deliuered to vs, to bee giuen to vs, or any way to bee ours. Now quhither is this propoſitioun true or fals? I ſay this propoſition is flat fals, and the contrair is maiſt true; a thing may be giuen to vs, &amp; may become ours, ſuppoſe the thing in perſon it ſelfe be as far diſtant from vs, as the heauen is from the earth. And how proue I this? Quhat maks ony thing to be ȝours? Quhat ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kis ony of ȝou to count a thing to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to ȝou? Is it not a title, is it not a juſt right to that thing? And gif ȝee haue as juſt right giuen vnto ȝou, bee him, quha hes power to giue it, and ane ſure title made to ȝou, be him, quha hes the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: ſuppoſe the thing that he geuis ȝou, be not deliuered into ȝour hand, ȝit bee the right and title, quhilk hee makis to ȝou, is not the thing ȝours? This is out of queſtioun, for it is not the nearnes of the thing to my bodie and to my hand, that makes the thing mine: for it may bee in my hand, and ȝit not appertaine to me; Nather is it the diſtance, nor abſence of the thing that makes it not to bee mine,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:61"/>
but it may be far abſent from me, &amp; ȝit be mine; becauſe the title is mine, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue gotten a right to it, of him quha hes power to giue it. Sa this ground is true, it is a ſure title, and an juſt right, that makis a thing, ſuppoſe it bee far ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and diſtant fra vs, to bee ours. Now ſubſume: But ſa it is, that a liuely &amp; true fayth, in the blood and death of Chriſt, makes vs to haue ane ſure title, and ane good right to the fleſh &amp; blood of Chriſt, and to his merites, looke quhat he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited be his death, &amp; ſheding of his blood vpon the cros, al that, togither with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alſo, apperteins to me, and that be a title &amp; ane right, quhilk I haue gotten to him of God, quhilk is faith: And the ſurer that my title be, the mair ſure am I of the thing, that is giuen me be the title. Now this Sacrament of the Supper wes inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to confirme our title, to ſeale vp our right, quhilk wee haue to the bodie and blood, to the death &amp; pasſioun of Chriſt, and ſa the bodie of Chriſt is ſaid to bee giuen to vs: the blood of Chriſt is ſaid to be deliuered to vs, quhen our title, quhilk we haue of him, of his death, of his body and blood, is confirmed in our hartes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
<pb facs="tcp:6260:61"/>
this Sacrament wes inſtituted, for the growth and increaſe of our faith, for the increaſe of halines and ſanctificatioun; quhilk faith, the greater that it be in our hartes, the mair ſure are wee, that Chriſt his death apertains to vs. I grant to thee, as I haue ſaide, that the fleſh of Chriſt, is not deliuered in my hand, his fleſh is not put in my mouth, nor enters not in my ſtomach: Ȝit, God forbid, that thou ſay, he is not truly giuen. For ſuppoſe Chriſts fleſh bee not put in thy hand, nor mouth of thy bodie (and quherefore ſuld it? Hes he not appointed bread and wine for the nuriture of the body, and may they not content ȝou? are they not ſufficient to nuriſh ȝou to this earthly and temporall life? hee hes appointed Chriſt to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, to the inward mouth of the ſaull, to be giuen in the hand of thy ſaule, that thy ſaull may feed on him, and be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with that life, quherewith the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels liues, quhairwith the Son of God, and God himſelfe liues: Sa the fleſh of Chriſt, is not appointed to nuriſh thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but to nuriſh thy ſaul in the hope, ȝea in the growth of that immortall life) And therefore I ſay; ſuppoſe the fleſh of Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:6260:62"/>
be not deliuered in the hand of my body; ȝit it is deliuered to the part that it ſuld nuriſh; the ſaull is the part that it ſuld nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: Therefore to the ſaul it is deliuered: ȝea that bread, &amp; that wine, are na mair really deliuered to the body, and to the hand of the body; nor the fleſh of Chriſt, is deliuered to the ſaul, &amp; to the hand &amp; mouth of the ſaul, quhilk is faith. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, craue na mair a carnal deliuerie, nor panſe not vpon an carnal receuing. Thou man not think, that ather God giues the fleſh of Chriſt, to the mouth of the body, or that thou, be the mouth of thy bodie, receauis the fleſh of Chriſt. For ȝee man vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this principal in the Scriptures of God; our ſaull cannot bee ioyned, nor bound with the fleſhe of Chriſt, nor the fleſh of Chriſt cannot be ioyned with our ſaull, but be ane ſpirituall band; not by ane carnall band of blood or allya, nor bee the twitching of his fleſhe, with our fleſh. But he is conjoyned with vs, be ane ſpirituall band; that is, bee the power and vertue of his halie ſpirit: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſayis, 1. COR. 12. 13. that be the moyan of his halie ſpirite; all wee quha are faithfull men and women,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:62"/>
are baptized in one bodie of Chriſt; that is, we are conjoyned, and faſtned vp with ane Chriſt, bee the moyan (ſayis hee) of ane ſpirite; not bee ane carnall band, or be ane groſſe conjunction; but anelie be the band of the halie ſpirite; that ſame halie ſpirit that is in him, is in every ane of vs in ſome meſure: And in reſpect ane ſpirit is in him, and in vs: Therefore wee are counted al to be ane body, and to be members of ane ſpirituall, and myſticall bodie: and in that ſame vers he ſayis; We are all made to drinke in ane, and the ſelfe ſame ſpirit, that is: Wee are made to drinke of the blood of Chriſt, and this blood is na vther thing, but the quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vertue &amp; power that flows fra chriſt and fra the merites of his death. We are made all to drinke of that blood, quhen wee drinke of the liuely power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that flows out of that blood: Sa there is not a bande, that can couple my ſaull with the fleſh of Chriſt, but anely a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall band, and ane ſpirituall vnioun; &amp; therefore it is that the Apoſtle 1. COR. 6. 17. ſayis: Hee that is cowpled with God, and conjoyned with our Lord, is ane ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with him, and IOHN, in his third chap.
<pb facs="tcp:6260:63"/>
ſayis: That quhilk is borne of the ſpirit, is ſpirit: Sa it is onelie, be the participation of the halie ſpirite, that wee are conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the fleſh and blood of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; that carnall band, quhither it bee the band of bloode, running thorowe ea race; or bee the carnal twitching of fleſh with fleſhe: that carnall band, was neuer eſteemed off be Chriſt, in the time he was conuerſant heere vpon earth, hee lute nathing of that band; and as he hes left behind him in his booke; he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that carnal band, in ony kind of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence nor eſtimation, in reſpect of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall band: but as to the ſpiritual band, quhairby we are coupled with him be an ſpirite; he euer eſteemed of this band, in the time that hee was conuerſant in the warld: and in his booke, hee hes left the praiſe and commendation of the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all band. To lat ȝou ſee, how lightly hee eſtemed of the carnal band, of the blood and alya, quhilk we regard ſa meekle. Ȝee haue a place, LVKE. 8. 20. 21. for there they come to him, and they ſay, Maiſter, ȝour mother, ȝour brother and kinsfolks ſtands without, and wald ſee ȝou, and bee at ȝou: ȝee heare his anſwere to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
<pb facs="tcp:6260:63"/>
how litle hee eſteemes of that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall band, he anſwers in the 21. verſe, in a maner, denying that band, and he ſayis: They are my mother and brethren, quha heares the word of GOD and dois it: as gif he wald ſay; it is not that carnall band that I eſteme off, it is not that carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctioun that I reuerence; it is the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conjunction, be the participation of the halie ſpirit, quhairby wee are moued to hear the worde of God, to giue reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to it, and to obey it. This carnall band, was neuer profitable as that ſame, LVK. 8. dois plainly teſtifie: For gif the twitching of Chriſts fleſh had bene profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, the multitude quhair of mention is made in that chapter, that thruſted and preaſed him, had bene the better be their carnal twiching: but ſa it is, that ther was neuer ane of tham the better of their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal twitching: Therefore the carnal twit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching profits na thing.

<pb facs="tcp:6260:64"/>
be faith hes ever bin profitable: and wee haue a plain exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of it in the ſam chap. Sicklike, quhair there the poore woman that was lang diſeaſed with ane bloodie iſſue, be the ſpace of twelue yeares, and had waſted, and conſumed ane great part of hir ſubſtance, in ſeeking remeid, ſhee findis no helpe at the naturall and bode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Phyſition: At laſt, be the vertue of the halie ſpirit, working faith in her hart; be faith ſhe vnderſtands and conceuis, that ſhee is able to recouer the health of her bodie, &amp; the health of her ſaull at Chriſt Ieſus, quha come to ſaue baith bodie &amp; ſaull: and vpon this perſwaſioun quhilk ſho hes in her hart, that Chriſt may cure both bodie and ſaull, ſhee comes to him, and as the text ſayis, ſho preaſis thorowe the multitude, quhill ſhe come to him, &amp; quhen ſho comes to him, it is not ſaide that ſho twitched his fleſh with hir hand; in cace the Papiſtes wald aſcriue the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue quhilk come out of him, to her car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal twitching: But it is ſaid, that ſho twit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched onely the hemme of his garment with her hand, and with faith, quhilk is the hand of the ſaull, ſhe twitched her ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour God and man. And to lat ȝou vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:64"/>
that ſho twitched him be faith, he ſais to her in the end: Go thy way, thy faith hath ſaued thee, ſho twitched him not ſo ſoone bee fayth, but incontinent there comes a power out of him, quhilke power and vertue, ſho felt be the effect of it in her ſaull, and he felt it quhen it gaid fra him: The effect quhairby ſho felt it, was the health of hir faull, and the effect quhairby hee felt it, was the ganging fra him, and ſa ſoone as he felt it ga fra him, he ſayis, quha is this that hath twitched me? PETER, quho was ever maiſt ſudden, anſwers, and ſayis: Thou art thrumbled and thruſted be the multitude, and ȝit thou ſpeeris quha hes twitched thee, hee anſwers againe and he ſayis, it is not that twitching that I ſpeak of: It is ane vther kinde of twitching: There is ane hes twit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched me, quha hes drawin a vertue and power out of me. The multitude taks na vertue fra me: The poore Woman think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe had done amiſſe, and ſeeing that ſho could not be hid, ſho coms trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and ſho ſayis; I haue done it: he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers her in the end; and he ſayis, depart in peace, thy faith hes ſaued the, thy faith hes thrawin out a vertue and power out
<pb facs="tcp:6260:65"/>
of me, that hath made baith ſaul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die haill. Sa that this twitching of Chriſt hes ever bene profitable, is and ſall bee profitable. Lik as the twitching of Chriſt with the corporall hand, hes neuer bene, is not, nor ſall never bee profitable; for quhy? Chriſt is not appointed to bee a carnall head, to bee ſet vppon the crags of our bodies, that hee may doe the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a carnal head thairvnto, to furniſh naturall motioun, and ſenſes to our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, na, the ſcriptures cals not Chriſt ane carnall head: But the ſcriptures cals him an ſpirituall head, to be ſet on the crag of ourſaul, that is, to be conjoyned with our ſaull, that out of him in our ſaull, may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil haly motions, heauenly ſenſes, &amp; that there may flow out of him to vs, ane ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and heauenly life. Then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures cals him ane ſpirituall head, as they call vs ane ſpirituall bodie. And as the life, quhilk we get from him, is ſpirituall: Sa all our conjunction with him, is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall; and in reſpect, hee works that ſame operattion in my ſaull, quhilk the carnal head dois in the bodie: Therefore hee is counted a ſpirituall head; Therefore is he counted the head of his Kirk, bee reaſon
<pb facs="tcp:6260:65"/>
he furniſhes to hir, ſpirituall motion and ſenſes, quhilk is the life of the Kirk: Sa to be ſhort, there is nathing in this conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctioun carnall; there is nathing groſſe in it, there is nathing, that may be compaſt bee our naturall iudgement and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: And therfore, quhaſoeuer wald attaine, to ony ſmall inſight of this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tul conjunction, betwixt vs and Chriſt; of force he mann bow downe, and earneſtly incall for the ſpirit, or it is not posſible to get ony vnderſtanding, and it were neuer ſa ſmal ane inſight; how the fleſh of Chriſt and wee are conjoyned, except wee haue ſome light giuen vs bee the ſpirit: that is, except our heartes bee walkned, bee the mightie working of the ſpirite of Chriſt, this ſall remaine, as a dead and a cloſed<note place="margin">Exhortation</note> letter to vs. Sa ȝee haue to craue, that the Lord in his mercie, wald walken ȝou, and illuminat ȝour vnderſtandings, and mak ȝou to haue a ſpirituall light, to diſcerne on thir ſpirituall things.

But it is not ſa with the evident, quhilk is the worde of God: for ȝee know ony evident will mak faith, ſuppoſe it want a ſeall, and it will ſerue to make a right, gif it be ſubſcriued without a ſeall: but the ſeall without the evident avails nathing: Euen ſa it is with the worde of God, ſuppoſe the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be not annexed to the worde, ȝit the worde will do our turne, it ſerues vs to get Chriſt; It ſerues to ingender &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get

Swa it is cleare, that na man, nor creature hes power to make a Sacrament: Then it mann bee according to the inſtitution of Chriſt; his inſtitution mann bee keeped: Looke quhat he ſaid, looke quhat he did, looke quhat he commanded thee to do: all that, mann be ſaid, done, and obeyed: Leaue thou a iote of that vndone, quhilk hee commaunded thee to doe, thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerts the inſtitution: for there is nathing left in regiſter of that inſtitution, but it is eſſentiall.

               <p>It is agreed &amp; condiſcended vpon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs, quha celebrats this inſtitutioun<note place="margin">Word and e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lement man continue to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a Sacrament.</note> and all the ſects of this warld, quha hes ſeparat thame ſelues fra this inſtitution, that twa things are neceſſare, and mann concur to the nature and conſtitution of a ſacrament; to wit, there man be a word, and there man bee ane element concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand; there is not a ſect, but they graunt this, that the worde man concurre with the element, or wee get a Sacrament.

And firſt of all wee haue to vnderſtande, quhat wee mean be the word, and quhat they meane be it: wee be the worde, as I haue ſaid, vnderſtands the haill inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt Ieſus, quhatſoeuer hee ſaid, quhatſoeuer hee did, or commanded to be done, without eiking, without paring, without alteratioun of the meaning or ſens of the word: This wee mean bee the worde in the Sacrament. Quhat vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the Papiſtes bee the worde? They preach not the inſtitution of Chriſt, nor taks not the haill inſtitution, as he left it:
<pb facs="tcp:6260:71"/>
but in ſtead thereof they ſelect, and pyks<note place="margin">Quhat the papiſts vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande be the word in the Sacrament.</note> out of his inſtitution, four or fiue words; and they make the haill vertue of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutioun, to ſtand in the foure or fiue words: &amp; it maid noght gif they conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thame with they words, becauſe they are the words of the inſtitution: but they eike to they wordes, they paire fra the wordes and alters, the meaning of they ſame wordes, quhilk they keepe as they pleas. That ȝee may ken this; In their Meſſe quhilk they cal the Supper, wee ſal lat ȝou ſe the ſubſtance of it. I deuide the Meſſe in ſubſtantiall things, and acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall things: To the ſubſtance of the Meſſe there ar three things craued. There man of force be a preiſt, that is ſick a ane, as taks vpon him the office of our mediator Chriſt Ieſus, to intercead betwixt God &amp; man. Secondlie, to the ſubſtance of the Meſſe is craued, that the Preiſt offer the bodie and bloode of Chriſt: Wee come heere to receaue thay thinges; there the Prieſt offers thame to GOD the Father. Thirdly, bee this worke, (ſay they) they obtaine all good things; bee this worke, wrought they obtaine remisſion of ſins, als weill to the dead, as to the quick; but
<pb facs="tcp:6260:71"/>
in ſpeciall, they obteine remisſioun of ſins to the Prieſt, quha is the diſtributer, and to him quhom to the Preiſt applies that ſacrafice: And as to the reſt of the Kirk, quha are abſent, they obteine this remisſioun of their ſinnes, be this worke generally. Thir three things are neceſſare to the ſubſtance of the Meſſe. As to the accidents that mann concurr to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a Meſſe, they are of twa ſortes: Some of thame are alwaies neceſſar, with out the quhilk that actioun cannot bee: Some are not neceſſare againe, and the action may bee without thame, but not without a deadlie ſinne: Thir things that are neceſſare, concernis partly the preiſt, and partelie the action it ſelfe. The acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that are neceſſary to the Preiſt, are of twa ſorts, an ſort are ſik, as without the quhilk he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be a preiſt, the vther ſort the quhilk without he cannot be free of dedlie ſin: The things without the quhilk hee can not be a Preiſt are thir: Except he haue power giuen of his Biſhop to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate, quhilk power is iuſtified be the vnctioun, and ſhauing of his croune; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againe hee haue power to ſpeake, &amp; that the roofe of his mouth be haill, that
<pb facs="tcp:6260:72"/>
hee may ſpeake, he cannot bee a Prieſt. Thir twa are alwaies neceſſare, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs to the perſon. Vther things againe, are not ſo neceſſare: as the Prieſt man be free fra ſuſpenſion, fra curſing, deadlie ſinne, and all eccleſiaſticall pane and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, thir things are neceſſare to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. There is againe, twa things neceſſare to the action; ane ſort without the quhilk the action cannot be, without the Lords prayer it cannot bee, without the fiue words of the inſtitutioun it can not bee. Vther things againe are not ſa neceſſare, as the conſecration of the place, quhere the Meſſe is ſaid, the Altar ſtane, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Chalice, the Water, the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, ſinging, hee that ſuld help to ſay Meſſe, and the reſt. Swa they and wee in na waies agreis concerning the worde, quhat is meaned be it.</p>
               <p>Into the ſecond member, wee are als far ſundry, how this worde ought to bee intreated: Wee ſay the word tane as ſayd is, for the hail inſtitution, ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treted efter this maner: Firſt there ought a lawfull Paſtour, quha hes his calling of God to intreat it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this lawful Paſtour aught to intreat the word lawfully; quhat
<pb facs="tcp:6260:72"/>
is that? he aught to preach it, to proclaim it, and publicklie, with a cleare voyce to denounce it. He aught to open vpp, and declare the haill parts of it; quhat is the peoples part: and quhat is his awin part; how hee aught to deliuer and diſtribute, that bread and that wine: how the peple aught to receaue off his hand, that bread and that wine, to informe theirfaith; how they aught to receaue Chriſt his bodie and his bloode, ſignified bee that bread, and that wine; as alſo, he aught to teach thame, howe they ſuld come with great reuerence to that Table, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the precious bodie and blood of Chriſt. This he aught to doe in ane fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar language, that the people may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him, that they may heare him, that they may perceaue and take vpp in their hearts, the things that he ſpeakes: For quhat auailes it to ȝou, to heare a thing quhiſpered, and not ſpoken out, or gif it be ſpoken out; quhat availes it ȝou to heare it, gif ȝee vnderſtand it not? For except ȝe heare Chriſt in an familiar and hamelie language, ȝe cannot vnderſtand: And except ȝee vnderſtand, it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to ȝou to beleeue; and without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:73"/>
there is na aplication of Chriſt; and except ȝe beleeue, &amp; apply Chriſt to ȝour ſelfis; ȝour comming to the Sacrament, is in vaine. Sa of force, gif this Sacrament be lawfullie handled; the Paſtour mann preach the inſtitutioun of Chriſt, that it may be hard, &amp; in ane familiar language, that it may bee vnderſtood; in ſicke ſort, that the faithfull peple may be informed how to receaue; &amp; the Miniſter may knaw his part, howe to deliuer and diſtribute. This we ſay, ſuld be the right handling of the halie inſtitutioun of this Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Now quhat doe they? They in place of a Miniſter, Paſtour, or Biſhop, call him as thou pleaſis, quha is called lawfullie of God: they ſubſtitute a Prieſt, and ſurro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates an hireling, quha hes na calling, or office now in the Kirke of God. For the office of a Prieſt, as they vſe their Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, is na vther thing, but the office of Chriſt Ieſus, the office of the Mediatour betwixt God and vs. For they make their Prieſtes, dailie to offer vp Chriſt Ieſus to the Father. Nowe this is the Mediatour, Chriſt his office; and he did it ains for ay, and ains for all, ſayis the Apoſtle: ſa that, they can haue na entry, to doe this turne
<pb facs="tcp:6260:73"/>
over againe: And in reſpect, that their Prieſts preaſis to do this turn ouer again, quhilk hee hes done already; they doe it without a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, they haue not a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand in the word of God, but givand that they had a warrand of their calling, in the booke of God; ȝit they handle the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment al wrang: for quhair they ſuld ſpeak forth clerly, they whiſper, &amp; they conjure the elements be an certain kind of quhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpering, quhair they ſuld ſpeak it in ane knawn language, that the people may vn derſtand; they ſpeak it in an vn knawn lan guage; and ſuppoſe they ſpak it in an kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win and familiar language: ȝit in reſpect they quhiſper it, the peple cannot be the better of it. And quhat ſall I ſay, ſeeing they handle the worde this way; ſuppoſe it be the very inſtitutioun it ſelfe: ȝit they ſa ſpill it in the handling, that it is not an halie Sacrament: Then we differ als mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle in the ſecond point; howe the worde aught to be handled and intreated.</p>
               <p>Now the third point comes in, to wit:<note place="margin">Third head controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> quhat vertue this worde hes, how far the vertue of this worde extends the ſelfe. In this hed we grant &amp; acknawlege, that the word hes a virtue, &amp; the word tane, as ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:6260:74"/>
is, workes ſomething, euin towardes the ſame elements of bread and wine; for we acknawledge, that they elements, be the vertue of this worde are changed, not in thair ſubſtance, not in thair nature, nor ȝit in thair ſubſtantiall and naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties: But we grant, that the elements are chaunged in ane qualitie, quhilk they had not off before: In ſick ſort, that thir elements are tane fra the commoun vſe, quhairvnto they ſerued of before; and be the inſtitution of Chriſt, they are apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed now to ane halie vſe: Looke howe far, the haly vſe differs fra the commoun vſe; thair is als great difference, betwixt the elements this day in the actioun, and the thing that they wer ȝiſterday. For I grant that the elements are chaunged; and ȝit, this element proceeds not of the nature of the elements, fra an cloſed vertue, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be in the words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor fra the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpering of the words; but it proceeds, fra the will of Chriſt, fra the ordinance and appointment of Chriſt, ſet downe in his awin inſtitution: for that thing is halie, quhilk GOD cals haly, and that thing is<note place="margin">Third head controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> prophane, quhilk God cals prophane.</p>
               <p>To lat ȝou vnderſtand, how thir ſignes
<pb facs="tcp:6260:74"/>

Firſt, quha is hee that makes thame halie, quhither God, Angell, or man: Secondly, quhaeuer hee be that marks thame halie; be quhat mean and way makes hee thame halie. And be the conſideration of thir twa, we ſal com to the conſideratioun, and right weying of the ſanctification of the elements: As to the firſt, we ſay; that God is onelie he, that may make a thing, quhilk was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to be halie: So wee ſay, that God be his will and ordinance, declared and ſet downe in his word; hes made the things that were common be his appointment to bee haly. As to the way and meane, quhairby they are made halie; it is the word of GOD, the inſtitution of Chriſt, the will of Chriſt, declaired in his inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioun, that makes thame halie: For the preachinge and opening vpp of the worde, and inſtitutioun of Chriſt, lats vs ſee, that God hes made thir things ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie; &amp; not onely, that he hes made thame halie, but lats vs ſee ane halie manner, how they ſuld be vſed; in quhat place, at quhat time, with quhat heart, and to quhat end. Sa it is the will of Chriſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb facs="tcp:6260:75"/>
in his inſtitutioun, quhairby the thinges that were commoun before, are nowe made halie. There is vther twa things alſo, that maks the ſame elements halie, and thir twa, are vſed in this inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutioun: there is praier and thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing; for praier and thankſ giuing, makes the creatures of GOD to our vſe halie: quhair vtherwayis, gif wee receaue the creatures of God like dogs, and thanke him not for thame; it is ane ſure taken, that they were neuer Sanctified to our vſe.</p>
               <p>Be praier, we obtain grace and ſtrength from God, to vſe the creatures, and this hail action halilie and lawfullie, as it ſuld be: And therefore, not onely in this haly action, ſuld wee begin with God, and at the incalling vppon his name; but in all actions of the warld<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wee ſuld beginne in Gods name. Sa it is the will of God, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and thankſgiuing conjoyned with the elements, that makes thame halie: al thir three, contained in the action of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, makes the ſeales halie: for beſide the will of God, declared in his inſtitutioun; In the ſupper, we vſe ane incalling, and in this incalling, wee vſe ane thankſgiuing: the
<pb facs="tcp:6260:75"/>
Sa the Elements are not made halie bee the worde of God onelie: but be the vſe of prayer and thankſgiuing, quhilk three are the onelie mean and way, quhereby thir things are ſanctified.</p>

God is ſaid to bleſſe, and Man is ſaid to bleſſe: God is ſaid to bleſſe, quhen he giues good thinges to his creatures, for God his blesſing is ever effectuall, &amp; therefore he is ſaide to bleſſe, quhen hee giues good things. Man againe is ſaide to bleſſe, ather priuatlie or publiklie, quhen he crauis blesſing at the hands of God to any man, quhen he bleſſes in the name, and at the commaund of God, any perſone or people. Nowe if ȝee aſcriue blesſing in ony of thir twa ſignifications to the cuppe, it is all wrang: for wee vſe nather to craue blesſing to inſenſible E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, nor ȝit to bleſſe thame in the name of God. And God vſes to giue good thinges to the Sonnes of men, and not to inſenſible creatures: Therefore wee are compelled to vſe the word, bleſſe, in the third ſignificatio: <hi>The cup quhilk we bleſſe,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:6260:76"/>
that is, quhilk wee ſanctifie and prepares be blisſing. This far wee vnderſtand, for the ſanctification of the elements.</p>
               <p>Now lat ſee, how they ſanctifie ther e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, and quhat is the forme of their conſecratioun; ſa far as I vnderſtand of it, ſtands in thir fiue wordes: <hi>Hoc eſt enim corpus meum.</hi> It ſtands in thay fiue words; and in the quhiſpering of thame; for gif ȝee quhiſper thame not, ȝe tine the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of incantation: for the thing that wee call ſanctifieng, they call quhiſpering: And the quhiſpering of they fiue words, they cal the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration of the elements. And quhen the wordes are efter this way quhiſpered, they preſuppone ſick ane hid and monſtrous vertue, to bee incloſed in the ſyllabs; that the vertue and power quhilk flowes fra they wordes, is able to chaſe away halely, the ſubſtaunce of the bread: Sa that the verie bread, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of it, is altogither deſtroyed bee this power. Secondly, that this power that flowes fra thir words, is able to rugg and pull downe ane vther ſubſtaunce; to wit, the fleſhe and blood of Chriſt Ieſus, that ſits at the right hand of his Father, and is able to put it within the compaſſe
<pb facs="tcp:6260:77"/>
of that bread; that is a ſtraunge and ane great vertue, that not onelie will thrawe downe that ſubſtance, but put it within the compaſſe of that bread. They ſame fiue words, quhiſpered in this maner, hes ſick a monſtrous operation, ſay they, that they are able baith to chaſe away the ane ſubſtance, to rug downe ane vther, and to put it within the compaſſe of that bread. We altogither deny, that ther is ſik a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in thir wordes: for as I haue ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; we deny not that the word hes a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but wee deny that there is ſick a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue incloſed in the wordes: wee deny the qualitie of the vertue, and the quantitie of the vertue, or that it flowes from ſic a fountaine. For we graunt that the word hes a vertue, there is neuer a woorde that God ſpake heir, but it hes a vertue joyned with it: but we deny that this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is incloſed in the ſillabs, in the whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering or pronouncing of the words: for gif there were ſic a vertue and power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in the ſillabs, be that reaſon it ſuld followe, that there were a vertue in the figure and ſhape of the letter that makes vp the wordes. Now there is na man will thinke, that there is any vertue in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:77"/>
or ſhape of the letter, and there is as litle vertue in the ſillabs, or in pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the words themſelues: Sa wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that there is any vertue incloſed in the ſillabs, or reſident in the worde; but wee ſay, that there is a power conjoyned with the worde, and this power is not reſident in the word, but is reſident in the eternal worde, in the eſſentiall worde, quhereof IOHN makes mentioun in the firſt of his Evangell. The worde quhilk wes fra the beginning, that is, the Son of God Chriſt Ieſus. We ſay there is not a dram weight of this vertue, and power reſident in na creature that ever God created: but it is onely reſident in Chriſt Ieſus: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there flowes na vertue from the ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labs, nor fra the wordes that ar ſpoken, but fra Chriſt &amp; his ſpirit, quha giues the vertue to thay words. Swa wee differ in this, wee ſay that there is not a vertue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident in the ſyllabs; wee ſay that the ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labs &amp; pronouncing of the ſillabs, works nathing: but we ſay that the vertue is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident in the perſon of the ſonne of God, and he workes be his awin word.</p>
               <p>Now we ſay, there cannot be ſik a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous chaunge, as to ſay, that the whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering

               <p>The firſt principle that I lay, is this; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Chriſt Ieſus the ſonne of God, in<note place="margin">

                     </gap>e firſt ſorte argument,</note> the time appointed, toke true fleſh of the wembe of the virgin, and vnited himſelfe with our nature in ane perſonall vnioun, to the end, that our nature, quhilk fell altogither fra integrity in the firſt Adam; might recouer the ſame in the ſecond A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam; ȝea, not only the ſame; but ſa meekle the greter, as our ſecond Adam excels the firſt in all degrees; and in reſpect he took on ane body, like vnto ours in al things, (ſinne excepted:) Sa, of necesſitie it mann folow, that the definition of ane true bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and the inſeparable properties ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, mann be competent to him. But thir
<pb facs="tcp:6260:78"/>
are the inſeparable properties; to wit, to be in ane certaine place, to bee finit, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcriued, viſible and palpable: For all thir conueines (<hi>quarto modo,</hi> as the Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians ſayis) to ane body; ſa that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee ſeperate fra the ſubject, without the diſtructioun thereof. Then I reaſon on this maner; All true humane bodie, is in a certaine place: Chriſt Ieſus bodie is a true humane bodie: therefore it is in a certaine place. I call a place, a certaine condition of ane organical bodie, quher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it comes to paſſe, that quherever the bodie be, of necesſitie, it is limitat within that place, and quhill it is there, it cannot be els quhere. Craue ȝee the probation of my propoſition, of the Doctors? Read AVGVSTINE, writand to DARDANVS, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kand of this ſame bodie of Chriſt: Take away a certaine rome fra the bodies, and they ſall be in na place; and gif they be in na place, they are not. This ſame AVGV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STIN writand vpon IOHN in his 30. trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe: the bodie (ſayis he) into the quhilk the Lord raiſe; of necesſitie it mann be in ane place; but his diuine efficacie and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is diffunded euery quhere. And in his third Epiſtle, hee ſayis, howe meekle
<pb facs="tcp:6260:79"/>
that euer the bodie be, or how little that euer the bodie be; it behooues to occupy the bounds of a place. And beſides thir, the hiſtorie of the Acts, prooues maiſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidentlie, Chriſts bodie to be in a certain place, as ACT. 3. 21. the wordes are thir: Quhom the heauen muſt containe, vntill the time that al things be reſtored, quhilk God had ſpoken be the mouth of all his Prophets. Suppoſe I need not to inſiſt, in the probation of thir things; ȝit I follow foorth. Secondlie then, I reaſon efter this maner; All humane bodie is finite and circumſcriued: but the bodie of Chriſt is a humane bodie: Quhat warrands of the Doctours haue I for this? I leaue many purpoſlie, and takes me onelie to AVGV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STINE: he writ and to DARDANVS; beleeue ſayis he, Chriſt to bee euery quhere, in ſa far as he is God, but onelie to be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen according to the nature of a true bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; and in his 146. Epiſt. I beleeue ſayis he, the bodie of Chriſt to be ſa in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, as it was in the earth, quhen he gaid vp to heauen: but it was circumſcriued in a certaine place in the earth: Ergo, it is ſa in the heauen, and conſequently, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in the Meſſe bread, and ther baith
<pb facs="tcp:6260:79"/>
at ane time. The laſt reaſon is this: al hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane bodie, is viſible and palpable; but Chriſt hes a humane body, and he is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally preſent, as ȝe ſay: therfore Chriſts bodie is viſible and palpable. I prieue my propoſition, be Chriſts awin words, tane out of LVK. 24. 39. Into the quhilk place, to perſwade the Apoſtles of the veritie of his bodie, and to prieue euidently, that it was not fantaſticall; he vſes the argument tane fra thir twa qualities, and hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds his Apoſtles to feele and ſee, lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thame to witt thereby, that as thir twa ſenſes are the maiſt certaine of all the reſt: ſa are they maiſt able to diſcerne, quhither gif he was ane body, or ane ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite: as gif he wald ſay; gif I be viſible and palpable, ȝee may be out of doubt, that I haue an true bodie. For as the Poet ſayis, quhilk TERTVLIAN cites alſo to this ſam purpoſe. <hi>Tangere enim &amp; tangi, niſi cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, nulla poteſtres.</hi> Be thir arguments, it may be euidentlie ſeene, how this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiatioun may na wayis ſtand with the veritie of the bodie of Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
               <p>And as it fights with the fleſh of Chriſt Ieſus, ſa it repugnes directlie againſt the articles of our beleife: for into our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:80"/>
wee profes that Chriſt aſcended out<note place="margin">Second ſort of argument</note> of this Earth to the Heauen; quhere hee ſits at the right hand of the father; quher he gouernes and directs all things in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth; fra the quhilk place, hee is to come in the laſt day to judg the warld<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This article lats vs ſee, that he hes fleeted his dwelling, quhilk he had amangs vs in the erth, &amp; hes aſcended into the heuens, quhere hee ſits at the right hand of his Father, and ſal remaine there, according to the teſtimonie of PET. quhilk I cited out of Act. 3. 21. vnto the laſt day. Gif he ſits at his Fathers right hand, &amp; be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in heuen quhil the laſt day, he is not corporally into the bread: but the article ſais, that he ſits at the right hand of his fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther &amp; PET. ſais in that place, that he is to be conteined in the heauens vnto the laſt day: therefore this tranſubſtantiatioun fightes directlie agains the articles of our beleife, &amp; the manifeſt place of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, that it fightes agains the end<note place="margin">Third ſorte of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> quherfore this ſacrament wes inſtituted, it is mair nor evident: for the end of the Sacrament is ſpirituall, as the effect that flowes thereof is ſpiritual, and the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:6260:80"/>
quhereby this ſpirituall foode is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to vs, is alſo ſpirituall: But of ane naturall and corporall preſence, ane ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall effect can neuer flowe: therefore the corporall and naturall preſens of the bodie and blood of Chriſt Ieſus, repugns directlie to the end of this ſacrament: for the corporall preſence mann haue a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall eating, of this eating, follows a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion in the ſtomach, &amp; the thing that is digeſted in the ſtomach, is neuer able to feede thy ſoule to life eternall: Sa, this corporall preſence mann ay tende to ane corporall end, quhilk is directlie contrair to the ende, quherefore this Sacrament wes inſtituted.</p>
               <p>Attour, gif the bred were tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate,<note place="margin">Vther argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</note> it ſuld become the thing ſignified; gif it becomes the thing ſignified, this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ſuld wante a ſigne, and ſa it ſuld not be an ſacrament: for euery ſacrament as ȝe hard, is ane ſigne. Now to ſay, that the accidents of true bread, as the hew &amp; the roundnes of it, that they may ſerue as ſignes, that is mair nor follie: for betwixt the ſigne and the thing ſignified, there man be ane conformitie: but there is no conformitie betwixt the accidents, and
<pb facs="tcp:6260:81"/>
the bodie and blood of Chriſt Ieſus: for gif ſa were, the accidents be houed to nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh vs corporally, as the body and blood of Chriſt Ieſus, is appointed to nuriſh vs ſpiritually. Farther, gif the bread become the bodie of Chriſt Ieſus, it ſulde followe that hee had ane bodie without bloode: for hee hes inſtituted ane ſigne, a pairt to repreſent his blood. Alſwa, gif there had bene ſick a wonderfull thing, as they ſpeake of, in this ſacrament, there walde haue bene plaine mention made thereof in the ſcripture: For God himſelfe works neuer a notable worke, but hee vtters it ather in opin tearmes, or priuat termes in the ſcripture, that thereby he may bee glorified in his wonderfull works; as ȝee may reade in the Evangell IOHN, 2. 8. quher the water wes changed into wine, GENE. 2. 22. quhere the Ribbe of ADAM wes changed into HEVA. EXOD. 7. 10. quhere AARONS rodde wes turned in a Serpent. There ȝee ſee, that chaunging is manifeſtlie expreſſed: Therefore I ſay, gif there had bin ſic a monſtrous change in thir elements of the Supper, as they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, the ſcripture walde not haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it, but expreſſed it: but in reſpect,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:81"/>
there is na mention made of this change in the ſcripture: therefore there is na ſic change in this action. Farther, gif there were ſic a change, as they ſpeake, ather it is before their words of conſecration be ſpoken, or followes efter that ſame word be ſpoken; gif the change bee before the words of the conſecration be ſpoken, the conſecration is ſuperfluous, &amp; their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is fals; gif the change bee efter the word be ſpoken, This bread is my bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>die; their propoſition is fals alſo, becaus the worde bread is ſpoken, or the laſt ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lab of their fiue words bee pronounced. Thir, and infinit ma abſurdities followes of this doctrine.</p>
               <p>And ȝit they obſtinatly perſeuere, and vrges vs with the letter, affirming that the wordes of Chriſt are ſa plaine, that they admitte na figure. They wald haue ſpoken mair aduiſedlie, gif they hadde ſought counſall of AVGVSTINE, to haue diſcerned betwixt ane figuratiue ſpeache and ane proper: for hee into the thirde booke, and 16. Chap. of Chriſtian doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, ſpeaks efter this ſort, gif the ſpeach ſays he, appear to command a wickednes or a miſchiefe, or to forbidd ane happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:82"/>
or ane welfair, it is not proper, it is not figurate, and he ſubjoynes for ane Example, a place out of IOHN. 6. 53. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſayis our Maſter, ȝee eat the fleſhe of the ſonne of Man, and drinke his blood, ȝee haue na life in ȝou: quhereunto AV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GVSTINE adjoynes, this ſpeach ſayis hee, apeares to command a miſchiefe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a figurat ſpeach, quhereby wee are commanded to communicate with the ſufferings of Chriſt Ieſus, and with gladnes to locke vp in perpetuall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that the fleſh of the Lord wes crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and wounded for vs: for vtherwaies it were mair horrible (as this ſame AVGVS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINE, maks mention in the ſecond book agains the aduerſaries of the lawe) to eat the fleſhe of Chriſt Ieſus reallie, then to murther him, and mair horrible, to drink his blood, then to ſhed his blood; ȝit not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, they hauld ay ſtill, on ea tune, and ſayis, that thay words aught to bee tane properlie. Sa that it appeares, that of verie malice, for contradictions cauſe, to the ende onely, that they may gainſtand the truth, they will not ackna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this to be ane ſacramentall ſpeach. For they are compelled, nil they, wil they
<pb facs="tcp:6260:82"/>
in vther ſpeaches of the like ſorte, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ane figure, as GENE. 17. 10. circumciſion is called the couenant: and EXOD. 12. 11. the lambe is called the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouer, and MATH. 20. 28. the cupp is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his blood, and LVKE 22. 20. the cupp is called the newe teſtament, and 1. COR, 10. 4. the rocke is called Chriſt. All thir ſpeaches are ſacramentall, and receauis a kinde of interpretation, ȝit they maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly preas to deny vs this in thir words; (<hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum</hi>) quhilke they are compelled to grant in the reſt, as ſpecialy quhere PAVL cals the rocke Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Nowe quhen they are dung out of this fortres, they flie als vnhappely to the ſecond: to wit, that God bee his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, may mak the body of Chriſt baith to be in heauen, and in the bread baith at ane time: ergo, ſay they, it is ſa. Gif I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied their conſequent, they wald be weil faſhed to proue it: but the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtands not heir, quhither God may do it or not: but the queſtioun ſtands, quhither GOD wil it or not, or may wil it or not. And we ſay reuerently, that his majeſty may not wil it: for ſuppoſe it be true, that he may, mony things quhilk he wil not: ȝit it is as
<pb facs="tcp:6260:83"/>
true; that there is mony things, that hee may not will, of the quhilk ſort, this is: &amp; thir are reduced to twa ſorts. Firſt hee may not will they thinges, that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare to his nature, as to be changeable, as to decay, &amp; ſic vthers. For gif he might will thir things, they ſulde not be argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ane puiſſance, or of ane power, but rather certaine arguments of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie and infirmitie: And therefore ſuppoſe he may not will thir things, hee leaues not of to bee omnipotent: but ſa mekle the rather, his conſtant, and invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible power is knawin. Secondlie God may not wil ſome things, be reaſon of an preſupponed conditioun, as ſick thinges, quher of he hes concluded their contrair of before: of the quhilk ſort, is this, whilk is now controuerted: For ſeing that God hes concluded that all human body, ſuld conſiſt of organicall partes, and therfore to be comprehended, and circumſcriued within ane, and the awin proper place: And als, ſeeing he hes appointed Chriſt Ieſus to haue the like body, and that not for ane time, but eternallie. In reſpect of this determined will, I ſay, God may not will the contrair now, ather to aboliſhe
<pb facs="tcp:6260:83"/>
this bodie quhilk hee hes appointed to be eternall; ather ȝit to make it at ane time, in reſpect of ane thing a bodie and not a bodie, quantified &amp; not quantified, finite and infinite, locall and not locall. For to will thir thinges, quhilk are plaine contradicent in thame ſelfes, hee may not, na mair nor it is posſible to him to will a lie. Swa, it may bee ſeene of al men, that wee preſerue the omnipotencie of God, and with reuerence from our harts, acknawledges him onely, to bee onelie omnipotent, and wils all men to eſteeme thame as calumniators, quha abuſes the ears of the ſimple anes, to perſwade tham the contrair of vs.</p>
               <p>They are not content with this, but they ſay, that the Lord may wil a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and make baith the parts to be true at ane time. And to prooue this, they wald bring in, the miracles quhilk GOD works; as they wald ſay, euery miracle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes a contradiction. As for example: God made a virgine to beare a ſonn, they thinke this warke brings with it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictioun; to beare a ſonne, ſay they, is the ane part of the contradictioun, and to bee a virgine, is the vther pairt of
<pb facs="tcp:6260:84"/>
the contradictioun. This warke is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, but it implies na contradictioun: For concerning the halie virgins birth, therein is na contradiction. There was a miracle indeede, that a Virgin ſuld bear a ſonne contrare to the cours of nature; for to be a virgin, and ȝit to haue a child, are not contradictorie, gif ſhe haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued and brought furth be miracle, as did the bleſſed virgin: but to bee a virgin and not a virgin at ane time, this is the contradictioun. Sa Chriſts bodie to bee viſible and inviſible, locall and not local, at ane time; is in everie reſpect the like contradiction: and therefore imposſible to be true.</p>
               <p>Their vther Example of Chriſts ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in, the doors being cloſed and ſhut, quhat apearance of contradiction hes it? Can they preiue that he entered through the doores? and gif hee did, then there wes ane alteration of qualities, and that be miracle; ather in Chriſts bodie or in the doores, but na contradiction in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: vnles ȝou know not quhat is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. Their third and laſt example of the fier in NABVCADNEZERS Oven, quhilk conſumed the miniſters, but hurt
<pb facs="tcp:6260:84"/>
not thame that were in the middeſt of it; apears to be of na weight, be that quhllk hes already bene anſwered. They imagin as apears, that in every miracle, a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is implied, quhilk is abſurde. Gif they can prooue that this fier wes baith hotte and cold, then they ſay ſome thing to the purpoſe: but that it burns vp ſome and hurts not vthers, is na contradiction; becauſe, bee miracles, the force thereof wes repreſſed. Swa, this ſecond ground halds faſt; God may not will that thing, quhilk implies a contradiction: but ſa it is, that the reall preſence of the bodie of Chriſt in the Sacrament, implies a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictioun; for it makes the bodie of Chriſt, viſible, and inuiſible, compaſt and not compaſt at ea time: therefore, GOD may not will ſick a thing.</p>
               <p>Quhen they are dung out of this, they<note place="margin">Their laſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

nixt, according to Phyſicke, quhilk is the lawe of nature, defends the naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, of the true and naturall bodie of Chriſt Ieſus. Then I grant this, that The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie is not ſubject to Phyſick; quhat of this? Ergo, Chriſts bodie is exemed fra phyſicall rules. How followes that I pray ȝou? Be quhat law may ȝee exeme, or can ȝee exeme the bodie of Chriſte? Bee the law of nature, ȝe cannot: for he was maid of the ſeed of DAVID, and tooke on true fleſh of the wembe of the virgin: And far leſſe, be the law of God: quhilk is Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie: For ȝee knaw, that Chriſt was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed from all eternitie, to take on our nature, and to become true man. Indeed it is true, that the law of God, cannot bee ſubject to the law of nature: For the law of nature, flows of the law of God, as out of the awin ſpring: but it is als true, that gif ȝee exeme Chriſtes bodie, fra the lawe of nature, ȝee ſall exeme it alſo fra the law of God. For I affirme, that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſa conſents with the law of nature; that gif ȝee denie the ane, ȝee ſall denie the vther; and gif ȝee admitte the ane, ȝee ſall admit alſo the vther. Therefore, gif ȝou looke weil about ȝou; ȝee ſall
<pb facs="tcp:6260:85"/>
finde the bauke in ȝour awin eie: for ȝee peruert, baith the law of God, &amp; the lawe of nature, bee ane new inuented phyſicke of ȝour awin: for quhaſoeuer he be, that attributes to ane, and the ſelf ſame body, natural and vnnatural properties, quhilk directlie feights agains thame ſelfs; I ſay, this man peruerts baith true Theologie, and Phyſicke: but ȝee, to ane and the ſelfe ſame bodie of Chriſt Ieſus, attribute naturall and vnnaturall properties: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ȝee that peruerts, baith the vſe of true Theologie, and the ordour ſett downe, and eſtabliſhed in nature. Craue ȝee the reaſon of my propoſition? I ſay, it behooues als weill in Theologie, as in Phyſicke of necesſitie, ane of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicent enunciations to be falſe. But ains to make ane end with ȝou; we ſal anſwer to ȝour laſt ſubterfuge.</p>
               <p>For ſa ȝee reaſon; a glorified bodie, is not ſubject to phyſicall rules; but Chriſts bodie is glorified: therefore it is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to phyſicall rules. Firſt of all, or wee anſwer directly, we man conſider, quher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſtands the glorification of ane bodie: &amp; then, I ſay, the anſwere ſall be eaſie: the Apoſtle PAVL, 1. COR. 15. 42. ſpeakes ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:6260:86"/>
this maner. Sa alſo, ſayis he, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead. The body is ſawen in corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; is raiſed in incorruption; It is ſawin in diſhonor, &amp; is raiſed in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: It is ſawin in weaknes, and is raiſed in power. And a litle efter; this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mann put on incorruption, and this mortality, mann put on immortalitie. Be this cleare Antitheſis, PAVLE clearlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriues, the glorification of ane bodie: for hee oppones thir twa; the vnglorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and the glorified bodie: And to the vnglorified body, he aſcriues corruption, ignominie, infirmitie, carnallitie, &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie. To the glorified bodie againe, he attributes incorruptioun, glorie, power, ſpiritualitie, and immortalitie. Of this oppoſition, wee may gather eaſilie, quhat the reſurrection &amp; glorification apports to the bodie. Shortly, bee thame we ſee, that the body is onely ſpoiled of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioun, ſhame, infirmitie, naturalitie, and mortalitie: And to take vp all in an word, it becomes, onely ſpoyled of all the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of our nature; that it may be cled, with ane mair glorious apparrell; as with incorruption, power, glorie, ſpiritualitie, and immortalitie. Wee ſee then that this
<pb facs="tcp:6260:86"/>
glorification imports ane change indeed; but I beleue na man will be ſa mad, as to eſteme this change to be made in the ſub ſtance: for gif ſa wer, the aulde ſubſtance behoued to decay, and ane newe ſulde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe: but wee hear na worde of ſic things in this deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; as litle is the change made, in the quantitie: for wee hear na word, nather of augmentatioun, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of any ſubſtance, quhilk beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be, gif it were in the quantitie. The fardeſt that wee can perſaue; this muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioun conſiſts in the qualities, bee the quhilk, the bodie caſts of the auld coate of infirmitie, and cleathes it ſelfe, with the coate of Glorie: For Chriſt efter hee rais, he baith gaide and come, wes ſeene and twitched. Of the things before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, it clearlie followes, that in reſpect the glorie of the bodie of Chriſt, hes wrought na change in his nature &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and conſequently, in his naturall dimenſions; nather ȝit in any vther eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall propertie: that therefore the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatioun of his bodie, exemes it not fra the rules of phyſicke. For ſa lang as the nature of ane true bodie remaines, there is na ſupernaturall gifts, quherewith it
<pb facs="tcp:6260:87"/>
may be glorified; war they neuer ſa high, ſa farre as may bee gathered of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of GOD, that may hurt, ather the nature, or the natural propertie of it. For ther is na gift nor qualitie, that may hurt natur, but that gift that is agains nature: but the ſupernaturall gift, is nather vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, nather ȝit agains nature: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot hurt nor impaire nature. And my reaſoun is this: They gifts, that decores and beautifies nature, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt nor impair nature: but al ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall gifts, beautifies and decores na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Therefore they cannot take away, nather nature, nor ȝit, the naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie.</p>
               <p>They leaue vs not ſa, but out of this ſame doctrine of PAVLE, concerning the glorification of the bodie, they draw ane objection, to preaſe vs. PAVL grants, that ane glorified bodie, is ane ſpirituall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: but ane ſpirituall bodie, is ane inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bodie: therefore ane glorified bodie, is inuiſible; and bee the conſequent, the bodie of Chriſt is inuiſible. Suppoſe the argument bee not formall; ȝit to make ſhort, I denie ȝour aſſumption: For gif there were na mair, but that ſame worde
<pb facs="tcp:6260:87"/>
                  <hi>bodie,</hi> that word might be ane argument to ȝou, that the ſpirituall bodie is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible. But ȝit, to open vpp the matter mair clearlie, according to the minde of PAVL in that place. PAVLE in ane word, as it were, in the 44. verſe of that ſame Chap. ſhewes the change that ſal become in the qualities of the body, be the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: For he ſayis of ane naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, it ſall become ane ſpirituall bodie. He ſtraight way in the nixt verſe, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatlie following, expones thir twa qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities: for in the 45. verſe, that is called an natural bodie, ſays he, quhilk is maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and quickned, be an liuing ſaul only; ſic as Adams was: and againe, that is ſaid to bee ane ſpirituall bodie, quhilke togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, beſide the ſaul, is quickned with ane farre mair excellent vertue, to witt; with the ſpirite of God, quhilk deſcended fra Chriſt, the ſecond Adam vnto vs. Then according to this ground, I anſwere with AVGVSTINE <hi>ad Conſtantium:</hi> As the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall bodie is not ane ſaull, but ane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; euen ſa, the ſpiritual bodie, is not ſaid to be a ſaull, but ane bodie; and bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, it is not inuiſible.</p>
               <p>But to take vpp this head, I ſall giue
<pb facs="tcp:6260:88"/>
thame onelie ane knot to looſe, and ſa make an end of this point. Then I reaſon, gif therefore Chriſts bodie is naturallie and really in the Supper, be reaſon that it is glorified, it follows conſequentlie, that quhen it was not glorified, it culd not be reallie preſent: but it wes not glorified quhen this Supper wes firſt inſtituted: therefore it wes not reallie preſent in the bread, at Chriſts firſt ſupper. Gif his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy wes not naturally preſent in the bred at the firſt Supper, it cannot be naturally preſent nowe: For quhatſoeuer ȝee vſe nowe in the adminiſtration of ȝour Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or of ȝour Meſſe, call it as ȝe will, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ȝour awin confesſioun, ȝe vſe it according to the ordinance, forme and maner, that Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe vſed in his firſt Supper: For ȝee ſay plainelie in ȝour diſputatioun at POYSSIE<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, and in all the reſt of ȝour workes; That Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus firſt of all obſerued that form, quhilk ȝee vſe in ȝour Meſſe, and left it to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and to their ſucceſſors, that they ſulde doe the like: and ſa bee ȝour awin words, ȝee haue drawne ȝour ſelfes in a Hoſe-net, &amp; crucified ȝour Meſſe. Quhat can ȝe anſwere to this? Ȝe will not ſtande
<pb facs="tcp:6260:88"/>
dumbe I am aſſured; for maintenance of ȝour religion, ȝee man ſay ſomthing: for gif this reaſon bear it away, ȝe haue done with it.</p>
               <p>Then wee ſay, quod the Papiſtes, that ſuppoſe the bodie of Chriſt, quhilk wes locallie preſent with the reſt of his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples wes not glorified, ȝit the bodie quhilk he exhibite in the bread wes glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. Ȝee might as weill haue halden ȝour peace, and ſaide nathing: For take tent to the wordes of the text, as they are written. Luk. 22. 19. quhere it is ſaide, &amp; hee toke the bread, and quhen he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thanks, hee brake it, &amp; gaue to them ſaying, this is my bodie quhilke is giuen for ȝou, and PAVL. 1. COR. 11. 24. hes thir wordes, <hi>Take, eate: This is my bodye, quhilke is broken for ȝou.</hi> This relatiue quhilk, is relatiue to the bodie, quhilke wes exhibited in the bred: for according to ȝour awin confesſion, they words are pronounced vpon the bread, &amp; directed to it. But that ſame bodie wes giuen and broken for vs, that is to ſay, crucified and demayned with anguiſh &amp; dolors. Then I reaſon efter this ſorte. To be crucified and broken with anguiſhe and dolours,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:89"/>
can on na waies agree and conueine with a glorified bodie: but the bodie that Chriſt exhibite in the bread, is ſayd of the Evangeliſts, to be crucified and broken for vs: Ergo, that bodie wes not glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Now laſt of all, they are not ȝit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but ſayis, Chriſt can make the bread his body, and therfore his bodie is really preſent. That Chriſt can make the bread his bodie, wee grant: for Chriſt beeing God, can do quhatſoeuer hee will: One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie let them ſhewe, that Chriſt will make of reall bread, his reall fleſhe, and then this controuerſie is brought to ane end. Chriſt indeed makes the bread his body, not reallie, but ſacramentallie: For Chriſt hes not a bodie made of bread, his body wes made ains of the pure ſubſtance of his bleſſed Mother: ane vther bodie then this, or oftener made then ains, hes hee nane: quherefore all doctrine that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Chriſts bodie to be made of bread, is impious, and hereticall: The Papiſts doctrine of reall preſence teaches, that Chriſts bodie in the Sacrament is made of bread, bee changing the bread into his bodie, through force of conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb facs="tcp:6260:89"/>
quherefore wee may bauldlie &amp; true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie conclude, that their doctrine of reall preſence, is baith wicked and hereticall. Now in concluſion of this head, I beſeke thame, ſeeing that reaſoun failes thame, that they fight not agains God, for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a lie, how auld that ever it be, (for the Diuell is auld aneugh, and ȝit he coulde neuer change his nature) but lat thame rather glorifie God, in confesſing thir ſpeaches to be ſacramentall.</p>
               <p>Then quhat is the reaſon and ground,<note place="margin">The reaſon that moues the Papiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The reſon is this, becauſe they cannot ſee be their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall judgement, nor cannot vnderſtand be their natural wit, the trueth of this, to wit, how Chriſtes fleſh and blood can be preſent in the Sacrament, except hee bee preſent to their corporall hand, to their corporall mouth and ſtomach. Gif they had an light to inform them, that Chriſt might be preſent in the Supper, and not to the hande, to the mouth or ſtomach: they walde neuer haue thought of ſick a
<pb facs="tcp:6260:90"/>
monſtrous preſence, as they compt to be there: but being deſtitute of the ſpiritual light, they followe their naturall reaſons and maks a naturall and carnall preſens. Swa that ȝee haue this leſſoun to note of<note place="margin">obſeruation</note> this: There is na man that hes not the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rit of God to vnderſtande this word: <hi>this is my bodie,</hi> but out of queſtion, he will doe as the Papiſtes does; that is, he will vnderſtande it carnally: and ſa they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing the right meaning of it, it is na maruell, ſuppoſe they and wee differ in this mater.</p>
               <p>For will ȝee ſpeare at the Papiſt firſt,<note place="margin">The diuerſe opinions concerning the preſence of the bodie of Chriſt in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> gif the true bodie of Chriſt be there, or gif the true fleſhe and blood of Chriſt be there: he wil ſay, it is there.

Will ȝee ſpeare againe at him, be quhat inſtrument it is receaued? he will tell ȝou be the mouth and ſtomach of the bodie: ſa this is their gros vnderſtanding of the bodie and blood of Chriſt. Will ȝe ſpeare at the VBIQVITER, gif the true bodie of Chriſt be preſent? he will ſay it is. Will ȝe ſpear gif it be in, with, or vnder the bred?
<pb facs="tcp:6260:90"/>
hee will anſwere, it is in the bread, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuè,</hi> that is, that the bread conteines it. Wil ȝee ſpeare at him, to quhat inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is offered? hee will anſwere, that the bodie of Chriſt, is offered to the mouth of our bodie, and that the blood of Chriſt is offered to the mouth of our bodie, as the Papiſts dois. Will ȝe ſpeare at vs again, how Chriſt Ieſus his true bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and<note place="margin">Our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> blood is preſent? wee wil ſay, that they are ſpirituallie preſent, reallie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente, that is preſente in the Supper, and not in the bread: we will not ſay, that his true fleſhe is preſent to the hande, or to the mouth of our bodie, but wee ſay, it is ſpirituallie preſent, that is, preſent to thy ſpirit and faithfull ſaull; Ȝea even als pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inwardlie to thy ſaull, as the bread and wine, are preſent to thy bodie out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardelie. Wil ȝe ſpeere then, gif the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and blood of Chriſt Ieſus bee preſent in the Supper? Wee anſwere in a word, they are preſent in the Supper: but not in the bread and wine, nor in the accidents nor ſubſtance of bread and wine: And we make Chriſt to be preſent in the Supper, becauſe he is preſent to my ſaull, to my ſpirit and faith. Alſwa, we make him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb facs="tcp:6260:91"/>
in the Supper; becauſe I haue him in his promeis, <hi>This is my body,</hi> quhilke promeis is preſent to my faith, and the nature of faith, is to make thinges that are abſente in thame ſelues ȝit preſent: And therefore, ſeeing he is baith preſent be fayth in his promeis, and preſent bee the vertue of his halie ſpirit, quha can ſay but hee is preſent in the Supper.</p>
               <p>But ȝit the word wald bee opened vp, quhat wee mean bee the worde preſent,<note place="margin">How a thing is ſaid to be preſent and abſent.</note> howe a thing is ſayde to bee preſent and abſent? And knowing this, ȝee ſall finde all the matter eaſie. I ſaye, thinges are ſaide to bee preſent, as they are percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued bee ony outwarde or inwarde ſenſe, and as they are perceaued bee ony of the ſenſes; ſa are they preſent, and the farther they bee perceaued, the farther preſent; and be quhat ſenſe ony thing is perceaued, to that ſame ſens it is preſent. As gif it be outwardlie perceaued, be ane outward ſenſe; that thing is outwardlie preſent. As for example, gif it bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued bee the outward ſight of the eie, be the outward hearing of the ear, be the outwarde feeling of the hand, or taiſt of the mouth; it is outwardlie preſent: Or
<pb facs="tcp:6260:91"/>
gif ony thing be perceiued be the inward eie, be the inward taiſt and feeling of the ſaull; this thing cannot bee outwardlye preſent: but it mann be ſpirituallie, and inwardly preſent to the ſaull. Sa I ſay, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie thing is preſent, as it is perceaued. Sa that gif ȝee perceaue not a thing out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlie, it is outwardlie abſent; and giff ȝe perceaue not a thing inwardlie, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlie abſent. It is not diſtance of place that maks a thing abſent, nor propinqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of place, that makes a thing preſent: but it is only the perception of ony thing be ony of thy ſenſes, that makes a thing preſent, &amp; the not perception, that maks a thing abſent. I ſay; ſuppoſe the thing it ſelfe, were neuer ſa farre diſtant, gif thou perceaue it bee thine outward ſenſe, it is preſent to thee. As for example, my body and the Sunn, are als far diſtant in place, as the heauen is fra the earth; and ȝit this diſtaunce ſtaies not his preſens to mee: Quhy? Becauſe I perceaue the Sunne be mine eie and vther ſenſes; I feele him and perceaue him bee his heat, bee his light, and bee his brightnes: Swa, gif a thing were neuer ſa far diſtant, gif we haue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to perceaue the ſame, it is preſent to
<pb facs="tcp:6260:92"/>
vs. Then the diſtance of place makes not a thing abſent to thee, &amp; thou haue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to perceaue it. Siclike, the propinqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of place makes not a thing preſent, &amp; it were neuer ſa near, gif thou haue not ſenſes to perceaue it. As for example, gif the ſunne ſhine in thy verie eine holes, gif thou bee blinde, hee is not preſent to thee, becauſe thou cannot perceaue him. A ſweete tune will neuer bee preſent to ane deafe ear, ſuppoſe it bee ſung in the eare of that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becaus he hes not a ſens to perceaue it: And a weill tauld tale will neuer be preſent to a foole, becauſe hee cannot vnderſtand it, nor hes not judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to perccaue it. Swa, it is not the neernes, northe diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of place that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kis any thing preſent or abſent, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the perceauing, and not perceauing of it.</p>
               <p>Nowe the worde being made cleire, ſpeere ȝee howe the bodie of Chriſt is<note place="margin">How the bodie of Chriſt is preſent.</note> preſent? To giue our judgement in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word, as ȝee haue hard fra time to time, he is preſent, not to the outward ſenſes, but to the inwarde ſenſes, quhilk is faith, wrought in the ſaull. For this actioun of the Sacrament and of the Supper, is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb facs="tcp:6260:92"/>
corporall, and partelie ſpirituall. I call this actioun partely corporall, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect only, that the objects, that is, that bread and wine are corporall: but alſo in reſpect my mouth, quhervnto thir things are offered; the inſtrument quherby, and the maner how thir things are receaued, are al corporall &amp; natural. I call the ſame action againe, partlie ſpirituall; not only, in reſpect of Chriſt Ieſus, quha is the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie and ſpirituall thing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; but alſo in reſpect of my ſaul, quher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto Chriſt is offred and giuen: in reſpect the inſtrument quhereby, and the maner how he is receaued, are all ſpirituall: For I gett not Chriſt corporallye, but ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuallie. Swa, in thir reſpects, I call this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, partlie corporall, and partlie ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</p>
               <p>Now confound me not thir twa ſorts of actions, the corporall and naturall ſigns, with the ſpiritual thing, ſignified therby: Confound not againe, the mouth of the bodie, with the mouth of the ſaull: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found not thirdlie, the outward manner of receauing bee the hand of the bodie, with the ſpirituall maner of receauing, be the hand of the ſaull. And ſa it ſall be
<pb facs="tcp:6260:93"/>
exceeding cleare to ſee, that ilke thing ſal be preſent to the awn inſtrument, that is; the bodie of Chriſt, quhilk is the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall thing ſignified, ſall be preſent to the ſpirituall mouth and hand; and the bread and wine, quhilk are the corporal ſignes, are preſent to the corporall mouth and hand. Then howe is any object preſent? A corporal object, is corporallie preſent, and ane inwarde object, is inwardly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Of quhat nature is the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? It is of ane heauenlie nature. Then ſpeare ȝe, how he is preſent? He is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuallie and heauenlie preſent to thy ſaull, &amp; the mouth of thy ſaul; quhilk is faith. For it were a prepoſterous thing, to mak the thing ſignified preſent to thy bellie, or to the mouth or eie of thy body; for gif ſa were, it ſuld not be ſpirituallie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Becauſe euery thing is preſent, as it accords to the awin nature: Is it a bodily thing, it is bodilie preſent, and gif it be a heauenlie thing, it is ſpirituallie preſent. Sa I thinke, na man can doubt, how the bodie of Chriſt is preſent; hee is not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie preſent, but ſpirituallie preſent to my ſaull, and to faith in my ſaull. This far concerning the manner of his preſence.</p>

For I ſall prooue it clearly be three arguments, tane out of the Scriptures, that the words aught not to be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the bread, but to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God.</p>
               <p>And firſt I ſay, the promiſes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and grace, aught to bee directed and pronounced to thame, in quhome the Lord performes thame, and makes tham effectuall. But ſa it is, that the promiſes
<pb facs="tcp:6260:94"/>
of mercy and grace, are performed and made effectuall, not in bread and wine, but in faithfull men and women: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thir promiſes ſuld bee directed to faithfull men and women. Now heere is the promiſe of mercie &amp; grace. <hi>This is my bodie, quhilk is broken for Ȝou.</hi> And this promiſe, is made to na vther thing, but to faithfull men and women; and ſa to tham onely, it aught to be directed. Secondly, we haue to conſider, that this ſacrament, ſeales vp a couenant of grace and mercy. Now quhom with makes God his coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of mercie and grace? Will he make a couenaunt with a peece bread, or anie dumb element? There is na man will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a couenant with his ſeruant: lat be to enter in a couenant with a dumbe ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Sa in reſpect, this Sacrament ſeals vp a couenant; this couenaunt of necesſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, man be knit vp with ane faithfull ſaul, and not with the dumbe element: and therefore, thir words cannot be directed to the elements. Thirdlie, looke to the end, quherefore this Sacrament was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: Is it not to lead vs to Chriſt? Is it not to nuriſh my faith in Chriſt? Is it not to nuriſh mee in ane conſtant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſioun
<pb facs="tcp:6260:94"/>
of the Lordes mercie in Chriſt? Was this Sacrament appointed to make the elements Gods? Na: For will ȝee marke Gods purpoſe in this inſtitution; ȝe will find, that Chriſt hes not ſet down his inſtitution, to nobilitat the elements, to fauor and reſpect the elements, quhilk were bread and wine ȝiſterday, to bee Gods to day. Wee on the contrair, ſayis plainelie, that the inſtitutioun of Chriſt, lookes not to the elements, to alter their nature. Indeed, it is appointed to alter vs, to chaunge vs, and to make vs mair and mair ſpirituall, and to ſanctifie the elements to our vſe. But the ſpecial end, looks to this; to make vs halie, and mair and mair to growe vpp in a ſure faith in Chriſt, &amp; not to alter the elements, nor to make thame Gods. And therefore, be all thir three argumentes, it is euident, that the words, aught not to bee directed to the elements, but to the people &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full communicants.</p>
               <p>Now to make an end of this, there is<note place="margin">Concluſion with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</note> ane thing, without the quhilk, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not profit; lat vs diſcourſe neuer ſa lang, vppon the right vnderſtanding of the Sacrament. Ȝee ſee nowe, all that is
<pb facs="tcp:6260:95"/>
ſpoken, concerning the Sacrament, is grounded and depended vppon fayth: Haue a man faith, albeit it were neuer ſa ſmall, hee getts ſome grippe of Chriſt, and ſome inſight in the vnderſtanding of this Sacrament: but lacking faith, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man paine him ſelfe, to make the Sacraments neuer ſa ſenſible, it is not posſible, that hee cann gette a grippe of Chriſte, or onie inſight in him: For without faith, wee can not bee Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; wee can nather get a ſight of God, nor feele God in Chriſt, without faith. Faith is the onelie thing, that tranſlates our ſaules out of that death and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, quhereintill wee were conceaued and borne, and plants vs into life. Swa the haill ſtudie and indeuour of a chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſulde tend to this. To craue that the Lorde in his mercie walde illuminat his minde, with the eie of fayth, and walde kendle in his heart a loue of fayth, and worke in his hart, a thirſt and deſire of the object of fayth, and mair and mair to thirſt and hunger, for the food of fayth, that nuriſhes vs to life eternall.</p>
               <p>Without this fayth, (howſoeuer the naturall man, and vnderſtanding natural
<pb facs="tcp:6260:95"/>
wald flatter thy ſelfe,) ſurely there is na bleſſednes, but all his life is mair nor ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible miſerie. For quhatſoeuer it be that flatters and pleaſes thee nowe, bee it a thought or motioun of the minde, or an action of the bodie, that pleaſes the now without fayth: the ſame verie motioun cogitatioun, and actioun, ſall torment thee efter this: Swa without faith, it is not posſible to pleaſe GOD: and quhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer pleaſes not GOD, is doone to torment thee. Therefore craue mercie, for quhatſoeuer motioun, cogitatioun, or actioun, quherein thou hes offended GOD, or bee that ſame, GOD ſall offend and torment thee: And to eſchew the offence of God, there is na moyane, but be true faith. Therefore the ſtudy of a Chriſtian ſuld be, to grow in faith. Now bee hearing of the woorde, thou gets faith, and bee receauing of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thou getts the increaſe of fayth: and hauing faith, the receauing of the Sacrament ſall bee fruitfull: But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, thou eats thine awin condem. nation. Sa, the haill ſtudie of ane Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, is to get faith; and this faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obtained with idlenes, but be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
<pb facs="tcp:6260:96"/>
praier: Therefore lat euery ane of ȝou, fall downe, and craue earneſtlie this faith, and the increaſe of it, quhereby, ȝe may bee worthie receauers of this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that for the righteous merits of Chriſt Ieſus: To quhome with the Father, and the haly Spirit: be al honour, praiſe, and glory, for now and euer.</p>

(For no man can heare the word of God frutfully, except in ſom meaſure hee prepare his ſaule, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the eare of his heart how to hear.) Therefore the doctrine of preparation &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:6260:97"/>
dew examination mann come in the awn place, and be very neceſſare for euery ane of ȝou. The Apoſtle in the wordes that wee haue redd, interponis his counſaile, and giues his aduiſe: and not only giues his aduiſe, bot giues his admonition and command, that we ſuld not come to the Table of the Lord, that we ſuld not cum to the hearing of the worde raſhlie; but that euerie ane of vs, ſulde come to this holy work with reuerence, that we ſulde prepare, and ſanctifie our ſelues in ſome meaſure: and ſeing we go vnto the King of heauens Table, it becomes vs to put on our beſt aray: and in ane word, he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kis vp the haill doctrine &amp; matter of this preparation, quhill as he ſayis: Let euery man, and let euery woman trye and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them ſelues, as gif he would ſay: let euery ane of ȝou trye and examine ȝour ſaules, that is, try the eſtait of ȝour awin hart, and condition of ȝour awne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Look and beholde in quhat eſtaite ȝour hart is with God, and in what eſtate ȝour conſcience is with ȝour neighbour. He bids not ȝour neighbour try ȝou, hee bids not ȝour companion try ȝour hart: but he bids ȝour ſelfe in perſon, try ȝour
<pb facs="tcp:6260:97"/>
awin conſcience, hee bidds ȝour ſelf trye ȝour awin hart, by reaſon nane ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the eſtait of ȝour hart, or of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition of ȝour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, but ȝour ſelf. Now he ſecludis not vthers from the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of ȝou neither, (for it is leiſum to the Paſtour to try ȝou) but others can nocht try ȝou ſa narrowlie, as ȝe ȝour ſelf can. For na man can know ſa mekill of me, as I knaw of my ſelf: na man can be certain of the eſtait of ȝour heart, and condition of ȝour conſcience, and ȝit ȝe ȝour ſelfis may be certaine of it. As to others, men may judge of ȝour heart and conſcience, according to ȝour works and effects, and except ȝour workes and effectes, be very wicked, and altogether vitious; wee are bound in our conſcience, to judge chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablie of ȝour hart &amp; conſcience. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is nane ſa meet to try the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of a man, to try the harte or conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a man, as is the man himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Nowe that this tryall may goe on the<note place="margin">The heades to be intrea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted in this ſermon.</note> better fauoredlie, ȝe haue firſt to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, quhat it is that ȝe ſuld try, quhat ȝee call a conſcience, quhilk the Apoſtle<note place="margin">1.</note> commandes ȝou to trye. Secondly, ȝee haue to wey and conſidder, for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons<note place="margin">2.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:6260:98"/>
and cauſes ſuld ȝee try ȝour conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Thridly and laſt of all, ȝee haue to ſee in what chief points, ȝe ſuld trye and examine ȝour conſcience. Then that we ſpeake not to ȝou of things vnknawne, it is neceſſare for euerye ane of ȝou (ſeeing there is nane of ȝou that lakes a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) to vnderſtand what a conſcience is; and ſo nearely as God ſhall giue mee the grace, I will bring ȝou to the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and knawledge of a conſcience. I<note place="margin">Definition of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with the expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the partis thair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> call a conſcience, a certain feeling in the hart, reſembling the judgement of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, following vpon ane deede done be vs, flowing from ane knawledge in the minde, accompanied with ane cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine motion in the hart, to wit; feare or joy, trembling or rejoyſing. Nowe wee ſhall examine the parts of this definition I call it firſt of all, ane certaine feeling in the hart: for the Lord hes left ſic a ſtamp in the hart of euery man, that he doeth not that turne ſo ſecretlie, nor ſo quietly but hee makes his owne heart to ſtrike him, and to ſmite him: hee makes him to feill in his owne hart, whether hee hes doone weill or ill. The Lorde hes placed this feeling in the hart; quhy? becaus the
<pb facs="tcp:6260:98"/>
eyes of God lookes not ſa mekill vpon the outward countenance and exteriour behauiour, as vpon the inward hart. For he ſaith to SAMVEL, in his firſt book 16. 7. verſe, The Lord behaldes the hart. Sic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like 1. CHRON. 28. 9. hee ſaieth to SALO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON: The Lord ſearcheth all harts, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandes al imaginations of thoughts. Alſo IEREMIE, 11. 20. ſayes, the Lorde tryes the reines and the hart. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle 1. COR. 4. 5. he ſayes, The Lorde ſhall lighten things that are hid in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and make the counſels of the hart manifeſt. Sa, in reſpect the Lorde makes him chieflie, to haif to do with the harte; therefore in the harte he places this fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, quhilk is the chiefe parte of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I ſay nixt, that this feeling reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the judgement of God; for this fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was left and placed in our ſaule, for this end &amp; purpoſe, that we might haue as domeſticke and familiar judgement within our ſelfes, to ſubſcriue and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the ſecreete and inuiſible judgement of the high God; a particular judgement to go before that generall judgement, in that generall and great day, quhere eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man ſall bee juſtified or damned, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb facs="tcp:6260:99"/>
to the particular judgement, that is within his awne conſcience. In the meane time, this conſcience is left in vs, to make out our hail proces in this life, to halde in the trauels of the liuing God, as it were, in that laſt judgement. For the bookes of our owne conſcience in that laſt day ſalbe opened, and euerye man ſall receaue according to the report of the decreet, that is within his awne conſcience; therefore I ſay, that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience reſembles the judgment of God. The third thing that I ſay, is this; It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows vpon an deed doon be vs, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, nor our heart ſtrykes vs not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the deede be done. Our hart ſtrikes vs not before the euill turne be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: na, it goes not before the deede, but the ſtraik of the conſcience, and feeling of the heart, followis immediatly vpon the deed, in ſick ſorte, that the deede is not ſo ſoone doone be thee, but thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience applyis it to thy ſelfe, and giues out the ſentence againſt thy ſelfe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaye, it is a feeling following vpon ane deede done be vs. And nixt I ſaye, flowing fra ane knawledge in the minde, for except the conſcience haue informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:99"/>
and except the hart knaw that the turne quhilk is done is euil, the hart, nor the conſcience, can neuer count it to bee euill. Therefore knawledge muſt go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſtraik of the conſcience. Thy hart can neuer feele that to be euil, quhilk thy mynde knawis not to be euill. So knaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge muſt euer go before feeling, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meſure of thy knawledge, according to the nature and qualitie of thy knawledge, accordinglie ſall the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie and ſtraik of thy conſcience be. For a light knawledge, a doubting and vncertaine knawledge, makis ane light &amp; ſmall ſtraik: as in the other part, ane haly and a ſolide knawledge drawin out of the worde of God, makis ane heauie ſtraike of the conſcience: Sa the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence mann anſwere to the knawledge. If wee haue na other knawledge, but the knawledge quhilk we haue by nature, &amp; be the light and ſpoonkes that are left in nature, our conſcience will anſwere na farder, but to that knowledge. But if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the light of nature, we haue a knaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in his worde, and a knaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God by his holie ſpirit working in our harts, our conſcience then will go
<pb facs="tcp:6260:100"/>
farder, &amp; excuſe, or accuſe vs; according to the light that is in the worde: Sa that the conſcience is not acquired or obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, at quhat time wee are enlightened bee the working of the halie Spirite, and hearing of the worde of God; but our conſcience is borne with vs, is natural to vs, &amp; is left in the ſaule of euery man &amp; woman: and as there are ſome ſpunkes of light left in nature; ſa there is an con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience left in it. And gif there were na mair, that ſame light that is lefte in thy nature, ſal be aneugh to condemne thee. Sa the conſcience is not acquired, gotten or begun at the hearing of the worde, or at that time quhen we begin to reforme our ſelfes, be the aſsiſtance and renewing of the halie Spirite: bot euerie man bee nature hes a conſcience, and the Lorde hes left it in our nature: and except that this conſcience bee reformed according to the worde of God, that ſame naturall conſcience ſall be aneugh to condemne thee eternallie. Therefore I ſay, flowing from a knawledge of the minde. Laſt of all, I ſaye, accompanied with a certaine motion of the hart: and we expreſſe this motion, in feare or joy, trembling or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing.
<pb facs="tcp:6260:100"/>
In very great feare gif the deed be exceeding heynous, and the ſtraik of the conſcience be very heauie: Than the conſcience takis neuer reſt, for guiltines mann euer dreed. Bot gif the deede bee honeſte, godlie, and commendable, it makis a blyth hart, and makis the harte to burſt out in joy. Sa to be ſhort in this matter, (for I purpoſe not to make ane common place of it) ȝe ſee that in euery conſcience there mann bee twa thinges: Firſt, there mann be ane knawledge, and nixt there mann be ane feeling, quherby according to thy knawledge, thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyis to thy awin hart the deede doone be thee. Sa that, according as the word it ſelfe teſtifyes, it ryſes of twa partis, it ryſes of knawledge, according to the quhilke it is called ſcience: and it ryſes of feeling, according to the quhilk the CON is put to, &amp; it is called conſcience. Then the woorde Conſcience ſignifyes knawledge with application.</p>
               <p>This conſcience the Lord hes appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">To quhat vſes the Lord hes appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to ſerue in the ſaull of man.</note> to ſerue in the ſaull of man, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie vſes: to wit, he hes appointed euerie ane of ȝour conſciencis to be ane keeper a waiter-on, and a careful attender vpon
<pb facs="tcp:6260:101"/>
euerie action doone by ȝou: ſo that that action can not be ſo ſecreetlie, ſo quietly,<note place="margin">1.</note> nor ſo thifteouſly convoied, but nil thou, will thou, thy conſcience ſall beare ane teſtimonie of it: thy conſcience ſall bee ane faithfull obſeruer of it, and a day ſal be ane faithful recorder of that ſame acti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on: So the Lord hes appointed thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to this office, that it attends and waits vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee in al thy actions, na thing can ſlip it. Sicklike the Lord hes appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy<note place="margin">2.</note> conſcience and placed it in thy ſaull, to bee ane accuſer of thee: ſo that quhen thou dois ane euill turne, thou hes ane domeſtick accuſer within thy awin ſaull to finde faulte with it. Hee hes alſo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced<note place="margin">3.</note> it in thy ſaull, to beare ane true and ſtedfaſt witnes againſt thee: ȝea, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the conſcience reſembles not onlie a teſtimonye or witnes, but the conſcience is als good, as ten thouſande witneſsis. The conſcience alſo is lefte in<note place="margin">4.</note> the ſaull, to do the parte of ane judge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, to giue out ſentence againſt thee, and to condemne thee; and ſo it dois<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for our particular judgement mann ga before the generall and vniuerſall judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Lord, at that great day.
<pb facs="tcp:6260:101"/>
And quhat mair? He hes left thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence within thee, to put thy awin ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in execution againſt thy ſelfe: This is terrible: he hes left it within thee to be ane verye torture, and a burriour to thy ſelfe: and ſa to put thy awin ſentence in executioun vpon thy ſelfe. Is not this an matter mair nor woonderfull, that ane and the ſelfe ſame conſcience, ſall ſerue to ſa manie vſes in ane ſaule, as to be ane continuall obſeruer, and marker of thy actions: ane accuſer, ten thouſande wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſsis, a judge, and a burriour and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentour, to execute thy awin ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy ſelf. Sa that the Lord miſters neuer to ſeeke a member of court out of thy awin ſaule, to make out a lawful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt thee: but thou ſall haue all thir within thy ſelfe, to make out a full proces againſt thy ſelfe. Take heede to this, for there is neuer a word of this that ſall fall to the ground, bot ather ȝee ſall feill it to ȝour weill, or to ȝour euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting woe. And this ſecreet and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler judgement, that euery ane of ȝou ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries about with ȝou; bydis ſa ſure and ſa faſt within ȝou, that doe quhat ȝe cann, gif ȝe wald imploy ȝour hail trauellis, to

I graunt thou maye blot out all knawledge out of thy minde, and make thy ſelfe to becom als blinde as a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wart: I grant alſo, that thou may harden thy hart ſa, that thou wil blot out al fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of it, ſa that thy conſcience will not accuſe thee, nor finde faulte with thee, but thou ſall haue ane delite in ill dooing, without a remorſe: but I denye that ony gree of wickednes in the earth, ſall bring thee to that pointe, that thou may doe euill without feare: but ay the mair that thou dois euill, and the langer that thou continewis in euill dooing, thy feare ſall be the greater: ȝea, in deſpyte of the deuill, and in deſpite of all the ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lice of the hart of man, that feare ſall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine: And ſuppoſe they walde baith conſpire together, it ſall not bee able to

Sa that, gif thy conſcience was a burriour to thee, in the time of thy death, gif thou gat it not pacified, in the time of thy death, it ſall be a burriour to torment thee in that general iudgement.

               <p>The ſecond thing that wee haue to ſpeake off, is this; we haue to try &amp; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, wherfore we ſuld examin our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for what cauſes ſuld a man or woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bee mooued to try thair awin conſcience and ſaull: I ſall take vp the reaſons ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. It becomes euery ane of ȝou, to trie ȝour conſcience; quhy? Becauſe the Lord will make his reſidence in na vther pairt
<pb facs="tcp:6260:104"/>
of the ſaull, but in the conſcience: he hes appointed his dwelling to be in the hart of man, and into the will and conſcience of man: and therefore, it becomes ȝou, to make his dwelling place cleane, and to take heede to ȝour heart. Nixt, ſuppoſe the Lorde of heauen made not reſidence there; ȝit, in reſpect the eie of God is ane all-ſeeing eie, and able to pearce thorow the very thicknes of the fleſh of man, how darke and groſſe ſoeuer it be, &amp; to pearce thorow the very ſecret hirnes of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience (for vnto the al-ſeeing eie of God, the maiſt ſecreet hirne of the conſcience, is als patent, cleare and manifeſt; as onie outwarde, or bodilie thing in the earth can bee to the outward eie of the bodie.) In reſpect therefore, that his eie is ſa per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and that he caſts his eie onely vpon our heart; it becomes vs to try our harts.

Becauſe the welfare and health of thy ſaull, dependes vpon thy conſcience; gif thy conſcience that is within thy ſaull be weil, gif it be at peace and reſt, thy ſaul is weill; gif thy conſcience be in an good eſtait, thy ſaull mann bee in ane good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtait; gif thy conſcience be in good helth; of necesſitie, thy ſaull mann bee in good health: For the good health and weill of the ſaull, depends vpon ane good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Therefore it becomes euerie ane of ȝou, to try weill ȝour conſcience. There is not a law that ever was ſet down or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed; but of all the lawes that euer was made, it is leifsom to vs, to haue a care of our health, it is leifsome to vs, to ſeeke ſic things as may procure our helth, preſerue &amp; entertain our helth; Now ſubſume: but the helth of thy ſaull, ſtands in the health of thy conſcience, &amp; in preſeruiug there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Therfore be al laws, thou aught to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to thy conſcience; gif thou keep thy conſcience weill, thy ſaul is in health; and

Then haue ȝee not reaſon, and mair nor reaſoun, to take tent to ȝour conſcience, to examine and trye ȝour conſcience, in quhat eſtait and diſpoſition it is.</p>

Firſt of all tak heed, that ȝe kepe faſt, a perſwaſion of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God in Chriſt Ieſus; examin quhen thou lies down, and examin quhen thou riſes vppe, in quhat eſtait thou art with God; quhither thou may looke ſurely for mercie at his hand or not: art thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb facs="tcp:6260:106"/>
of mercie; aſſure thy ſelf, thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is at ane good point, thou hes health in thy ſaul, for be keeping of faith the conſcience is preſerued, as ſayis the Apoſtle, 1. TIMOTH. 1. 19. Keep this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, halde it haill and ſound, hurt it not, bring not thy ſaul in doubting ſa far as thou may, ſtay not, nor hinder not thy perſwaſion, gif thou walde keepe health in thy ſaull: for gif thou doubt, or in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye wayes diminiſh thy perſwaſion, and aſſurance, aſſuredlye thy aſſurance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo ſone be hindered, nor diminiſhed; bot in that ſame article of time, ſall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, the diminiſhing of the health of thy ſaull: Ȝea, it cannot be, but in that ſame article of time, followes the hurt of thy conſcience, for faith will not dwell, bot in ane haill conſcience. Thairfore in quhat article of tyme thou dois againſt thy conſcience, in that ſame article of time thou loſes ane gree of thy perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the mercy of God: and vnto the time that thou fall downe at the feete of Chriſt, &amp; obtein mercy for that ill deed, purchaſe peace at his handes, to repaire thy perſwaſion; thou ſall euer doubte of mercie, and want healthe in thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<pb facs="tcp:6260:106"/>
Then this is the firſt leſſon, to keep health in ȝour ſaulles, look and ſee, that ȝe be perſwaded of mercy.</p>
               <p>The ſecond leſſoun to keepe a good conſcience, or to keepe health in thy ſaul is this: Ȝee mann flee, eſchewe, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare quhatſoeuer may trouble the helth of ȝour ſaull, quhatſoeuer may trouble the quietnes &amp; peaceable eſtait of ȝour conſcience: Caſt it out, forbeare it, and eſchewe it. This generall is good: but quhat is it, lat ſee, that troubles the quiet eſtait of the conſcience? Nathing in the warld but ſinne, nathing in the earth, but an euill nature: Therefore, wee mann of force, to keepe health in our ſaulle; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare and eſchew ſinne, we mann flee ſin, and rid our hand of it. It is not posſible, that ȝee can baith keepe a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſerue the affections of ȝour heart: and therefore, to keepe peace and health in thy ſaull; thou mann bidd thy luſtes goodnight: thou mann renounce the luſts and affections of thy heart, and thou mann not doe, as thou was woont to doe: thou mann not bee giuen to the ſeruice of thine affections, and of thine appetite, to put thame in executioun as
<pb facs="tcp:6260:107"/>
thou woont to doe: but incaſe, thine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or luſt, commaund thee to doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing; quhat is thy part? Thou mann try, howe farre this may ſtande with the good will of God, and how far that affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction quhilk commands thee, may agree with the law of God. Is there ſic an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that that, quhilk thine affectioun commaunds thee, may ſtand with Gods law and halie will? Na queſtion, it is ane ſanctified affection; thou may put it in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. But efter this triall, gif thou find thine affection to be exorbitant, and out of rule, carying thee plat fra God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains his lawe: Beware of it, reſiſt it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, that thou put not the will of it in executioun. Or vtherway is, gif thou ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the will of that affectioun ane hour, quhat pleaſure can that bring with it? It may weill bring with it, a flattering plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the entrie: but it cloſes euer with a bitter remorſe in the ende. Then to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew this bitter remorſe, ſuld ȝee not all trie ȝour affections? Ȝee mann examine and try tham, be the ſquare of Gods law, ȝe mann ſee, how far they agree with his law, or how far they diſaſſent from it: and in ſa far as, they diſaſſent fra that law: lat
<pb facs="tcp:6260:107"/>
euery man denie himſelfe, renounce his affections; and ſwa, this triall being tane this way be thy ſelfe, it ſanctifies thine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, makes Chriſt to ludge in thy ſaull, makes thy conſcience to be at reſt, and the halie ſpirite this way, maks baith bodie and ſaull, to be in good health, and to reioyce. Then flie fra ſin: This is the ſecond leſſon.</p>
               <p>The third leſſon is this, Studie to doe well: Walde thou keepe healthe in thy ſaull; ſtudie to do better and better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallie: At leaſt, haue a purpoſe in thy ſaull and hart, to take vp a better courſe dailie. Quhilk is the laſt leſſon? Seeing that quhen wee ſtudie to doe beſt, and that the iuſt man, that is, the maiſt halie man, fallis ſa oft in the daye, as ſeauen tymes in the daye: ȝea rather, ſeuentye tymes ſeauen tymes, quhat is thy parte in thir ſlippes, and ſnappers? Suppoſe thou fall, as thou can not eſchew to fall, ly not ſtill there: ſleep not there quhere thou hes fallen: It is a ſhame to ſleepe there, therefore, ryſe againe: And how ſould thou ryſe? Be lifting vp thy ſaull, and running to the fountaine of grace &amp; mercie: bee running to Chriſt Ieſus to ſeeke
<pb facs="tcp:6260:108"/>
to be for a day, or for a ȝear: but it aught to bee euery day, and euery ȝeare of thy haill lifetime. For that conſcience, that ſuld reſt for euer, with the liuing GOD, that conſcience, quhilk mann euer looke vpon the face of the Sonn of God: It can not be ouer wel ſcowred, we cannot look ouer narrowly to it: the mair curious we be in ſearching out of this conſcience, we are the better occupied: I ſpeake of our awn conſcience, I ſpeak not of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>I ga to the third, and I come to the points quhairintill, euerie an of ȝou, ſuld<note place="margin">In quhat points wee ſuld examin our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> trie and examine ȝour ſelfis. I giue ȝou twa points; quhairintil, euery ane of ȝou, aught to try and examine ȝour conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Try thy conſcience firſt in this point; quhither thou be at peace with God, quha is the Lorde of heauen, or not: Nixt, trie thy conſcience in this point: quhither thou be in loue &amp; amitie with thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or not. Wald thou knaw, quhither thy conſcience, bee at vnitie and peace with God, or not? thou ſall knawe it this way. The God of heauen, hee cann haue na ſocietie, nor can keepe na companie, with that ſaull, quhilk is alwayis vnclean,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:108"/>
that is euery way defiled: na, he cannot. Now I ſpeake not ſa preciſely, that I mak a ſaull to be fullie ſanctified, and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie halie in this life. Na, in this life, there is wonderful iniquities, groſſe ſinnes, and great faults, quherewith, euen the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ar defiled: But this is my meaning; There is na ſaull, cann bee at peace with God, or quherewith the Lorde can haue ony ſocietie, but in ſome meaſure, it man be ſanctified, and made halie: for GOD cannot make reſidence in a ſaull, that is a ſtincking midding alway: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on force, in ſome meaſure it man be ſanctified; there mann be ſa meekle made cleane, in ane nuke or vther of that ſaule, quherein the Lord of heauen, be his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſpirit may make his reſidence. Nowe lat ſee, quhereby is the ſaule ſanctified? PETER Acts 15. 9. ſayis, that the ſaull of man is purified be faith; that the heart of man is purged bee faith. Sa faith opins and purges the heart: bee faith in Chriſt Ieſus, and in the merites of his blood, we haue peace with God. Being iuſtified be faith, wee haue peace towards God, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, ſayis the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, ROM. 5. 1. Nowe comes in this
<pb facs="tcp:6260:109"/>
point, ȝe haue to proue ȝour ſelfs, quhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ȝee bee in the faith or not, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſayis. 2. COR. 13. 5. Trie and ſee, quhither ȝee haue faith in Chriſt or not. Examine, gif ȝour ſaull be ſeaſoned with this faith: for gif ȝee haue not faith in Chriſt; Chriſt is not in ȝou: and gif Chriſt be not in ȝou, ȝee are in ane euil eſtait, ȝe are in the eſtait of the reprobat and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Sa, euery ane aught to looke care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie, and ſee, gif hee hes a beliefe in the blood of Chriſt or not: quhither hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues to get mercie bee his merites, and ſanctificatioun be his blood or not: For gif thou haue na meaſure of this fayth, thou hes na meaſure of peace with God: Be reaſon, our peace with God, is ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and grows daily mair and mair be true faith in Chriſt. Now this faith, quher it is true, quhere it is liuelie, and couples the heart with God, as I haue ſpoken; it mann breake out in worde and deed: It cannot be halden in, but it mann breake out. It mann breake out in word, in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying the God of heauen, quha hes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen vs our ſins: It mann breake out in word, be giuing a notable confesſion of they ſinnes, quherein we haue offended
<pb facs="tcp:6260:109"/>
him. It mann breake out in deed, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good workes, to teſtifie to the warld that thing, quhilk is within thy heart: to teſtifie to the warld, that thou, quha hes this faith, art ane new man; that bee thy good example of life and conuerſatioun, thou may edifie thy brethren, the ſimple anis of the Kirke of GOD: and that bee thine halie life, thou may draw ſinners to repentaunce, that they ſeeing thy light, they may bee compelled to glorifie God in thee. Then in the firſt point of triall, lat vs looke to thir three; to the heart, to the mouth, and to the hand: Take heed, that there be ane harmonie, betwixt thir three, and that they all ſing ane ſang: for gif the heart, bee inwardly coupled with God; there is na doubt, but the mouth wil outwardly glorifie him: and gif thine hart and mouth be renewed, and be ane: of necesſitie, thou mann vtter this, in thy conuerſatioun: There mann bee agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt the hart, and the hand: thy conuerſation mann be changed with the heart, and be halie, honeſt and godly, as the heart is: Swa that, gif thy conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be good; it is a ſure taken, that thou art at ane with God: but gif thy conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb facs="tcp:6260:110"/>
be not good; lat men ſpeake quhat they wil, the hart is but defiled: this true and liuely faith, hes na place in it. Then will thou ſpeare, quhen art thou at ane with God? Quhen thy conuerſatioun, thine hart, and thine mouth ſayis all ane thing; then na queſtioun, thou hes the warke of fayth, wrought be the halie Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in thy heart, quhilk makes thee to bee at peace with God. This is the firſt point, quherein ȝee ſuld trie ȝour ſelfs.</p>
               <p>The nixt point is loue; ȝee mann trie, quhither ȝee be in loue, and vnder chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with ȝour neighbour or not: For as thou art not coupled with God, but bee the band of faith: ſa thou art not cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with thy neighbor, nor joyned with na member of Chriſt in this earth, but be the band of loue, amitie, and charity. Tak away loue, thou art not a member of this bodie: For loue is the maiſter ſennoun, that couples all thir members of Chriſts body togither, &amp; maks tham to grow vp all in a ſpirituall and miſtical vnitie. Loue is the onelie marke, quhereby the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Chriſt, and members of Chriſtes bodie, are knawen from the reſt of the warlde. Loue is that halie oyle, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhes
<pb facs="tcp:6260:110"/>
our ſaules, and makes vs like vnto God: and the mair wee growe in loue, the mair God be his ſpirit dwels in vs; for God is loue. Sa that, except in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, loue towardes thy neighbour dwell in thy hart, thou can haue na ſociety with thy neighbour, and far leſſe with GOD. Gif the manners of men were examined be this rule; wee ſuld find a multitude of godles people in this Country, quha hes their hearts raging with malice, ilke ane againſt vthers: and quhere the Deuill, and a malitious ſpirite dwels; there is na place there for the haly ſpirit: &amp; now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Lord hes gan about, be al means posſible, late and air, to inſtruct thame, and to infound in thame, this precious loue and amitie towardes God and their neighbour, and ſa to alter their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Ȝit they will not ſuffer thame ſelfis to bee walkned, quhill the great venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and malediction of GOD, light on their carcaſes. Alwayis this loue, this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and godly conuerſation, flows all fra the root of faith: ſa that, gif thy hart haue faith, in any meaſure; and it were neuer ſa ſmall; in that ſame meaſure, thou man haue loue towardes thy neighbour: and
<pb facs="tcp:6260:111"/>
this loue is neuer idle, but it is euer vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſelfe; ather in ane effect, or v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And in reſpect faith is the ground, quherevpon all the reſt dependes, and in reſpect, that this faith, is ſick a jewell, as without the quhilk, it is not posſible to onie of ȝou, to pleaſe God; without the quhilk, al ȝour doings are abhomination before him; without the quhilk, ȝee are left in a terrible miſerie: quhilk miſerie, is ſa meekle the mair terrible, that ȝe are ignorant of it: Is it not good reaſon, that we knaw and vnderſtand, how this fayth is wrought and created in our ſaules bee the halie Spirite, and howe it is intertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and nuriſhed in our ſaules: That ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how it is created, and hearing tel the maner, how it is brought about; ȝe may examine ȝour conſciences, and ſee quhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ȝee bee in the faith or not. My pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was to haue inſiſted langer in this matter, nor this time will ſuffer. Nowe therefore, as time will ſuffer, and as God will giue the grace, I ſall lat ȝou vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, how the halie Spirite imployes his trauaile, in the heart and mind of man &amp; woman; and quhat pains he taks in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and making vp this jewel of faith in
<pb facs="tcp:6260:111"/>
their ſauls. Ȝit or I enter to this wark, to lat ȝou ſee the trauaills of the ſpirit of God, in working of this faith in ȝour harts: It is neceſſare, and mair nor neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſare, that ȝee vnderſtand firſt, ȝour awin miſerie and infirmitie: and that ȝe knaw how the Lorde was induced, to recouer ȝou out of ȝour auld eſtait, &amp; to recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at ȝou, quha were loſt be the deede of ȝour fore-father ADAM.</p>
               <p>Then to take vp the matter the mair highlie, I call to ȝour memories this<note place="margin">The myſt of mans nation in ſome me ſure diſc ſed.</note> ground: That man vniuerſallie, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ane particularie beeing corrupted, being loſt, and that be his firſt forebears faulte: (For gif there were na mair but that ſame firſt fault and ſinne of his, wee are all juſtlie obliſhed and bound to ane double death, baith of body and ſaul for ever.) Man, this way vniuerſally and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularlie, being vtterly loſt, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hope of regres left in his ſaull, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ony ſenſe of the recouerie of that for mer eſtaite, or reparing of that image quhilke hee had tint throw ſinne lang of before: he being loſt be this ſinne, and lefte in this deſperate eſtait in him ſelfe, quhat dois God? The euerliuing God,

Not at any creature: but he ſought counſaill at him ſelf: the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Trinitie, ſought counſaill at them ſelfis: ea God was moued to ſeeke counſaill at him ſelf, onlie moued in him ſelf: for he had not ane externall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall outwith him ſelf, to induce him. Swa he ſeeking this counſell at him ſelfe, and beeing mooued in him ſelfe thereto: AS EPHES. 1. 9. quhat dois hee? Quhen all men and women ſulde haue died for euer, it pleaſis him of his infinite mercie to ſelect out of all, and to elect a certaine number out of the loſte race of ADAM, that ſuld haue periſhed for euer. In this his counſail and decreet, moued I ſay of him ſelf, and ſeeking counſaill at himſelf onlie, he ſelectes a certaine number out of this rotten race: quhilke certaine, he will haue ſanctified, he will haue juſtified, he will haue glorified. And therefore to bring about the work of their ſaluation, quhat dois hee? He appointes his awin naturall ſonne (for he had but ane natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb facs="tcp:6260:112"/>
ſonne,) he appointes the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Trinitie, his awin naturall Son, God in power, glorie, and Majeſtie, als high as him ſelfe: aequall with God the Father in all things; he appoints him to work this warke, to bring about this wark of our redemption and aeternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: (this is but the myſterye of it in ſome meaſure diſcloſed.) And therefore in the fulnes of tyme (for he diſpenſis all times according to his wiſedome,) at ſik tyme as he appointed, he maks his ſonne to come downe, to ſeaſe him ſelfe in the wemb of the virgin, to take on our fleſh, to take on the likenes of ſinne, he tooke not on ſinne, but he took on the likenes of ſinne. Quhat call I that likenes? our fleſh is the likenes of ſinne: hee took on our fleſh and nature, the lyknes of ſinne, quhilk wes perfitelie ſanctified, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie moment of his conception, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie wembe of the virgine: Hee tooke on this fleſh, that in this fleſh and nature, ſin might be baniſht and dung out of vs for euer. And quhere we ſuld all haue gane ea gaite, (for there was na exception of perſons be nature;) Chriſt Ieſus our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueour, hes elected vs: and according as
<pb facs="tcp:6260:113"/>
his Father in his ſecreet election, before the beginning of the worlde, had elected vs: the ſame Chriſt Ieſus in his awin time hee callis vs, hee makis vs pertakers of that ſaluation, quhilk he hes purchaſed: and hee repairis not onlye that Image quhilk was loſt in our fore-father ADAM, he places vs not in a terreſtriall paradiſe, quhere ADAM was placed at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, (and quhat mair could haue bene ſought be vs?) but he giues vs a far mair excellent image, nor we loſt: he places vs in a mair high, and in a mair coeleſtial Paradiſe nor wee loſt. For, ſa meekill the mair heauenlie is the paradiſe quhilk hee giues vs, as the ſecond ADAM is mair excellent nor the firſt: and as the Son of God, and God him ſelfe, gais far aboue any creature that euer was; man, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell. Therefore it comes to pas, that be the benefite of the ſecond ADAM, Chriſt Ieſus our Sauiour, the Sonne of God; quhereas, gif we had remained in that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage quherein our fore-father was firſt created: wee ſuld haue ſetled our ſelfis in the earth for euer, we culd not haue cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a better Paradiſe, nor ane earthlye Paradiſe for earthly tabernacles. Be the
<pb facs="tcp:6260:113"/>
benefite of the Sonne of God, I ſaye, it comes to pas, that we are plucked vp out of the earth to the heauen, and to ane heauenly paradiſe. And quhat haue we to do with heauen? Are we not made of the earth, to returne to the earth? becoms not ane earthlye paradiſe, ane earthly body? Ȝit the Lord in his mercy ſendis downe his Sonne, to draw vs vp out of the earth to the heauen: This is ſa high a thing, that it cannot be eaſily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered: For this drawing of vs to ane heauenlie paradiſe, is a thing mair nor coulde haue beene thought of, that wee ſuld liue ane Angels life in heauen: how could the hart of man think on this? ȝit it pleaſed the leuing Lord in the great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and bowels of his mercie, and in the exceeding greatnes of the power of his mercie towards vs: (The Apoſtle in that Epiſtle to the EPHESIANS, can not get words anew to expreſſe this; hee knawes not how to begin, nor how to end: quha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſpeakes of the riches of that mercye. And gif ȝe look that Epiſtle to the EPHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIANS narrowlie, ȝe ſall finde maa high, and excellent ſtiles, giuen to the riches of that mercie, in that Epiſtle, nor in ony

               <p>Now, reſtes his mercy and grace heir?

As he be his death purchaſed our ful redemption: ſa he maks it knawin to vs: hee intimates it to vs, bee our inwarde calling: letting vs baith finde and feele in our heart, quhat hee did in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for vs: For our Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quhen he maks his ſeruants to proclaime this redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to intimate it to our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis: he workis this jewell of faith in our ſaulls, quhilk aſſures vs, that the Sonn of
<pb facs="tcp:6260:114"/>
God hes died for vs: For quhat coulde it auaile vs, to ſee our redemption, to ſee our ſaluation and our life a farre of, gif a way wer not founde out, and a hande, &amp; a moyan giuen vs, quhereby we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that ſaluation, &amp; apply it to our ſelf. Quhat can it avail a ſick man, to ſee a drog in ane Apothicaries booth, except a way be found out, how it ſall be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his ſick bodie: Swa, to the end that this worke of our redemption and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may bee fullie and freely accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: Look how freelie hee hes giuen his onely Sonn, to the death of the Cros for vs: als freelie hes he founde out this way &amp; moyen, &amp; propyned vs with this hand quhereby we may take hald on Chriſt, &amp; apply him to our ſaulls. This moyan, to conclude, is faith. There is not a waye, nor ane inſtrument in the Scriptures of God, quhereby ony man or woman, may apply Chriſt to thair ſaulls, but only the inſtrument of faith: therefore faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee aneugh commended. Turne to faith, and it will make thee to turne to God, and ſwa conjoine thee with God, and make all thine actions to ſmell weill in his neaſe: And there is neuer a good

For faith conjoynis vs with the GOD of heauen, and makis vs heauenlye. This jewell of faith, ſeaſons all the giftes and graces quhilk God giues vs. I will not giue a ſtraw, for all the riches of the earth to my ſaull, without faith. And quhat auailes it to ony man, to haue all the ſciences, wiſedome, and knawledge in the earth, without faith? for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil hes all this knawledge; and is not the better. Quhat auaillis it to me, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques all the Monarches, Kingdomes, &amp; haill riches in the earth? quhat can all thir auaill to my ſaull? Na thing; but to make out a proces againſt mee, gif I want faith. Therefore all the benefites and giftes of God, without faith; auailes
<pb facs="tcp:6260:115"/>
nathing, but to augment our miſery. All the giftes and graces of God, are abuſed without faith: Faith onlie makes thee to vſe the benefits &amp; graces of God rightly: faith onlie ſuld bee ſought, keeped, and interteined heir in this life: hauing faith, all the reſt of Gods graces are profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thee: for this jewell keeps them all in order, and makes them al fruitful: quhere, lacking this jewell, there is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing heir in this earth, but it will beare teſtimonie againſt thee.</p>

Ȝea, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der looke, howe voide any carcaſe is of a naturall life, als voide ar our ſauls (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they be liuand the naturall life) als voide are they of the life of God, of that heauenlie and ſpirituall life, quhereunto we in this life doe aſpire: vnto the tyme that the ſpirit of God draw our harts &amp; mindis, that is; quicken our hartes and mindis. Nay, it is not a draught as wee take it commonlie, it is a verye quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a dead thing: It is a quickening of that thing quhilk was voide of the life of the ſpirite. Then, except the ſpirit of God drawe vs, that is, quicken vs with that ſpirituall &amp; heauenlie life: it is not poſſible to vs to come to heauen.

the forging and creating of faith in our ſauls, quhilk makis vs newe creaturs. Lat vs ſee now, quhat order the ſpirit of God keepis in drawing vs, and in forging and creating this faith in our ſauls. Firſt of al, I deuide the ſaull in na ma parts, nor commonlie it vſis to be deuided: that is, in the hart and in the minde. Our mind then being ane clud of darknes, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blinde naturallie: there beeing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in that mind of ours, but vanity &amp; error, quherby we vaniſh away, &amp; can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bide at na good purpoſe: quhat dois the ſpirit of God?

He banniſhis darcknes, he chaiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes out vanitie and blindnes, that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lurkes in the minde: and in ſtead of this darcknes, he places in the mynde, a light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a coeleſtiall and a heauenlie light, a light quhilk is reſident in Chriſt Ieſus onlie. Then the ſpirite chaiſſes out that clud of miſte and darcknes, and places light in the mynde. And quhat dois hee be this light? Wee getting this inward and heauenlie light in the mind, and ane ſanctified vnderſtanding; incontinent he

makis vs to ſee God: not onlie, as hee is God the creator of the warld: but alſwa, as hee is God the redeemer, and hes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed vs in his Son Chriſt Ieſus. Now before I get this light, quhat is my heart and mynde dooing? There is neuer ane of ȝou, but ȝee haue experience, as I my ſelfe haue, in quhat eſtait the heart and minde is before this light enter. The mynde is lyand drowned in blindnes, &amp; the hart is hardned, and they baith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire together in ane vice, to ſet vp ane I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll in ſteed of God: ane domeſtick &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible idoll, &amp; quhat a ſort of idol is that I pray ȝou?

Then wee ſee, that all the things in the warld, beſide the liuing God, are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, deceaueable allurements, vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſhaddowes, fleetand and flowand without ony byding: and then wee ſee that our hartes and mindes was ſet on ill continuallie. Then wee begin to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor that Idoll, and to ſeek to ſerue God onlie. Now except the Lord of his awin mercy &amp; goodnes, place in vs this light, vnto the tyme that we get ſome glimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this light, wee can neuer ſee our

awin vanitie, lat bee to ſee God. This then is the firſt warke of the Spirit, hee banniſhes darcknes and errors, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces light in our mindis. Nowe, this firſt wark of the Spirite, is termed oftymes in the Scripture, vnder the name of faith: for the minde hes the awin aſſent &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion in the awin kynde, als weill as the hart hes: and therefore the mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing illuminat &amp; ſeaſoned with this light, the aſſenting and knawledge in the ſame minde, is called faith. The Apoſtle, and the Euangeliſts giues to this knawledge, the name of faith: for fra time ains thou haue ane eie to ken God, and quhom he hes ſent Chriſt Ieſus, fra ains thou get a ſight of him, and gets acceſſe to him, gif it wer na farder nor in the mind, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led faith.</p>
               <p>But we are forbidden to ſtand heir, gif faith ga na farder nor the minde, it is not the faith wee are ſeekand. For the Faith that juſtifies, and dois vs good, mann oppin the heart, als weill as it op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinnis the minde: it mann banniſh that idol and affection, out of the hart, and in his ſteed, ſet down a Throne to Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Sa that, except the good Spirite of
<pb facs="tcp:6260:118"/>
God ga farder, nor rhe mynde; and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh this idol, als weil out of our harts, as out of our minds, we get not that juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, quhereby wee may looke for mercie. Ȝea, the Spirit of God mann not onlie ſtand in lightening the minde: but it mann mollifie this hart of thine, and change thine affection: And quhere thy affection was wicked and ill, Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit mann change the will: and hee neuer can change the will, except he make the ground of thy hart good: that it may be ſet on God, and bring foorth good frute aboundantlie to the awner. And quhat teaches this? This teaches ȝou to ſeeke, for ane honeſt hart, and to ſeeke inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, quhil ȝe obteene it. For quhat auails it to ony man to ken quhat is good, or quhat is ill, except he haue a way ſhawin him, how hee ſall eſchew the ill, and a moyan giuen him to make him ſelfe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the good? Is not this ane idle and vnprofitable knawledge to mee, to ſee a far off: and to ken, that this is good for mee, quhen as I finde not a moyan how to be pertaker of that good, that it may be ane ſpeciall good thing to mee. Is it not ane idle knawledge alſo, to ken
<pb facs="tcp:6260:119"/>
that this is ill for mee, that it wil do mee ill gif I doe it: and ȝit that ſame verye thing I will do; and na vther? Swa, the Spirit of God linckes thir twa together in this warke: and as he reformes the minde, hee reformes alſo the heart, and makes ȝou to be pertakers of that good quhilke ȝou ſee, and to eſchewe that ill quhilk ȝee ſee. And this is the ſecond warke of the Spirit, not onlie to preſent a thing to thee, but to make it thine in effect. For, howbeit the minde wald do hir turne neuer ſa weill, and lat thee ſee that Chriſt is thine; and preſent him to thee, neuer ſa oft; gif the hart be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that wil, and cruked affection that is in thy heart, will prefer it ſelfe to Chriſt, and will make thee to compt all but follie, in reſpect of that Idoll. And therefore it were ane idle and ane fooliſh thing for mee to ſee my ſaluation, except I get grace to be pertaker of it: &amp; quhat auailes it to thee to ſee the Diuel, to ſee thine awin ſins that ſlayes thee, except thou get grace to eſchew tham: &amp; ſa the ſecond wark of the ſpirit is this; he enters in the heart, he dantons the hart, &amp; wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges it, &amp; makes the will of it
<pb facs="tcp:6260:119"/>
obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; he mollifies the affection, quhilk was hard of before, in ſic ſort, that it is made to poure out thy affection in ſome meaſure on the liuing GOD, quhere it was powred out on ane idoll or vther of thine awin before. Then except the hart wil do his part, as the mind dois his part; the haill ſaull is not conſecrate to God: for God hes not made the ſaull, that the heart ſuld ſerue thee, and the minde onely ſuld ſerue him: but thy ſeruice is then onelie acceptable to GOD, quhen thou conſecrates thy hart, as weill as thy mind to him.</p>

is our meat and drinke ſpiritual. Of meat and drinke corporall, there is ane appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion bee the eie, and be the taiſt: that quhil as the meat is preſent to ȝou on the table, ȝour eie takes a view of this meat, diſcernes on it, and makes a choyce of it; Ȝea, not onelie the eie, but alſo the taiſt, diſcernes on that meat, and the taiſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouing it; that is called the firſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.</p>
               <p>Now vpon this, quhilk is the firſt, the ſecond apprehenſion followes: that is, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ȝe haue chewed that meat, letten it ouer ȝour halſe, and ſend it to ȝour ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs, quhere it digeſts, and conuerts in ȝour nuriture: Then in ȝour ſtomach, ȝee get the ſecond apprehenſion.

<pb facs="tcp:6260:120"/>
that, gif ȝee chewe not this meat, and lat it ouer; it feeds ȝou not. Then it is onely the ſecond apprehenſioun, that nuriſhes our bodie.

Then we reject him, and prefers our awin idoll, and the ſeruice of our awin affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him; and ſwa, the ſecond apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion follows not: We cannot digeſt him, and gif wee digeſt him not that ſpirituall life cannot grow in vs. For look in quhat place, the eie ſerues to thy bodie; in that ſame roume, ſerues knawledge and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtaunding to thy ſaule: and looke in quhat place, thy hand and thy mouth, the taſt and the ſtomach, ſerues to thy body; in that ſame roume, ſerues the heart and affection to thy ſaull: ſa that, as our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die cannot bee nuriſhed, except our hand take, and our mouth eat the meat, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the ſecond apprehenſion may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Likewiſe, our ſaules cannot feed on Chriſt, except we gripp him, and imbrace him hartelie be our wil and affection. For we come not to Chriſt, bee ony outward motion of our bodie, but be ane inward motioun and apprehenſion of the heart: for God, finding vs al in a reprobat ſenſe, hee brings vs to Chriſt, be reforming the affectioun of our ſaules, bee making vs to loue him. And therefore, the ſecond ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:121"/>
quhereby we digeſt our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, will neuer enter into our ſaules; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, as he pleaſes the eie, ſa hee pleaſe the will and the affection alſo. Nowe gif this come to paſſe, that our wil and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioun is halelie bent vpon Chriſt; then na dout, we haue gotten this jewell of faith: haue ȝee ſic a liking in ȝour mind, and ſic a loue in ȝour heart of Chriſt, that ȝe will preferre him to all thinges in the warlde; Then na queſtioun, faith is begunne in ȝou.</p>
               <p>Now, fra time a thing be begun, there is farther required: for ſuppoſe this faith<note place="margin">How faith is nuriſhed &amp; intertained in vs.</note> be formed in ȝour mindes, in ȝour harts and ſaulles, ȝit that is not aneugh, but that quhilke is formed, man be nuriſhed, and hee quha is conceaued, mann bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and brought vp; or els the loue that is begone in me bee the halie ſpirit, except be ordinare means, it be daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and nuriſhed, it will decay: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Lord continue the draught and working of his halie Spirit; it is not posſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that I can continue in the faith. And how mann we nuriſh and continue fayth in our ſaules? Twa maner of wayis: firſt, we nuriſh faith begun in our ſaul, be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:6260:122"/>
of the word: not of euerie word, but bee hearing of the worde of GOD prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: and not bee the hearing of euerie man; but be hearing the word preached be him that is ſent. For this is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nair meane, quherevnto the Lorde hes bound him: he will worke faith, be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word, and perceptioun of the Sacraments: and the mair thou heare the word, &amp; the oftner thou receaue the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; the mair thy faith is nuriſhed. Nowe it is not onely, bee hearing of the word, and perception of the Sacraments, that we nuriſh faith. The word &amp; the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, are not able of thame ſelfis, to nuriſh this faith in vs, except the working of the halie Spirite, bee conjoyned with their miniſterie: But the word and ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ar ſaid to nuriſh faith in our ſauls, becauſe they offer and exhibite Chriſt to vs, quha is the meat, the drinke, and life of our ſaules: and in reſpect, that in the word &amp; Sacraments, we get Chriſt, quha is the foode of our ſaules; therefore the word and Sacraments, are ſayd to nuriſh our ſaules: as is ſet downe Acts 2. 42. The Diſciples of Chriſt, were earneſtlie occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, and continued in the Apoſtles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb facs="tcp:6260:122"/>
and fellowſhippe, and breaking of bread, and praiers: bee thir meanes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertening, augmenting, and nuriſhing the faith that was begun in thame. Then the halie Spirite begets this faith, works this faith, creats this faith, nuriſhes and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines this faith in our ſaules, be hearing of the preached word, and be participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſacraments, quhilk are the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinair meanes, quhereby, the Lord nuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes vs, and continews this ſpirituall food with vs: For looke be quhat meanes, the ſpirituall life is begunne, bee thay ſame means, it is nuriſhed and intertained. As this temporall life is intertained and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed bee thay ſame meanes, quhereby it is begun.</p>

But alas, we are come to ſic a loath, diſdain, &amp; offcaſting of this heauenlie foode in this Countrey: That
<pb facs="tcp:6260:123"/>
quhere men in the beginning, wald haue gane, ſome twentie miles, ſome fourtie miles, to the hearing of this word: they will ſcarcelie now come fra their houſe to the Kirk, and remaine ane hour to heare the word, but bides at hame. Weil I ſay, ouer great welth, gars wit wauer; and the aboundance of this word, ingenders ſik a lothſomnes, that it is a rare thing to find out onye, that hes that thirſt and deſire to heare the word, as they were wont to haue in the beginning: And as to our great men, they wil not heare it at all: for they cannot heare the thing that accuſes thame, and conuicts thame, but becauſe this word accuſes &amp; conuicts thame, they run fra it. But they ſuld not do ſwa; they ſuld not run fra Chriſt, nor fra his worde that accuſes tham: but they ſuld hear the worde, and as the worde accuſes thame, they ſuld accuſe tham ſelfs alſo that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, they may come to a confesſioun of their ſin, &amp; obtaine mercie for the ſame. Sa, quhen Chriſt accuſes thee, thou ſuld not run fra him, but thou ſuld draw neer to him, thou ſuld threepe kindnes of him and make irruption, as it were, and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie enter in his kingdome. It is not the
<pb facs="tcp:6260:123"/>
way, quhen thy ſinne twitches thee, and quhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt accuſes thee, to run fra him: Na, thou ſuld then turn to him; thou ſuld confes thy ſin, cry <hi>Peccaui,</hi> &amp; ſeek mercy: and efter that thou hes gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mercy, this word ſal become als pleaſant to thee, and thou ſall take als great delite, to come to the hearing of it; as euer thou delited to fly fra it before. But alas, our lothſomnes and diſdaine, is grown to ſick ane height; that truly, I am moued to beleeue firmly, that the Lord hes concluded, that wee ſal not enter in his reſt; and that only, for the great contempt of his mercy and grace, quhilk is now ſa richly offered: For why? God cannot deal vtherwayis with vs, nor he dealt with our for fathers the Iſraelits, for the negligence of the euangel, quhilk was but then obſcurely preached: for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it was farre fra the incarnation of Chriſt; and the farther that it was fra his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the Euangell was ay the mair ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely preached, vnder darke types and ſhadows; Ȝit notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, the fathers that hard that euangel preached, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued it not; they periſhed all in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, except twa, as ȝe haue hard ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time fra this place: And gif they, for the

               <p>To the end that ȝe might ga fordward, and proceede in the worke of this triall with the better ſpeede, and with the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fruits: Into this examination we laid downe this ordour.

feeling in the heart, reſembling the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judgement of God, following vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a deed done be vs, flowing of knaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the minde: A feeling accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a motioun in the heart, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioun, ather of feare or ioy, of trembling or rejoyſing.

I come nixt to the cauſes, quherefore eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ane of ȝou, ſuld bee carefull in trying and examining ȝour awin conſciences. The firſt cauſe is; becauſe the Lorde of heauen, hes his eie continuallie vpon the conſcience; the eie of God, comes neuer off the conſcience and heart of man; as I prooued to ȝou, be ſundrie places. Nixt, be reaſon this God hes choſen his ludge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hes ſett downe his throne, to make his reſidence in the conſcience: Therefore, that hee may dwell in cleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ȝou aught to haue a regard to his dwelling place.

And laſt of all, in reſpect, that the health of thy ſaull, ſtands in the eſtait of thy conſcience; and gif thy ſaull bee in good health, thy bodie cannot be euill: Therefore in reſpect, that ſaull and bodie, dependes vppon the eſtait of the conſcience; euerie ane of ȝou, ſuld care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie looke to ȝour conſciences. I will not amplifie this, but remits the matter to ȝour memories: howe the health of the ſaull, and weilfair of the ſaull, ſuld be keeped.</p>
               <p>Nixt, I come in the thrid and laſt rowme, to the points, into the quhilk e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie ane of ȝou, ſuld try and examine ȝour conſciences: And as ȝe remember, I ſet down twa points, quhere into it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houes ȝou to put ȝour conſciences to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Firſt, to knaw quhether ȝour conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences wes at peace with God, or not: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, quhether ȝour conſciences wes in loue, in charitie, &amp; in amitie with ȝour neighbour, or not: Into thir twa points chieflie, ȝee mann try and examine ȝour ſelfis. To ken quhether ȝee bee at peace with God or not, ȝe mann firſt try, quhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ȝe be in the faith, or not: (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeakes) quhether ȝee bee in the
<pb facs="tcp:6260:127"/>
faith of Chriſt or not: For, being in the faith, and juſtified thereby; of force ȝee mann haue peace with God, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeakes. Then the nixt cair mann be to try ȝour faith, and to ſee quhether ȝe haue faith, or not. Faith can na waies be tryed, but be the fruits: faith can not be judged on be mee, that lookes on it at the leaſt, but be the effects: Therefore to try quhether ȝee be in the faith, or not: take tent to the frutes: take tent to thy mouth, take tent to thy hand, take tent to thy wordes, and to thy deedes. For, except thou glorifie God in thy mouth, and confes to thy ſaluation: and except thou glorifie him alſo in thy deedes, and make thine haly life to teſtify of thy haly<note place="margin">How ane ſinceare faith is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

Therefore to knaw the ſynceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of thy faith, thou mann take tent, that there be ane harmony betwixt thy hand, thy mouth, and thy hart: that there bee a mutuall conſent, that thy doings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge not thy hart, that thy mouth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge not thy hart: but that mouth and hand, may teſtifie of the ſynceritie of the heart. Gif the heart, the hand, and the mouth, conſent and agree in ane harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb facs="tcp:6260:127"/>
together: Na queſtion, that hart that breakes foorth in ſa good frutes, is cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with God: there is na queſtion, the light of thy actions, the beames and ſhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thy life, ſall make the name of thy good God to bee glorified. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the haill weight of our tryall ſtands chieflie vpon this point: to ſee quhether wee bee in the faith, or not: to examine quhether Chriſt dwels in vs bee faith, or not: For without faith, there can bee na coupling, nor conjoining betwixt vs and Chriſt: without faith our hart can not be ſanctified and clenged: and without faith we can not worke bee charitie: ſa all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on this onlie. And therefore that ȝe might the better vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d quhether ȝe haue faith or not: I gaid ſomequhat mair highly in this matter, and I begoud to lat ȝou ſee, how the haly Spirit creats faith, &amp; workes faith in ȝour ſauls, harts, and mindes. I begouth to let ȝou ſee, quhat order the halye Spirite keeped, in forming and in creating this notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in ȝour harts and mindes: Not only how he ingenders and begins faith, but alſwa how he interteinis it, how hee nouriſhes it: and we lute ȝou ſee, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb facs="tcp:6260:128"/>
meanes and inſtrumentes quhilk he vſis to this effect. To beget faith in our ſauls, the halie Spirit vſes the hearing of the worde preached, bee him that is ſent; &amp; the miniſterie of the Sacraments, as ordinarie meanes and inſtrumentes: quhilk ordinare meanes are onelie then effectual, quhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the haly Spirit concurs inwardly in our hearts, with the worde ſtriking outwardlie in our eare: and with the Sacrament outwardlie receaued. And except the haly Spirit grant his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currance to the word, and to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; word and Sacrament wil not work faith. Swa, all depends vpon the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this haly Spirit. The haill rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of mankinde, the renewing of the hart and of the conſcience, depends on the power of the haly Spirit: and ther fore it becoms vs cairfully, to imploy our trauails, in incalling for his haly Spirit. Be the ſame means and na vther, that the halie Spirite begets faith in vs; bee the ſame meanes he nouriſhis and augments that, quhilk he hes begotten. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as wee get faith bee hearing of the word; ſa be continuall and diligent hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, we haue this faith augmented, and
<pb facs="tcp:6260:128"/>
nouriſhed in vs. And heir I drew out my exhortation, that gif ȝe wauld haue that ſpirituall life nouriſhed in ȝou, and gif ȝe wald haue a farder aſſurance of heauen: on force ȝe mann baith continuallie and diligentlie, heare the bleſſed worde of God.</p>
               <p>Now it reſts that euery ane of ȝou cair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie applye this doctrine to ȝour awin ſaulls, and enter into the tryall of ȝour awin conſciences: to ſee, gif this faith, as I ſpake, bee begunne in ȝour hearts and minds, or not: How far, or how little the halie Spirit hes proceeded in that wark, try with mee, and I with ȝou. The firſt effect of the haly Spirite, quhereby ȝee may try ȝour minde, quhether it bee in the faith, or not; is this: Reuolue in ȝour memories, and remember, gif at ony time, it pleaſed the Lord in his mercie to turne the darcknes of ȝour minde vnto light, to make that darcknes quhilk wes within ȝou to depart. Be the quhilk dark<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, nather had ȝee ane eie to ſee ȝour ſelfis, quhat ȝee war bee nature: nor ȝet had ȝee ane eie to ſee God in Chriſt, nor ony part of his mercie. Examine I ſaye, quhether gif this darcknes of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb facs="tcp:6260:129"/>
vnderſtanding, be turned into light, be the working of the Spirit, or not: Gif thou art become a childe of the light, a childe of the day: Gif thou art become as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, light in the Lord: Gif there be this alteration maid in thy minde, that quhere naturallye off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it was cloſed vp in darcknes; quhere it was filled with vanities and errours; quhere it was cloſed vp in blindnes: gif the Lorde hes at onye time, enlightened the eie of thy minde, and maide thee to ſee thine awin miſerie, to ſee the vgglines of thin awin nature: to ſee they hainous ſinnes, in the quhilk be nature thou lyes: Gif he hes granted to thee, ane inſight of thy ſelf in ſome meaſure: and vpon the vther ſide, gif hee hes graunted thee ane out-gait: and hes giuen thee ane inſight of the mercie of God in Chriſt Ieſus: gif thou haue gotten ane inſight of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his grace in Chriſt: Na doubt, the halie Spirit hes begun a good warke in thee: A wark, quhilk will bring foorth repentance, quhilk in his awin time hee will perfite. Sa this is the firſt cair that ȝe aught to haue, and the firſt point quher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ȝe aught to examine ȝour mindes: to
<pb facs="tcp:6260:129"/>
ſee gif there be any light in it, quhereby ȝe may knaw your miſery, and haue a in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of the mercy of God in Chriſt. This being doone, that thou findes a ſight of thir twa in thy minde; fra thy minde, ga to the heart, and as thou hes tryed thy minde, ſa try thine hart. And firſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the hart, gif it bee altered or not: gif it be in ony ſort reformed or not, that the will of it bee framed and bowed to Gods obedience: that the affectioun bee turned in the luif of God, and bee pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out on him, as it wes powred out on vanities, on filthines, and on the warlde off before. Try quhither the ground of the hart, and the fountaine quherfra the motions and affections proceeds; be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, or not: For of ane haly fountaine, halie waters mann diſtill: of ane halye fountaine, halie motions, halie cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſanctified conſiderations mann flow.</p>
               <p>Try then and examine ȝour heart, gif the ſpirit of God hes wrought ony ſik re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation (as I ſpake off) in the hart or not: And that thou may take vp the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the halie Spirit, the better in thy hart and conſcience, quhilk makis chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb facs="tcp:6260:130"/>
reſidence in the hart: I ſall lay before thee the firſt effect, that euer the halye Spirite brings foorth in thy hart: in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it, in mollifying it, and in bowing it to the obedience of God. Thou ſall knaw the working of the haly Spirit, bee this effect: to wit, gif, as thy minde ſeeis, and behaldes quhat is ill, ſeeis and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haldes quhat is good, ſeeis and behaldes thine awin miſerie, and thy ſinnes that hes caſten thee in this miſerie: and ſeeis and behalds the riches of the mercie of God in Chriſt: Gif as thy mind ſeeis thir twa, thy hart be reformed and prepared, to loue the ſight of thame. As thou ſeeis in thy mind, the mercie of God, &amp; that in Chriſt: gif thou hes ane hart to deſire mercie: gif thou hes ane thirſt and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire, to bee pertaker of mercie: quhere this deſire and thirſt is, there the halie Spirit is, he hes, na doubt, opened the hart. Vpon the vther ſide, becaus, as thou ſeeis mercie, thou ſeeis thy miſerie: gif as thy minde ſeeis the miſerie, ſeeis the fountain quherefra thy miſery flows a to wit, fra thine awin ſins, gif then thyne heart alſo hates this; the halie Spirite is there. Gif as thou ſeeſt ſinne, quhilk is
<pb facs="tcp:6260:130"/>
the cauſe of thy miſerie, with the eye quhilk is giuen thee in thy minde; thou hateſt this ſinne with thy heart: na que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, the halie Spirite is there. And as thou hateſt it, gif alſo thou ſorrow for it, (for it is not aneugh to hate it, gif thou lament not the committing of it, &amp; with a godlie ſorrowe deplore it:) the halie Spirite is there. And thirdlie, gif with thy lamenting, thou haue a care and a ſtudie to eſchew that ſinne; for quhat auailes it to lament; gif like a dogg, returning to his vomit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou fall in that ſame golfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Therefore, quhere there is ane ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trent of ſinne, a ſorrowe for ſinne, a care and a ſtudie to eſchewe ſinne: na queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oun, the halie Spirite hes opened the heart, and is working out that precious inſtrument. Take vpp all this in a worde, take vp all the operation of the haly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and working in the heart in a word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bee this examine thy heart. See and perceaue, gif the halie Spirite hes entred ſa farre with thee, to worke in that hard heart of thine, an erneſt, a diligent ſtudy, a carefull ſolicitude, continually to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with the gret god, quhom thou hes offended: Is there ſick a thing, as ane
<pb facs="tcp:6260:131"/>
thirſt and ane deſire to be at amitie with him, quhom thou hes offended, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with the God of heauen, quhom thou hes offended be thy manifald tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresſions: quhere this care, and ſtudy of reconciliation is: Gif this care &amp; ſtudy of reconciliation be in the heart; there is na dout, but the hart that thirſts for this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation is hartelie content, not onlie to renounce ſin, to renounce al the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, that ſeucred thee fra God: but the hart that is indewed with this thirſt, will bee hartely content, to renounce it ſelfe, to caſt downe it ſelfe, for als ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne as it wes off before, to caſte down the ſelf at the feete of the mightye GOD, and bee healilie content, in all times comming, to be ruled be his halie will: Not to followe the awin luſt, the awin will and appetite, as it did off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but to reſigne the ſelf healilie in the handes of the mightie God, to bee ruled be his wil at his pleaſure, and to obey his appetite. And except ȝe find this diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitioun in ȝour awin heart, to quite ȝour ſelfis, to renounce ȝour ſelfis; it is a vaine thing, to ȝou to ſpeake, that ȝee haue a thirſt to bee reconciled. Sa, the greater
<pb facs="tcp:6260:131"/>
thirſt of reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that we haue. And the mair that this ſtudy grow is, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the apprehenſion of my miſerie, of the deep gulfis &amp; very hels (quherunto my ſaull is ſubiect) growes in my ſaull, the mair earneſt wald I be to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: &amp; to be reconciled, I wald not ſtand, for the renuncing of the luſts of my hart; but I wald renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce my hart, &amp; the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the wil &amp; appetit of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Quhy? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus I ſee, I mann die for euer, except the Lorde reconcile him ſelf with mee. I ſee the huge deepes &amp; oceans of all miſery, in the quhilk I ſal fal in the end, except in mercie, the Lord reconceile him ſelf with mee. To eſchew thir deepes and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences, is there ony queſtion, but the hart that hath a ſenſe, and is touched with thame; wil maiſt willingly quite the ſelf. Againe, ſeing the Lorde hes tane paines to deliuer mee out of that deepe miſery, in the quhilk I drowned my ſelf, and hes purchaſed my redemption bee ſick a coaſtlie price: not with golde, nor with ſiluer, or ony draffe in the earth: but be ſick a wonderful way, be ſick a pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tious price, and rich ranſome: Looking to the greatnes of our miſery, and to the
<pb facs="tcp:6260:132"/>
greatnes of the price, quhereby hee hes redeemed vs: quhat hart is it, but it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie walde renunce the ſelfe, to get a part of that redemption, and to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered out of that hell, quherein wee are preſentlie, and quherein wee will be in a greater meaſure eſter this, except we be reconciled. Swa then, with this choſe, there is joined a diſpoſition in the heart, quherby the hart is willing in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to renunce the ſelfe. This leſſon is oft tauld ouer to vs bee Chriſt, in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangell: We mann ather take vp a croſſe and renounce our ſelfis alſo, or wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not follow him. The mair that this thirſt growes in the heart, the mair this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of our ſelfis growes: the mair that this thirſt decayes, and is dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the heart, the mair cleaue wee to the warld, the mair cleaue we to the fleſh, and the mair are we ruled and guided be thame. Sa, ather mann wee nouriſhe a thirſt of righteouſnes, a hunger of life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting, a thirſt of mercie, a hunger of that juſtice that is in Chriſt; or it is not poſſible that in any meaſure, we can bee diſciples to him.</p>
               <p>Now I ga fordward: The heart that
<pb facs="tcp:6260:132"/>
efter this ſorte is prepared, that with a thirſt to be reconciled, is diſpoſed alſo to renounce the ſelf: this heart into the quhilk there lyes ſa earneſt a thirſt, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fruſtrat of the expectation: that gree die heart is neuer diſapointed: but as the Lorde hes imprented in it, ane earneſt ſtudie to bee reconciled, and to get a grip of Chriſt: Sa in his mercy he grants vnto that hart the poſſeſſion of mercie, hee puts that heart in ſome meaſure, in poſſeſſioun of the mercye quhilke it ſeekes, in poſſeſſioun of Chriſt Ieſus him ſelf, quhom it ſeekes. The quhilk appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſioun of Chriſt, the heart ſenſiblye feels and gripes, in that peace, quhilk he giues to the conſcience: ſa that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience quhilk wes terrified, exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie gnawen, and diſtracted off before; be the incomming of this peace, and of Chriſt with his graces; incontinent it is quieted &amp; pacified: there comes a calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and ſoundnes in the heart, and all troubles and ſtormis are remoued. With this peace is conjoined, ane taiſt of the powers of the warld to come. The heart gets a taiſt of the ſwetnes that is in chriſt of the joy, whilk is in the life euerlaſting,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:133"/>
quhilk taiſt is the only arlis-pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny, of that full and perfite joy, quhilk ſaull and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in that life ſhall enioy. And the arlis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pennie (as ȝee knaw) mann be a part of the ſowme, and of the nature of the reſt of the ſowme. And therefore, that arlis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penie of joy aſſures vs, that quhen wee ſall get poſſeſſion of the haill ſowme, it ſall bee a ſtrange joy. And thir docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments halds vp the heart, and makes it not to linger, nor wearie in the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that life: but being refreſhed now and then therewith, be ſa mony arlis pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: they aſſure vs of the full fruition of that joy, for the quhilk in patience wee will ſuſtein all troubles. Swa, as the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Spirite workes a thirſt in vs, to be at Chriſt, a thirſt of mercy and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him: the ſame halie Spirit diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apoints not that ſame expectatioun, nor thirſt; but puts the ſaull and hart in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Chriſt: bee the quhilk the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is pacified, the heart is rejoiced, and we get a taiſt of the ſweetnes, and of the powers of that life to come. The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible feeling of the quhilk taiſt, that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes all natural vnderſtanding, quhat dois it in my hart and conſcience? It workes
<pb facs="tcp:6260:133"/>
a wonderfull aſſurance and perſwaſioun that God loues mee. The feeling of his mercie in the bowels of my heart, in the bottome of my conſcience, works a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain aſſurance and perſwaſion, that he is my God, that he will ſaue me for Chriſts cauſe; that the promiſe of mercy, quhilk I durſt not for my life applye to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience off before; now bee the feeling of mercie, I dare baldly apply, and ſay: mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie apperteins to mee, life and ſaluation apperteins to mee.</p>
               <p>For the conſcience being exceedingly terrified, and ſeeing na thing in God but fire and wraith: it is not poſſible, but it mann flee fra him: it can not approch to ane conſuming fire: but fra time the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcience get a taiſt of this peace, mercy, &amp; ſweetnes; Looke how firſt it fled fra him off before: now efter this reconciliation it will runne als faſt to him, and wil poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes him, mair and mair, fullie. Sa the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance and perſwaſion of mercie, ryſes of the feeling of mercie in the heart and conſcience. And except the hart feele it, and taſte it in ſome meaſure: I dare not, nor na conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce dare for the life, apply God and his mercie to the ſelf. I may be
<pb facs="tcp:6260:134"/>
ſure in generall, that all my ſinnes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsable, and that I may come be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or I feele it: but to apply this mercie in particular to my ſelfe, quhill I feele a taiſt of it firſt, I dar not. Swa, this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular application, quhereby we claime God, and Chriſt as propertie to vs, as gif na man had title to him but wee, and to call him my God, my Chriſt, and to claime his promiſes, as na man had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres to them but wee: this comes of the ſenſe and feeling of mercie in the heart: And the mair that this feeling growes, &amp; the farder experience, that wee haue in our awin hart of this peace and mercie, the greater growes our faith and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: Our perſwaſion becoms ſa ſtrong, that we dar at laſt come out with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle and ſay: Quhat can twin mee fra the luif of God? Nather death, nather life, nather Angels, nor principalities nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, is able to ſeperate mee fra the loue of God, quhilk is in Chriſt. This particular application, quhilk ryſes (na doubt) vpon the feeling and ſens of mercie, is the ſpecifik difference, the cheef mark and proper note, quhereby
<pb facs="tcp:6260:134"/>
our faith, quha ar juſtified in the blood of Chriſt, is diſcerned fra that generall faith of the Papiſtes. Our faith bee this particular application, is not onlye diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned fra the generall faith of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes, but it is diſcerned fra all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended faithes, of all the ſectes in the warld. For the Papiſt dare not applye the promis of mercy to his awin ſaul, he compts it preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſay, I am ane e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, I am ſaued and juſtified. And quher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fra flowes this I pray ȝou? Only fra this, that in their conſcience, they haue neuer felt mercie, they haue neuer taſted of the luif, fauour, and ſweetnes of God: For, looke how faſt the conſcience fleeis fra God, before it get the taiſte of his ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: It runnes als diligentlie on him, &amp; threapes luife on him, efter that it hes gotten that taiſt. Swa, they miſerable bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies contents thame with this generall faith, quhilk is na vther thing, bot ane hiſtoricall faith, that leanes only on the treuth of God, quherby I knaw that the promiſes of God are true: Bot the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt dare not come, and ſay: they are true in mee; quhy? becaus hee hes not felt it, and the hart of him is not opned.
<pb facs="tcp:6260:135"/>
But our juſtifieng faith, as I tauld ȝou, conſecrates the haill ſaul, to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God in Chriſt. Sa that it reſts not only vpon the truth of God, nor it reſts not only vpon the power of God: ſuppoſe thir be twa chiefe pillars of our faith alſwa: but ſpeciallie and chieflie, it reſts vpon the mercie of God in Chriſt: it reſts alſo vpon the truth and power of God, but ſpeciallie vpon the promiſe of grace and mercie in Chriſt. The ſaull of the Papiſt, being deſtitute of the feeling and taiſt of mercie, dare not enter in this particular application, and ſwa hee can not be juſtified. Ȝea: na doubt, ſa mony of them as are juſtified, in the mercy of God gets a taiſt of his mercie, and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or thay die. This far concerning the effects.</p>
               <p>Then ȝe haue onely this to remember, the opening of the heart, the pacifiyng, &amp; quieting of the conſcience; they worke ane aſſurance and a ſtrong perſwaſion of the mercie of God in Chriſt: The mair that the heart bee opened, the mair that the conſcience be pacified, the mair that the taiſt of that ſweetnes continue and remaine, the mair art thou aſſured of his
<pb facs="tcp:6260:135"/>
mercie. Swa then, wald thou knaw, quhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy faith be ſtrong or not, quhither thy perſwaſion of Gods mercie, be ſtarke or not? Take tent to thy conſcience; gif thy conſcience bee hurt, aſſuredly thou will doubt; and gif thou doubt, thou can not haue ſicke a ſtrong perſwaſioun, as v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayis thou wald haue, gif thy doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting were away. Not that I wil haue faith to be ſa perfit in this life, that there be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies na doubting joined with it. I clame not to that perfection: but I ſay that ane hurt conſcience mann ever doubt, and the mair wee dout, the les is our perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Swa the mair thou hurt thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the leſſe faith thou hes. Then thou mann come to this point: Keepe mee a ſound conſcience; intertaine peace in thy conſcience, and thou ſall keepe faith, and ſal haue thy perſwaſion in that ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that thou hes of reſt and peace in thy conſcience: &amp; the mair that thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience bee at peace and reſt, the greater ſall thy faith and perſwaſioun be. Sa this ground halds faſt, ane doubting conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, makes a weake faith; and the mair the doubting in the conſcience bee, the weaker is the faith. Then the Apoſtle lies
<pb facs="tcp:6260:136"/>
not; quha ſays, that faith dwels in a good conſcience, that faith is locked and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpp in a good conſcience: Sa that gif ȝee keepe a good conſcience, ȝe ſal keepe a ſtrong faith; and gif ȝee hurt ȝour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ȝee ſall hurt ȝour faith. Nowe to make this mair ſenſible: How cann I bee perſwaded of his mercie, quhais anger I feel kendled againſt me, &amp; againſt whom my conſcience ſhewes me to bee giltie of manie offences. Na queſtion, ſa lang as the ſenſe of his anger, and feeling of my offences bides; I cannot haue a ſtarke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that he will be mercifull to me: but quhen I gett acceſſe to his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and ane ſight that hee hes forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me; then I begin to be perſwaded. Sa keepe a good conſcience, and thou ſall keepe faith; and the better that thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be, the ſtarker mann thy faith be.</p>
               <p>Then the hail exhortation that we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">

Bee ȝee in the ranke of great men, ȝee aught to tak tent to ȝour conſciences: Speciallie, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:136"/>
that the Lord hes placed ȝou in ane great calling: Ȝee haue mony thinges, quherein, ȝe aught to controle ȝour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. Ȝee aught to craue the aduiſe of ȝour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, or euer ȝe put ȝour hand to onie warke: In reſpect ȝee are bound in manifauld duties to God, and to ȝour inferiours: And na doubt, gif ſome of our great men had aduiſed weill, theſe diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions had not fallen out into their awn bodies. Thir oppresſions of the poore, thir deadlie feids, with their awin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, walde not burſt out in ſick ane heigh meaſure, gif they had aduiſed weil with their conſciences. But the Lorde, ſeeing thame take ſa little tent to their conſciences, hee ſpoyles thame of fayth, and of the hope of mercie: and out of queſtion, ȝee fall ſee their end miſerable; Ȝee ſall ſee thame ſpectacles of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God: they that hes eies to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauld it, ſall ſee the God of heauen, make thir men, quha gais ſa diſſolutly to wark, ſpectacles of his judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to the warld: For the Lord leaues not ſic men vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. Be theyr example, it were verie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſare, that men of inferiour rancks ſuld take tent to their conſciences: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:137"/>
let euerie man, according to his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, examine his calling, bee the rule of his conſcience. And ſpeciallie, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coms ȝou that are judges; It becoms ȝou, before ȝe pronounce, and gif forth judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to aduiſe with ȝour conſcience and law thereof, and in judgement, not to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ȝour affection, but to follow the rule of ȝour conſcience. Likewayis, ȝee that are of inferiour ranks to Iudges, and ȝee that are aduocats, controlle ȝour doings be ȝour conſcience, and giue not the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges nor ſubjects of this Countrey, juſt cauſe to complaine on ȝou: terrifie tham not, fra the pleading of juſtice be exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant prices, and extraordinair kind of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but moderate al ȝour actions ſa, that they agree with the rule of ȝour conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; that ſa farre as in ȝou lies, juſtice ceaſe not. This that I ſpeake to thame, I ſpeake to ȝou of the Merchand eſtait al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: See that ȝee looke not ſa meekle, to this or that, as to the conſcience that is in ȝou; quhat in conſcience ȝee may doe, according to the meaſure of knawledge, that God hes placed in ȝou: and quhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ȝee doe; beware, ȝee doe not againſt ȝour knawledge.

               <p>It hes pleaſed the Lorde, to poure this<note place="margin">Faith is the free gift of God.</note> liquour, this precious ointment in vs; ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſe we be earthly and lame veſſels, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb facs="tcp:6260:138"/>
creatures; ȝit it hes pleaſed our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious God, to poure ſic a precious liquor in our hearts and minds, and to concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite ſick ane jewell in our hands and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, that bee the vertue of this liquour, we may tak hauld on Chriſt, quha is our juſtice, our wiſedoome, ſanctificatioun, and redemption. Suppoſe we be miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures, ȝit the Lord of his mercie, hes a reſpect to vs in Chriſt, in giuing vs this precious liquour, quherby our ſauls may bee ſeaſoned to life euerlaſting. In this, that he powres it in our hearts, we ſee clearelie, that it growes not in our hearts, nor breeds not in our nature. Na, this gift of faith, is not at mans co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, nor vnder his arbitrament: as gif it lay in his hand to beleeue, or not to beleeue, as he pleaſes. It is the gift of GOD, poured downe freelie of his vndeſerued grace, in the riches of his mercie in Chriſt. That it is a gift, ȝee ſee clearelie, 1. COR. 12. 1. quhere the Apoſtle ſayis; and to an vther is giuen faith bee the ſame ſpirit: as alſo, PHIL. 1. 21. quhere hee ſayis: For vnto ȝou it is giuen for Chriſts cauſe, that not onelie ȝee ſuld beleeue in him, but alſo ſuffer for his ſake. Sa faith is the gift of
<pb facs="tcp:6260:138"/>
the halie Spirit: and this gift is not giuen to all men and women, as the Apoſtle plainelie declares: All hes not faith. This gift, ſuppoſe it be giuen, it is not giuen to all, but is onely giuen to the elect, that is, to ſa mony as the Lord hes appointed to life euerlaſting. This gift, quhere euer it is, and in quhat heart ſoeuer it bee, it is neuer idle, but perpetuallie working, and working weil by loue and charitie, as the Apoſtle ſayth. GAL. 5. 6. This gift, quher euer it bee, is not dead, but quicke and liuelie, as the Apoſtle IAMES ſaith, in his ſecond Chapter. And to let ȝou knawe, quhither it be liuely and working or not, there is not a waye, but to looke to the fruits and effects that flowes fra it: And therefore that ȝee, be ȝour awin effectes, may be the mair aſſured of the goodnes of ȝour faith: I will giue ȝou three ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall<note place="margin">Certaine ef<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fects quhere by ane may knaw, gif we haue faith.</note> effects to looke on, be the quhilk ȝe may judge vppon the goodneſſe of ȝour faith. Firſt of all, looke to thy heart, and caſt thine eie on it: Gif thou hes a deſire to pray, a deſire to craue mercy for thy ſinnes, to incall vpon Gods halie name for mercie and grace: gif there be ſick a thing in thy heart, as ane deſire to praie,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:139"/>
gif there be ony peece of thine heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, and hes a thirſt to ſeek efter mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and grace: ſuppoſe the greateſt part of thy heart repine, and wald draw thee fra prayer: ȝit aſſuredlie that deſire that thou hes in ony meaſure to prayer, is the true effect of the right faith. Gif thou haue a hart to pray to God, ſuppoſe this deſire be but ſclender, aſſure thy ſelf thy ſaull hes life: for prayer is the life of the ſaull, and maks the faith liuelie; for why? Praier is Gods awin gift; it is not our gift, for gif it were ours, it wald be euill. But it is the beſt gift that ever God gaue man, and ſa it mann be the gift of his awin ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit; and being his awin gift, it mann make our faith liuelie. Beſide this, thou art not able, nor thou dare not call vpon him, in quhom thou beleeues not, as the Apoſtle ſaith. ROM. 10. 14. For gif I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat him be praier, I mann truſt in him. Then praier is a certaine argument of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying faith and beleife in GOD: For I cannot ſpeake to him; let bee to pray to him, in quhome I truſt not: And ſuppoſe the heart be not fullie reſolued, and weill diſpoſed; ȝit gif there be ony part of the heart that inclines to praier, ſticke bee it;
<pb facs="tcp:6260:139"/>
it is a ſure gadge, that that part beleues. The ſecond effect, wherby thou ſal knaw, quhither faith bee in thee or not, is this; looke and aduiſe with thy ſelfe, gif thy heart cann bee content, to renounce thy rankour, to forgiue thy grudges, and that freelie for Gods cauſe: may this be done be thee? and will thou forgiue thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as freely as God hes forgiuen thee? aſſuredlie, that is the effect of the right Spirit; for nature could neuer giue that. There is nathing, quherevnto nature bends the ſelfe mair, nor to rankour and enuie; and there is nathing, quherein na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture places her honor mair guckedly, nor in priuie reuengement. Now gif thy hart bee ſa tamed and brought downe, that it wil willinglie forgiue the injurie for gods cauſe; that is the effect of the right Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite: This is not my ſaying; it is Chriſts ſaying, MAT. 6. 14. quhere hee ſaith: gif ȝee do forgiue men their treſpaſſes, ȝour heauenlie father wil alſo forgiue ȝou; and 15. verſe: but gif ȝee do not forgiue men their treſpaſſes, na mair wil ȝour heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Father forgiue ȝou ȝour treſpaſſes. Sa wald Chriſt ſay; he that forgiues wrangs, ſall get wrangs forgiuen him; but he that
<pb facs="tcp:6260:140"/>
wil reuenge his wrangs, wrang ſal be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged vppon him. Therefore, as thou wald bee ſpared in thy wrangs, doone to the mightie God; ſpare thou thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. I will not inſiſt; examine quhither ȝe haue faith or not; examine it be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, examine it bee the diſcharge of ȝour awin priuie grudges; for gif ȝee want thir effects: Ane heart full of rankour, an hart voyd of praier, is ane heart faithleſſe, and meet for hell. The third effect of faith is compasſion; thou mann bowe thy heart, and extend thy pitie, vpon the pure mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bers of Chriſts bodie, and ſuffer thame not to lacke gif thou haue: for except ȝee haue this compasſioun, ȝee haue na faith. Examine ȝour ſelfs bee thir three effects, and gif ȝee finde thir in onie mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; how beeit, it were neuer ſa ſmall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ȝou haue the right faith in ȝour hart, the faith that ȝou haue, is true and liuelie, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly God will be mercifull to ȝou.</p>
               <p>This faith of ours, ſuppoſe it be liuely, ȝit it is not perfect in this warld, but eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<note place="margin">Our faith man be continually nuriſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> day, and euery houre, it craues a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall augmentatioun, it craues euer to be nuriſhed: for the quhilk increaſe, the Apoſtles thame ſelfis, LVK. 17. 5. incalled
<pb facs="tcp:6260:140"/>
and ſaid: Lorde increaſe our faith. And our maiſter commaunds vs to pray, and ſay, Lorde increaſe our faith, I beleeue, Lorde helpe my vnbeliefe. Then Chriſts commaund lats vs ſee clearely, that this faith, miſters continually to bee nuriſhed and helped, and it cannot be helped, but be praier: ſa we ſuld alwayis continue in praier. That this faith ſuld be helped, and that wee ſuld bee perpetuallie vppon our garde, in feare and trembling to gett it augmented: the terrible doubtings, the wonderful pits of deſparatioun, into the quhilk, the deareſt ſeruaunts of God are caſten, dois clearelie teach: For the beſt ſeruants of God, are exerciſed with terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble doubtings in their ſaules, with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull ſtammerings, and they will bee brought at ſomtimes, as appears in their awin judgement, to the verie brinke of deſperatioun. Thir doubtings and ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings lets vs ſee, that this faith of ours wald bee perpetuallie nuriſhed, and that wee haue neede, continuallie to pray for the increaſe of it. It pleaſes the Lorde, at ſomtimes, to let his ſeruants haue a ſight of thame ſelfes, to caſt thame downe, and to let thame ſee, how ouglie ſinne is: It
<pb facs="tcp:6260:141"/>
pleaſes him, to let thame fall in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of ſinne, and to quhat end? Not that he wil deuour thame, or ſuffer tham to be ſwallowed vp be deſperation. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe EZEKIAH cries out, that like an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie lyon, the Lord is like to deuour him, &amp; bruiſe him in peces: ȝit the Lord ſuffers him not to diſpair. And ſuppoſe DAVID cry, I cannot away with his conſuming fire, I may not bide the fire of the Lordes ielouſie; ȝit he diſpairs not: But the Lord caſts his ſeruants very low; to quhat end? To the end, that they may feele in their hearts and conſciences, quhat Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for thame in the ȝarde, and on the croſſe, in ſaull and bodie: Ȝea, wee wald thinke, that there had bene plaine collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion betwixt the Father and the Son, and that his ſuffering had bene na ſuffering: except we felt in our ſauls in ſom meſure, the hell quhilk hee ſuſteined in full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Swa to the effect, that wee might clearelie vnderſtand the bitternes of ſin, that we might knaw, how far wee are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detted to Chriſt, quha ſuffered ſicke tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for our ſinne, and that we may be the mair able to thank him, and to praiſe his halie name: hee ſuffers his awin ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
<pb facs="tcp:6260:141"/>
to dout, but not to diſpair: he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giues thir doutings, he forgiues thir ſtam rings, and in his awn time, hee ſupports tham, and brings vs to the waters of life.</p>
               <p>Thir doubtings, as I haue oft ſpoken, may ludge in ane ſaul with faith; for dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting &amp; faith, are not extreamly opponed; Onelie faith and diſpair, are extreamelie<note place="margin">Doubting and fayth may ludge in ane ſaule.</note> opponed: and therfore, faith and diſpair, can not baith ludge in ane ſaule; for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair cuts the pillers of hope, and quher there is na hope, there cann bee na faith. But as to doubting, it mann ludge, it will ludge, and hes ludged in the ſaules of the beſt ſeruants that euer God had. Looke to the Apoſtle, we are alwayis in doubt, ſaith he, but we diſpair not. Sa, douting and faith may ludge in an ſaul: &amp; quher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fra flowes this doubting? We knaw, that in the regenerat man, there is a remnant corruptioun: For wee gett not our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in this earth: ſuppoſe we beginn our heauen heere, wee get it not fullie heere: And gif all corruption were away, quhat ſuld there reſt, but a full heauen heere? Sa it is onelie begun in this life, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited; therefore there remains in the ſaul, a great corruptioun, quhilk is neuer idle,
<pb facs="tcp:6260:142"/>
but continuallie occupied. This corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is euer bringing foorth the birth of ſinn, part leſſe, part mair; euerie ſin hurts the conſcience; ane hurt conſcience, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs the perſwaſion, and ſa comes in the doubting. For there is not a ſinne that we commit, but it banniſhes light, &amp; caſts a ſlough ouer the eie of our faith, quher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, wee doubt and ſtammer in our ſight. And were not the Lord of his mercy taks vs vp, giues vs the gift of repentance, and maks vs euery day, als oft as we ſin, to cry als oft for mercy, &amp; ſa to repair the loſſe that wee haue of faith, to repair the loſſe quhilk we haue of the feeling of mercie, we wald gang on, and halely put out that ſame light. But it pleaſes the Lorde; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we be euerie day ſinning, to giue vs the gift of repentance; &amp; be repentance, to repaire our faith, to repaire the ſenſe and feeling of mercie in vs, and to put vs in that ſame eſtait of perſwaſion, quhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we were off before. Therefore, gif God beginn not, continue not, and ende not with mercie: in that ſame moment, that he abſtracts his mercie fra vs, we will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caye.

This comfort and conſolation, the Spirite of God hes ſet downe in his word, to hald vp the troubled hart: that howſoeuer faith bee weake, ȝit a weake faith, is faith: and quhere that faith is, there mann euer bee mercie. Ȝee haue in ROM. 11. 29. that the giftes and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God, are without repentaunce. But amang all his giftes that are of this ſort, faith is ane of the cheefeſt, therfore it can not be reuoked againe. Ȝee haue in IVDE 3. that faith is ains giuen to the ſaints: ains giuen: that is, conſtantly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, neuer to bee changed, nor vtterlye tane fra thame. The Lorde will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent him of this gift, but the ſaul quhilk he hes luifit ains, he will luif perpetually<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is true and certaine, that the ſpoonks of faith quhilk are kindled in the hart be

Quhere this corruption burſtis furth in gros maner, efter that the Lord hes called thee: Look howe ſone the Lorde beginns to walken thee again: incontinent, thou fixes thine eies vpon thine awin life, and enters in a deepe conſideration, als weill of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity of thy ſinne; as of the weight of the wrath of God, quhilk thou ſeeis follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

As for the confirmation of my argument, that howſoeuer our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies bee lowſed to all diſſolutioun, efter our effectuall calling within vs in our ſauls, and that ȝit the ſpoonks are not i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, ȝee ſee, that ſuppoſe the fire bee co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with the aſſes; ȝit it is a fire: there is na man will ſay, that the fire is put out ſuppoſe it bee couered: Na mair is faith put out of the ſaull, ſuppoſe it be ſa coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it nather ſhawe hewe nor light outwardlie. Example of this wee haue clearlie in DAVID: Efter his lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oun
<pb facs="tcp:6260:144"/>
in that pſalme of repentance. PSAL. 51. 11. he prayes to God in thir terms: Caſt mee not away from thy preſence: And quhat ſubjoines hee? And tak not thine halie ſpirit from mee. Had he not loſt the Spirit, be his adultery and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Na: for hee walde not haue ſaide then, take it not from mee, but reſtore it to mee. It is true, he vſis ſick faſhion of language, as PSAL. 51. 12. he ſayes: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore to mee the joy of thy ſaluation: not that he lacked the Spirit healilie; but that the Spirit lacked force in him, and miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſtrengthening and fortification: It wald bee ſteered vp, that the flame of it might appeare. Therefore I ſaye, in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect DAVID ſayes ſa clearlie, efter his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie and murther; take not that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite from mee: it is a certaine argument, that the faithfull hes neuer the Spirite of GOD alwayes tane fra thame, in thair greateſt diſſolutions. The ſecond point is this; How proue I that thir ſpoonks are not idle, ſuppoſe the outward effects bee interrupted. As DAVID felt this in his conſcience, ſa euery ane of ȝou may feele it in ȝour awin conſciences. The Spirit of God in mans heart can not bee idle, but
<pb facs="tcp:6260:144"/>
thir ſpoonkes, in the mean time that the bodie is caſtin lowſe to all diſſolutions, thir ſpoonkes are accuſing thy diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are finding fault with thy manners: thir ſpoonkes ſuffers thee not to take the pleaſure of thy body, without great bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe, and continuall remorſe. And thir ſpoonkes quhere they are, they will make the ſaull quherein they dwel, to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thir voces, at ane time or vther; ains in the twentie fowre howres: Allas, I am dooing the ill quhilk I wald not doe, gif I hadd power or ſtrength to reſiſt my affectioun, and gif I might be maiſter of my affection, I wald not for all the warld do the ill quhilk I do. Againe, gif I had power to do the good quhilk I wald doe, I walde not leaue it vndoone for all the warld. Swa thir ſpoonkes, ſuppoſe they haue not ſick force and ſtrength preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, as to reſiſt the affection, and to halde the ill turnes vndone; ȝit perpetuallie in the heart, they are finding fault with thy corruption: and ſuffers thee not to take thy pleaſure without paine: but laſt of all makes thee to vtter thir voces: Gif I had ſtrength to reſiſt, I walde not doe the ill quhilk I do. Quhere thir voces are, na
<pb facs="tcp:6260:145"/>
queſtioun, they are the voces of a ſaull, quhilk the Lorde hes begun to ſanctifie: and being ains ſanctified, in deſpite of the Diuell, and of the corruption that is in vs, this faith ſhall neuer periſh: But gif the haill ſaull without contradictioun, with a greedie appetite and pleaſure bee caried to ill, and hes na ſorrow for it: that ſaull is in ane ill eſtait: I can look for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſick a ſaull but death; except that the Lord preuent tham. But quhere this remorſe and ſorrowe, and ſick voces are in the ſaull; that ſaul in the time that God hes appointed, ſall recouer ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth: The Lord ſall neuer ſuffer they ſpoonkes to be halilie tane awaye, but in his awin time he ſall fortifie tham, &amp; make thame to breake out before the warlde in good warks.

For, there is na man will thinke, that the fire quhilk is couered<note place="margin">Similitudes ſhewing that the ſpoonks of faith, ſupoſe they be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered are not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</note> with aſſes, is extinguiſhed; but being ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp in the morning, it will burne als clearlie, as it did in the night before.

Let thy heart fixe thy loue als lang as thou will vpon the creaturs, thou ſall neuer be ſatiat, nor thy affection ſall neuer be content, except thou get a grip of God. But gif ains thou loue God in thy hart, &amp; caſt thy affections vpon him, and get ains a grip of him: the langer thou loue him, the greater ſatiety &amp; con tentment ſall thou haue: thou ſall not thirſt for ane vther. For, as to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, there is neuer a creature that God created, but it is ſtamped with his awin ſtamp, and euery creature beares his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: and looking to the image of God in the creature, ſuld it not draw thee to him, that thou fixe not thy hart vpon the creature: for his awin image in his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature, ſulde lead thee to him ſelfe. And therefore the mair that thou knawes the creatures; the greater varietie of knaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that thou hes of the creatures, the
<pb facs="tcp:6260:149"/>
mair ſuld euery particular knawledge of thame drawe thee to God, and the mair ſuld thou wonder of thy God, and knaw thy duety towards him. And ſeeing that delite flowes of knawledge, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery knawledge, hes the awin delite with it: as the varietie of knawledge that riſes vpon the creatures, ſuld make the minde to mount vp to the knawledge of God: ſa the varietie of delites, that riſes vpon the diuerſitie of this knawledge, ſulde moue the heart vpwarde, to the loue of God: and the hart getting a grip of God and being ſeaſed with the loue of God: and the minde being occupied with the true knawledge of God; ſa ſone as heart and mind is full of God, the hart is quiet and the minde is ſatisfied. Sa that the mair this knawledge grows in thy mind, the greater contentment hes thou, &amp; the mair the loue of him growes in thy hart, the greater joy and rejoiſing hes thou in thy ſaull. For quhy? In God ȝe haue not only all the creatures: but ȝee haue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, beſide the creatures: And therfore in God, ȝe haue al the knawledge &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite that can riſe of the creatures: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the creatures, ȝe haue God himſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:6260:149"/>
quha is the Creator. And ſwa I ſay, the mind of man, can neuer quiet the ſelfe in the knawledge, nor the heart cann neuer ſettle the ſelfe in the loue of naked crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs, in reſpect they ar flowing &amp; vanitie, as SALOMON cals thame: but in the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite God, rightlie knawin, and earneſtlie loued; the mind ſall ſee a full reſt, and the heart ſall haue a perfite ioy. For our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is ſa inſatiable, that na finit thing will ſatisfie it, nor there can bee na ſolide ſetling vpon the thing that is tranſitori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Sa the loue aught to ſtrike vpward, and redound firſt to God, in quhais face, the heart ſall find full and perfite ioy.</p>
               <p>The ſecond argument that I vſe, is this:<note place="margin">Of loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our neighbour.</note> ſeeing there is only an precept left be our maſter in reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be obſerued be vs, to wit; that euery ane of vs ſuld loue anvther: Therfore our wiſe maſter, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding well, that quhere loue was, there miſterd na ma laws: that the life of man, be loue only behoued to be maiſt happy, left only the ſame in chief recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and taks vp the hail law &amp; euangell in a word, Loue. And gif the hart of man were indued with loue, his life might bee maiſt happy and bleſſed: For there is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:6260:150"/>
maks this life happy, but the reſem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blance &amp; likelyhood that wee haue with God. The nerer we draw to God, the mair bleſſed is our life; for there cannot be ſik a happy life, as the life of God. Now ſayis IOH. in his 1. epiſt. 4. 8. God is loue; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the mair we draw neere to loue, the mair neer ar we to that happy life: for we are in God, &amp; partaker of the life of God. Quhen I ſpeak this, ȝe mann not thinke, that loue in God, &amp; loue in vs, is an thing; for loue is but a quality in vs, &amp; it is not a quality in God; there is nathing in God but that quhilk is God; ſa loue in God, is his awin eſſence: Therefore, the mair ȝee grow in loue, the neerer ȝe draw to God, and to that happye and bleſſed life. For there is nathing mair profitable, mair a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable and conuenient to nature, nor to loue; and aboue al things to loue God: And therefore it is, that God and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are maiſt happy &amp; bliſt, becauſe they loue all thinges, and deſires ever to doe good. On the vther ſide, there is nathing mair vnhappy, nathing mair noyſum, mair hurtfull, and that eats vpp nature mair, nor to burn with envie and hatred, And heirfore it is, that the deuils ar maiſt
<pb facs="tcp:6260:150"/>
miſerable, quha torments thame ſelues with continual mallice and hatred, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with ane vehement appetite, to bee noyſum to all creatures. Sa as the life of the Deuill is maiſt vnhappy, becauſe hee is full of envie and malice: Siclike our life mann be maiſt happy, gif wee be full of loue. To ſpeake of loue I will na farder: Onelie gif ȝe haue loue, marke the effects of it, ſet downe 1. COR. 13. 4. 5. 6. 7. verſ. quhilk effectes, gif ȝee haue not in ſome meaſure, ȝee haue not true loue.</p>
               <p>I end heere, ȝee ſee in quhat points, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ane of ȝou aught to be prepared; ȝe<note place="margin">Concluſion with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation</note> mann bee indued with this loue, and ȝee mann bee indued with faith: and gif ȝee haue thir in onie ſmal meſure; gang bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the hearing of the word, and to the receauing of the Sacrament. This is the preparation that we allow of: I grant, the Papiſtes hes a preparatioun, but nathing like to this, and therefore they cann haue na warrand of the word of God. Laſt of all, ſeeing wee are commanded to try our ſelfs: he that lacks knawledge, cannot try himſelfe: A furious man cannot try him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: A childe cannot try himſelf: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they aught not to com to the Table.
<pb facs="tcp:6260:151"/>
All thir things being weill conſidered; he that hes faith &amp; loue in ony kind of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, let him come to the Table. And all thir things ſeruis, als weil for the hearing of the word fruitfully, as for the receuing of the Sacrament. Therefore, the Lord of his mercie illuminate ȝour mindes, and worke ſome meaſure of faith and loue in ȝour hearts: that ȝee may be partakers of that heauenly life, offered in the worde and Sacraments: that ȝe may begin ȝour heauen heere, and get the full fruition of the life to come, and that in the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous merits of Chriſt Ieſus: To quhom with the Father, and the halie Ghaiſt, be all honor, praiſe, and glorie, for nowe and euer:</p>
