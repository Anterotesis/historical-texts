            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, Compassion, for though we suffer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly, yet hee pityeth us in our misery.</p>
               <p>He is said to have bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of mercy, or tender mercy, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.78.</p>

               <p>If wee seeke him in the time of trouble, he will heare us, aud be mercifull to us.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Readinesse to pardon, <hi>Psal.</hi> 130.4.</p>
               <p>As <hi>David</hi> at first would not looke on <hi>Absalon,</hi> yet afterwards kissed him.</p>
               <p>A Father will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pardon a prodigall Son, returning, but put on him a robe, and a ring

and kill a fatted calfe, <hi>Lu.</hi> 15.22.</p>
               <p>There is joy and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in heaven, over one sinner that repenteth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Neither doth God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pardon small faults, but great sinnes.</p>
               <p>They say, if a man put away his wife, and shee goe from him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come another mans, shall hee returne unto her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? shall not that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers, yet returne againe unto me, saith the Lord, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 1.</p>

               <p>He is kind unto the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull, and to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.35.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Neither doth he onely grant pardon, but grace also; preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, following, compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing about on every side, <hi>Psal.</hi> 79.8. &amp; 23.6. &amp; 32.10</p>
               <p>Seventhly, What ever good worke we doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assisted by his grace, he will reward it.</p>
               <p>Hee crowneth us with
<pb facs="tcp:150548:112"/>
loving kindnesse, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.4.</p>
               <p>He is mercifull, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth us farre above what we deserve.</p>
               <p>He suffereth not a cup of cold water to be given without a reward.</p>
               <p>Eightly, Neither is he mercifull by nature one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but also by practice.</p>
               <p>Hee hath learned to be gracious, and shewed it for ever of old, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.6.</p>
               <p>We say rightly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Our Fathers trusted in thee, they trusted, and thou didst deliver them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.4.</p>
               <p>Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in
<pb facs="tcp:150548:112"/>
anger shnt up his tender mercies? <hi>Psal.</hi> 77.9.</p>
               <p>The Fountaine is not dryed up, his hands are not shortened, his eares are not heavy.</p>

               <p>Ninthly, As God shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mercy, so he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it: so saith <hi>David,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the word unto thy Servant, upon which thou hast caused mee to hope, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.49.</p>
               <p>For what if some did

               <p>But all these are as one

               <p>Procure thy Fathers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, give us what thou art thy selfe.</p>
               <p>Say to my Soule, I am thy salvation.</p>
               <p>Thy apostle hath not said in vaine, This is a faithfull saying and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world to save sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, of whom I am chiefe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.</p>
               <p>Where sinne abounded, grace did much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:150548:114"/>He hath concluded them all in unbeleife, that hee might have mercy upon all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32.</p>
               <p>He commandeth his love towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ dyed for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8.</p>
               <p>And another Apostle speaketh to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; Christ also hath once suffered for sinnes, the Just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18.</p>
               <p>So a third, Mercy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth against Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.13.</p>
               <p>And a fourth, if any man sin, we have an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
<pb facs="tcp:150548:115"/>
with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for our sinnes, and not for our sins onely, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for the sinnes of the whole world, 1 <hi>Io.</hi> 2.1,2.</p>
               <p>Yea, he himselfe saith, Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and I will give you rest <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28.</p>
               <p>I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.32.</p>
               <p>These words have not beene uttered in vaine, they cannot be so uttered</p>
               <p>Wherefore in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts
