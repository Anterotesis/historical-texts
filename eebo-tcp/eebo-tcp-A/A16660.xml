            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Haue long sought the expressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of my thoughts, which haue euer with all sinceritie tendred them yours: but how infirme is conceit without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demonstration?

I haue many times purposed to offer some <hi>vowes</hi> next to <hi>him,</hi> whose diurnall prouidence (if nought else should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce) and his <hi>Maiestie,</hi> whose <hi>Halcyon-raigne</hi> makes vs happy, vnto <hi>your Selfe,</hi> to giue argument of my loue, the exquisite Idea of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life; and now haue I seconded what I intended, though not in that perfection as my intirest wishes ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. It is a great defect (and I haue noted it) not in will but worke, nor in purpose but power, to see so many extended desires limit their issue to leane effects: which fareth vsually to best-affected dispositions, where affectionatest thoughts are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in silence for want of a tongue to discouer them. I will say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for much speech rather argues affectation, than intimacie of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: here be certaine <hi>Essaies</hi> or

               <hi>Obseruations,</hi> or what you will, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating vpon the <hi>fiue Senses,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as to their proper Obiects and Subiects they are limited: where you shall finde (as questionlesse you haue found in your selfe) the <hi>eares</hi> choicest harmonie to be Gods glory, the <hi>eyes</hi> cleerest vision his contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, the <hi>noses</hi> sweetest posie, the odours of his mercy; the <hi>tastes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull'st fullnes, meditation of his goodnesse; the <hi>Touches</hi> mouingst action, the <hi>feeling</hi> of his Passion. Many subiects I confesse excellently composed, whose Title deriues their essence from <hi>Essaies;</hi> but few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to these Obiects, which the devout Father termes those <hi>win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes</hi> which open to all vnbounded libertie; organs of weale or woe, happy if rightly tempered, sinister, if without limit. For in what erre wee and take not the occasion (as primitiue source) from one of these? The

fable of the Syrens had allusion to the <hi>eare,</hi> of Ixion to the <hi>eye,</hi> of Ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanta to the <hi>taste,</hi> of Mirrha to the <hi>smell,</hi> of Semele to the <hi>touch:</hi> where the <hi>eare</hi> not temperately restrained was soone inchanted, the <hi>eye</hi> lightly affected was to misery exposed, the <hi>taste</hi> for want of due relishing foyled her that was vanquishing, the <hi>smell</hi> too rankly breathing brought it selfe to perishing, the <hi>touch</hi> too highly aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, through her ambition fell to ruine. These were excellent types, and not vnbeseeming the purest and piercingst eye: now it rests, that I draw in my sailes, least my <hi>gate</hi> be too <hi>great</hi> for my <hi>worke,</hi> onely thus much I may confidently say,

to affectation: and that part (the curious modell of the eye) which ought of it selfe to be a directrice to all other Sences, becomes the principall organ of error to the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: there is a motiue of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes in the eye of man, more than in the eye of any other creature; a <hi>muscle</hi> which lifteth the eye <hi>vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> whereas others be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, bending <hi>downeward.</hi> Why should <hi>man</hi> then fix the eye of his delight on the creature, hauing his eye made to looke vp to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? The eye of our bodie, is like the orbe of the world; it moueth in the head, as the Sunne in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; take away the Sunne, and there is darknes; by the depriuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the eye, there ensueth blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Conceits by nature ripest, are euer wandringst: and the eye of all parts most eminent, is to obiects of all kindes most extended: though
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4898:6"/>
I gaze, till mine eye be dazled, yet is the desire of mine eye neuer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied: as the eye of all other Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is most needfull, so of all others it is most hurtfull: it findes an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of affection pretending Loue, when her ayme is cleane contrary, peruerted by lust; there is no pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage more easie for the entry of vice than by the cranie of the eye: there shee hath first acceptance, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilest entrance, and assuredst conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance. She hath first acceptance, because by the <hi>eye</hi> first entertained: facilest entrance, because of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers easiest to be induced: and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredst continuance, because once perswaded, not to be by any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue afterwards restrained. There is nothing so <hi>litle,</hi> that hath such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie of operations attending it; being moued by the <hi>obiect</hi> that it lookes vpon, to loue or hate. Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the minde receiue their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

impression by the <hi>eye</hi> of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; and soonest are they allayed, when the <hi>eye</hi> is most temperate. If the <hi>eye</hi> chance to be restrained, and want an <hi>obiect</hi> outwardly, it makes it self a mirror represented inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and sometimes <hi>Narcissus</hi>-like doates for want of a <hi>substance,</hi> on an imaginarie <hi>shadow</hi>: it is iealous, and that is the cause, it is euer prying into others secrets. He is a wise man, that carries his <hi>eyes</hi> in his head, making them his Sentinels: but he is foolish, that sends them out like <hi>spies,</hi> to betray his soule to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of vanitie. I haue heard <hi>some</hi> wish, that some space before their death, they might be depriued of their <hi>sight,</hi> inferring that the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Soule were aptest for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward contemplation, when the eye of the bodie was least conuersant in outward delectations. It is true; but why should the principallst mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4898:7"/>
and organ of thanks-giuing be an occasion to the minde of erring? I haue <hi>eyes</hi> to direct me by obiects outwardly mouing, to the affections of the soule inwardly working. It is against reason, that the greater light should be extinguished by the lesser; the <hi>eye</hi> of the soule, by the <hi>eye</hi> of the bodie. A candle burnes the darkest, when the Sun beames shut out the brightest: so should the <hi>eye</hi> of the bodie subiect her light to the soules beauty; that as the Sunne cheeres and renewes by his milde aspect, cleeres and purifies by his more piercing reflex; so the <hi>eye</hi> of the soule might cheere the bodie (if deiected) renew her (if decayed) and purifie her maleuolent affections (if corrupted.) Lastly, as the <hi>eye</hi> is the bodies guide, it should not be made a <hi>blinde guide</hi>; it should lead vs, and not in our straitings, leaue vs: as it chalkes vs

They say, the obiect of the <hi>eare,</hi> to wit, <hi>Melodie,</hi> is the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraing'st preseruatiue against Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4898:9"/>
which opinion is true, if grounded on the <hi>melodie</hi> of the heart: for externally sounding ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, though they allay the passion for an instant, the <hi>note</hi> leaues such an impression, as the succeeding dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content takes away the mirth that was conceiued for the present. The <hi>eare</hi> is an edifying sence, conveying the fruit of either morall or diuine discourse to the imagination, and conferring with iudgment, whether that which it hath heard, seeme to deserue approbation. A judicious and impartiall <hi>eare</hi> obserues not so much who speakes, as what is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; it admires not the externall habit with the garish vulgar, but the force of reasons, with what likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood produced. If <hi>Herod</hi> speake, hauing a garment glittering like the sunne, the light-headed multitude will reuerence <hi>Herod,</hi> and make him a deitie, not so much for his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4898:9"/>
                  <hi>speech,</hi> for that is common, as for his apparell, to them an especiall motiue of admiration. Such as these (the common sort I meane) haue their <hi>eares</hi> in their <hi>eyes:</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they heare spoken, if they approue not of the <hi>person,</hi> it skils not; such a neere affinitie haue the <hi>eare</hi> and the <hi>eye</hi> in the vulgar. A discreet <hi>eare</hi> seasons the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, marshals the rest of the sences wandring, renewes the minde, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring her to all difficulties, cheeres the affections, fortifying them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all oppositions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> those be the best <hi>Forts,</hi> and impregnablest, whose seats, most opposed to danger, stand in resistance against all hostile incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, brauely bearing themselues with honour, in the imminencie of danger. Such be the <hi>eares,</hi> they are planted in the high-rode-street, and exposed to a world of incursions; Scandall, than which nothing more
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4898:10"/>
swift, nothing more frequent shoots her arrowes, detracting by aspersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the excellentest modell of perfection: yet a resolued <hi>eare</hi> (like an other <hi>Antomedon</hi>) tempers the heat of her passion, by recourse had to herselfe and the sinceritie of her owne reputation. There is no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord so harsh to a good <hi>eare,</hi> as the discord of the affections; when they mutine one against another; for shee heares how <hi>a kingdome diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded cannot stand.</hi> I heare many things I would not heare, yet being enforced to heare them, I meane to make this vse of them; that hearing what moueth detestation to me in an other, I may be cautioned not to represent that to an other in my selfe. As the <hi>Martin</hi> will not build but in faire houses: so a good <hi>eare</hi> will not entertaine any thing with an approued iudgment, but what is faire in it selfe, and confers an equall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4898:10"/>
benefit vnto others. As of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues none more eminent than <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi>; so no sence of all others more accommodate than <hi>Hearing</hi> vnto <hi>Iustice.</hi> It is an excellent commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, which the Historian giueth to that princely Monarch and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the worlds sole Monarch, <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi>; that after <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> of the <hi>Plaintffe,</hi> he would euer keepe one <hi>eare</hi> open for the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi>; a prerogatiue princely and worthy the management of <hi>her</hi> affaires, that is princesse of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. But as best things peruerted, proue the worst; so fares it in <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi>; many haue eares, who <hi>Mydas</hi>-like are depressed to earths obiects: erect them how can they, hauing their <hi>attention</hi> fixed on the basest of subiects? with how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared an eare come these to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of a <hi>scarce Summer?</hi> how apt these be to heare report of a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4898:11"/>
young <hi>scape-thrift,</hi> ready to vnstrip himselfe of a faire inheritance vpon any termes? how vnworthy tidings these be for so diuine an Herald? The <hi>Eare</hi> is one of the actiuest &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borioust faculties of the soule: pitty then it is that the soule should be by her intangled, or by her meanes to such base subiects enthralled, being for the succour of the soule princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally ordained. I haue thought long time with my selfe, how I should imploy this <hi>Sence</hi> best for my soules aduantage: wherein I tooke a sur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uey of all those subiects, to which this peculiar sence of <hi>Hearing</hi> was especiallest extended; and I found the <hi>Eare</hi> much delighted with <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke</hi>; but finding it but an aërie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, breathed and expired in one instant, I thought there was no abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for my <hi>attentiue Sence</hi>; fitter to be employed in a delight more permanent. Presently I made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4898:11"/>
to the acts of Princes, and gaue my <hi>Eare</hi> to the discourse of fore-past exploits: Subiects I found well deseruing my <hi>attention,</hi> mouing me to imitation, and eying my own weaknesse with their puissance, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing me to admiration. But rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to my selfe with this expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latorie discourse; Where be those eminent and memorable Heroës, whose acts I haue heard recounted? where those victorious Princes, whose names yet remaine to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie recorded? and <hi>hearing</hi> no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther answer, saue that they once <hi>were,</hi> and now are not, I wayned my <hi>eare</hi> from such a subiect, as one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had power to giue vnto the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable a name, but no essentiall being. From hence trauersing my ground, I descended (a descent I may terme it, being a studie of lesse height, though of more profit) to the discourse of the Lawes: where
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4898:12"/>
I found many things in their owne nature worthily approued, by the <hi>Prescription</hi> of time, and <hi>Proscription</hi> of conscience to be strangely depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: here me thought, I saw the Poets <hi>Arachne,</hi> spinning webs of so different a warpe, that <hi>great Flies</hi> might easily breake out, while <hi>litle ones</hi> suffered, strange vnctions able to cast Iustice on an <hi>Euphuus</hi> slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; motions made to moue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions twixt party and party. Here was no employment for my <hi>Sence,</hi> desiring rather a direction in her way to eternitie, than to haue partiall-guilt corruption her best Solicitor in this vale of misery. Whilest I was thus roving, seeking for a <hi>Pylot</hi> to giue free and safe waf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to my vnharbored <hi>Sence,</hi> at last after many tempestuous occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, my afflicted mindes perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I fixt anchor, and by the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Reason,</hi> got what I sought
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4898:12"/>
for, a quiet harbour. And where may I limit or how confine the straying circle, of many perplexed and confused thoughts wherewith I am surprized, within so blest a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod? Not by the <hi>appetite,</hi> for that slaues the best of man to vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est ends: nor by the obedience of my owne proper will, for that I found perverted by ayming at indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect obiects: nor by <hi>ambition,</hi> which alwaies (as <hi>Pindarus</hi> defined her, was accompanied with danger in assaying, impatience in prosecuting, and an opposition of expectance in atchieuing: nor by the <hi>Vsurers Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender,</hi> for there is Auarice, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit infirmitie of old age haling, many a poore-prodigall Wittall cursing, and an inward corasiue, worse than any outward affliction, tormenting: Nor by the <hi>Courtiers fawning,</hi> where times be obserued, fashions imitated, good-cloths ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4898:13"/>
and the onely-generous qualitie is to be phantasticall-idle: Nor by the <hi>country-Farmers engros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi> where many a poore Orphans teare accusing, many a desolate widowes complaint contesting, and the hunger staru'd soule witnessing, make <hi>him</hi> of all others most wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in that his <hi>Nabal</hi>-securitie makes him obdurate. <hi>These</hi> are not guides to lead my <hi>directing Sence</hi> to her harbour; she is not for earth; her Musicke is mixt with too many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords. The worlds harmonie to a good Christian <hi>eare,</hi> may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to that of <hi>Archabius</hi> the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter, who had more giuen him to cease than to sound: so harsh is the sound of this world in the <hi>eare</hi> of a diuinely-affected soule. A good <hi>eare</hi> will not say, as the powerfull audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or incorrigible sinner, saith to his Preacher; <hi>Speake to vs pleasing things,</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4898:14"/>
of reall delights planted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue. First, shall be that delight, which depriued the first Angell of his eternall delight, to wit, <hi>Pride</hi>; whereby we become like <hi>Cinnamon-tree,</hi> whose rinde is better than all the bodie. Hence is it we desire to reforme the workmanship of God, becomming polishers of nature, garnishers of corruption, and proud of our shame. And how should we thinke, that God will respect vs, who haue disfigured his owne simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, and so disguised our selues as he can hardly know vs? There is no workman, that regardeth or estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his owne workmanship after it is translated and transposed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and wee becomming crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of our owne making, shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing natiue modestie with a dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blush, seeme to translate that amiable forme and proportion, which was giuen vs by our Creator,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4898:14"/>
to an vgly and promiscuous habit, extracted like <hi>Flaccus</hi> crow, from the phantasticke invention of all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. The ancient law obserued, that such as had a <hi>yellow locke</hi> vpon their leprous parts, were not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort with other people; though we want that <hi>yellow locke,</hi> the apparent token of leprosie, yet we haue a <hi>yellow band,</hi> and other running sores of vanitie. Far be this <hi>vice</hi> from the mansion of my soule, lest her speedy surprisall, depriue me of all: and euer may the consideration of my owne weaknesse, restraine me from the least conceit of aspiring arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance. Next of <hi>pleasure,</hi> shall be sensuall delights, the vaine obeying of our owne affections, the soules bane, the bodies vlcer, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils watch bell. We are rocked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe, and sit dandled on the knee of an impudent strumpet; as <hi>Babels</hi> subversion proceeded from the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4898:15"/>
height of her sinne; so this linke of impietie, by which death and ruine is haled along to vs, promiseth sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion to the possessor, the best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward her serpentine embraces, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate affections, and obsequious delights can propose to her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants. Shall my <hi>eare</hi> be intangled with her soules staine? or prostitute her <hi>attention</hi> to so odious a subiect? shall my <hi>Sence of Direction</hi> tend to my subversion? or the bodies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structresse (like a blinde guide) throw her headlong to confusion? No, I will not engage so excellent an hostage as my soule, for the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-sweet of a repenting pleasure. Reason tells me, that <hi>pleasure</hi> merits onely that title, when it is relished with vertue; nor can sensualitie sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate the delight of the <hi>intellectuall part,</hi> when it is confined to imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited respects. This I will make my position, in the bent of my resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4898:15"/>
I meane onely so far to obey my delights, as the after-hope of my soule may not be abridged, the future ioy in the expectance of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne happinesse, impayred: but that my <hi>Sence</hi> to reason subiected, may in the sweet concord of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward contemplation drawne from her creator, apprehend an exceeding pleasure, to haue done any thing pleasing to her maker. Can I finde in rich coffers (the misers idols) any true obiect to plant this excellent organ? ô no, the corruption of coine is the generation of an vsurer, or a lowsie begger. For the <hi>first,</hi> I loue my soule too wel, for so meane &amp; base a traffick to hazard a gem so incomparable: heau'n is the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle I desire to dwell in, but so far is that <hi>Mansion</hi> from the conceit of our English Iew, or oppressing Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, as he chuseth rather to liue in the tents of <hi>Kedar</hi> with the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4898:16"/>
issue of <hi>Dathan,</hi> than by hauing <hi>Lazarus</hi> scrip, to be carried after to <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome. Rightly was his experience grounded, who said; that the multitude of Physicians and Lawyers are the signes of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered state; but the number of Vsurers and their factors, is the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of a fatall disease raigning: For the <hi>second,</hi> to wit, Beggery; I know not what to thinke on't: It is a beneficiall trade, where <hi>impudence</hi> marshals it: but a shamefast beggar (saith <hi>Homer</hi>) neuer yet could liue on his profession. I could wish a more temperate harbour; neither too <hi>rich,</hi> lest the fulnes of my estate make me insolent; nor too <hi>poore,</hi> lest the consideration of my want, force me to some course exorbitant. <hi>Pauperis est</hi> (saith the Poet) <hi>nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare pecus:</hi> but <hi>boni est</hi> (saith Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid) <hi>numerare dies:</hi> it shall be my arithmeticke, my golden number.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4898:16"/>
But stay, let me reduce my thoghts, and in the consideration of my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempred and indisposed affections, propound to my selfe a <hi>forme</hi> which I may obserue, a <hi>line</hi> by which I may direct my course, and a <hi>centre,</hi> where I may end my distance; than a <hi>Caueat</hi> which may restraine me, an <hi>obseruance</hi> to conduct me, and a <hi>reason</hi> drawne from an inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to divert me. and thus I expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulate; why would I not be <hi>rich?</hi> why no extortioner? why no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressor? why no biting vsurer? Rich I would not be, lest I should admire my owne fortunes, and after admiration fall to idolatrize, and then where should I plant my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expectance? it is hard for a Cammell to goe through the eye of a needle, and more difficult for a gold-adoring Mammonist to enter heauen. <hi>Extort</hi> I would not, for I know there be vialls of wrath ready
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4898:17"/>
to be powred downe on the <hi>Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner:</hi> and though the wicked for a while flourish like the greene <hi>Bay-tree,</hi> time will come, when his place is not to be found. <hi>Oppresse</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, when I heare the Orphans teare, the widdowes curse, the poore mans prayer, the hunger-strau'd soule: for I know the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans teares will be botled, the widdowes curse effected, the poore mans praier receiued, &amp; the hunger-staru'd soule reuenged.

but such as haue a fore-head glazed with impudencie, will triumph in their owne defects, or boast of their owne imperfections? doth the <hi>Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocke</hi> glory in his foule feete? doth he not hang downe the taile when he lookes vpon them? doth the Bucke, hauing befiltht himselfe with the female, lift vp his horns, &amp; walke proudly to the lawnes? ô no; he so hateth himselfe, by reason of the stench of his commixture, that all drooping and languishing into some solitary ditch, he with drawes himselfe and takes soile, and batheth till such time, as there fall a great shower of raine, when, being throughly washed and cleansed, he posteth backe to his foode. If such apprehension of shame appeare in brute beasts, what should <hi>his</hi> be, that is made Lord and gouernour of all beasts? is this <hi>liuinge sence,</hi> this vitall faculty, this indiuiduate
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:4898:20"/>
propertie made a rubb in our way to immortality? Doth that by which we liue, cut from vs all means of liuing hereafter? miserable then is our <hi>Sence,</hi> when without all sence of sinne, we become depriued of the sence of glory. This Sence of <hi>Touch</hi> may be reduced to those three ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, wherein our vnderstanding is summarily emploied: the <hi>Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> the <hi>Irascible,</hi> and the <hi>Concupisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> The <hi>Intelligible,</hi> whereby we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the end of our creation, whereby we iudge of causes and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, <hi>touching</hi> with the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue hand of iudgement, what may concerne vs, and the state wherein we are interested. The <hi>Irascible,</hi> when stirred vp with ire or indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we prosecute reuenge, not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the least disgrace without an intended requitall. The <hi>Concupisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> when in an ambitious desire of honour or estate, or lustfull satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4898:21"/>
of our owne illimited affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we couet this or that, ardent in pursuing, and least contented, when obteining that we haue pursued the <hi>vnderstanding</hi> if rightly seated, like a wise Pylot steres the ship, saues her from splitting, mannaging all things with a prouident respect had, of what may come after. No Syren can tempt this wise and subtile <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisses</hi>: though the sea looke neuer so faire, this wise and temperate mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is suspicious of it, knowing, Where the Sea lookes the whitest, oftimes the periloust rocks, and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitablest shelfs are seated. She sinks, plumms, and tryes the shaldes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apt for nauigation or noe: in briefe she doth nought without se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious premeditation, &amp; fore-thinks of the meane, ere she attaine the end. She affects not curiosity either in words, habit, or manners; yet vertuously curious how to expresse
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4898:21"/>
herselfe truely honourable in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments, without aspersion of scandall. She will not disguise her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in an vnhonest couer, but affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Plainenesse,</hi> teacheth the same rule and precept to her followers, which Iesu the sonne of Syrach taught: <hi>Ne accipias faciem aduersus faciem tuam:</hi> not to be dooble faced, but with sincere plainenesse, such as thou art, such do thou seeme. A rule far more accomodate to the course of vertue, and more directly lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the seate of glory, then all the pollicies which euer <hi>Machauell</hi> yet inuented, or the dissembling ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of all obseruing Timists. Though <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> in Rome kept the people in awe, and subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to what tirannous lawes he pleased, vnder pretence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with <hi>Aegeria; Minos</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> vnder colour he was inspired in a certaine hollow caue by <hi>Iupiter</hi>;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4898:22"/>
and <hi>Pallas</hi> in a counterfeite habit, deceaued <hi>Claudius,</hi> in the adoption of <hi>Nero.</hi> This deuine essence of the soule, (the <hi>vnderstanding part</hi>) will assume no other forme then as she is: knowing her perfection cannot be made more accomplished by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie borrowed colours. She vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands her selfe to be composed of a more deuine element, then to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect her will to vnworthy ends; for she knowes, that as the <hi>Sence</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersant in outward things, she is sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in inward things, not directed by the eye of the <hi>Body,</hi> which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times deceued, but by the eie of the <hi>Soule,</hi> which alwaies aimeth at one certaine scope, to wit, immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, She considereth the ends, which mortality aimes at; honour, ample territories, great possessions, popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar respect, and long life, to enioy these without disturbance, and she makes vse of these with a penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4898:22"/>
iudgment, apprehending wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ends of these externallie-see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming goods confer. <hi>Honour</hi> (saith she) is quickly fading, and an aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring spirit, like the loftie <hi>Cedar,</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer subiect to most danger; when like <hi>iacks</hi> in a virginall, or <hi>nailes</hi> in a wheele, the fall of one is the rising of another. <hi>ample teritories and great possessions</hi> (saith she) are more then nature requireth; she is content with a competent; and that competency reduced to a very narrow scantling, when of all our drosse, estate, tresure and possessions, going downe into the earth, nothing shall you take with you: you shall carrie no more hence, <hi>Nisi parua quod vrna capit,</hi> but a coffin, and a winding sheete. When <hi>Saladine</hi> that puissant empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of <hi>Persia,</hi> with many victorious and successiue battails, had exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the limits of his Empire, and through the happinesse of his warrs

being neuer in any one pitcht field vanquished, become the sole terror of the Easterne part, at last fell mortally sicke, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing how there was no way but one with him, called his <hi>Chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> and commanded him (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bin chiefe Leader in all those prosperous warres, which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror had atchieued) to take his <hi>shrowding-sheet,</hi> and to hang it vpon a staffe in manner of a banneret, and with it, to proclaime in the streets of Damascus, <hi>This is all that Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine, the Emperor of Persia, hath left of his many conquests, this is all he hath left of all his victories. Long life</hi> (saith shee) is not worth desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, since it giues but increase to a multitude of sorrowes; she prefers a <hi>good life,</hi> before a <hi>long life,</hi> and esteemes that life best beyond all comparison, which is exercised in the vse of her creation. Shee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4898:23"/>
with the Philosopher, <hi>Opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum est aut non omnino nasci, aut quàm cito mori</hi>; making life the Theatre of shame if abused, but the eminent passage from a <hi>pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> to a <hi>permanent Citie,</hi> if right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed. To be briefe, she meditates of nought, affecteth nought, entertaineth nought with a free will, and a pure consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted desire, but what tastes of the spirit, hauing her eare barraca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doed against the insinuating de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of euery seducing appetite; shee is not of the world, though in the world; nor can shee loue any thing within the worlds cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, in regard, the world hath her limits, but shee not to be confined.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Irascible</hi> is attended al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies vpon by <hi>Reuenge</hi>: for the obiect of the wrathfull facultie is honour and aduantage, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4898:24"/>
if this cease, straight-waies courage and stomach decay, so as the least argument of distast, like another <hi>Silla</hi> stirrs her blood, and makes vp a Centaures banquet. This <hi>Facultie</hi> is alwaies as ready to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend an occasion of punishing (yea before it is offered) as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the meanes of executing, when the occasion is ministred. She will not say with that noble Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Duke; <hi>It is sufiicient for a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Prince, to haue power to reuenge, that his enemies may haue cause to feare him.</hi> No, meditation vpon reuenge is the onely prayer-booke, that this vnbounded passion vseth. Yet may this <hi>part</hi> rightly tempered include in it an excellent good: for <hi>Anger</hi> is not alwaies vnto sinne: whence it is said, <hi>Be angry, but sinne not.</hi> Wee may be <hi>angry</hi> through zeale, and the feruencie we beare to the Gospell: Christ was <hi>angry,</hi> when
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4898:24"/>
he whipped the buyers and sellers out of the Temple: he was <hi>angry,</hi> when his Disciples contended for prioritie; he was <hi>angry</hi> at the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie of the Gentiles, the obdura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Iewes; yea he was <hi>angry</hi> at the barren fig-tree, when it brought out no fruit, and therefore cursed it, shadowing thereby the fruitlesse synagogue. O may my soule, if euer shee be <hi>angry, feele</hi> this passion in the feruent loue shee beares to her Creator: may her <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> be against her selfe, in the wofull remembrance of her sins; that her <hi>anger</hi> may breed a detestation, dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station a reconciliation to her Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. But for such as with the <hi>Beare</hi> cannot drinke, but they must bite the water, far may my soule be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided from their dwelling: I will be <hi>angry,</hi> but commit no sin, for the God of Sion hath prescribed mee a forme, to be <hi>angry</hi> for the zeale of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4898:25"/>
Gods house, wherin is no sin.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Concupiscible</hi> is as the rest, of it selfe indifferent; and as a line in a circle, equally tending to either part of good or euill: yet so depraued is man become, that <hi>Medea</hi>-like, he is euer more prompt to take the worse rather than the better: here the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous</hi> miser couets to engrosse an huge estate to himselfe, making his purse the diuels mouth, and with his hydroptick conscience, though euer purchasing, yet euer coueting. Here the <hi>ambitious</hi> man displaies his own humor to the eye of the world, of whom I may say, as was once said of one puffed vp with the like spirit: <hi>Quod habere non vult est valde bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, quod esse non vult, hoc est bonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> that is good which he desires not to haue, that is good which he would not haue come to passe; so exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant is the desire of the <hi>ambitious,</hi> as what he desires is nothing lesse then
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4898:25"/>
vertuous: here the <hi>Merchant</hi> aymes at an exceeding gaine in trafficke; he sliceth the seas, opposeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to all dangers, all distempra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of winde and weather, euer vsing this <hi>concupiscible part,</hi> desiring a happy fraught for his aduenture. Here the <hi>Warriours</hi> desire is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to gaine by the spoile of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. euen the basest mechanicke offices be conuersant in this facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ayming at some especiall end, whereto their labors be directed. To couet things temporarie, planting our affections on them, is discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant from the right vse of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent facultie: there is a <hi>good</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnes, and it is heauenly; there is a <hi>good</hi> theft, and it is heauenly; there is a <hi>good</hi> ambition, and it is heauenly: The good and godly <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous</hi> couet not with <hi>Demas,</hi> nor <hi>Magus,</hi> nor <hi>Demetrius</hi>; they couet righteousnes, sobrietie, temperance,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4898:26"/>
yea all vertues which confer to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane perfection; there is but one <hi>pearle</hi> of esteeme, and to purchase it, they sell all that they haue; this is a happy couetousnesse, a glorious merchandise: the good and godly <hi>thiefe</hi> cares not for embezling earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treasure; for he knowes mothes will corrupt it, rust will consume it, and continuance of time will deface it; it is that immortall treasure which he would <hi>steale,</hi> for he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues how it is subiect to no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but continues in the same state euer. Againe, he reads, <hi>the kingdom of heauen suffers violence,</hi> and rather then he will loose it, with all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence he meanes to pursue it. The good and godly <hi>ambitious</hi> ayme not at worldly honour, but as a subiect incomparably aboue all externall seeming happinesse: for they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how it is better to be a doore-keeper in the Lords house, than to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4898:26"/>
be conversant with Princes. Happy <hi>theefe,</hi> whose theft is heauen; blessed <hi>couetousnesse,</hi> to couet heauen; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>ambition</hi> to aspire to heauen; may this <hi>Theft</hi> be my soules disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; this <hi>Couetousnesse</hi> her exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise; this <hi>Ambition</hi> her prize: so like the <hi>good Theefe,</hi> may shee be crowned, with the godly-couetous <hi>Zacheus</hi> rewarded, and with the heauenly-aspiring soule exalted. How happy shall I be in this <hi>Sence</hi> (the life of humane essence) if by vsing these <hi>three faculties</hi> of my soule sincerely, I shall at last attaine to the state of glory? yet how much is this <hi>Sence,</hi> especially conuersant in these three subiects, perverted, and violently wrested from her own nature? where such as desire to <hi>touch</hi> the Arke, make this Sence the instrument of their fall: others <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hezai</hi>-like, whose beating pulse will not forgo the <hi>touch</hi> of gold, though
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4898:27"/>
they purchase it by a leprosie. O how many fall by this <hi>Sence of life,</hi> making it their sence of death? <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi> apples were but <hi>touched,</hi> and to dust and ashes they were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: the fairest of all our vanities be but <hi>Sodoms apples,</hi> they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the <hi>touch,</hi> for they are painted and adulterate. Far be my <hi>Sence</hi> estranged from so prophane a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: <hi>Vertue,</hi> as it needs no colour to garnish it, so can it endure the <hi>Touch,</hi> and neere be changed. It is shee that shall attend my <hi>Sence,</hi> so as <hi>touching</hi> her intellectually, my soule by so sweet an apprehension, may be incorporate in her indiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually. Here is my <hi>liuing Sence</hi> well satisfied, and in this harbour planted, she will neuer desire to be remoued: for affliction is ended, discontent cheered, and a perfect rest, without interruption, by her that is the true essence of delight, proposed.</p>

                  </note> sith hence came our greefe, hence our mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: when I represent her before my eyes, my eyes become blinded with weeping, remembring my gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame <hi>Eue,</hi> how soone she was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to <hi>taste</hi> that shee ought not. Hence doe I imagine (imagination is the end of man) how pure I had bin, if this one <hi>Sence</hi> had not corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted my pristine innocencie: <hi>apples</hi> are suspicious to me, being the first that depraued me. I will rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staste mine owne <hi>palate</hi> to giue true rellish to my soules appetite, than by satisfying the <hi>first,</hi> corrupt the puritie of the <hi>latter.</hi> By the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of this <hi>Sence,</hi> I apprehend
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4898:28"/>
the vniuersal delights of this world, and as in the <hi>Palate,</hi> so finde I in them a distinct operation. Many things hot in the mouth, are cold in the stomacke: such are word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleasures: hot they are in the first pursuite or assault, and eagerly are they followed: but in the <hi>sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke,</hi> that is, when digested and rightly pondered, how cold are those <hi>Pleasures,</hi> being attended on by remorse, and obserued by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Againe, hence doe I gather the frailty and breuity of all earthly pleasures? Whatsoeuer ministers singular'st content vnto our <hi>appetite,</hi> is no longer satisfieing then in the <hi>palate</hi>; for after going into the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, that content is done. So de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights momentany, and limitarie to an instant, may for the present yeild a satisfaction, but how soone be these ioyes extinguished, how soone forgotten? This <hi>Sence</hi> cautions me
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4898:28"/>
of two <hi>Sects,</hi> the <hi>Epicure</hi> and <hi>Pitha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorist,</hi> the <hi>first</hi> by too much excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the <hi>latter</hi> by too much restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; the <hi>Epicure</hi> puts his mony in his belly, as the <hi>Miser</hi> doth his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his purse: but the <hi>Pithagorist</hi> neither cares for belly nor purse, scrupulously abstayning from that which was ordained for his vse. The <hi>fiue Sences</hi> (saith one) be our greatest sleepers; yet I may affirme that this <hi>Sence</hi> neuer sleepeth; for there is nothing seemingly-sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, which she apprehends not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with free <hi>taste</hi> or <hi>distaste.</hi> Of all others, this <hi>Sence</hi> produceth the diuerst qualities: whence it is we say, <hi>Like lips, like lettice:</hi> where this facultie, either by an indisposition of the bodie, or a distinct operation in the subiect, showes this pleasing and acceptable to one, which is noysome and different to an other. This <hi>Sence</hi> must haue the bodie and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4898:29"/>
minde prepared, before shee can rightly show her owne power; she admits of no distemper, suffers no restraint: whence it is, that we finde by experience, where the bodie is not equally disposed, this <hi>facultie</hi> hath much of her operation impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The best <hi>taste</hi> is to distaste sin, and the worst <hi>taste</hi> is to affect that, which confers to the soulea distaste of all <hi>tastes</hi> inherent in all subiects, none lesse distinguishing than the hungry-mans <hi>taste:</hi> which may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in those miserable famines of <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; ratts, mice, weasels, and scorpions were no common mens iunkets; where mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly loue renounced her name, and became the ruine of that shee should cherish; as the Matron <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam,</hi> who constrained for her liues supportance (though shee had but one sonne) killed and rosted him. Hence comes it, that necessitie hath
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4898:29"/>
no law, nor hunger needs no sawce. Let my <hi>Taste</hi> be directed by reason, and not by sence. <hi>Reason</hi> may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten her, and make her distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of desires; but <hi>Sence</hi> perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xeth her, and subiects the better part to a slauish <hi>appetite.</hi> Many haue exceeded in the vse of this <hi>Sence,</hi> but few restrained their desires with moderation. More <hi>Cleopatra's</hi> than <hi>Cornelia's,</hi> more <hi>Vitellij</hi> than <hi>Vticae,</hi> more <hi>Sileni</hi> than <hi>Salustij:</hi> ancient and moderne replenish vs with sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this nature; where violent ends euer attended the immodera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Princes, but healthfull liues, and ioyfull periods summ'd vp the dayes of the temperate. The <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> giue vs instance of these in themselues; amongst which there appeares one more memorable: <hi>Domenico Syluio</hi> his Duchesse, was so delicate a woman, as she would haue <hi>dew</hi> gathered to make her
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4898:30"/>
                  <hi>Baine</hi> withall, with many other curious perfumes and tricks; yet before her death her flesh did rot, so as no creature could come neere her. May my <hi>Taste</hi> be seasoned with no such delicacie: let my affection rather disclaime herselfe, than vndo my soule by intemperate subiects. I will not care so much to <hi>taste</hi> what I loue, as what I hate; for I know my selfe more subiect to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet in the one, than in the other. I haue <hi>tasted</hi> most of inferior de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, yet in a generall suruey of all my pleasures, I cannot chuse but weepe, to remember how those delights which I affected, produce no other fruit but <hi>Repentance.</hi> The <hi>taste</hi> of vice to a mortified affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is like sweet meats to him that is in an ague: <hi>shee</hi> is distastfull, and becomes more odious, in that shee cloaths delight with an habit of wantonnesse. I will chuse with
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:4898:30"/>
holy <hi>Hierome,</hi> to build me a cell in the desart, to liue out of the heat of concupiscence, rather than by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in the eye of the world, enthral my reasonable part to the appetite of <hi>Sence. Taste</hi> ingenders delight: I will not <hi>taste</hi> euery thing I like, lest late repentance force me to distaste that which I liked. I will fore-see the end, ere I approue of the means, that grounding on a <hi>golden meane,</hi> I may attaine a glorious end. No tempting delight shall feede my <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite:</hi> for as <hi>preuention</hi> is the life of policie; so temptation, if consented to, is the passage to miserie. Fowles of the ayre, though neuer so empty-stomackt, flie not for foode into open pit-falls:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quae nimis apparent retia, vitat avis.</hi> My soule shall imitate the bird, that she may escape (like the bird) out of the hand of the Fowler. How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py were I, if I would <hi>taste</hi> nothing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:4898:31"/>
but what ministers content to the minde, sustayning nature, but not oppressing her, feeding, but not pampering her, cheering, but not cramming her. I haue <hi>tasted</hi> many liquors, yet none like the brinie cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of mine eyes: <hi>teares</hi> are best extinguishers of sin, preparatiues to remorce, motiues to true contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: precious <hi>Elixir</hi> may thou e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be my drinke in the time of my pilgrimage, and quench my thirst of sin with a desire of an heauenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. As the Nurse layeth wormwood or aloes on her pap, to waine her childe from sucking, so will I sprinkle some bitter thing vpon such things as I affect, that my delight may be restrained. How full of comfort am I, when my <hi>taste</hi> is directed to a right end? and how directed, when it is besotted with vanities?

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:4898:39"/>
entertained by Nouelists, an inquisitiue obseruer of state-affaires, and a serious agent in ciuill diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: she is a great enemie to peace, yet expects small benefit by warre, neuer contented so long as she sees deseruing men honoured: shee is amongst men as pernicious, as to God odious, being a profest foe to none more than such as be zealous of God. <hi>Saturne</hi> is said to haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancie ouer her, <hi>Idlenesse</hi> is the foster-mother of her, and <hi>Enuie</hi> claimeth an especiall prerogatiue in her. It is strange to see how her censures be euer grounded on igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in matters of knowledge, where publike or priuate imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vseth to be the maine scope of her invention. Rightly was shee compared to the venemous <hi>Taran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula</hi> bred in the region of <hi>Apulia,</hi> whose stinging was not to be cured by ought but <hi>Musicke,</hi> to wit, the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4898:39"/>
melodie of a sincere and patient minde, prepared to endure whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer she shall inflict, yet able to wipe of, whatsoeuer she can asperse. As it is the propertie of a friend to conceiue well, to defend, and speake well of those labours we compose, or actions we performe (saith <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>): so is it the vse of a disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and malignant nature, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praue the <hi>best</hi> by misconstruction, euer ayming at the <hi>worst</hi>: much like the <hi>Toade,</hi> that may not endure to smell the sweet sauour of the Vine, when it flourisheth. Whence I may iustly assume a particular complaint, hauing got the name of a <hi>Detractor,</hi> which I neuer merited. But well doe I perceiue whence I gained that title, traduced not deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, being by malice suggested, or on misconstruction (the indirectest path to probable opinion) groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For <hi>Construction</hi> is the moulder
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4898:40"/>
of <hi>Detraction:</hi> and impossible is it, that so many different mindes should iumpe in one censure; for particular vices enforce an applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our selues, what was meant in generalitie. So as nothing can be writ in how temperate a style so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, but some personall distast may be occasioned contrary to the minde of the <hi>Author,</hi> yet sorting with their owne vicious humour: whereas it would rellish more of true wisdome, to reforme that in our selues, which giues occasion of reproofe vnto others, then publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to discouer our owne defects, by applying that to our selues, which perchance, had as neere, if not nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer affinitie to others. And herein was <hi>Vespasian</hi> commendable, who apprehensiue enough of offence, and powerfull enough to reuenge, could wisely forbeare to be capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the one, or violent in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:4898:40"/>
As for popular opinions, which haue their foundation on no other ground than erring Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I appeale from them to a firmer and faithfuller testimonie, that is, my owne conscience, which can say thus much for me in lieu of so many obiections: <hi>Non habeo in me, quod testetur contra me:</hi> so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere were my purposes from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, as they euer aymed at a more generous and glorious marke, than to stoupe to such basenes, as personall calumniation, the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble note of an ignoble and vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy disposition. Albeit more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it is than light: <hi>vt Belluae sunt humanae, ita homines belluini</hi>; whose depraued actions should be glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at, whereby shame might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime them, seeing themselues brought forth naked to the world, or the examples of others deterre them, whose fearefull ends were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:4898:41"/>
vpon like meanes. And such as <hi>these</hi> be as necessarie fautors and supporters of <hi>vertue,</hi> and her decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning soueraigntie, as those cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shers and professors of vice be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall causes of vertues decrease: yea <hi>those</hi> be they, which that regall patron and patterne of iustice, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stides,</hi> termed the Centinels of his kingdome, because they rowsed and raised his people from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure sleepe of ryot and excesse, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading them to imployments more generous and manly, than to expose so precious a treasure as <hi>Time</hi> to sensuall effeminacie. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst <hi>these</hi> (I confesse it) I may be ranked, nor is this Ranke vnworthy the approbation of the <hi>best</hi>: for my ayme hath euer bin (so farre as the small portion of my abilitie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) to propose a way as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate, to the course of vertue in a generall obseruance, as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

Yea, so farre haue my thoughts euer beene from excusing or exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating my imperfections (which haue beene euer before mine eyes) as I made that diuinely-morall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Epictetus,</hi> my entirest Councellour: who wils mee to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the sinnes mine enemy taxes me with, but to <hi>reproue</hi> his ignorance, in that, being vnacquainted with the infinitie of my crimes (which mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster no lesse occasion of feares then teares) he layes onely two or three to my charge, whereas, indeed I am guilty of a million. But for that

other <hi>ranke,</hi> whose oyly tongues can <hi>smooth</hi> the errours of the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, aswell as <hi>smother</hi> the deseruing parts of the vertuous, I asmuch loath the gaine of their trafficke, as I hate their trade. For the world shall not hire me to vtter one word to their praise, which depraue the world, nor the eminentst rewards force mee to <hi>detract,</hi> where <hi>vertue</hi> bids me commend. For so small is the content I reape on earth, as I see nothing in it of that worth, which might moue mee to <hi>Flattery:</hi> or of that daring command, to force mee to dispraise what is good, hauing a prepared soule within me. Briefly, as I detest these <hi>base creepers,</hi> so will I seeke to auoide the daungerous company of <hi>detractours,</hi> since the <hi>former,</hi> as they imply spirits igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and depressed, so the <hi>latter</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre troubled minds, and such as are discontented.

haue I resolued to sconce my selfe betwixt these two, for who so obserueth not a <hi>meane</hi> is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being split by one of these two. But to returne to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of these <hi>Detractors,</hi> which <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darus</hi> calls <hi>men of vncurbed mouths, they</hi> are euer itching after newes, which by an vncharitable glosse, they labour so to peruert, as they may redound to the imputation of some personall agent interrested in those affaires. <hi>They</hi> are subtill inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters to the worst sence: for (Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-like) they sucke poyson out of the holesomest flowers.

Yea, euen <hi>those</hi> Orators, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for the prerogatiue of <hi>nature,</hi> haue beene oftimes seene to <hi>detract</hi> from her Soueraignty: as the sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Epicure, whose absurd opinion was, that there was indeed a <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour power,</hi> which had commaund ouer the inferiour Creatures: Yet was that Power but an <hi>idle God,</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his rest and quiet, and retyring himselfe from the care of man or his affaires; giuing him free scope and liberty to doe what he list, and repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Supreame happinesse of a Deity in <hi>rest.</hi> To confirme which palpable opinion, <hi>some</hi> irreligious Epicures of our time, for the better establishing their doctrine of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4898:43"/>
haue produced, or rather most impiously traduced that portion of sacred Scripture, <hi>Requieuit Dominus in septimo die super omnia quae patra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</hi> So generally pernicious is this poison of the world, as it aymes not onely at inferiour Subiects, but euen at the transcendent power of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> piercing (that I may vse <hi>Homers</hi> words) the spheare of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, &amp; wounding <hi>Iupiter</hi> himselfe. These be those <hi>Aspes</hi> tongs, which poyson our good names; Those Spiders, which with an art full of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret admiration, bring webs out of their bodies to intangle vs poore Flies in their snares; <hi>Those</hi> sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding tetters which eate into our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; <hi>Those Suck-blouds</hi> which exhaust the pith and marrow of our <hi>Soules; They</hi> are those Canker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wormes, which euer browze on the tenderest and sweetest blossomes of our <hi>vertues.</hi> In briefe, whatsoeuer
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:4898:44"/>
is opposed to good, that are they, aspersing the foulest blemishes, on men of approuedst deseruings. True it is, that nothing is more swift than <hi>Calumnie,</hi> for shee is euer flying; more eager, for she is euer assailing; more cautelous, being euer prying; more tyrannous, being euer raging, or more remorcelesse, being euer deuouring. In a well-gouerned state, this <hi>Axiom</hi> holds euer impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnable; <hi>Eadem est foelicitas vnius hominis &amp; totius ciuitatis:</hi> but how far <hi>shee</hi> is estranged from that feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, may appeare by the hate shee beares to euery good man within the Citie; professing for faith, fraud; mixing deceit with fairest pretences of affection; conversing with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to traduce, importunate in the pursuit of acquaintance, which she makes as notorious by her report, as if they were Prodigies in nature, by their life. Shee cannot endure to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:4898:44"/>
entertaine such into the <hi>lists</hi> of her discourse, as affect a reserued si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: for <hi>those</hi> cannot yeeld her argument of talke, because they are not talkers. <hi>Those</hi> which <hi>Catiline</hi>-like, will promise much and doe litle, rellish better in her palate, than <hi>such,</hi> as <hi>Iugurth</hi>-like, will speake litle but doe much. Thus far in expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her nature, I will now touch the place of her abode. For the place of her <hi>abode,</hi> it is harder to finde where she is not, than where she is; in diuers villages, as obscure, as time could make them, haue I liued, and I haue euer noted one <hi>Mother Trattles,</hi> newes-carrier to all her neighbor-gossips within the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish: <hi>One</hi> that had art to tell a tale with winks and nods: yea so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent were these old-trots in inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they could make one and the selfe-same tale, told in disgrace of one neighbour to another, with a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:4898:45"/>
litle alteration, as pleasing to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the former. It pleased there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spartan Orator, to call them <hi>brands,</hi> because raisers of ciuill differences and heart-burnes one with another. <hi>Brands</hi> indeed, as well to publike states as priuate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; whose many ruines will wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that though the wound be healed, the scar remaines still, harbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that Viper within them, that preyed on them; so miserable was their fate to cherish her which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned their fall. Rightly did he say, that termed them <hi>Antipodes</hi> to all good men, because <hi>they</hi> walke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in a path opposite to the trace of vertue, being as indirect in their courses, as vncharitable in their censures. For <hi>iudgment,</hi> they as much disclaime it, as those that are profest enemies vnto it; so much for conceit they thinke onely requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, as may <hi>detract</hi> from merit, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4898:45"/>
adde to disgrace. The <hi>Athenian</hi> tearmed them <hi>Owles, haters of light, Bats, recreants to their owne, Scara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,</hi> euer feeding on <hi>vlcerous flesh</hi>; aptly displaying their natures, by these borrowed names. But for their place of <hi>being,</hi> as they euer loue to insinuate into the acquaintance of the eminentst persons, so they make them the vsualst subiects of their discourse: wherein they vse to compare their <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>parts</hi> with their <hi>Progenitors,</hi> whose ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues they make as transcendent, as they disvalue the commendable qualities of those now present: and <hi>which</hi> is more remarkeable, though they be altogether ignorant of what their <hi>Ancestours</hi> did, yet expresse they their actions, in dispraise of their successours, as by ocular expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience they knew what they did. Farre bee my thoughts estraunged from conuersing or commercing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4898:46"/>
with these men; yea, may I rather not speake, then <hi>detract</hi> from the vertues of the least eminent by speaking. I haue euer wished, that my speeches might tend rather to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of some, then imputation to any. For so free haue my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions beene from publike or priuate Calumnie, as my inuention (euer grounded on a probable truth) hath euer seated and setled it selfe, on the serious commending of goodnesse, with a modest improuing of what was vicious. Yea, I may safely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uow (out of a sincere confidence within me) that I neare saw <hi>the man,</hi> who could worthily taxe me in this kinde: indeede <hi>Poesie,</hi> which one of the Fathers is pleased to terme <hi>vinum daemonum,</hi> not because it cheeres but charmes <hi>Sinne,</hi> may seeme sometimes to <hi>Satyrize,</hi> when it is personall application, not the <hi>Authours</hi> intention which

for my part, I haue bin euer so reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious an obseruant of my <hi>friend,</hi> as I wish rather not to liue, than by my lines to loose any mans loue: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when I esteeme (with that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Sage) <hi>my friends life, my best of humane glory, and his good name the essentiallst part of his life</hi>; but <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I cannot chuse (for else should I

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Offered before the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of my <hi>teares</hi>; now remaines the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of my <hi>Resolues:</hi> that as the <hi>first</hi> were symbols and signalls of my conuersion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, so the <hi>latter</hi> might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasiue motiues of my firmer reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. Dry be those <hi>teares</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which are not seconded by a zealous continuance; sith the perfection of vertue is <hi>perseuerance</hi>; and fruitlesse is that zeale, which like the <hi>seede</hi> in the parable, is either by the thornie cares of the world choaked, by the heat of persecution parched, or by stonie impenitencie and obduracie withered: I will therefore by the power of him that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:4898:49"/>
made me, so forme my <hi>Resolution,</hi> that I may finde a comfortable friend in the day of my dissolution; so shall the howre of my death be my convoy to life, my <hi>Exit</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to a more glorious <hi>intrat,</hi> my farewell on earth to my welfare in heauen; reaping for what I sowed in <hi>teares,</hi> in a plenteous haruest of ioyes. Thus therefore I addresse my <hi>Resolues,</hi> which I wish may be with like feruor receiued, as they were composed, ministring no lesse matter of consolation to the devout <hi>Reader,</hi> then they did of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the penitent <hi>Author.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I <hi>resolue</hi> to fix mine eye (more intentiuely) vpon my image, that my forme may put me in minde of my former.</p>
            <p>I haue conversed too long with the world: I will fall from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:4898:49"/>
to contemplation; from talking with the world, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template <hi>him</hi> that made the world.</p>
            <p>I will no longer put my candle vnder a bushell, shrowding my soules lustre with my bodies couer, but will display the eminence of the <hi>one,</hi> by the basenes of the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since it is not granted to man <hi>to loue and to be wise,</hi> willingly will I incurre the opinion of vnwise, to gaine the loue of <hi>him,</hi> that is solely wise.</p>
            <p>The most precious things haue euer the most pernicious keepers; which I found too true, when I made my bodie my soules guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian: I will henceforth esteeme more highly of such a <hi>treasure,</hi> than to commit it to the trust of a <hi>Traytor.</hi>

               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:4898:50"/>I haue obserued two <hi>Solstices</hi> in the Sunnes motion, but none in times revolution; I will redeeme therefore my time while opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is offred, for being past shee is not to be recalled.</p>
            <p>I haue seene young mens loue end in lust, old mens in dotage; if ere I plant my affection, I will so waine my selfe from the <hi>first,</hi> that my chast youth may exempt me from the <hi>latter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Elegantly expressed was that conceit of the Emperor: <hi>Fortune hath somewhat of the nature of a woman, that if she be too much wooed, shee is the farther of:</hi> I will thinke it therefore the best of <hi>fortune,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be allured by her fawne, nor deiected by her frowne: for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie towards fortune makes vs most fortunate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:4898:50"/>Excellent was that soueraigntie or regencie of <hi>Fortune,</hi> attributed by <hi>Liuie</hi> to <hi>Cato Maior: In whom</hi> (saith he) <hi>there appeared such abilitie both for constancie of minde, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turitie of wit, as in what place soeuer he bore himselfe, he seemed to be the moulder and maker of his owne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:</hi> but I desire no such transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie; more haue fallen through the height of successe, than for the want of meanes: This is my wish, to enioy no other meanes, than my Sauiour, who makes <hi>meanes</hi> for me to his Father.</p>
            <p>I haue wondred at the strict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts betwixt man and man, while <hi>Man</hi> the image of his Creator, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets his accounts due to God by man: I <hi>resolue</hi> therefore to make the Euening the summer vp of the day and morning; that my daily <hi>Memorandums</hi> may direct me in my

            <p>In my <hi>childhood</hi> I wished time after time to please my waggish fancie; now is my wish extended to the length of time, <hi>resoluing</hi> to liue to my fathers glory.</p>
            <p>It grieues mee when I call to minde, how those many howres of vanitie, which did once delight me, shall be produced as so many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, to condemne me; yet am I cheered with this <hi>Resolue,</hi> that <hi>He,</hi> who moued me to this remorce for my sin, will not suffer me to make relapse into sin, nor will pronounce the iudgment of death on me for my former sin.</p>
            <p>Grieuous sinnes require grieuous sighes; I will passe therefore the remainder of my time, in lamenting,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:4898:51"/>
as I spent the prime of my time in transgressing; so shall my teares witnesse my contrition, my retire from the world my conuersion, that in both, I may adde to my soules glory, by wayning my bodie from the conceit of her beauty.</p>
            <p>Ech thing we see in her kinde and nature; yet man by sin a priuitiue, degenerates from his nature primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue; opposing himselfe, by trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing his law that made him for himselfe.</p>
            <p>I haue heard many call this life a <hi>Pilgrimage</hi>; yet did they liue in it, as if it had bin the sole hope of their inheritance: I <hi>resolue</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to take in hand the <hi>actiue part,</hi> and leaue the <hi>discursiue; doe</hi> before I <hi>speake,</hi> practise mortification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I prattle of it: so shall my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course be powerfull, subsisting in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:4898:52"/>
the worke not word, not externall or for fashion, but in essence and operation.</p>
            <p>I haue oftentimes entred into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with my selfe, making the scope thereof <hi>venite &amp; abite:</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated withall, the happinesse of those <hi>fiue Virgins</hi> receiued, the miserie of those <hi>fiue</hi> reiected: rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning with my selfe what this should meane; and I found that no entry was admitted, where the <hi>oyle</hi> of grace was not infused, and that the heauenly Bridegroome will be by vs watchfully attended, ere we be by him gloriously receiued. I <hi>resolued</hi> therefore, to prepare a Wedding garment to adorne me, a Lampe full of oyle to lighten me, and a trustie friend to direct me; the garment of humilitie, the oyle of charitie, and my friendly consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence within me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:4898:52"/>I haue wondred at some mens humors, whose chiefest discourse was euer bent on their owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations; for my part, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of mine owne imperfections inioynes me silence, considering how far I am short of that I should be, how exceeding in that which is not required of me; I haue <hi>resolued</hi> therefore by the scale of humilitie, to ascend to the throne of glory, making the acknowledgment of my defects, my directest path for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning of perfection.</p>
            <p>As the completest follie appeares in too much complement, so the best of wisdome is to be least popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly wise; where opinion makes vs proud, whil'st priuacie in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge makes vs onely knowne to our selues, and no otherwise.</p>
            <p>I haue found oft-times the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentest
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4898:53"/>
parts shrowded in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and vnhansomest couers; which I can instance in nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than in the diuine essence of the soule, couered with the garment of flesh.</p>
            <p>Honour is a faire <hi>baite,</hi> but a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere disposition will not assume it before shee deserue it.</p>
            <p>The best of honour is to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our selues vnworthy of <hi>Him,</hi> to whom is ascribed all honour; nor can we better expresse our worth, than by confessing our own shame.</p>
            <p>Purposes and <hi>Resolues</hi> may be compared to <hi>Pauls</hi> planting and <hi>Apollo's</hi> watering, but their disposes to the blessing of God.</p>
            <p>I haue <hi>resolued</hi> in reflexion to my houre-glasse, considering times pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousnes
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4898:53"/>
with his swiftnes, to vie teares with her graines of sand; that my teares might (in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure) wash away the heap of those sins, which are multiplyed like the <hi>sands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Earth as a globe in the ayre, the soule as a Diamond in lead, reason as a queene in her throne; in the <hi>first</hi> we moue and are moued; in the <hi>second</hi> we shine, yet is our splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor by our bodies couer, obscured, by the <hi>last</hi> we are distinguished from beasts, yet by her abuse we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come worse than beasts.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Caesar</hi> (saith <hi>Machauell</hi>) had beene ouerthrowne, he would haue beene more odious then euer was <hi>Catiline</hi>; so strangely doth th'euent make indirectest actions glorious: but successe doth not euer argue a direct cause; for the morning-flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4898:54"/>
of the wicked shuts vp their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening in a sullen discontent; I will therefore so direct the <hi>meane</hi> that I may attaine the end: that an equall relation of one to the other, may produce a necessary <hi>successe</hi> in both.</p>
            <p>I haue wondred why the <hi>Thraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> being a Pagan should lament his birth like a Christian; when we that are Christians laugh at our birth, but pule at our death, like Pagans.</p>
            <p>As wee enter the world with a <hi>shrike,</hi> so we leaue it with a <hi>sigh</hi>; the <hi>first</hi> implyes what place of miserie wee are entring; the <hi>other</hi> shewes with what griefe we leaue the world in our departing.</p>
            <p>I haue considered with what tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and peace of conscience, a soule sequestred from the world ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth her farewell of earth; she finds
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:4898:54"/>
no obiects to distract her, shee sees no friends that can with-drawe her from her approaching dissolution; all seeme as in a calme sea; whilest a soule plunged in worldly cares, grieues to <hi>leaue</hi> what shee did so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly <hi>loue.</hi> O may my soule so contemne the world, as she may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse her selfe for a future world: so extend her hopes aboue <hi>earth,</hi> as she may raigne with her Sauiour after <hi>Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the vale best discouereth the hil; so a humble outside best displai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a glorious soule; Vanity becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not a wise-man, much-lesse <hi>him</hi> that should be only wise to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
            <p>I had neuer the fate to admire ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, nor hope to rise by fauning on greatnesse; Heauen grant I may so follow <hi>him</hi> that is onely great, that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:4898:55"/>
the choyce of his attendance may purchase mee a place of perpetuall residence.</p>
            <p>Age cannot alter habite, nor aër condition; I doe wish my age may be so well tempered, that I may get that habite of vertue, which cannot be depraued, those internally-beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying qualities of the minde, which may not be corrupted.</p>
            <p>That is the choycest pleasure, which hath onely relation to vertue; others may haue appearance but no essence: for bitter is the fruite of that pleasure, which is attended on by <hi>Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no Bulwarke so impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable as a spotlesse soule; for shee can oppose all hostilitie inward, where the <hi>other</hi> is onely for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: as there is a continuall feast to

            <p>Length of daies is not in this vale of <hi>teares,</hi> for few be they and full of misery; but in the Tabernacle of <hi>Syon</hi> there is length of time without transition, and accomplished yeares without conclusion.</p>
            <p>I haue collected that there is a <hi>Reward</hi> for the good, as reuenge for the wicked, after this life; because the <hi>Sunne shineth aswell on the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked as the good in this life.</hi> I haue <hi>resolued</hi> therefore, that as the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary <hi>Sunne</hi> cheeres mee with his heate, so to dispose of my <hi>Actions,</hi> that by his operation which workes in mee, I may bee exalted by the <hi>Sunne</hi> of righteousnesse, being made pertaker of his glory.</p>

            <p>It is strange that <hi>Man</hi> in his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, should so often measure his graue, yet be forgetfull of his end; <hi>seuen foote</hi> is his dimension, yet man liueth in that securitie, as if that small scantling had a perpetuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension.</p>
            <p>Making ech day an abstract of my life, I finde by bitter experience (yet hopefull repentance) that I haue spent my morning in wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; now my <hi>resolue</hi> is, to redeme my morning idling with my mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes labouring, that I may receiue my penny in the euening.</p>

            <p>Flatterie is not alwaies to praise in presence, for incurre we may that name by praising in absence; that is, when either the vertue is absent, or the occasion; as for <hi>vertue,</hi> shee can neither be ouer-prizd, nor ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praisd: I will hate therefore to insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, where Vertue is not resident; nor can he be a Parasite, that is her attendant.</p>
            <p>I finde seuerall perturbations, to which I am exposed, diuers infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to which naturally I am subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; I would not follow the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion of <hi>Empyricks,</hi> which mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the same medicines to all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients:

as my griefes be sundry, proceeding from diuers meanes, so must my receits be sundry, if I meane to cure the effects.

            <p>I am almost of <hi>Copernicus</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who in his <hi>Theorie</hi> supposed, that <hi>the Earth did moue</hi>; it moues man indeed to moue vnlike him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, becomming in his motion for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull of his <hi>first Mouer:</hi> I <hi>resolue</hi> therefore, as many lines tend to one Centre, so to ayme all my soules motions to the glory of my maker; that earths motion may by no meanes draw me from <hi>him,</hi> who first gaue me motion to serue him.</p>

of my miserie, lest miserie should cause my end; but I found how foolish I was to wish for an end of that, which can no way possible, haue an end before my end; for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie is an inseparable companion to man, so long as he is man, for ceasing to be miserable he becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth an Angell and no man.</p>
            <p>He that falls from diuine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, to take content in the world, is as <hi>he,</hi> that after he hath bin fed with meat of Angels, falls after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to delight in Swines meat: sensuall desires shall not captiuate my reason to the soueraigntie of <hi>Sence</hi>: I <hi>resolue</hi> so to liue, that dying I may liue; for this life as it is a death, so death to the good is an aduantage of life.</p>

As it repenteth me not to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:4898:65"/>
know it now, so it litle repenteth me not to haue knowne it before now: for as the present estate adds to my content, so my former want perhaps kept me from discontent: I perceiue no such thing as bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage in <hi>marriage,</hi> onely a restraint from Batchler-sensualitie, which merits not the name of seruitude but libertie. Vpon consideration had of two estates, I account <hi>mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age</hi> concurring neerer with perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and I ground my opinion vpon no worse probabilitie, than the Arithmeticians <hi>maxime,</hi> Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers haue their beginning but not perfection from <hi>vnities</hi>; yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude I not these two indiuidually vnited, from that incomparable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of marriage, <hi>vnitie.</hi> Content I finde more accomplished where mindes are consorting; for single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse includes rather the condition of an Anchorite, than of one affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:4898:65"/>
societie: <hi>This</hi> better for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, <hi>That</hi> for contemplation. There is no felicitie (if earth may be said to enioy it) like a fellow-helper, &amp; no fellow-helper equall to a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bosom-friend: I am neither for committing secrets nor concealing them, till I finde an aptnesse to conceale, or faith to reserue. I finde <hi>Mysogenes</hi> opinion grosse and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, touching the secrecie of a woman, a faithfull wife cannot chuse but be a good Secretarie. <hi>Shee</hi> makes her husbands reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion her principall subiect, and chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth rather to dye, than it should dye. Her acquaintance is not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, nor craues shee rather to be seene what she weares, than to be knowne what shee is. Vertue is her best habit, and her garnish is behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den more to Nature than Art: shee affects no colours, doing well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pretence of glory, affecting
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:4898:66"/>
what is good without desire of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause. I haue bin in a strange error, and it much repents me of it, where imagination suggested to me, wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke could not be without some aspersion of lust; for I perceiue the sanctitie and puritie of the <hi>rite,</hi> adds more to content than the outward delight; it relisheth more of the Spirit than the flesh; he that feeles an other effect in <hi>marriage,</hi> he is more brutish than reasonable. The best purchase is a good wife, and the worst is her contrary: I haue commended <hi>Arminius</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and haue long embraced it, whose conceit was so much remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the affection of <hi>marriage,</hi> as he censured <hi>him</hi> dead to earths-comforts, that tooke himselfe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other bed-fellow, than his owne minde to converse with; but I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime now vpon that heresie: I finde my minde strengthned by
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:4898:66"/>
conference, and that proceeds with best grace and consonance from a faithfull mate: I will not trust her with my bodie, whom I dare not make partner of my minde? and though the excellencie of the one, surpasse the frailtie of the other, yet will I not commend the one where I dare not commit the other. For frailtie of Sexes, I conceiue how apt man is to iudge sinisterly of the weaker vessell, and I impute it either to a want of Braines, in that they cannot diue into the excellencie of so pure and exquisite a composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or some hard hap they haue had in making choice of such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme creatures. I haue found <hi>one,</hi> though weake by condition, yet firme in her affection; making her resolues so vndoubtedly approued by <hi>him</hi> she loues, as she hath vowed to engrosse her loue to none saue <hi>him</hi> she onely loues: her content is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:4898:67"/>
so setled, as she scornes to haue it diuided, for she knowes that <hi>a heart diuided ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not liue.</hi> She professeth her selfe to be, not where shee liues but where she loues, and the <hi>Adamant</hi> which drawes her to affection, is the perswaded ground she intertaines of her husbands disposition, which is too choice to be popular, and too relenting not to be wonne; as meere protestations were not of force to winne her, so flatterie was too pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable a suter to woe her. <hi>Content is worth a kingdome, and my kingdome is my owne familie, where I make euery day my account, casting vp in the euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what I did in the day:</hi> I thinke my day well bestowed, if employed in the seruice of my <hi>Creator,</hi> and my conclusion is this: <hi>I will be none of that familie, which is not carefull of promoting Gods glory.

eldest itcheth after <hi>Bellman,</hi> her next after <hi>Cryer,</hi> and her daughters scorn to degenerate, vowing to bring the aunciently-erected <hi>Cuckstoole</hi> into request: shee frets like gum'd <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram,</hi> but for weare she is <hi>Sempiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> Shee goes weekly a catter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wauling, where shee spoiles their spice-cup'd gossiping with her tart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tongued calletting: she is a Bee in a box, for she is euer buzzing: her eyes, though they be no <hi>matches,</hi> for she squints hatefully, are more firing than any matches: she is a hot shot, for she goes euer charg'd: she hath an excellent gift for memorie, and can run diuision vpon relation of iniuries. In some thing she is praise-worthy, for shee hates complement, and grins when she heares any one commended, much more flattered: all the phrensies in <hi>Bedlam</hi> cannot put her downe for humors. If shee be married, she makes her husbands
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:4898:73"/>
patience a fit subiect to work vpon, where his miserable eares are dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with her incessant clamour. she is neuer pleasd, for being pleasd she were not her selfe, whose choysest Musique is euer to be out a tune: a nest of <hi>wasps</hi> and <hi>hornets</hi> are not comparable to her for spite, nor may equall her in splene; and in this they principally differ, she hath her sting in her tongue, they in their tayle. she is monstrously vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociable, and grounds the reason of her distast vpon others approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. when shee hath none to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise her furie on, she mumbles ouer some dogg'd <hi>Pater-noster</hi> to her self, as if she were conjuring: her signe is euer in <hi>Cancer,</hi> and hates Patience left it should bastardize her blood. <hi>shee</hi> is euer suspicious of others thoughts, and therefore answers for her selfe before she needs. were she as strong in power as will, she would
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:4898:73"/>
commit more insolencies with her tongue, than euer <hi>Nero</hi> did tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies with his sword.

Great ones she as much disvalues, as shee contemnes inferiors, yet neither shall slip her, for she neuer saw <hi>that creature,</hi> which might not giue her argument to vent her impatience; her reading is but small, yet when she heares of <hi>Stentors</hi> tongue, shee would giue her Dowrie for such a cimball. she somtimes counterfeits
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:4898:74"/>
grauitie, but her ferret eyes and hooke nose display her for an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite. Her tongue neuer findes vacation but in Church, which time giues her occasion to commence some new brawle. Her tongue is as glibberie as an Eele, all the Posts in the Kings high roade cannot equall her for speed; marie truth is, she en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfears dangerously. shee weares her clothes negligently, of set pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to moue her husband to taxe her for her sluttishnes, whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe she retorts with haile-shot, and pellets him with words as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull as she is fulsom. By this time she hath formald a paire of high corke shoes to heighten her dwarfish proportion, purposely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to beard her husband. In her infancie she was tongue-tyed, but by an expert Artist, the string being cut, she euer after vowed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to loose the facultie of her vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:4898:74"/>
by discontinuance. she hath seriously protested to make her husband run mad, but he is a <hi>foole</hi> then. she claimes some priuiledge in his <hi>Bretches,</hi> and that is th'efficient cause of a <hi>breach</hi> betwixt them. It may be she is honest, but if her dogd humor would giue her leaue, I am perswaded shee would enter parlie with a knaue in a corner: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as she is) a very <hi>Crab,</hi> if shee affect any pleasures, they must be <hi>backward.</hi> she resembles the <hi>Raile,</hi> and her name concurrs with her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. shee condemnes no act so much, as that of <hi>Hypemnestra,</hi> who procured her husbands safetie, while all the rest practised their deaths. shee approues of no ancient soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie, but that of <hi>Amazon,</hi> where the gouernment was feminine: and for the <hi>Salique</hi> law, she hath already repeald it, as expresly preiudiciall to their sex. Her tongue-feuer is <hi>quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:4898:75"/>
for it is euer shaking: her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is so far out of temper, as shee hath vowed to be phrenticke euer. she maintaines this, that fancie is a phrensie, and Loue such a painted Idoll, as she will rather burne, than tye her selfe to such a fopperie. I would see that Saint, which shee would not incense, a man of that temper, whom she will not nettle. There is no bird which she lesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles than the <hi>Doue,</hi> for she is all gall. <hi>Saturne</hi> hath sole predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ouer her, dis-affecting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than affabilitie. she can be merry by times, but then especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, when her husband is malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. she liues of litle sleepe, and seldome sleeps but dreames, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakes laughing, relating how in her sleepe she beat her husband. The <hi>Crocodyles</hi> teares are not by halfe so mortally dangerous, making euer her hatefull teares assured harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:4898:75"/>
of reuenge. she weeps because she may not effect what she would, tuning all the day a hellish discord, best sorting with her serpentine subtiltie. she willingly entertaines her owne dislike, to infer her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands distast; which she appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends with ioy, and obserues with a continuate delight. she rewards the <hi>Sexton</hi> liberally in her husbands presence, onely adding, <hi>a day will come.</hi> she presseth him to make his will, perswading him he cannot liue long, albeit he finde no such fault with himselfe. she would make an excellent Hawke, for she is euer sharpe. shee vowes <hi>Temperance</hi> is none of the cardinall vertues; and that too much sufferance may make the bleare-eyed world esteeme such an on a <hi>Saint,</hi> whose recreant Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence deserues rather the title of <hi>Sot.</hi> she may seeme to haue some allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the <hi>Pismire,</hi> wheresoeuer she
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:4898:76"/>
is, she brings smarting, and in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence too, for the <hi>shrow</hi> is euer scraping. Her tongue would make a singular Scarcrow, for it is euer ratling: in her discontent (as when is she out of that humor?) her only dolefull song is <hi>Lachrimae,</hi> which she vsually sings in any consort. Her complexion is sallow, of constitu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion strong, yet is her bodie incom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parably weake to her will, which can finde no period, till death be her Herald, to whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable arrest I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath her.</p>
