         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MVch honoured <hi>Doctor,</hi> and my moſt worthy friend,
being abroad this <hi>Saturday,</hi> I heard that Mr. <hi>Iohn Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi>
hath again printed another laviſh Letter, which I have
not yet ſeen or read, wherein, together with others, he hath
ſorely, and I am perſwaded moſt unjuſtly taxed you, to have
done him a great deale of wrong, in his late miſcarried bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
about the Parliament, whereas I have ever obſerved
that you have alwayes, ſince you were firſt acquainted with
him, ſhewne your ſelfe his ſingular good friend, ready to do
him all good in word and deed, yea and in theſe later times
of his uncomely miſcarriages have ſpoken very tenderly and
friendly of him; and therefore I cannot (I ſay) be perſawded
that you have given him any juſt cauſe ſo to complaine or
exclaime of you, I therfore humbly deſire you (moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Sir</hi>) to vouchſafe to ſatisfie and certifie me in a word or
two, whither any ſuch thing be betweene you or not at this
time, though I ſay for mine own part I am confident of the
contrary, but, then I ſhall be the more groundedly able up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
occaſion to vindicate your integrity and innocency ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and the more fully to ſtop the mouths of any other tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers
of you herein: Thus, moſt noble <hi>Sir,</hi> whom from my
Soule, for your faithfulneſſe to God and his Truth, I can
never ſufficiently prize and honour, praying pardon for this
my boldneſſe, emboldned therunto by your own Chriſtian
Candor and even genuine ingenuity, with the humble ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

Iuſt defence, of John Baſtwicke, Doctor
In Phyſieke, Againſt the Calumnies of

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I have ever found you a truly loving friend
to mee and mine heather to, and that in my
greateſt adverſity and hotteſt conflicts, which
with all thankfulneſſe I doe acknowledg, and
have with reciprocall affection anſwered your
love: So I hope there ſhall never on my part,
any juſt occaſion bee given of violating this
our mutuall affection: for to the uttermoſt of
my abilities, I ſhall endeavour to keepe peace
with all men eſpecially my Chriſtian acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
And ſo confident I am of your good
opinion, that there is not any calumny how high ſo ever it fly, and how
loud ſoever it ſpeake, and by what multitudes ſoever it be ſpread obroad
and divulged, that can in the leaſt alienate your charity from me before
you have heard my juſt defence. And truly at this time though I ſhould
not returne an anſwer to your Letter in way of juſtification of my owne
integritie, ſo aſſured I am of your Love, that al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thoſe foule aſperſions that
are now cauſleſly publiſhed concerning me, by reaſon of a Letter printed by
Leiu. Col. <hi>Lilburne</hi> ſhould not in the leaſt ſtagger your good eſteeme of me
or eſtrange you from me: much leſſe would they extort a cenſure from you
before you had heard what I had to reply in my owne behalfe. But ſeeing
you have deſired for the ſatisfaction of others to heare from me concerning
the buſines between me and the Leiut. Colonell, I thought fit to gratifie you
in a few lines, not that I am ſollicitous about that matter, or that it doth in
the leaſt trouble my minde, or diſquiet my thoughts: for ſuch is my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
in this cauſe, that beſides the teſtimony of my owne Conſcience, I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:123452:3"/>
have the witneſſe of the whole Parliament, the great Councell of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to acquit and free me from the Colonells crimination: ſo that all men
may ſee that it was malitiouſly laid upon me, onely to make mee hatefull to
all good people. You know that Calumny (who is quicker then Martiall
Law) doth ordinarily arraigne, accuſe and condemne men before they have
beene heard ſpeake for themſelves, and men are uſually put to death and
murdered in their reputation, and their fame taken from them before they
know of it: and thus at this time it hath hapned to me, who am made as
odious and infamous as the tongues of Revilers can make me, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
no juſt grounds; as you ſhall ſee by and by. It is a ſinne that many in
this Nation are highly gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ty of, who deale not with others as they would
be dealt with, and eaſily receive a reproach againſt their Neighbour, both
which notwithſtanding are againſt the Royall Law of love. Neither is there
any man that would not complaine if one ſhould either ſpread an evill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of him, or imbrace one againſt him; yet that they condemne in others
is the practiſe of too too many in theſe our dayes: and they that ſit at the

and therefore we that are of the low degree may not thinke our condition

good word, either wholly to excuſe him, and vindicate his reputation, or at

diſaffection to him, much leſſe of that, hee layeth to my chrge, yea, had it
beene true, that hee chargeth mee with, yet it had beene no more a cryme
in me, then it was in himſelfe, when he not only communicated a buſineſſe
concerning Col, <hi>Hollis</hi> to Mr. <hi>Samuell Gooſe,</hi> but afterward made it knowne
to ſome Members of the Houſe; which ſaith he, we did without any deſigne

Knaves for doing this, then there is no juſt ground, nor cauſe why either
Leiutenant Colonell <hi>Lilburne,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Worley</hi> and there companions ſhould
aſperſe me with thoſe odious tearmes, and many more, calling mee an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
as they have beene often heard ſpeake, and for no other cauſe but for
informing the Houſe of that which they themſelves had done before mee,
yet all theſe calumnies I now under go from theſe men and of all their fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie,
and for no other offence but for that they applaud in themſelves for
a vertue. But now for anſwer to that which Leiutenant Colonell <hi>Lilburne</hi>
chargeth me with, and for a replication to your requeſt, know this Maſter
<hi>Vicars,</hi> that it is moſt falſe, and that I may expreſſe my ſelfe in the words of
a Parliament man (when he had read the printed Letter) it is a moſt impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
lye, for ſo ſaid a Member of the Houſe to me, that <hi>Lilburne</hi> had prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a moſt impetuous lye againſt me, whiles he upbraided mee, and my ever
to be honoured brother Maſter <hi>William Prynne</hi> of lying, and to ſpeake the
verity, I doe not thinke there was a more groſſe and wilfuller untruth
ever printed againſt any man: for I underſtanding that Leiutenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
<hi>Lilburn</hi> had given out that I had informed againſt him, I ſent him word
by one Miſtris <hi>Barber,</hi> which told me that ſhe was very ſorry to heare that
I ſhould do ſuch a thing againſt a brother and a loving friend and fellow ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer,
to whom I meerely replyed, that it was a groundleſſe report, and that
I never did it, and with all told her, that it was one <hi>Hawkins,</hi> and deſired
her to ſignifie it to my Brother <hi>Lilburne,</hi> that he might be undeceived, and
fearing that ſhe ſhould not relate it unto him, (though ſhe was then going
to him) and promiſed me that ſhe would) the next day finding him waiting
on the Committee, I blamed him that he ſhould report ſuch things of mee,
and told him that hee had exceedingly wronged me in ſo doing, in raiſing
ſuch a report and withall ſignified unto him that it was his friend <hi>Hawkins</hi>
that had accuſed him: Notwithſtanding all this, ſuch is his inveterat malice
towards me, becauſe I writ againſt the <hi>Independents,</hi> that he printed that
falſehood againſt mee, only as I ſuppoſe to bring an <hi>Odi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the Kingdome (for his Letter is now as publike as weekely newes, and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
bodyes hands) and I am induced to beleeve that this was the deſigne
both of himſelfe and thoſe that are of his ſociety, becauſe it hath ever beene
their ordinary practice, to abuſe ſuch in tongue and print withall manner of
callumnies and blaſting language as they think Malignant and Leiutenant
Col. <hi>Lilburne</hi> by name, is notorious, and famous for this faculty of reviling,
as this his printed letter doth ſpecifie and his many other Pamphlets, and
that which not long ſince he printed againſt Col. King a Lincolnſhire Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who had deſerved as wel from the Parliament and his Country (if fame<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye
not) as moſt of thoſe that have bin in publike ſervice for the State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:123452:4"/>
who expoſed himſelfe to as many dangers, and did as faithfully diſcharge
his place and the truſt committed to him as any man: yet this man, becauſe
he oppoſed the Independent party, and would not whiles he was in Come
mand, ſuffer them in a diſorderly manner to leave the publike Aſſemblies
where the word was faithfully and Orthodoxly preached and vent their own
novelties, to the ſeducing and miſleading of the poore people and making a
faction in Church and State: For no other ground (I ſay) that ever I heard
of, ſaving that he being a man not only of integrity, but wiſdome alſo and
courage, and could not indure to ſee his Country-men made a pray of to
pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oyners, and ſuch as aymed more at their owne honour and private e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molument
then at the publique good and dignity of the Parliament; for
theſe very cauſes and no other, that ever I could learne what I ſay with that
party hating him, and the Independents joyning with them, by their falſe
informations and clamorus againſt him and their malitious ſuggeſtions,
as that he was of a troubleſome and contentious ſpirit, they have made him
as odious as any man in the Kingdome, excepting my ſelfe and my learned
and honoured Brother Mr. <hi>William Prynne.</hi> And Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne</hi>
not ſatisfied to raile of this gallant Gentleman whereſoever he came,
but printed a moſt notorious lying Libell againſt him, and ſuch an
one, as all the truly Godly and honeſt men of that County doe affirme,
they never ſaw more prodigious untruthes publiſhed againſt any man:
and ſuch of his Country men as are acquainted with him and his abilities
know very well, that if hee had but faire play, hee is able for wit and
worth to deale with a whole Army of Indepents, and all his enemies, and for
valour and skill in Armes he is inſeriour to none of them, and whiles hee was
in their good eſteeme, and before hee oppoſed their faction, they neither
thought nor ſpake otherwiſe of him, but as of a brave and diſerving Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
as can be prov'd by a cloud of witneſſes and under the hands of the beſt
of them: but now, becauſe he is adverſe to theer way, as with all good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
hee and all good men, ſuch as love the peace of Sion, and the welfare
of the Kingdome, ought to bee, to their whimſy of Independency, therefore
that party and their abbettors do moſt horridly abuſe him with all manner
of reproaches, and my Brother <hi>Lilburne</hi> by name, (as I ſaid before) hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
ſuch beaſtly lies of him, as ſcarſe the Sunne ever ſaw greater, and in the
ſame tracke and path do all the Independent faction walke in, blaſting all
thoſe they hate with vilifying language, and for this very end and for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
purpoſe, I perſwaded my ſelfe he publiſhed that lye againſt me, that he
might make me deſpicable, and of no reputation amongſt honeſt men: for
in his accuſation, hee chargeth me with two crimes, <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Ingratitude,</hi>
either of which were enough to make mee infamous through the World,
much more they being both joyned together, and that with aggravation
for there is nothing that all ingenious men hate, &amp; abhorre more then alyat,
and an ungratefull fellow, and that deſervedly neither can any honeſt man
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:123452:5"/>
keepe ſuch men company with ſafety, as are guilty of thoſe crimes. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if I were ſuch a man, the world might juſtly diſtaſte and abjure mee. Now
to prove me a lyer, he thus argueth. <hi>The</hi> Doctor (ſaith hee) <hi>ſent in a paper to

to Oxford, though with the ſaid Doctor Baſtiwck I had no diſcourſe at all about

Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> when I had no diſcourſe with him about any ſuch bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe.
And to prove me an ungratefull fellow, and one that had done him

the ſorrowes and miſeries that I ſuffered from the Biſhops for divers yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
And for this man to make an information againſt me and thus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
mee, rendring me evill for Good, he proclaimes himſelfe to the whole
world to be an unworthy and ungratefull man, and therefore ought deſerved<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
to be abhorred and abominated of all good people, as a lyer &amp; an unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
fellow, and this is the ſcope of this gallant ſword-mans diſputation, to
wound and diſtroy his Brothers reputation, and this effect it hath allrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
produced, that amongſt all thoſe of that fraternity (for they take all <hi>pro

then of a baſe fellow, calling me knave and paultry fellow at every word, and
this dialect they have learned of Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Iohn Lilburne,</hi> who
when hee ſpeaketh of me, giveth me no other name, although it is well
knowne untill I had declared my ſelfe againſt Independency, there were no
praiſes though great enough both for me and my Brother <hi>Prynne,</hi> ſuch is the
ſickleneſſe and vanity of the poore creature, one day crying <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

dealeth with the Parliament, who, but the Parliament not long ſince with

Court of Judicature is with him as bad as the High Commiſſion, and the
Star-chamber, and worſe and all the Judges in the great Councell, as bad as
<hi>Strafford</hi> and the Prelates, trampling downe <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the liberty
of the Subjects under there feet, ſo that if their dealings towards the Subjects
be juſt, he profeſſeth he hath loſt his judgment, and muſt beginne to learne
A. B. C. againe, &amp;c. But to wave his diſpiſing of Government, and rayling
of dignities, a Sin which God ſo much abhorrs, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. Iude and which
belongs to thoſe in authority to redreſſe, and whom it moſt concernes.</hi> I come
to his particular charge againſt mee, and firſt, where hee accuſeth mee that I
put up a paper againſt him to the Speaker, hee beginnes his crimination with
calling, for I never put up a paper againſt him, neither did I ever in my life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
againſt him unto any Parliament man, or ever open my mouth to any
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:123452:5"/>
of the Houſe in his leaſt prejudice to this preſent day, but have ever ſpoken
well of him to the Parliament, and for this I now ſay, all the Parliament
can witneſſe for mee: and ſo farre I was from making an Information a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him about this buſineſſe, that I knew not at that time, that hee had
ever heard that Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi> was accuſed of any ſuch thing, nor had not
knowne it, had not hee himſelfe in his letter ſignified ſo much that <hi>Pendrid</hi>
had told him ſuch a thing, and therefore I could not informe againſt him,
and in the firſt paper that I and Colonell King put into the Houſe, wee were
ſo carefull of preſerving others reputations, that we named none in it but
<hi>Haukings.</hi> But after we had ſent in the firſt paper, and underſtanding from
others, that <hi>Hawkins</hi> varied in his relation, and whereas to us he had only by
name accuſed Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Harlow,</hi> ſaying that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more were equally guilty, and hearing that, to others hee in his relaton
ſaid there were ten more ſpecifying a certaine number upon this new intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
we conceiving that if he would communicate theſe things to us which
were ſtrangers unto him, hee would much more impart his mind to his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers
and thoſe of his owne faction, and ſeeing him in the company of many
of that way from whoſe ſoſiety hee then immediatly came and related thoſe
things to us, we verily perſvvaded our ſelves that hee had told them alſo the
ſame things, and thinking vvith our ſelves if <hi>Hawkins</hi> ſhould deny his words
as probably hee might, that then we might the better corroberat and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
our witneſſe with their teſtimonies, which would alſo have added
great force and life to our information as being men of reputation and of
good eſteeme and credit in the Parliament, and againſt whom there could
be no juſt exception or ſuſpition of hatred to that party, they being Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
and no Presbiterians, I ſay for the ſtrengthening of our witneſſe, in the

to have had their teſtimony and witneſſe, joyned with ours, (in caſe that

and truly Colonell <hi>Iret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſpirit: for all that wee intended by naming of them in the paper preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Houſe, was for no other end, but to produce their teſtimonies with
ours, if (as I ſaid before) <hi>Hawkins</hi> ſhould have denyed his words. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the naming of theſe men were any wrong to them, or any juſt cauſe of
a quarell from Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Lilburne,</hi> I referre it to the judgment
of any Sober and diſcreete man! But for the ſaitisfaction of your ſelfe
Maſter <hi>Vicars</hi> and all good men, teke the information as it was put

were to rate mee, and revile mee, and joyne with my enemies, yet though
they fayled mee, I had got ſome acquaintance by theſe my ſufferings, who

ſome black mouthed Phyſitians that made Religion their ſtalking Horſe to
get into practiſe, one of the which alſo, ſtood really obliged unto mee, in as
many Obligations of reſpect and frindſhip, as Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Lilburne</hi>

they all as it were in a confedracy combined together to defame mee, and
ſpake all manner of evill of mee (and continue the ſame trade to this day) ſo
that in the judgment of all the Citizens that heard of mee and through their
calumnies, I was thought worthy of no pitty, and eſteemed of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mee, as an evill doer, and my puniſhment thought to little for mee, and they
ſpake generally of mee as of a debauſhed fellow and a madman: and all
thoſe aſpertions were laid upon mee partly out of malice, and partly for feare,
leaſt any ſhould make uſe of mee for their Phyſitian, for they were ſure they

me, and vilified me every where an ordinary practiſe eſpecially of the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Phyſitians, and all that I now ſay Maſter <hi>Vicars,</hi> I think you in part can
witneſſe: ſo that I remained a Priſoner of hope, deſtitute of friends and in a
deſpicable condition, and knew not the face of any Citizen but my kindred,
and ſome few that I formerly made mention of, untill one Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi> an
old Diſciple, an honeſt and a godly man, was ſent unto me by a Doctor
of Divinity, as prelaticall a man as hee told mee, as any in <hi>England,</hi> which
made the good-old man to wonder, yet hee being a learned man tooke pity
of mee, and ſent me twenty ſhillings in Gould, which was the firſt preſent I
ever received from any man of that function, forbidding him to tell me his
name (which hee concealed faithfully) with this Meſſage alſo, that if I were
in any neceſſity, I ſhould make Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi> acquainted with it, and then I
ſhould heare from him, and hee likewiſe charged him to take a care of mee,
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>elling him that he never read any Puritans writings from which he had
better ſatisfaction, and gave me hyperbolicall prayſes as he related unto me;
whereupon the ould man began to aske mee, how I ſubſiſted there, and I
told him in particular, all my means that was left to ſupport me to a Peny

cry out one to another roſt-meat, roaſt-meat, that it would draw teares

               </gap>n
we could have continued without ſtarving, though wee had never had ayde
from any mortall man, but I had a very loving Kinſman (whom you know
well Mr. <hi>Vicars</hi>) Mr. <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

may kindneſſes and his Children likewiſe, and he lent me money upon any
occaſion, and that was no ſmall comfort unto us, but otherwiſe I was friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
and helpleſſe, untill old Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi> by that Docters meanes came to me
who much incouraged mee, and intreated me I would write ſomething in
Engliſh, for the people (ſaith hee) underſtands not Latine, and therefore can
reape no benefit by your labours, neither will you ever be knowne unto them
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:123452:7"/>
and ſo hee extreamly urged mee that I would write ſomething in Engliſh,
whereupon I demanded of him what theame hee would put me upon, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
meanes (ſaith hee) write againſt the Biſhops, for he could not indure them,
they having utterly undone him two or three times and proſecuted him
for the ſpace of forty yeares, whereupon I told him that in few dayes I would
do ſomething concerning that Subject, and perceiving that he was a good
cheerfull, merry old man, I began with my Letany which when he had heard
it made him laugh as if hee had bin tickled, ſo that I never ſaw a man more
pleaſant at a peece of grillery. And the very day he brought ſome Citizens
of good repute into my Chamber, who beſtowed a dinner on mee, and after
they had heard my Letany once, they were ſo highly pleaſed at it, that they
int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and deſired each of them a copy of it, and at
their departure they ſhewed themſelves very Chriſtianly noble and kind, and
gave me ten peece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, which ſet me up, and this was the firſt curreſie that
ever <hi>I</hi> received from any Citizens that were ſtrangers to mee, neither were
they loving to me at that time, but now and then they both came and ſent
to mee, delighting in my company, ſo as they commended me unto their
Neighbours with compaſſion grieving as they ſaid, that I ſhould be neglected
and no more regarded, and they read my Letany to them alſo, and ſo from
one to another, by this meanes I came to be knovne, and to be in eſteme
among ſome Godly Citizens, and to be acquainted with them, who ſhewed
me many courteſies, vvhich vvas not a little comfort unto my bands vvhich
I acknowledge with all thankfullneſſe to God and them (and all theſe were
the old Puritans of <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and this was the firſt occaſion of my being knowne to the City,
And not long after this, the good old Father, brought me acquainted with
ſome young men towardly and fearing God, and they alſo tooke pleaſure in
my ſociety, and I was as glad of theirs, amongſt the which was Mr. <hi>Iohn Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi>
who as his occaſions permitted him, would now and then viſit mee, of
whom I had then as good an opinion, as of any young man in the Towne,
and conceived of him as an honeſt hopefull and godly youth, and gave him
as good councell, as I could give to any, and loved, and eſteemed of him, as I
did of any of my Chriſtian Brethren, and after ſome familiarity and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
acquaintance, he made knowne unto mee his condition, and told me
(as I remembred) that he was now, either out of his time, or that it approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that he ſhould be a Free-man; but withall related unto me, that his ſtocke
was very ſmall to beginne with (and if my memory faile not) he tould mee
hee had but fifty or threeſcore pound for his portion, which ſaith hee, you
know, is very li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tle to ſet up withall, (But what trade hee was of I know not
to this day) and hee intreated mee, that I would be pleaſed to give him a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
of my Let any, and my anſwer to the Bill of information put up againſt me
in the Star-chamber, ſaying that hee doubted not but hee ſhould get money
enough by them, for he perceived that they were well approved of by all that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:123452:8"/>
read or ſeene them: whereupon I diſwaded him from thinking of ſuch a
thing, telling him, that it would expoſe him to great danger, and that it might
prove his ruin: but withall, I ſaid, if that hee did really conceive or beleeve
that it might bring any benefit unto him and might raiſe him a ſtock, that
withall my heart, moſt willingly I would give it him, or any other Copies of
anything I had either in Latin or Engliſh: but I told him for my Letanies they
were all gone, and I had never a Copy left. Then hee demanded where hee
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight procure one, and I told him, that one Maſter <hi>Vicars</hi> a Schoole Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
in Chriſt church had one, and I thought that hee would be willing to let
him have it, whereupon Hee intreated mee to write unto you Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Vicars,</hi> and ſo I did earneſtly, deſiring you to let him have
yours, which you moſt willingly and readily condeſcended unto: with
all you may remember Mr. <hi>Vicars,</hi> that I uſed this Argument to make you
more willing to pleaſure him, that hee was a hopefull young man, but he had
but a little ſtock to begin with, and hee conceived that it might be a meanes
the better to ſet him up, to which you the more willingly liſtned unto, and
freely gave him my Letany. And all this you can witneſſe unto. Whereupon
<hi>John Lilburne</hi> repayers to mee, returning many thanks, and tould mee with
all, that hee had my Letany, and was now taking his journey into the Low-Countries
to print it, and brought with him a young man, whom hee ſaid, he
would imploy for the diſperſing of his bookes, that he ſhould ſend over be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his returne: but I diſſwaded him for confiding in that man (though I had
never ſeene him before) for I tould him I liked not his lookes, and I was
afraid that he would betray him: but notwithſtanding what I ſaid, hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eied
moſt confidently upon him, profeſſing that he would put his life in his hands,
aſſuring that hee had experience of his fidelity, and ſeeing that I could not
prevaile with him to make uſe of ſome other, <hi>I</hi> left him to himſelfe, telling
him againe and againe, that I was perſwaded hee would prove a falſe friend
unto him, for hee looked like a knave. And all this <hi>John Lilburne</hi> cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and as I tould him it came to paſſe, for he betrayed him to the Prelates
afterward, but it was carried ſo cunningly on the Prelates part, and ſo crafte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by that fellow, that it did not appeare to <hi>Iohn Lilburne</hi> that he was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
though it was palpable to all men beſides. But now a word or two of
<hi>John Lilburnes</hi> ſucceſſe in the Low-Countries, when hee came thither, hee
made all ſpeed to print the Letany, with my anſwer to the Bill of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and it was no ſooner publiſhed, but hee got threeſcore pounds cleerely
by it in a few dayes, as hee himſelfe hath often related it to mee and others,
as <hi>I</hi> can prove: and had not that baſe fellow betrayed him, he might for ought
<hi>I</hi> know, have gotten five hundred pounds by it: for never did any apolegy
ſell better: but as ſoone as the Bookes were landed in <hi>England,</hi> and that, that
Judas had intelligence of it by <hi>John Lilburnes</hi> Letters, hee immediatly
informed the Prelate of <hi>Canterbury</hi> of it, who could not endure the very
name of my Letany, and forthwith he ſent downe a Purſevant vvith plenary
authority, to the place where they landed, and ſurpriſed all the books &amp; burnt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:123452:8"/>
them there where he found them, (if I have not bin miſinformed) &amp; as ſoon
as <hi>Iohn Lilburne</hi> was arrived he cauſed him to be apprehended &amp; caſt into
riſon and after to be cenſured in the Star-Chamber, and made him moſt
barbarouſly and cruelly to be whipt, pillired, and gagged, and afterwards
to bee moſt tyrannically abuſed in the Goale, againſt all Lawes both of
God, Nature, and all humanity, all which hee might have eſcaped, if hee
would have followed my counſell, and had not truſted to his owne wit, and
confided in that treacherous fellow, who was his overthrow. This is all
true, Maſter <hi>Vicars,</hi> that I have now related unto you, and both your ſelfe
and many more can witneſſe for me, that I have not in my relation falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any thing. Now I ſhall deſire you, and all thoſe that ſhall reade what
in truth I have written, to conſider, whether I ſtand obliged to <hi>John Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi>
with as many tyes of friendſhip and reſpect, as to any man in the
world (as he affirmeth) or whether or no, hee is not obliged rather to me
in all thoſe tyes of friendſhip and reſpect, that was ſo willing to gratifie
him meerely, for a few viſets: for I never at that time had received a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of mony from him of his own? Or whether he ventured his life in
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> for my ſake, or for his own profit and hope of gaine?
Or whether hee underwent thoſe miſeries hee ſpeakes of for my cauſe,
or for his owne emolument and benefits which hee affirmeth? All theſe
things Maſter <hi>Vicars,</hi> I referre not onely to your judgment, to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
of, but to the wiſdom and diſcretion of all moderate minded men,
who if they ſhall impartially judge, I am moſt aſſured, they will determine
that the obligation lyes on <hi>John Lilburnes</hi> part towards me, and not on my
part towards him, eſpecially if they ſhall ſeriouſly way all other paſſages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
us, which in the following diſcourſe will appeare for I freeley gave
him the Copies of both my Letany and anſwer, never expecting any profit
to my ſelfe by them, or ever looking for any reward from him, or any other
thing but his love. And I am moſt confident, if I could have beene merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
as yet I never was, (who never tooke a penny of my Printer for any
thing I did) I might have had forty pieces at leaſt for the Copies of them:
and it will not be a difficult thing to prove what I now ſay. Now then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no, <hi>Iohn Lilburne</hi> bee not for this my humanity obliged to mee, I
leave it to all mens conſideration. And whereas hee ſaith he adventured
his life at home and abroad, and underwent all thoſe miſeries for my ſake
and cauſe, it is moſt falſe: for he expoſed himſelfe to all thoſe dangers, as
Mariners doe to all the perills of Sea, for hope of gaine, and of getting a
livelyhood for themſelves &amp; their Families; And it is well known that <hi>Iohn
Lilburne</hi> at that time was not ſo well inſtructed in the controverſies of the
Church as uow he ſeemeth to be, who dares all the World to diſpute with
him: Neither was it ſo much his zeale to the Cauſe, that put him upon that
imployment, as the eye he had to his own honour and profit, which in all
probability, if he had not beene betrayed, hee would have concommita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:123452:9"/>
his endeavours: and if <hi>John</hi> had not forgot himſelfe, he would as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
hee hath done acknowledge that I was the beſt maſter, and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
that ever hee had for matters of controverſie, and Religion; ſo that
next unto God he owes his greateſt ski<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l to mee, who was a good Tutor to
him, and I would have him to know that I am yet able to teach him, and a
better Schollar then any independant in <hi>England,</hi> who are yet to learne
their Primer in Politickes, and their Catechiſme in Divinity, though
through the judgment of God upon this Nation which affect Novelties the
people are infatuated with that generation of men: and as it is in the ſong
of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Revel. 15. <hi>Great and wonderfull are thy workes, Lord God Almi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtie,
and just in all thy wayes, thou King of Saints, to give men over to error
becauſe they receive not the truth, in the love of it, that they might be ſaved,</hi>
2 <hi>Theſ. 2. ver.</hi> 10. 11. And if <hi>John</hi> had but grace in him he would not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
at this preſent, to be adviſed by me who ſo long as he followed thoſe
wholſome principles, and the good councell I gave him, hee had true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
indeed and might have lived and dyed with comfort and repute,
whereas taking thoſe idle courſes, and following a company of unſtable
guidy-headed people out of vaine glory and ambition to have a name of a
Champion of the Independents he perpetrates thoſe unwarrantable things
that brings diſhonour to God and ſcandalls all Chriſtian Religion, and
his holy profeſſion, ſo that whiles hee would be thought to bee a Teacher
and Doctor as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, 1 <hi>Tim. chap. 1. Hee underſtandeth not
what he ſpeaketh, nor whereof he affirmes, who hath erred from the truth, and is
now turned in to vain janglings, not knowing that the end of the Commandement
is love out of a pure heart, and a good Conſcience, and of faith unfained,</hi> which
forbids him <hi>to rayle of dignities and to ſpeake evill of Government,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes
him to obedience, and teaches him in love, <hi>to thinke better of others
then of himſelfe, and to preferre others before himſelfe, Rom. 12. v. 10. Phil.</hi> 2.
and not out of a vapouring humour, proudly and arrogantly to vaunt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and dare all others, and our of his turbulent and tumultuous ſpirit to
rayſe a Faction to the diſturbing of both Church and State and the diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himſelfe and others, to the griefe of all ſuch as wiſh his good both
for ſoule and body. Now as I have related unto you Maſter <hi>Vicars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the
beginning of our acquaintance, and ſhewed you what the Obligations
were that hee ſayes, I ſtand ſo much ingaged unto him for, ſo I thinke it
not amiſſe to ſpeake of ſome other paſſages of love both from my Wife
and my ſelfe towards him. As for my Wife in the time of my baniſhment
at his ſufferings, ſhe was failing to him in no offer of friendſhip but withall
tender affection, ſhee was ever ready to yeeld him her beſt aſſiſtance in any
thing and night and day ſhe was ſolicitous for his good providing for him
a moſt faithfull and diligent Chirurgion, often viſiting him, and ſtirring up
friends to doe him good and according to her owne abilities pleaſuring
him, in any thing hee ſtood in need of continually taking order that hee
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:123452:9"/>
wanted nothing that was ſitting for a man in his condition, and had as great
a care of him, as if he had been his owne Father, and that when he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
of his friends (as can ſufficiently be proved) and after he was ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and I was returned from my baniſhment, we lived in as great amity and
affection, as ever any two chriſtian Brethren did, and there was no office of
love that I have ever hitherto been failing to him in, either in his ſickneſſe or
in health, notwithſtanding in the time of his impriſonment, he falling
into acquaintance with ſectaries and ſtraglers, was much ſwarved from thoſe
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uthes, and that purity of doctrine he had learned of me; yet all this in the
leaſt alienated not my affection from him, but I continued as cordiall as ever,
rejoycing either to ſee or heare of him, and of his wel-fare, and he had my
prayſes whereſoever I came; and all theſe were obligations, and ſo would any
others have thought.</p>
            <p>And this I may alſo ſay, that he may thanke me as an earthly inſtrument
(that I may make uſe of ſome of his owne language) for all the honour he had
in the world; for his acquaintance with me, and his ſuffering about my books
(as many of the Parliament have often told me) was the cauſe that he became
ſo famous, and ſo well knowne and honoured, whereas otherwiſe he might
have lived and dyed in obſcurity, and been knowne no farther then a man can
ſhoot a pelle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> with a Trunk, and perhaps not to his next neighbours doore,
as it happens in <hi>London</hi> to many thouſands of eminenter men, otherwiſe for

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
that alſo he is beholding unto me.</p>
            <p>Beſides, I taught him ſome courtſhip by being in my company, and
made him ſit for all Gentlemens and Noble-mens ſociety; whereas when
he came firſt to be my Scholler, though he were Honeſt and Religious, yet he
was but a meere country courtier, and very rough hewen, ſo that he could
neither make a legge with grace, nor put off his hat ſeemly, till I had poliſhed
him, and taught him all his poſtures of courtſhip, and now he is become a very
gallant Fellow, aud hath commenced Lieutenant-colonell <hi>Lilburne;</hi> and who
but <hi>John</hi> among the controlereſſes of dripping-pannes, the Independent
ſiſters?</p>
            <p>Beſides, by my ſociety he bettered himſelfe, and that not a little in his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
and dialect, and is ſtill beholding to me for many of his beſt and choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
expreſſions, as all that know him can ſay, and all theſe were obligations,
which many a gratefull man would have thought he could never have can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled,
though <hi>John</hi> has forgot all, which makes me therefore (though it be
contrary to my complexion) to enumerate them, that every indifferent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
man may ſee, that Lievtenant-colonell <hi>John Lilburne</hi> is not alwayes
to be beleeved, though he be in print: And that Maſter <hi>Vicars,</hi> you may ſee
how fairly I deale with him, I will conceale no curteſie that ever he did me,
that all men may behold the extremity of my engagement<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> towards him.
Whileſt he was in a good mood, he was very loving and kind unto me in word
and deed, and when I was a priſoner in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> he laboured much for my
exchange, and writ many Letters to my Wife about it, and ſent his Drum once
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:123452:10"/>
or twice to me to <hi>Knarsbrough</hi> caſtle, which was two miles or thereabou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>m the place where he billited, and one of thoſe times he ſent me ten ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
which I eſteemed of as a great favour, and in way of thankfulneſſe, I
gave unto his Drum eleven ſhillings, as the Captaine and Souldiers there can
witneſſe, who ſtood by all the time he or any man talked with me: But by
the way, Maſter <hi>Vicars,</hi> I will ſay thus much, that this ten ſhillings was the
firſt and laſt money that ever I received from <hi>Iohn Lilburnt;</hi> and withall I
profeſſe unto you, that notwithſtanding all our acquaintance, I never yet
brake my teeth with any of his capons, or ever eat of his bread; yet at that
time eſpecially, he ſhewed his readineſſe to pleaſure me; and through his
meanes, as I conceive, many other great commanders laboured my exchange,
and ſent their Drums and Trumpets about it to me, as the Earle of <hi>Manche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
and Generall <hi>Crumwell;</hi> to both which Honourable Perſonages, I ſtand
ſtill ingaged, for that excellent favour of theirs: And at my returne, he came
lovingly out of the city, with others, to bring me into <hi>London.</hi> But here let
me tell you alſo Maſter <hi>Vicars,</hi> and what I ſhall ſay I am able to prove;
that all this time my brother <hi>Iohn Lilburne</hi> ſhewed me ſo much kindneſſe, and
was ſo ſolicitous for my liberty, and came ſo friendly out to meet me, he not
onely conceived me to be an Independent, but reported it that I was of their
way, and one of them; and this, I ſay, I can prove; ſo that it was not pure
charity and unfained love, but all under the notion that I was of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that he ſhewed me ſo much favour: For ſince that I declared my ſelfe
that I was of a contrary opinion; it is well knowne that he hath not onely
relinquiſhed and abandoned me, but in words moſt reproachfully abuſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with all manner of calumnies behind my backe, calling me baſe fellow, pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

and all this before his Letter was printed, wherein he hath to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
rayled both upon me and my highly honoured brother Maſter <hi>William
Prynne;</hi> but it is his uſuall cuſtome thus to aſperſe the very Nobility and
Peers of the Kingdome, if they do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Earle of <hi>Manchester,</hi> yea, he ſpares not the King his Highneſſe, nor
the Parliament.</p>
            <p>And for his complices, all that Rabble rout, tagragge and bobtaile, that
followed him in theſe his needleſſe and ſought for troubles, as <hi>Worly</hi> by name,
and others, they told me, and that in a crowded aſſembly, that I was very
high, but they had knowne me low enough, and that not long ſince I lived
on their almes, and affirmed, that they had kept me from hanging, but now
I was turned an Apoſtate, a perſecuter, and an enemy of the godly party,
and joyned with the wicked, againſt the Saints (it ſeems they are all Saints)
and that I had ever been factious, inſomuch that they could not entertaine me
in their hearts, nor ſo much as pray for me: All theſe reproaches, and a grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

many more, they caſt upon me in the preſence of many, when they were in
a tumultuous manner attending upon the Committee of Examinations,
and that without the leaſt occaſion on my part given them, any more then
my preſence in that place, whether I was ſummoned to be a Witneſſe: And
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:123452:10"/>
for theſe men that did thus ignominiouſly and injuriouſly relvile me, they
were all Lieutenant-colonell <hi>Lilburnes</hi> followers and abettors, and ſeconded
by him, and all of them unknowne to me, and ſuch as I had never ſeen (to my
beſt remembrance) ſo much as the very face of any one of them before that
day, neither did I ever amongſt chriſtians behold ſuch odde complexions and
ſtrange looks; if ever you had ſeen the picture of Hel, M. <hi>Vicars</hi> in York-houſe,
where all the poſtures of the damned creatures, with their griſly lookes are
deſcribed, and had alſo taken notice, what ghaſtly, ugly ſower and muſteds fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
out of dolour, paine and anguiſh they made, and had been amongſt this
company, and had ſeen what griſly looks they out of malice, rancor and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
to the Presbyterian party, and eſpecially to my ſelfe had made, and had
withall heard their confuſed, hiddious noyſes, calling for the liberties of the
Subjects, and for the benefit of Magna charta, and the Petition of Right, and
for a publike hearing, you would have thought your ſelfe in the very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs
of Hell, and that theſe had been the ſonnes of <hi>Pluto</hi> or <hi>Pinus</hi> aſcended
out of <hi>Orco;</hi> the complexion alſo of many of them being like the bellie of a
Toad; and to ſpeake the ttuth, <hi>Worly</hi> was one of the propereſt Gentlemen
amongſt them all, and he was the moſt remarkable and taken notice of, by
reaſon of his habit and buſie diligence; he went that day in a great white
and browne basket-hilted beard, and with a ſet of teeth in his head, much
like a Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>-fiſh, all ſtaring and ſtanding ſome diſtance one from another, as if
they had not been good friends; it may be conjectured, he picks them twice
a day with a bed-ſtaffe, they looke ſo white and cleare; he was mighty dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
about the Common-wealth that day, and the Priviledges of the Subject,
and all the fraternity came flocking about him upon all occaſions, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Turkyes doe about a Frogge, wondering at her as at a ſtrange ſight:
Without doubt when the Parliament comes to be recruted, the Independents
will make him a Member; and I am confident he will prove a rotten one, for
he looks as if he had gotten a blow with a French colt-ſtaffe, and it is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
he is a bankrupt of all goodneſſe, and whatſoever ſhew he makes now
of Independency, Anabaptiſme, or any of the new wayes, or to ſtand for the
Common-wealth, both he and Saint <hi>Sprat</hi> their Soliciter, have been knaves
from their mothers womb; and therefore Maſter <hi>Vicars,</hi> if you have any hand
in chooſing of Members, let not him have your voyce.</p>
            <p>But now to ſpeak ſomething of their babble; how can any man living that
either ſaw them or knows them perfectly, with reaſon, imagine that I ſhould
ever have lived of theſe mens almes? moſt of which, by all conjectures, live
and depend on other mens curteſies, and are onely ſupported by being of that
Faction; for more obſcure and ill conditioned fellowes did I never behold:
And what a baſe lye it was in them, to affirme that they kept me from hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
whereas I never was (as all men know) ſo much as queſtioned at any
Earre, or in any Court for my life, and therefore had no need of the Pſalme
of mercy, much leſſe of their help in that kind; and I bleſſe God, I was never
brought ſo low, that I could not have ſubſiſted without ſtarving, with the
ſtumps of that eſtate my Father left me, after all the vaſt expences I was cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:123452:11"/>
put unto, by my malicious enemies in all their Courts, although my
children would have fared the worſe for it, and I ſhould not ſo comfortably
perhaps have undergone my impriſonment, had not my chriſtian friends been
ſome help unto me; and I can truly ſay this, and make it appeare, that all
that ever I received by way of curtifie, doth not amount by a thouſand pound
and more, to that meanes my Father left me, beſides my Wives portion; ſo
that I am above two thouſand pounds worſe, in reall money and eſtate at
this day, beſides the loſſe of my time, for theſe twelve yeers, ſince which my
troubles began, above eight of which I was kept a cloſe Priſoner, and three
of them in baniſhment; and they that know what I am now worth, can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
the ſame for me, men of reputation: And therefore they were barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
inſolent ſo to ſpeake to me; and indeed all the ſtanders by wondered
at their rudeneſſe and inhumanity towards me, affirming that they never ſaw
a more uncivill and ill conditioned people.</p>
            <p>But here we may take notice what a ſlavery it is for any man to be behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to ſuch a generation of creatures, who upon the leaſt conceived diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
will caſt their courteſies (if any) in the teeth of thoſe to whom they
have ſhewne them, if in the ſmalleſt punctillio you be not of their mind: And
therefore we are councelled by Saint <hi>James,</hi> if we want wiſdome or any good
thing, to aske it of God, <hi>who</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>giveth liberally and upbraideth not,</hi>
Jam. P. 5. And if theſe men had ever given me any thing, as I am moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
they never did, yet all the world knowes, that when they gave it, it
was for this reaſon, that they were then of my mind (for they ſay now they
cannot pray for me) which argueth their want of charity, their levity, fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and inſtability in all their wayes; but this is that that all their frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
daily caſt in my diſh, though I am moſt aſſured, if all that ever I received
from them, or any of thoſe that are now of that ſociety, it will not all amount
to three ſcore pounds, and I am able to make good that I now ſpeak: And
yet theſe are the daily claimours of this people, and onely for my conſtancy;
for all that have read my books for which I ſuffered, and know me, can free
me from that aſperſion of apoſtacy and faction, and from being an enemy to
the truly godly party, and to the Saints, who I honour and love with my life.

he be not rather obliged to me in them all, and hath proved very ungratefull

aſperſed me to the whole Kingdome, and cauſeleſly brought all the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

evill opinion they might have conceived of me ſecretly, becauſe I differ
from them, yet they could never ſo ſhamefully have vented themſelves in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
ſo that he hath proved himſelfe guilty of both theſe crimes, <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,</hi>
that he accuſed me of, and wronged both me and all his party, and
made all his aſſociates offenders in many reſpects, by theſe his pactices; for in
complying with them in his unwarrantable wayes, they have made themſelves
equally guilty before God and men, and have a great deale to anſwer for their
tumultuous diſorderly carriage in all that buſineſſe, which to ſpeak the truth,
concerned them not; neither had there been any juſt cauſe of offence given
by me (if they would but deliberately weigh all things with reaſon among

(which I did not) neither could it deſervedly have been accounted a crime;
for there is no tye of friendſhip that ought to make me deſert my duty to the
publike, and to break my Covenant, and violate my Proteſtation; by vertue
of both which, I ought to informe the Parliament and State of any thing that
I thought of common concernment, made for the peace of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and the honour of the Parliament, which I am bound to maitaine with
the reputation of every Member of that Supreame and Honourable Court;
for they are our Fathers, Magiſtrates and Protectors, and every Subject that
is under obedience (and that has taken the Covenant and Proteſtation) is
tyed in as much as in him lyes, to preſerve and defend them in their lives and

that he ſhould either doe, practice or attempt any thing that tends to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine

bound to reveale it, (that if falſe, the divulgers of ſuch calumnies may receive

to doe, though it ſhould be to the prejudice of his nigheſt alies and intimateſt

that many of the Independants when they ſhall heare the truth, will condemn

there was no juſt proceeding amongſt them, and that they had not the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

the Kingdome, that ſo they may with the more facility ſpread abroad and
publiſh the ſentence given by the Lieutenant againſt the whole Parliament,
the better to bring an Odium upon them all; for in his book he pronounceth

them of any thing they ſay, that they may not all be blamed and judged for
the raſhneſſe of ſome, when notwithſtanding they that uttered ſuch words,
ſpake nothing but what they had learned from their faction, or what they
had received from the chiefe heads of them: And it is well knowne that
Lieutenant-Colonell <hi>Lilburne</hi> is upheld by that party, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

after him may ſufficiently witneſſe, and they look upon him as their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,
applauding all his actions. And it will not be a difficult thing for me
to prove whatſoever I have written in my books againſt the Indepedent
party, from their owne bookes, and even from his owne Letter, and
the proceedings of that company that followed him to the Committee of
Examinations, and their behaviour and carriage there, may abundantly
prove my charge in my booke againſt them; for they gave lawes to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
and would not be examined but upon their owne tearmes, crying out
of injuſtice, and threatning that they would bring up the whole City, and a
thouſand ſuch other inſolencies they uſed there for many dayes together; all
which doe manifeſt, that if in time their party grow a little ſtronger, they
will give lawes to the Parliament, and make them doe what they would
have them, or elſe they will take the authority into their owne hands;
for Lieutenant-Colonell <hi>Lilburne</hi> hath plainly taught his Diſciples, that the
power that now reſides in the Parliament, is inherent to the people, and that
thoſe of the Parliament are not to act according to their owne will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and boldly taketh upon him to inſtruct the Parliament and teach them
their duty; and affirmes, that the power is the peoples birth-right, and that
they have but entruſted them with it; ſo that it ſeemes if they ſhall once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that the Parliament doth not diſcharge their truſt they have committed
unto them, they may reſume it when they pleaſe, for that muſt neceſſarily
enſue from his premiſes; and this is the Doctrine that he infuſeth to all his
followers, and onely for to ſtirre up a commotion in the Kingdome, and to
put the people in a heat; which if the Parliament timely prevent not, they
will runne the greateſt hazard of being deſtroyed, that ever any Councell in
the world did.</p>
            <p>And whereas he ſaith, that when the King went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> he left many
of his friends behind him: I for my part believe that he is one of them;
for I am moſt aſſured, that never any friend the King had, hath done the
Parliament more wrong and indignity than Lieutenant-Colonell <hi>Lilburne;</hi>
for it was not an apparent enemy to the great Councell, that hath done them
this wrong, it was no <hi>Aulicus,</hi> for then they would have laughed at it, and
made themſelves merry with it, but it was their friend, their familiar one,
that the Common-wealth had fed at her table<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and one that the Parliament
had in ſpeciall honourd, favourd, and confided in, and who they had ſtood by
in his greateſt difficulties, yea, and had preſerved his life; and for this man
now to lay ſo foule things to their charge, as unjuſtice and tyranny, and

and an honeſt mind, drawne his ſword in the defence of the Parliament,
he would not now have drawne his pen to have cut all their throats, and to

did, yet make no noyſe, but with modeſty and patience, wait and attend till
the great and weighty matters in the Kingdome, will give leave for private
buſineſſes: And all men know, that the publike good, the preſervation of
the whole body, is to be looked unto in the firſt place; and then afterward
as occaſion doth offer it ſelfe, without damage to the publike; private buſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the reliefe of the neceſſiited, are taken into conſideration, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
is given unto them that can juſtly complaine; and this has ever
been the practice &amp; cuſtome of all Nations, as the Annals and Hiſtories of all
times relate: Neither have ſuch as have been forced to wait, forthwith pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed

neither would ſuch proceedings be thought tolerable in any well governed

            <p>It is well knowne, that there are many Noble-men and great Gentlemen

their lives and all their eſtates, but are at this day brought to ſuch extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and neceſſities, as to relate would exceed beliefe, ſo that many of thoſe
that had ſome three, ſome four thouſands by the yeer, ſome more, are brought
to ſuch ſtreights, as they have not bread to put in their families mouths, nor

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t on their backs; yet I never heard that they did ever print
Letters in diſgrace of the King or his Councel and upbraid him with ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
towards his Souldiers, becauſe their particular neceſſities were not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
or becauſe they conceived they were wronged by his Majeſties Councel:
And I am moſt aſſured, that if any of thoſe that follow the King ſhould doe
any ſuch thing, or durſt attempt to diſparage the Kings proceeding, being
one of that party, he would not onely be abhorrid by all the Cavaliers, but
thought worthy of ſevere puniſhment, whatſoever former ſervice he had
done his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Nay, I will ſpeak my knowledge, I have heard a Cavalier ſay, that if any
of their party ſhould have done any thing in this kind againſt his Highneſſe
or his Councell, the other Cavaliers would have cut him in pieces: And
truly all ſober minded men, and ſuch as ſtand really wel-affected to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
cannot think thoſe the Parliaments friends, that in this kind write
againſt them and their proceedings: For were it granted, that Lieutenant-Colonell
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:123452:14"/>
               <hi>Lilburne</hi> had done as good ſervice, as he pretends, though there be
many that ſay, that the deviſions that he hath cauſed at <hi>Bosterne,</hi> and through
<hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> with his preaching up his new Doctrine of ſeperation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath done
more hurt to the ſoules and bodies of the people, then all the good that ever
he is able to doe.</p>
            <p>But I ſay, were it granted that he had done all good ſervice without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
yet the diſgrace and evill he hath now done to the State, hath ſurpaſſed
all the good he ſpeaks of: Many Cowes you know Maſter <hi>Vicars</hi> ordinarily
give good milk, and then ſcummer in the payle, by which they ſpoile all that
they had given down; even ſo it is in this caſe with Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi>
what he hath formerly built up, that he hath now throwne downe:
He may remember what the Lord ſaith, Ezek. 10. <hi>If the righteous turneth from
his righteouſneſſe, and doth that which is evill, I will forget all his righteouſneſſe,
ſaith the Lord &amp;c.</hi> So if a Commander doe faithfull ſervice for a time to a
State, as the <hi>Hothams</hi> did, or as <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>holmly,</hi> and afterwards turne traitors, muſt
the memory of their former ſervice hinder the courſe of juſtice? I trow not;
if a ſervant for ſome time ſhall doe good ſervice for his Maſter, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
prove unfaithful, or purloyne his goods, and labour to deſtroy him, is
his former ſervice to be taken any notice of? it is perſeverance in any good that
crowneth all; and therefore it is but a poore grollety to ſpeak of good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
formerly done, when they are acting all the evill that men can well act
againſt a State or Kingdome.</p>
            <p>But one thing is very obſervable, he would brand me with great ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and as if I had forgot what he had done for me, and in the meane time
he is guilty of the ſame crime: For it is well knowne, that the Parliament
not onely ſaved his life, but delivered him from his ſlavery and captivity,
and greatly honoured him, and for ought I know, would have made him a
full ſatisfaction for all his damage and ſuffering by the unjuſt Courts, when
from their publike affaires, they could have been permitted to have liſtned to
private grievances; yet he hath forgot all this their curteſie, and ſingular hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
and now flings dirt in all their faces, and ſo deſpightfully abuſeth
them, as no ordinary well bred man would abuſe an ordinary baſe fellow:
But becauſe this is a buſineſſe that concerneth the honour of the whole Houſe,
which he hath ſo contumeliouſly blaſted, I ſhall leave that to their grave wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
onely out of my duty to that great Councell, the Supreame Court of
the Kingdome, I may ſay thus much, that the whole Kingdome owe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of their Religion, lives and liberties, to their care and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and that all our Poſterity are bound to be thankfull to them for their
fidelity, diligence and infatigable prayers in their common defence, who, all
reaſon will dictate, could have no end for what they have done, but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good and ſafety of us all: And therefore it concernes all the people to
take heed how they joyne and adhere to Lieutenant-Colonell <hi>Lilburne,</hi> and
ſuch factious ſpirits, who under pretence of defending the Subjects Liberty,
raiſe tumults to bring all to a confuſion: And let them ever ſet before their
eyes the ſtory of <hi>Cora, Da<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:123452:14"/>
brought upon themſelves by their rebelling againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> their deliverer and
preſerver, they cannot be ignorant, that while they aſſent unto him, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud
and owne what he raſhly and unadviſedly doth, they make themſelves
equally guilty; for as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, Pſal. 50. He that conſenteth with evill
doers, makes himſelfe as guilty as they: So doth the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> teach all
men, in his Epiſtle to the Romans, chap. 1. 2. they that conſented to thoſe
impious and wicked men, were in Gods account as equally guilty as if they
had perpetrated al thoſe facinourus actions; yea, it is the practice of all Courts
in all the Kingdomes and Nations of the whole world to condemne the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices
of treaſons as well as the others: And as no men, no not the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents
themſelves, can indeer thoſe that comply with ſuch as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to be their enemies, ſo they ſhould now make the Parliaments Cauſe
their owne (for it is their owne indeed) and think that it highly concernes
them all, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> may be their condition ere long; for deſtroy once the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Parliament, and enervate their authority, and you ſhall ſhortly ſee
every Country Courtier, fly not onely in the face of the Gentry and Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but indeed every ſervant become a Maſter and Miſtris, and caſt off the yoke
of obedience to their Superiours, whether Parents, Maſters or Governours;
and therefore it concernes all men, as they will avoyd both the wrath of God
and inevitable danger, now to take ſpeciall heed what they doe, in abetting
with Lieutenant-Colonell <hi>Lilburne,</hi> in theſe his temerarious proceedings;
for I well perceive the poore people are all deluded by his falſe information,
and think his impriſonment, and the proceedings of the honourable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
of Examinations, to be againſt the liberty of the Subject, and againſt
Magna Charta, and the Petition of Right, all which inviolably remaine to
the Subject, notwithſtanding whatſoever he pretendeth to the contrary: And
as he hath traduced the Parliament cauſleſly, ſo likewiſe in his owne defence
he hath abuſed the holy Scripture; for there is a vaſt difference between Saint
<hi>Pauls</hi> ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe and his, as will quickly appeare, if there be but a true informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made of Lieutenant-Colonell <hi>Lilburnes</hi> buſineſſe, for the ſtory of <hi>Pauls</hi>
ſufferings is ſufficiently knowne.</p>
            <p>The verity of the matter is, the Parliament in their proceedings with <hi>Iohn
Lilburne,</hi> have done nothing contrary to the Law of God or nature, or the
cuſtome of Nations, and the Lawes of the Kingdome, and therefore ſo horrid
an accuſation of the great Counſell is unſufferable: He quarrels the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
amongſt other things, that he was ſent to priſon, the cauſe not being
ſpecified of his commitment: If indeed he had been arraigned and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
before he had been heard, then there had beene a juſt cauſe of complaint;
but that they did not in their Warrant ſet downe the cauſe both of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
and Commitment: I muſt confeſſe for my part, I ſee no cauſe why
he ſhould make ſo loud a complaint; for if there ſhould now in the City of
<hi>London</hi> a conſpiracy be diſcovered, and ſome of the Conſpirators ſhould be
appprehended (under reformation) I conceive it will not ſtand with the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the City Office<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, and with the diſcretion of thoſe that are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
to ſet down the cauſe of their apprehenſion and ſending them to priſon;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:123452:15"/>
for if their complices ſhould have intelligence of this, that their plot was
diſcovered, they would all either eſcape away, or attempt ſome deſperate
thing that might be deſtructive to the whole City, and that that might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
the whole Kingdome; therefore in ſuch a caſe as this, it is for the
wiſdome of the Officers to conceale the conſpiracy till they have apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
all the Delinquents; and in ſuch a caſe as this is, and many more, the
Magiſtrate may, as I conceive, ſend any man to priſon without ſignifying
the cauſe why unto the priſoner: For I read in many places of the Scripture
that priſoners have been committed, and there was no cauſe given either to
him that was committed, or to the Goaler, wherefore he was committed,
and yet they are not condemned of unjuſtice for ſo doing: But when men
have been condemned without hearing, or by falſe witneſſes, this hath made
it a crime.</p>
            <p>Neither hitherto have I ever read, that it was counted a crime in a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
or an unjuſt thing, or a thing againſt the Law of God, nature or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to ask any man that is apprehended a queſtion; or to demand of him,
whether he either ſpake any ſuch words, or heard any ſuch, or did ſuch a
thing, or did it not; for none of both theſe proceedings were counted a
crime in either <hi>Ioſeph</hi> or <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> or any other of the Rulers in Iſrael; for <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
caſt his brother into priſon upon ſuſpition, and queſtioned all his other
brethren upon a pretended jealouſie, and yet they accuſed not the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Aegypt</hi> of unjuſtice to their good old Father: Neither was it a crime
in <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to queſtion his brethren (if the buſineſſe had been reall;) or in <hi>Ioſhua</hi>
to aske <hi>Achan</hi> whether or no he had taken the wedge of gold: And if either
<hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethen or <hi>Achan</hi> had refuſed to have anſwered to the queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
unto them, til either <hi>Ioſeph</hi> or <hi>Ioſhua</hi> had told them the cauſe of their
apprehenſion or commitment, I beleeve they might have laine in priſon till
Doomſ-day in the afternoone (the time that <hi>Iohn Lilburne</hi> thinks the
Parliement will pay him what they owe him) and no wiſe man would
have condemned the Governour of <hi>Aegypt</hi> for ſo doing; and therefore he
moſt ſhamefully abuſeth the Parliament for their proceedings againſt him,
which ſtand very well with the Lawes of God, and all well governed Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and the Scripture that he citeth, concerning <hi>Paul,</hi> was nothing to the
purpoſe, for <hi>Paul</hi> ſtood committed, and that upon ſuſpition: But the Judge
thought it unjuſtice to proceed to ſentence, before that they had heard what
<hi>Paul</hi> could ſay for himſelfe in his owne defence, and ſo the Parliament will
doe to him; and I am moſt aſſured, he ſhall have all the faire hearing in the
world; but all this is nothing to Lieutenant-Colonell <hi>Lilburne's</hi> cauſe, who
might have been releaſed, as <hi>Hawkins</hi> was, and without any diſhonour unto
him, if he had not diſobediently behaved himſelfe to the honourable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee.
For they demanding of him a queſtion, which by all the lawes of
God and nature, and Nations, they might doe, and to which without offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
he might well have anſwered; he contemptuouſly not onely refuſeth to
anſwer, but aſperſeth them with unjuſtice, which was the cauſe of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uation
of his commitment, and then his publiſhing of a libellous and a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:123452:15"/>
moſt dangerous Letter, was a cauſe of his new commitment to New-gate:
And in all this that the Parliament hath done, I am confident when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſhall have a full hearing of the ſame, and be rightly informed, they will
be abundantly ſatisfied of the juſtice of the Honourable Houſe.</p>
            <p>Much I confeſſe I could ſay for the juſtifying of the Parliaments proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,

ſpeciall care, that whiles they ſtudy and labour to offend their enemies, they
doe not deſtroy their preſervers, and abuſe thoſe men cauſeleſly as wiſh them
as much good as they doe themſelves, though they tell them of their faults
and errours; and amongſt others all the Independents have moſt injuriouſly
in word and deed abuſed my ever honoured brother M. <hi>Prynne;</hi> and <hi>John Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne</hi>
in this his Letter in ſpeciall, to my knowledge hath moſt baſely and
falſly belyed him; for it is well knowne he was never a favourer of Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
and ſuch as betrayed ſtrong Holds, as the buſineſſe of Briſtow can well
witneſſe, for the proſecuting of that ſo cordially inraged many of the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents
againſt him; and there be many that can witneſſe for my brother
<hi>Prynne</hi> that he was not the cauſe of the looſing of Gernſey, for had his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
beene followed both thoſe Ilands at this day had bin under the command
of the Parliament; and what he publiſhed concerning the two Captaines it
hath been proved by ſufficient witneſſe, whatſoever they ſay to the contrary;
and Sir <hi>Samuel Luke,</hi> a man of honour and approved integrity, would never
have queſtioned them without ſufficient witneſſe for what he chageth them
with; and as I have bin credibly informed, every thing he accuſeth them of
is abundantly proved by two or three witneſſes. But this is the practice dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Independents, that they will owne nothing of that they have ſaid
or done, but put men upon the proofe, and then aſperſe all thoſe that juſtly
queſtion them for lyers and perſecutors; as at this time that confounded tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor

they are ſent from heaven, when as it is moſt apparent they are meere juglers
and impoſters, and onely make a pray of the people and lead them captive to
liberty and licenciouſneſſe; ſuch Teachers as theſe are ſo farre from a juſt
call from heaven, as they runne before they were ever ſent; ſo that a man
may truly ſay of ſuch Teachers and Miniſters <hi>Diabolus caccavit illos:</hi> and
therefore my reverend brother Maſter <hi>Prynne</hi> hath writ nothing but the truth
concerning them, and is moſt maliciouſly and cauſeleſly abuſed by Lievete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Colonell <hi>Lilburne,</hi> and therefore this that he ſpeaketh concerning him
it not to be beleeved, it being an untruth: And as little credit is to be given
to that he relateth of himſelfe, how he dared Maſter <hi>Prynne</hi> to diſpute with

If Lievetenant Colonell <hi>Lilburne</hi> had really challenged him in that place,
it had bin very incivily done in him; for the Committee, as it is well known,

againſt all Authority. I conceive he hath done a very good and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
worke in reducing their railings, revilings and blaſphemies into a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne,
that they may be left to all poſtity and future ages, that in times to
come the following generations may heare what a hideous and monſtrous
Sect in theſe laſt and worſt times of the world is now riſen up, which ſpeake
evill of dignities and all government at pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Neither hath my brother <hi>Prynne</hi> in this tranſgreſſed, but hath imitated all
the Prophets and the bleſſed Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, who have leſt upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
all the blaſphemies of <hi>Senacharib,</hi> and of all the wicked men in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
ages; <hi>David</hi> hath done the ſame concerning the enemies of God and
his people in his dayes; the Evangeliſts alſo have recited all the blaſphemous
ſpeeches they ſpake againſt Chriſt and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt, and all the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
have done the ſame, as <hi>Peter</hi> in ſpeciall and <hi>Iude;</hi> ſo that by their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
all men may ſee what a wicked generation of men were then living, and
what judgements of God lighted upon them for their ſo doing, to leſſon all
people in future ages to take heed by their examples, leſt they provoke God
by the like wickedneſſe; for whatſoever was written was written for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
upon whom the ends of the world are come.</p>
            <p>Now when my brother <hi>Prynne</hi> hath in this done nothing but what he hath
preſidents for, and that out of Gods Word, he is neither beſotted nor out of
his wits, as he maliciouſly and falſly aſperſeth him; but they rather are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted
that either write, read or entertaine in their houſes with delight ſuch
wicked Bookes as tend to no other end, but to the corrupting not onely of
good manners, but the adulterating of the true Religion and perverting of
mens judgements: and yet Bookes of this nature are continually to be found
in the hands and houſes of all the Independents, and I know few other that
are by them either regarded or looked after; ſo that it is juſt with God to
give ſuch as they are over to fearefull errours, who leave the fountaines of
living waters and digge unto themſelves ſuch broken ceſternes that hold no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but puddle and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>inking filth.</p>
            <p>This I thought by the way to ſpeak in my brother <hi>Prynnes</hi> behalf, nothing
doubting but himſelfe, or ſome friend for him will ſhortly publiſh his juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
againſt all other reproaches, to the world.</p>

And now Maſter <hi>Vicars,</hi> I hope you are ſatisfied concerning <hi>Iohn Lilburnes</hi>
calumnies againſt me and my brother Prynne, but for a corolary let me ſay
thus much, that whereas <hi>Iohn Lilburne</hi> would accuſe me of ingratitude, I may
juſtly complain of his unthankfulnes &amp; uncharitablenes toward me, who hath
rewarded me evil for good; for all that know me can teſtifie for me, that I was
ever his friend to my power; but it is not he alone that would make me an
ungratefull man, but all of that way aſperſe me with the ſame crime; many
of the which notwithſtanding, have for ſmal favors done to me in the time of
my impriſonment, been ſix times over requited for it, as I can prove, and yet
they cry out of my unthankfulneſſe, and others of them that ſent me now and
then a Piece, as a token of their love, and as a free gift, when they turned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents,
demanded it all of me againe, and I have paid them every penny,
four pounds at a time, according to their asking, and yet they cry out of my
ingratitude, and have to my face moſt baſely upbraided me with their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayth, <hi>he that contends with a foole, whether he rage or laugh there is no
peace;</hi> ſo he that hath to doe with the Independents can have no peace with
them, if in the leaſt they differ from them; for if ye be merry with them in
telling them of their grolleries, then they ſay ye jeere them, if ye be ſerious
then they ſay ye raile, ſo that no man can tell how to pleaſe or humour them
or how to enjoy the lawes of civility amongſt them, or to have any peace in
their ſocieties, neither the Parliament, nor Synod, nor Presbytry, or any go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
can pleaſe them, for if the Parliament will have them faſt, then they
will feaſt, and if they would have them feaſt and be merry, then they will
mourne, and ſet dayes apart for humiliations, and ſay, they are ſad times,
nothing can pleaſe the Gentlemen, as their practiſes can witneſſe: And truly
if ever there were a contradicting people, and an ungratefull generation of
men to all ſorts of benefactors, theſe are; if a man conſider things, either in
generall or in ſpeciall.</p>
            <p>As for the Parliament, it is well knowne, that they have honoured that
Sect, as much as ever any authority did any, for they have the principall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
in the Army, and through the Kingdome places of chiefe truſt and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
put in their hands, the prime places of gaine and emolument like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
beſtowed upon them, through all Counties, and are ordinarily as well
paid for their ſervice as any, and yet none ſpeak more unreverendly of the
great Counſell, more harſh, more bitter invectives againſt them and their pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceedings
then they, and more aſperſe their authority, by their practiſes then
they doe, as all their words, pamphlets, preachings and actions can witneſſe.</p>
            <p>As for their ingratitude towards our brethren the Scots, and it is notorious
to all men, for they cannot give them a good word for all their love to us,
no not at this time of their di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

that they have by aſſiſting us, not onely expoſed all their lives to perill, but

think nor ſpeak well of them; ſuch ingratitude was never ſeen in any
Nation; a ſinne ſo great, and crying ſo loud in the eares of Almighty God,
that were this Kingdome guilty of no other, it were enough to bring downe
the plagues of God upon us.</p>
            <p>And howſoever their Miniſteus enjoy all our Pulpits, and have ſuch privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
and immunities without all controle, as was never by any State gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to any ſect; yet they cry out of perſecution and ill uſage, whiles they
themſelves abuſe the whole world, and perſecute in tongue and print, every
living thing that in the leaſt doth not pleaſe their humour: And for ſuch as
have done incomparable favours and curteſies to many of them, and who
have entertained them in their houſes, by the ſix monethes together, gratis,
with their Wives and Children, and ſhewne them ſurperlative humanity, yet
in their greateſt extremities, when they have been plundered of all, ſtript na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and ſome of them have fled to London with ſcarce a rag of their backs,
and have applyed themſelves to ſome of theſe Miniſters, thinking that they
would have retained a memory of former curteſies, they would not own them
or ſcarce look on them; and when poore Gentlewomen, that lived in time
of their proſperity in reputation and honour, and had ſervants then to wait
on them, and being now deprived of all, and brought to beggery, and did
onely deſire them to get them but a ſervice in ſome friends houſe of theirs,
profeſſing that they would willingly ſubmit themſelves to the loweſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
rathet then be a burden to any, ſo long as they had their health; yet
they could not by all their importunity extort a good word out of their
heads in their behalf; and when they deſired but their wives to give them but
one of their old petticoats to cover their nakednes; for anſwer, they were told<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that they were now going over into the Low-countries againe, and that they
had ſent over all their cloathing, ſo that they had nothind left to give away;
and this was two yeeres ſince, and they are yet in England, and have got ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fat Congregations and of chiefe women not a few; ſo that had not ſome
Presbyterians and ſtrangers too, taken ſome compaſſion of them, they might
have ſtarved for all the Independent Miniſters and their Wives, as can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
notwithſtanding they were obliged unto them with all the tyes of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
&amp; when they were in their friends houſes, as they had all reſpectful uſage
ſo they looked for it, and expected dayly to eat and drink of the beſt, or elſe
they might heare of it.</p>
            <p>But as the ingratitude of the Independents is generally taken notice of, ſo
eſpecially of their Miniſters towards their Benefactors; and their covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is very remarkable, ſo that it may be proved, that ſome of the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Miniſters have got more in a yeere here in London, then ten Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Miniſters, and yet they are as covetous as ever they were, and as much as
ever complaining of want, and of the hardneſſe of the times, and for their
phariſaicall pride, it is incomparable, and commonly they inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into rich acquaintance, and love ever to be where good cheere is ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
onely in this they differ from the Phariſes, for they faſted often, twice

better and more acurately handle it then any eight Presbyters in the City of
London; ſo that if yee behold them ſometimes at a Feaſt, you would take
them to be the Nephewes of Helliogabalus. There is not any man that ſhall

out of the Americans and out of the Low-Countries ſmell the good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and plum-pottage into England, which was indeed one of the chiefeſt cauſes
that made theſe men leave their charges and flocks there, and chooſe rather
to live among Wolves, Beares, Lyons and Tygars, (for ſo they tearme us)
for certainly if it were not good cheere, and their belly that made them dwell
amongſt us, they would never have lived here, but as long as that laſt we ſhall
have their company, but when that ceaſes, their zeale will grow cold; for
they have ſent over their treaſuries into <hi>Holland</hi> and into <hi>New-England;</hi> but
as long I ſay, as there is a carcaſe left, they will ſtay by it; for our Saviour
ſaith, where the carcaſe is, thither the Eagles fly, and therefore they are here
yet fluttering about, and when they have picked the bones of it well, then
they will take take their flight and be gone; the Lord ſend us peace and faire
weather after them.</p>
            <p>But in in the meane time Maſter <hi>Vicars,</hi> it concernes us all to take heed of
them, for they are a very dangerous people in all reſpects; for beſides their
good conditions that I have now named, they are terrible diſſemblers, and
notorious lyars, as their daily language and libels can witneſſe, and this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Lieutenant-Colonell <hi>Lilburne</hi> teſtifies; and you alſo know what a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
lye one of their chiefe Paſtors told not long ſince of my reverend bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Waker,</hi> and he did not onely divulge it, but ſtands in the juſtification of
it; and yet there are divers men, and them of reputation, can witneſſe the
contrary to what he affirmes, ſo that no man of a contrary mind, can with
ſafety converſe among them; for they will lay any thing to his charge, and
then ſweare to it, yea they turne ordinary tale-bearers, the worſt of men,
and violate many times all the lawes of humanity to ſatisfie their ſpleen, and
will <hi>peccare contra jura jovis hostitatis,</hi> and all civility, to doe a Presbyterian
a miſchiefe; and thus unchriſtianly dealt that independent Paſtor with my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend

            <p>I muſt confeſſe, if at the recruting of the Parliament, the Independent

never ſo pollute the Temple, as they will defile the Honourable Houſe, and
then downe alſo goes the Gentry and the Nobility, and all Churches; for
they begin already to piſſe in them, and to ſcummer in the Pewes of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
out of a hatred they beare to that name, diſdaining that any ſhould be
thought greater then themſelves; telling them when they forcibly crowd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their ſeats, that the Saints have more right to thoſe places then they, and
therefore partly for the ſtinking of them out of their ſeats, as Baggars doe
Foxes out of their holes, by defiling them, theſe Independent Country
Courtiers ſcummer and piſſe in their Pewes; and partly alſo they doe it out
of hatred to the very ſtructure of the poore Churches, which ſay they, having
been conſecrated to Idolatry, ought to be demoliſhed, or elſe made a Tophet
on, and a place of eaſement, and therefore it is now growne an ordinary

               </gap>hing with the Independents thus to pollute Churches; and ſome of them
would have given ſeven thouſand pound, not long ſince, for Pauls, that they
might have demoliſhed it as an Idol Temple, and ſo in their judgements the
Gentry and Nobility are Idols, and have too long been adored and venerated,
and they now deſire that honor themſelves, and therfore if once they have the
power in their hands, and get into the Parliament, then out go all the ſons of
<hi>Belial,</hi> fot ſo they call the Gentry: Therefore if you have any acquaintance
with thoſe that are to chooſe Burgeſſes for the Parliament, give them a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
caviat to take heed how they make any of that fraternity Parliament-men;
let them have an eye to the godly and truly religious (without faction) and
underſtanding Gentlemen in the Country, that know what really belongs to
government: For conſider what a deale of miſery all the Countryes through
the Kingdome are involved in, by reaſon of the Committees that are compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of thoſe independent Country Courtiers, who generally domineer over

and exerciſe more ſeverity over the Parliaments very friends, then the

friends againe and againe, that they make choyce of no Independent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

they profeſſe openly, we ſhall never know them: And thus much I thought
