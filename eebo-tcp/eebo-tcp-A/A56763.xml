            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am ſorry to hear that the <hi>Small Pox</hi> is ſo riſe at <hi>London,</hi> it's the leſs Wonder to find you ſo Inquiſitive after a good Specifick Remedy in that Diſtemper: I muſt tell you, I know no better Medicine in that Caſe than
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44433:3"/>
the Famous <hi>Carolina</hi> Herb called <hi>Caſſiny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are abundance of Perſons now Dye of the Small Pox in our Town and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, but I attribute it very much to ill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Nurſes and Ignorant People, who give many hot Medicines, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of driving out, as Sack, and Saffron, and Mithridate, and <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle; by this means they fire the Blood into a Feavor, and that kills them. I only give a few Drops of the Tincture of this temperate Herb in Water-gruel, or in Panado, or Poſſet-drink, and do nothing elſe all the while, but leave it to Nature, and I find better Succeſs.</p>
            <p>I have had many in one Family down at one time of this loathſome Diſtemper, and all recover'd with this Method; but if any deſire to dye with more pompous Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, much good may it do them.</p>
            <p>The Medicines made of this Herb do not in the leaſt heat the Blood, but rather moderate and gently allay the violent Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44433:3"/>
of it, if it be too high, and yet ſafely help the Expulſive Faculty if it be too weak. This Specifick keeps them out of the Head and Throat, and ſecures the Lungs, by helping Expectoration.</p>
            <p>I have often obſerved, that the ſlower they are in coming forth, the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; and if the Salivation or Spitting ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before the eleventh Day, eſpecially in a Flux Pox, there is then much more reaſon to fear the Patients being poyſoned by the return of the purulent Matter inwards: And yet in this extream hazard the Tincture of this Herb in Small Beer, and ſome times in Tare Broath, hath ſaved the Lives of many.</p>
            <p>I being once ſent for to a Boarding-School, where ſeveral young Gentlewomen, who high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valued their Beauty, were ſurprized with the Small Pox, I only gave them the Drops drawn out of this Herb in all their liquid Aliment, as Water-gruel, and Poſſet-drink, and Small Beer, and cauſed them to keep their Faces co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with their Masks all the time, and they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44433:4"/>
recover'd, and preſerv'd their Complections.</p>
            <p>I remember that an Eminent Phyſitian of <hi>London</hi> told me an extraordinary Caſe of a Court Lady of great Beauty, a Patient of his, who was much afflicted at the Death of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who dyed of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> and he was reſolved to try a contrary Method to what had been taken with thoſe, he kept her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately warm cover'd with Scarlet Blankets, omitted Bleeding, and cauſed her to take no more Nouriſhment than would keep her from ſtarving; her Drink was Poſſet-drink, with Figgs in it; her Food only Bread and Water boyl'd together, with ſeven Drops of this Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick which came out of <hi>Carlina</hi>; he cauſed a live Sheep to be kept in the Chamber all the time of her Illneſs, to draw away the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity; the Sheep dyed, but the Lady reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, although it was a very unkindly ſort, which much threaten'd her Life; the Dr. told me he durſt never give her any Opiate Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, leſt it ſhould ſtop her Spitting, which is the moſt proper way of Evacuation in all ſorts of <hi>Poxes,</hi> both great and ſmall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:44433:4"/>The Virtues of this excellent Plant are at large mentioned in an Account of <hi>Carolina,</hi> and alſo in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> a Latine Book written by <hi>John Delait</hi> of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> many Years ſince, who tells us that it's an Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Dioretick, it alſo greatly corroborates Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and helps her to caſt off whatever is offenſive to the Animal and Vital Spirits, and alſo it promotes genuine eaſie Sweats, and mild friendly tranſpirations, preſerving the Mind ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene, and the Body active and lively a long while after, without any other Nouriſhment, and none but Perſons of great Quality are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to uſe this Noble Beverage, which they drink as we do Tea and Coffee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Purchas</hi> in his Pilgrimage tells us, that at <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida,</hi> now called <hi>Carolina,</hi> they live to a very great Age, and ſpeaks of one of their Kings who was three Hundred years old; and whenever the Inhabitants of that Countrey meet with Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Accidents, or Subjects of Lamentation, they drink <hi>Caſſiny</hi> to chear their Hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:44433:5"/>A famous Sea-Chyrurgeon who came from thoſe Parts, had moſt of his Ships Paſſengers taken ſick of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> and recover'd them with Medicines made with this Herb.</p>
            <p>I have ſo great an Opinion of this Plant, that if I had an Only Child who had the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> I would give him the Tincture of it in all his Drink, and depend upon it under God, as much as I would upon the <hi>Peruvian Bark</hi> in a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Ague.</p>
