            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>On the 9. day of Auguſt we arrived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Galloway, which is the ſtrongeſt
towne they have, except Limbrick, and
there laid ſiege to it: ſo the Lord of
of Clenrikard came downe and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with our Lord Forbes, and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
of the towne: they ſtrongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
and ſaid, that they were the Kings
loyall ſubjects, and had not offended in
the leaſt thing, but that the ſouldiers in
the Kings Fort had done them wrong:
but had the King ſealed to our Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
we ſhould have found enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, that we might truly have
made an onſet upon the towne: wee
were ſo neere the towne with our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,
that we could heare them plainly
call our Parliament rogues, Parliament-dogs,
and Puritan-Dogs: ſo you may
very well conceive what ſubjects they
are. On the third and fourth day we
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62045:3"/>
re-fetcht aboard our ſouldiers, and the
ſixth day wee ſet ſaile from Gallaway to
go to Limbrick, and on the ninth day
we arrived in Limbrick river, and on
the two and twentieth day we laid ſiege
to the Knights of the Elmes Caſtle, that
is to ſay in Engliſh, the Knights of the
valley; the which Caſtle we plaid upon
two dayes and two nights with two
Demi-Canons: ſo the ſecond day we
entred the Caſtle, ſlaying all we found
alive: but when we came to burie them
we found but eighteene or twentie, the
reſt made an eſcape and got into the
woods: there came a great army of the
Iriſh within ſight of the Caſtle; there
marched out betwixt four and five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and when they began to approach,
the Iriſh men fled, and durſt not ſtand:
We tooke in this Caſtle a thouſand bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhels
of Wheat, three or foure thouſand
vveight of Butter, beſides Barley, Malt
and ſalt Beefe: this Caſtle vve took on
the three and tvventieth of September
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62045:4"/>
vvith the loſſe of five men, a Trouper
and a Footman in the purſuit after the
firſt landding, and three other after vve
came under the Caſtle vvals, tvvo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſouldiers, and the Maſter of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Thompſons ſhip: after they vvere
under the Caſtle vvals, they vvent off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and ſo vvere ſhot from the caſtle
out of one of the lovver holes: but
vvhen vve entred the caſtle, vve loſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

not the number vve ſlevv before the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
vvas taken, for they buried their dead
out of our ſight. We had a very hard
ſiege of it by reaſon of the fouleneſſe of
the vveather, I think they did ſet all the
divels they ſerve to vvorke; for it did
raine and blovv all the time; vve vvere
in the cold exceedingly, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
