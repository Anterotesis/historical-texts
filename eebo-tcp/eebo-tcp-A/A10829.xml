         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Apoſtolically conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Fayth of
Chriſt, the <hi>Britans</hi> or
ancient Inhabitants of England,
are vndoubtedly to be numbred,
as <hi>Origen 4. in Ezechielem, Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
contra Iudaeos, Dorotheus</hi> in his
<hi>Synopſis, Theodoret,</hi> and others
haue expreſly affirmed, beſides
many home proofes, and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
teſtimonies of that their ſo
<pb facs="tcp:16468:6"/>
timely conuerſion. Which primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
Fayth of theirs hauing byn,
by a continuall mixture of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
and other Infidells liuing
amongſt them, and perſecuting
them for the ſame, exceedingly
decayed; was againe cultiuated
by <hi>Fugatius,</hi> and <hi>Damianus</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall
Preachers, ſent for that
purpoſe by Pope <hi>Elutherius</hi> vnto
them, the very next age after the
Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Since which tyme albeit they
loſt to the Saxons, the greateſt, &amp;
fruitefulleſt part of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and were enforced to betake
themſelues to the mountanous
places of <hi>Wales</hi> (as now it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
and <hi>Cornewall;</hi> yet haue they
ſtill vntill this laſt age, vnalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
maintayned their primitiue

written by that learned man <hi>M.
Brerely,</hi> is moſt cleerly proued, &amp;

            <p>And to recompence perhaps,
their Conſtancy therein, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings

perſons ſworne, and publique In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
authentically appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
I forbeare heere further to
mention, then as my Authour
doth afterwards recount them;
<pb facs="tcp:16468:8"/>
and will only ſay, that this Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and Coſtly monument, is
the more to be admired, for that
it ſtandeth in ſo hilly, poore, and
barten a Countrey, which hath
ſcarſly any thing, but this fayre
building remarkable in it, exactly
therefore drawne out by <hi>M. Speed</hi>
in his Table of <hi>Flint-ſhyre,</hi> and in
his Comment hiſtorically decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
yet with this tale ridiculouſly
added, that Catholiques viſiting
the <hi>Well,</hi> do really belieue the red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the ſtones to be the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
very bloud, and the Moſſe
growing therein her hayre, like
to one of <hi>Ouids</hi> Metamorphoſing
Fables.</p>
            <p>The Life of this Noble Virgin
and Martyr, was diligently and
authentically gathered (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in his Prologue profeſſeth)
<pb facs="tcp:16468:8"/>
by <hi>Robertus Salopienſis,</hi> a learned
Monke and <hi>Priour</hi> of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi>
of the holy order of S. Benedict,
liuing in King <hi>Stephens</hi> tyme, &amp;
for his great ſincerity, by <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Baronius, Surius, Capgraue, Pits,
Poſseuinus,</hi> and others, worthily
commended. Whoſe booke cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
truly out of an old authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Manuſcript, I haue heere in
ſenſe faithfully tranſlated, and
done no otherwiſe in altering the
Authors old phraſes, ſcarſely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible
in good Engliſh, then as
if I had ſtripped ſome body out of
Welſh courſe frize, and put him
into a ſuite of Engliſh playne
Kareſay.</p>
            <p>And if the matter of the Booke,
conteyning in it ſundry ſtrange
and miraculous paſſages, ſhall
ſeeme ridiculous to <hi>Protestants</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:16468:9"/>
chancing to read them, it is not
much to be wondred at, ſithence
they will be their owne chooſers,
euen in the very beliefe of ſacred
Verities themſelues, diuinely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed;
and ſleight, as fabulous
Legends, the Liues of Saintes,
written by <hi>S. Athanaſius, S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi>
S. <hi>Hierome, S. Climachus, S.
Gregory,</hi> and other holy Fathers.</p>
            <p>It ſufficed my Author, and ſo it
ſhall me, that deuout Catholiques
for whoſe inſtruction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
he penned firſt his Hiſtorie,
will piouſly and probably aſſent
to that, which heere is credibly
propoſed vnto them, auoyding
two extremes therein; the one is
of belieuing things ouerlightly, &amp;
the other of belieuing nothing at
all but as fancies, and ſelfe-opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
do guide them. The which,
<pb facs="tcp:16468:9"/>
in Sectaries following commonly
this latter extreme in their iudg-ment
of Catholique writings, is
a kind of Infidelity, and Impiety
mixed togeather: for if God be
wonderfull in his Saintes (as the
Royall Prophet telleth vs, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
67.) and Chriſt in his Aſcenſion
towards heauen did ſo expreſly
promiſe, that theſe ſignes ſhould
follow ſuch as did belieue in him,
<hi>In my name</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>they ſhall caſt
out Diuells, they shall ſpeake with
new tongues &amp;c.</hi> why should we
vpon probable teſtimonies refuſe
to belieue, ſuch wonders to haue
ben done by Saintes, as diuine te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifications
of their true Fayth,
and great graces heere obtayned?</p>
            <p>The ſacred body of this Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Bleſſed Saint, was ſolemnly
tranſlated to <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> in this
<pb facs="tcp:16468:10"/>
Authors tyme in the yeare of our
Lord 1138. and raigne of <hi>K. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi>
and there, in his owne Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
magnificently interred, that
greater honour and veneration,
in ſo populous, and Religious a
Citty (as that was then) might be
yielded vnto it; where it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
for aboue 400. yeares, till
Hereſie preuayled vtterly to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
in our Country the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
profeſsion of Catholique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and deface the Venerable
monuments thereof euery where
almoſt then extant. In which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ruine &amp; calamity hapning,
the ſhrine of this great Saint with
numbers of others became ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiouſly
defaced, and her ſacred
Reliques lye ſince diſperſed God
knoweth where or how, vntill by
his omnipotency, they ſhall come
<pb facs="tcp:16468:10"/>
to be vnited againe, &amp; moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
rayſed, <hi>For God</hi> (ſayth the
ſame holy Prophet <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.) <hi>doth
conſerue all the bones of his ſeruants:</hi>
and it hath increaſed I doubt not
their ioyes accidentall in heauen,
to haue had heere on earth for his
ſake, their Reliques by the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
enemies, and haters of true
Religion contemptuouſly abuſed,
after due Reuerence yeilded by
deuout people vnto them, and
ſingular bleſſings receaued from
Almighty God by their powerfull
interceſſion.</p>
            <p>Neither haue moderne Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
ſhewed in any one act more,
the little Communion, which
they haue in this world, or are
likely to haue in the other, with
the Saintes of Chriſts Church,
then in contemning, ſcattering,
<pb facs="tcp:16468:11"/>
and deſtroying their Reliques,
of which in generall <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi>
writeth thus, <hi>Serm. 93. de Sanctis
Nazario &amp; Celſo. If thou aske me
what I honour in their flesh and bones
now diſſolued and conſumed? I honour
in the Martyrs flesh, the ſcarres of
thoſe woundes, which for Christ he
ſusteyned; I honour the memory of his
vertue still liuing; I honour in his
ashes the ſeedes of Eternity; I honour
the body that taught me to loue Christ,
and not to feare the cruelleſt death for
him. Why should not faithfull ſoules
honour that body, which Diuells trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>quod Christum honorauit
in gladio, quod cum Christo regnabit
in caelo: that body, I ſay, which hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Christ in the ſword, and which
shall reigne with him in Heauen.
Theſe</hi> (ſayth <hi>S. Baſill</hi> ſpeaking of
the 40. Martyrs Reliques) <hi>are thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:16468:11"/>
who protect our Countrey, and like
strong Towers guard vs from our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore I may vſe, of ſuch
as ſcattered, and deſtroyed the
holy reliques of <hi>S.Wenefride,</hi> and
many other Saintes in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<hi>S. Gregory Nazianzens</hi> words
in his firſt Oration againſt <hi>Iulian</hi>
the Apoſtata; <hi>Thou hast not reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced
the Hoastes ſlaine for Christ,
whoſe bodies, yea very drops of their
bloud, or other ſmall ſignes of their
paſsions, can worke the ſame effects
which their ſoules themſelues can doe;</hi>
to wit ſuch ſudaine cures of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and diſeaſes, as <hi>S. Austin lib.</hi>
22. <hi>de Ciuitate Dei cap.</hi> 8. affirmeth
by <hi>S. Stephens</hi> Reliques, as they
paſſed through <hi>Afrique</hi> towards
<hi>Rome,</hi> to haue byn done in his
preſence: which Proteſtants will
<pb facs="tcp:16468:12"/>
as little belieue, as they do the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
paſſages of <hi>S. Wenefride</hi>
recounted in this Hiſtorie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
whome there is no one
ſo ſtraunge, but the like may be
found in other Saintes liues, by
holy &amp; ancient Fathers authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
written; and in ſome of
them far more ſtraunge: which
piouſly read, &amp; probably belieued
by faithful ſoules for 1400. yeares
ſince, cannot but temerariouſly be
reiected now, and contemned by
Proteſtants; whoſe corrupt Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as I regard not in this my
tranſlation: ſo I hope good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques
will read it with edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and comfort. For it may
well delight them, as it doth me,
to thinke that we haue anciently

ancienter hiſtorians do witneſse,
though the Names, and liues of

in the booke of life regiſtred,
and will in the generall Iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
be gloriouſly reuealed.</p>
            <p>That <hi>S. Wenefride</hi> likewiſe,
ſhould liue againe, after her head
cut off, and do the things which
heere are written of her in her
Hiſtorie (the chiefe blocke which
incredulous Readers perhaps will
ſtumble at) is no more hard to
be belieued, then that <hi>Lazarus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had ben dead, and ſtinking
in his graue, ſhould liue agayne,
ſit at table with Chriſt, and be Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Marſills in <hi>France</hi> many
yeares after. And if it be obiected
<pb facs="tcp:16468:13"/>
that Chriſt himſelfe, did worke
that miracle, able to do all things:
I may well anſwere, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
his owne power, and far
greater wonders then himſelfe
had wrought, to be done by his
ſeruants, extant now in authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall

Venerable ſelfe, much reſpected
by me, the Collection which I
have lately made of the Bleſſed
<hi>Virgin</hi> S. Wenefrides <hi>life: the
reading whereof, will, I doubt
not, help much to increaſe and
perfit heauenly piety, and love
eminently already, and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarly
to many shining in You;
delighted alſo to dilate the glory
of God, &amp; his Saints by workes
like to this, which you haue by
frequent letters, and earneſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties
required of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I haue gathered the ſame,
partly from the Ancient, and
vndoubted Monuments of ſuch
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16468:17"/>
Monaſteries, and Churches as
this Bleſſed Virgin is knowne to
haue liued in, and partly from
the relation of ſundry Ancient
Prieſts, for their great learning
ſanctity of life, and Religious
profeſsion, made Venerable, &amp;
worthy of all credit, in their
aſsertions, and depoſitions vnto
me.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Three cauſes have moued me
to publish the true knowledge
of this Saints life, ſo by me at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
vnto. The firſt, was a
wholſome feare (as I haue ſaid)
to be reproued by my Eternall
Iudge, for hiding vnder grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16468:17"/>
and not imploying profitably as
I ought the talent which he hath
lent me. The ſecond, was my eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall
loue, and deuotion to this
moſt renowned Virgin and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
of our Countrey, that by her
ſanctity, and great merits heere
by me declared, she might by
faithfull ſoules be the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutely
honoured, ſerued, and
prayed unto. The third, was
a particular deſire which I have
charitably had to edifie my owne
Brethren, humbly in their deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and inſtantly intreating
this labour of me.</hi>

this which I have heere gathered
being ſufficient, in my opinion,

the eminent ſanctity and graces
of this most ſacred Virgin, by

and your holy prayers, I hope to

otherwiſe affoarded her, ran
out by a backe way, as faſt

brake into the roome, and
finding her not there, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
her ſo haſtely in her

of wrathful indignation that
if forthwith she conſented
not to his will, ſo full of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
