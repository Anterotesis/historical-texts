            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS many (right Honorable) from the high to the low, of all ſortes haue bene deſirous greatly and a long time, to haue the holy booke of God, which for the old Teſtament is in Ebrew, for the new all originally in Greeke, to be tranſlated and beautified with all furniture for playnes and ornaments: that ſuch as ſtudie it, ſhould in no place be ſnared by the tranſlater: but rather in all poinctes might haue at the firſt layd cleare before them all that ſtudie can affoord: It may be thought a good help to the bringing of their deſire to paſſe, by ioyning of al effectuallie in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the worke: to ſhewe what in this paynes may be better done then yet we haue in Englande.

Alſo where the later repeat the former holy writers, therein as it were commenting vpon them, that ſhould in all clearnes be expreſſed, and noted. Theſe be poinctes of neceſſitie. Some others of ornament in the end of our ſpeach may be conſydered. Thus all are briefly told once: which by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement will appeare more pleaſant.

That fault is exceeding great, for a man to take vpon him to bee wiſer then God: and to take his kingly care tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in trueth of wordes. All men will graunt that there is not an idle plant, fiſhe, worme, foule, or beaſt in nature, nor yet ſtarre in the ſkye: but all knowen and looked vnto by Gods care.

The Pſal. 25. hath an Alphabet, ſaving for two letters: and the Pſalme is a generall forme of prayer. There the wiſeſt may try, whither any wiſedome could ſupply the argument,

Saint Luke Act. 7. maketh Iacobs familie to be of ſeauentie fiue ſoules, whereas Moſes in Ebrew hath but ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentie. And an Arabique tranſlation, written (as none are yet printed I trowe) brought vnto me from the Indianes, hath but ſeauentie ſoules.

For thus the caſe ſtandeth: The Septuagint adde vnto Moſes Perſones, fiue to Ioſeph (vnborne when Manaſſes and Ephraim were but

ſeauen or eight yeares old, at Iacobs comming to Egypt) a ſonne and a grandechilde to Manaſſes, Machir and Gilead: to Ephraim two ſonnes, Sutelah and Tahan: with Sutelahs ſonne Eden: all theſe, fiue: &amp; accordingly doe they ſumme all, to be ſeauentie fiue ſoules. Great reaſons moued them: which fewe wordes can not make plaine. Saint Luke wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Greeke was to followe the Greeke: though Saint Stephen ſpake as the Ebrew ſtood. And the Arabique tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlatour, that folowed the Ebrew in a neare language, which ſhould be conferd with the Ebrew, not with the Greeke in Gen. 46. ſhewed a profound iudgement:<note place="margin">A phraſe Act. 13. true in 450. whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is but 339 and lappeth al one book and 19. pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in one ſumme.</note> regarding as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Luke did, nations weakenes, whereof vnto this day fewe knowe Saint Lukes minde, though it be not darke, if wee had looked vnto the Septuaginta.

And theſe examples may bee ſufficient to ſhew a Tranſlators care for defence of the text. Many are ready fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both Teſtaments. One kinde I cannot paſſe ouer, which Daniel hath in two examples:<note place="margin">The Maſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites onelye kept Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els copy pure: twiſe in Dan. 7. and 8.</note> where but for the <hi>Maſſorites</hi> Bible, the common copies would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue errour. Daniel turneth the notation of a Chaldean kinges name and his owne Chaldean name, into cleane contrarie ſignifications, by tranſpoſing one vnſounded letter: <hi>Bel is

the authour of wealth: and Bel is a fyre of ſorrowe</hi> theſe are cleane contrarie, as darknes and light: ſinne &amp; iuſtice: idols and the throne of God.

The obſeruing of theſe matters will bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de plentie of dexteritie in the ſtory of the Kings: which, ſome Ebrews thinke that Ierem. penned: as <hi>Ezra</hi> the Chr. In ſumme, this much I thinke of that learned Latin work and of the late French edition which foloweth it: that in the obſeruationes much iniurie is done to the trueth of ſtory. Examples may theſe be taken. <hi>Amazias</hi> raigned at Ieruſalem nine and twentie yeares, ſayeth the text. The notes checke it, that he raigned but ſeauenteene yeres, and liued at <hi>Lachis,</hi> banniſhed all the reſt. <hi>Amazias</hi> was killed, and when his ſonne was ſixteene yeares old, the people of the lande made him king. The notes make him reigne all the time of his fathers baniſhment. The text telleth, that he began to reigne in the ſeauen &amp; twentieth of <hi>Ieroboam:</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:22797:16"/>
that he was then ſixteene yeares olde: and ſo he ſhould be about foure at his fathers death: &amp; a regentſhip of eleauen yeares ſhould goe betwixt. The notes make him raigne foure &amp; twentie yeares afore that time: that is eight yeres afore he was borne. The text maketh him reigne two and fiftie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Ieroboams</hi> ſeauen &amp; twentie. The notes make him then ſtroken with a leproſy &amp; to continue eight &amp; twentie yeares. The text teacheth that <hi>Iotham,</hi> at his fathers death, was but fiue &amp; twentie yeares old. So, by the former note, he ſhould iudge the people afore he was born, three yeres. The notes, to auoyd that, expounde the text thus: <hi>Hee was fiue and twentie yeares olde when he reigned,</hi> that is, <hi>when he ruled the kingdome in his fathers leproſie: and he raigned ſixteene yeres:</hi> that is, <hi>after his fathers death.</hi> If this had bene done in myne owne nation, I would haue blamed it more largely: But I loth to diſgrace a learned paynes, but for infinite neceſſity. And our trauels might haue more cleared the regentſhip of <hi>Azarias</hi> and the two and twentie yeares of <hi>Anarchy</hi>: that earthquake of the ſtate, and the ſtyrres called <hi>Iezreel:</hi> and likewiſe for <hi>Ezekiels</hi> 390. yeares, where the French notes returne to the right trueth: againſt their owne particulars in all theſe errours, wee in a fewe wordes might haue kept our nation from liking ſtrange opinions. Other matters of this Latin worke for the laſt Prophetes times &amp; <hi>Zorobabels</hi> houſe, I haue written, againſt his learned defendor therin: though not here. D.R. whom I name for honors ſake. He deſerued great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation for hazarding his fame: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 2000. yeares errours holden almoſt generally ouer all Greekes and Latines Libraries, could be ſet on flame with a fire of iudgement taken from the holy authour. And, I trow, all of hart and our language, will confeſſe that parte cleared, by my paynes: how ſo euer ſome feared to ſtande to an arbitrement: reported that they had paſſed, as lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:22797:17"/>
would require them and all to determine. Yet hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what infinite millions were againſt me: they thought it the ſafeſt way to haue all in ſuſpenſe. But I thought it a duetie vnto God and my countrey, to cleare not only the cauſe, but all the Bible, by Gods helpe, in our tongue: and to ſeeke for the next kingdomes helpe, if that labour at home ſhould be blaſphemed. Experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in <hi>Daniel</hi> the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt booke, cleared (I hope) in the very dedication, may ſhewe how ſoone and eaſilie, much holden paſt hope of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieving, may be accompliſhed.

Nowe we vpon Gen. 4.26. ſay, Then men began to make invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the name of the Lorde. But Moſes expoundeth him ſelfe Ch. 6.1.

I doe not yet preſently aſcend. The holy and wiſe Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt left out her action, to bee gathered by our Lorde his ſpeach.

Howe we haue contemned all this: examples wee haue like the ſande of the ſea, that can not bee numbred.

And one of you Lordes requeſted me to write a common Epiſtle to you all: that you might ſo better knowe howe in time to agree for execution of good will this way. That requeſt I haue (as ye ſee) accompliſhed. And I hope your Noble learning will not expect an inflaming peroration. The dignitie of the matter is greater then any Oratour can match. And for perſonnages, none be ſo fitt as your ſelfes to vrge it. Profeſſed Scholers, who ſtudie to liue: and not liue to ſtudie, are commonly, being advaunced, hinderers of all that paſſeth the common baſe courſe. And as my furtherance for honorable wordes, workes, charges, and all tendring hath bene from the Nobilitie (from what ſide the contrarie: I will yet ſee, and nothing ſay) ſo I am free to chuſe whom I would honour in this motion. Vnder the terme of Nobilitie, as we here towards Germanie do, I conteyne all the ancient and good Gentry of the land: whom all I wiſh to haue a care &amp; portion about the book of life. The deliberation ſhould be quick. The King of our language hath dealt very royally for his part: with a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnes very readie.

               </gap>rth in fayrer and more diſtinct letters: and they would each vndertake copyes to fiue poundes: both ten. Herevpon I cauſed <hi>M. Fr. Raphelengius,</hi> the beſt of Printers, to print me a thouſand: which I haue ſent to Englande, to make our Diuines readier in great matters. Maiſter <hi>Ioſeph. Scaliger,</hi> a Gentleman of rare learning, and Maiſter <hi>Raphelengius</hi> had neuer ſeene them before I ſent them to <hi>Leyden:</hi> Both as good Linguiſtes, as any in the world: and learned men: to whom I am very much beholding for ſingular gentlenes in lending me bookes rare and of rare commoditie: ſuch as our nation, I trowe, neuer yet ſawe. A certen Engliſh man here, had by my gyft but one copy, and was ſhewed the vſe of it: of whom I demaunded in ſadnes to record it in print, what he eſteemed of the matter: and he ſayd that of trueth, he would not for twentie poundes bee without the copye and the matter. The caſe ſtanding thus, I can not chuſe but be grieued to ſee my Ebrewe ſtudies ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, a good old worke and a rare monument, marred, &amp; occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offered to haue our natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for learning much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned. The certeintie of the holy text in Ebrew, is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as all called to grace, will confeſſe to be gracious. And that rare piece of worke of <hi>Sadaias,</hi> will ſeeme, to all, voyde of Papiſtrie, and endued with reaſon, to confirme much the certeintie of Scripture. Wherfore proceeding from an enemie, for the trueth, &amp; grounds of faith, the corrupting of it ſhould ſeeme a worke farre from grace. Beſides theſe verſes of <hi>Sadaias,</hi> a piece of the <hi>Ieruſalemy Talmud,</hi> very plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſant and learned with Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> learned in Ebrew, is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in this Printers edition: whereas no open aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie could ſo much diſgrace, as ſuch a corrupter of matters brought about not without great paynes, pretending re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to the authour. I haue felt griefe in this kinde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie not a litle: by a booke collected from ſundry frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
<pb facs="tcp:22797:30"/>
by a ſeruingman: and falſely reported to be notes from me. As that booke was in printing, I did cauſe the ſeruingman to ſhewe your grace of it, that the Printer had no authour for his worke: and, as he tolde me, the Printer was bound in fiue hundred poundes not to proceede: but by a bribe, ventured againſt his band, and vpon complaint anſwere was returned, that the Printer would noyſe how he was vndone: So againſt all that I could doe, forged ware, ſome ſtollen from me, ſome from others, and more kindes then <hi>Labans</hi> ſheepes coloures, were ſolde deare in <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Sturbridge</hi> fayre, and ſtill fathered vpon ſuch as moſt loth it. As all trueth ſhould be trueth: ſpeciallie in diuinitie it ſhould be ſo. And the befooling of an whole nation ſhould not be counted a light faulte: in forging au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, by pieuiſh printers, &amp; greadie of vnhoneſt gaynes. I was minded neuer to haue printed anie thing. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of matters to be as mine, which I lothed, they forced me to leaue in print the whole veyne of my iudgement in Diuinitie, in the booke of Scripture concent. That any might knowe myne from forged ware. Nowe at my firſt printing much anger I had. When it came furth: the great Lord Chauncelour tolde the Queene, as he bragged, that in no caſe any countenance might be ſhewed me: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon a Noble Earle, who had named vnto me a fine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of my ſtudy, hearing of the L. Chauncelours ſpeach, altered. And I to pay the L. Chauncelour, mynded to haue liued in Germanie: till I heard the Queenes aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: That he commended, whom he condemned. For that the booke was ſchollerlike &amp; all for the States good: where to knowe howe to ouerreach others, &amp; not to doe it, argueth a minde bent to quietnes. Another gaue out wordes alſo to the Queene: vnlearned and malicious: of whom I will yet ſpeake nothing. Your Grace I muſt now commend for much humanitie, that tolde one, ſent in my
<pb facs="tcp:22797:31"/>
cauſe: that whatſoeuer you could doe for me, you would: So that I would acknowledge my friends. In trueth my L. touching preferments I was thus minded hitherto: that if my worthier in the common eſtimation ſtept before me: I would reioyce. But when two hundreth thouſande poundes a yeere is ſpent by the Church vpon ſuch as can not reade a line of the Bible: and I could not liue in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande vnſollicited ſtill to preach: and was commended by the Queene, whom I trowe you will not checke, I ſee not why I may not require my recompence: as the Realme hath put the Queene in truſt to deale: and require it with as good a conſcience, as you may receyue one pennie of your tenantes. You gaue me counſell to be toward ſome Biſhop or ſome Lord as one ſayde to whom it ſhould bee tolde. The Queene or a Prince ſhould bee the onely Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron for one of my yeares ſpent in hard ſtudies. And the Counteſſe of <hi>Warwicke</hi> tolde that the Queene would not for all the prefermentes in the Realme, I went out of the Realme. In the time of deliberation, I pray your Grace, that Printers be not allowed to diſgrace my ſtudies.</p>
