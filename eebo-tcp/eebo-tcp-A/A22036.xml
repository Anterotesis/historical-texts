            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For wee are not ignorant, that of all other ſeditions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, none doth bring ſuch infinite waſte and deſolation vpon a Kingdome or State, as theſe popular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections, which though they doe ſeldome ſhake or indanger a Crowne, yet they doe bring a heape of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities vpon multitudes of innocent Subiects, and chiefly vpon the Authors and Acters themſelues.</p>
            <p>And againe, Wee doe obſerue, that there was not ſo much as any neceſſitie of famine or dearth of corne, or any other extraordinary accident, that might ſtirre or prouoke them in that maner to offend; but that it may be thought to proceede of a kinde of inſolencie and contempt of our milde and gracious Gouernment, which mought (in ſome Prince) turne the ſame into more heauy wrath and diſpleaſure. But We neuertheleſſe hauing at the very entrance of our Raigne, in the higheſt treaſons againſt our owne Perſon, intermingled Mercie with iuſtice, are much more inclined in this caſe, which concerneth a number of poore &amp; ſimple people, to extend our naturall clemencie to wards them. Whereupon we haue reſolued to ſet wide open the gate of our Mercie vnto them, and to beſtowe vpon them our free Grace and Pardon, without further Suite or Supplication.</p>
            <p>And therefore we doe hereby take and receiue all the ſayd Offenders, and euery of them, to our Mercie, and of our Grace and meere motion, freely pardon vnto them their ſayd Offences, and all paines of Death or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther puniſhment due for the ſame, and promiſe vnto them, in the word of their naturall Liege Lord and King, that they ſhall not be in any wiſe moleſted or impeached, in Life, Member, Lands or Goods for their ſayd Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, or any of them. So as neuertheleſſe, that before Michaelmas next they doe ſubmit themſelues, and acknowledge their ſayd Offences before our Lieutenant, Deputie Lieutenant, or Sheriffe in the Countie where they ſhall remaine, whereof Wee will and command a Note or Entrie to be made and kept.</p>
            <p>And We are further graciouſly pleaſed, that if any of them ſeuerally or iointly ſhal deſire for their better aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to haue our Pardon vnder our great Seale, that our Chancellor ſhal make the ſame vnto them without further warrant in that behalfe. Not intending neuertheleſſe to preiudice any our Subiects priuate Suite or Action, but ſo much as in Us is, abſolutely to acquite &amp; diſcharge them againſt Us, our Heires &amp; Succeſſors.</p>
