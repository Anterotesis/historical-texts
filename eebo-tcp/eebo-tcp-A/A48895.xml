            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THese Notions, concerning <hi>Coinage,</hi> having for the main, as you know, been put into Writing above Twelve Months since; as those other concerning <hi>Interest,</hi> a great deal above so many years: I put them now again into your hands, with a Liberty (since you will have it so) to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them farther, as you please. If, upon a Review, you continue your favourable Opinion of them, and nothing less than Publishing will satisfie you, I must desire to remember, That you must be answerable to the World
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56722:3"/>
for the Stile; which is such as a Man writes carelesly to his Friend, when he seeks Truth, not Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and studies only to be in the right, and to be understood. I have, since you saw them last year, met with some new Objections in Print which I have endeavoured to remove; and particularly, I have taken into Consideration a Printed Sheet, entituled, <hi>Remarks upon a Paper given in to the Lords,</hi> &amp;c. Because one may naturally suppose, That he that was so much a Patron of that Cause, would omit nothing that could be said in favour of it. To this I must here add, That I am just now told from <hi>Holland, That the States, finding themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused by coining a vast quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56722:3"/>
of their base</hi> [Schillings] <hi>Money, made of their own Ducatoons, and other finer Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, melted down; have put a stop to the Minting of any but fine Silver Coin, till they should settle their Mint upon a new Foot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know the sincere Love and Concern you have for your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, puts you constantly upon cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about on all hands for any means to serve it; and will not suffer you to overlook any thing you conceive may be of any the least use, though from the meanest Capacities: You could not else have put me upon looking out my old Papers concerning the reducing of <hi>Interest</hi> to <hi>4 per Cent,</hi> which have so long lain by forgotten. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56722:4"/>
this new Survey of them, I find not my Thoughts now to differ from those I had near Twenty Years since: They have to me still the Appearance of Truth; nor should I otherwise venture them so much as to your sight. If my Notions are wrong, my Intention, I am sure, is right: And whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I have failed in, I shall at least let you see with what Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I am,</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have so little Concern in paying or receiving of <hi>Interest,</hi> that were I in no more Danger to be misled by Inability and Ignorance, than I am to be biassed by Interest and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I might hope to give you a very perfect and clear Account of the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of a Law to reduce <hi>Interest</hi> to Four <hi>per Cent.</hi> But since you are pleased to ask my Opinion, I shall endeavour fairly to state this Matter of <hi>Use</hi> with the best of my Skill.</p>
            <p>The first thing to be consider'd, is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Price of the Hire of Money can be regulated by <hi>Law.</hi> And to that I think, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally speaking, one may say, 'tis manifest it cannot. For since it is impossible to make a Law that shall hinder a Man from giving away his Money or Estate to whom he pleases, it will be impossible, by any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of Law, to hinder Men, skill'd in the Power they have over their own Goods, and the ways of Conveying them to others,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56722:6"/>
to purchase Money to be lent them at what Rate soever their Occasions shall make it necessary for them to have it. For it is to be Remembred, That no Man borrows Money, or pays <hi>Use,</hi> out of mere Pleasure; 'tis the want of Money drives Men to that Trouble and Charge of Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing: And proportionably to this Want, so will every one have it, whatever Price it cost him. Wherein the Skilful, I say, will always so manage it, as to avoid the Prohibition of your Law, and keep out of its Penalty, do what you can. What then will be the unavoidable Consequences of such a Law?</p>
            <p n="1">1. It will make the Difficulty of Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing and Lending much greater; whereby Trade (the Foundation of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches) will be obstructed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It will be a Prejudice to none but those who most need Assistance and Help, I mean Widows and Orphans, and others uninstructed in the Arts and Managements of more skilful Men; whose Estates lying in Money, they will be sure, especially Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, to have no more Profit of their Money, than what <hi>In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>st</hi> the Law barely allows.</p>

For Men find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Convenience of lodging their Money in Hands where they can be sure of it at short Warning; the Ignorant and Lazy will be forwardest to put it into these Mens hands who are known willingly to receive it, and where they can readily have the whole, or a part, upon any sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Occasion that may call for it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I fear I may reckon it as one of the probable Consequences of such a Law, That it is likely to cause great Perjury in the Nation; a Crime, than which nothing is more carefully to be prevented by Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, not only by Penalties that shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend apparent and proved Perjury, but by avoiding and lessening, as much as may be, the Temptations to it: For where those are strong, (as they are where Men shall swear for their own Advantage) there the fear of Penalties to follow will have little Restraint; especially if the Crime be hard to be proved. All which I suppose will happen in this Case, where ways will be found out to receive Money upon oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r

Pretences than for <hi>Use,</hi> to evade the Rule and Rigour of the Law: And there will be secret Trusts and Collusions amongst Men, that<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

from what has been observed in something of that kind. Masters of Ships are a sort of Men generally industrious and sober, and I suppose may be thought, for their Number and Rank, to be equally honest to any other sort of Men; and yet, by the Discourse I have had with Merchants in other Countries, I find, That they think in those Parts, they take a great Liberty in their Custom-house Oaths, to that degree, that I remember I was once told, in a trading Town beyond Sea, of a Master of a Vessel, there esteemed a sober and fair Man, who yet could not hold saying, <hi>God forbid that a Custom-house Oath should be a Sin.</hi> I say not this, to make any Reflection upon a sort of Men that I think as uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt as any other; and whom I am sure ought in <hi>England</hi> to be cherished and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd as the most industrious and most beneficial of any of its Subjects. But I could not forbear to give this here as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance how dangerous a Temptation it is, to bring Men customarily to Swear, where they may have any Concernment of their own. And it will always be worthy the Care and Consideration of Law-makers, to keep up the Opinion of an Oath high and sacred, as it ought to be in the minds of the People; which can never be done, where frequency of Oaths, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>But that Law cannot keep men from taking more <hi>Use</hi> than you set (the want of Money being that alone which regulates its Price) will perhaps appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how hard it is to set a Price upon Wine or Silks, or other unnecessary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities: But how impossible it is to set a Rate upon Victuals in a time of Famine! For Money being an universal Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and as necessary to Trade, as Food is to Life, every body must have it at what Rate they can get it, and unavoidably pay dear when it is scarce, and Debts, no less than Trade, have made Borrowing in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion. The Bankers are a clear Instance of this: For some Years since the Scarcity of Money having made it in <hi>England</hi> worth really more than Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> most of those that had not the Skill to let it for more than Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> and secure themselves from the Penalty of the Law, put it in the Bankers hands, where it was ready at their Call, when they had an Opportunity of greater Improvement, so that the Rate you set, profits not the Lenders, and very few of the Borrowers, who are fain to pay the Price for Money, that Commodity
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56722:8"/>
would bear, were it left free; and the Gain is only to the Banker. And should you lessen the <hi>Use</hi> to Four <hi>per Cent.</hi> the Merchant, or Tradesman, that borrows, would not have it one jot cheaper than he has now; but probably these two ill effects would follow. First, That he would pay dearer; and secondly, That there would be less Money left in the Country to drive the Trade. For the Bankers paying at most but Four <hi>per Cent.</hi> and receiving from Six to Ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> or more, at that low Rate could be content to have more Money lye dead by them, than now when it is higher. By which means there would be less Money stirring in Trade. and a greater Scarcity; which would raise it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Borrower by this <hi>Monop<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

to the Trade of a Country; for in Trade every Body calls for Money according as he wants it, and this disproportion is always felt. For if Englishmen owed in all but One Million, and there were a Million of Money in <hi>England,</hi> the Money would be well enough proportionable to the Debts, yet if Two Millions were necessary to carry on the Trade, there would be a Million wanting, and the price of Money would be raised as it is of any other Commodity in a Market, where the Merchandize will not serve half the Customers, and there are two Buyers for one Seller.</p>
            <p>'Tis in vain therefore to go about effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to reduce the price of Interest by a Law; and you may as rationally hope to set a fixt Rate upon the Hire of Houses, or Ships, as of Money; He that wants a Vessel, rather than lose his Market, will not stick to have it at the Market Rate, and find ways to do it, with security to the Owner, though the Rate were limited by a Law; and he that wants Money, rather than lose his Voyage, or his Trade, will pay the <hi>Natural Interest</hi> for it, and submit to such ways of Conveyance as shall keep the Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der out of the reach of the Law.

            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:56722:19"/>We have seen how Riches and Money are got, kept, or lost, in any Country; and that is by consuming less of Foreign Commodities than what, by Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Labour is paid for. This is in the ordinary course of things: But where great Armies and Alliances are to be maintain'd abroad by Supplies sent out of any Country, there often, by a shorter and more sensible way, the Treasure is diminished. But this, since the holy War, or at least since the Improvement of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation and Trade, seldom happening to <hi>England,</hi> whose Princes have found the enlarging their Power by Sea, and the securing our Navigation and Trade, more the Interest of this Kingdom than Wars or Conquests on the Continent; Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Arms beyond Sea have had little Influence on our Riches or Poverty. The next thing to be considered, is, how Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is necessary to Trade.</p>
            <p>The Necessity of a certain Proportion of Money to trade, (I conceive) lyes in this, That Money in its Circulation dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the several Wheels of Trade, whilst it keeps in that Channel (for some of it will unavoidably be dreined into standing Pools) is all shared between the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, whose Land a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ords the Materials; The Labourer, who works them; The
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56722:20"/>
Broker, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) Merchant and Shop keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who distributes them to those that want them: And the Consumer, who spends them. Now Money is necessary to all these sorts of Men, as serving both for Counters and for Pledges, and so carrying with it even Reckoning and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity that he that receives it shall have the same Value for it again, of other things that he wants, whenever he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. The one of these it does by its Stamp and Denomination; the other by its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick Value, which is nothing else but its Durableness, Scarcity, and not being apt to be counterfeited. Which intrinsick Value, though it be not natural, but is only in the Opinion of men consenting to it, yet being universal, has generally, but not always, (for we see that in a Siege or Man of War Silver may not be of equal Value to Gunpowder, and in a Famine Gold not be worth its Weight in Bran) the same effect as if it were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</p>
            <p>The Necessity therefore of a Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Money to Trade, depends on Money, not as Counters for the Reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning may be kept or transferred by Writing, but on Money as a Pledge. For since the Bill, Bond, or other Note of Debt, I receive from one man, will not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56722:20"/>
be accepted as Security by another, he not knowing that the Bill or Bond is true or legal, or that the man bound to me is honest or responsible; and so is not valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enough to become a current Pledge, nor can by publick Authority be well made so, as in the Case of Assigning of Bills; because a Law cannot give to Bills that intrinsick Value, which the universal Consent of mankind has annexed to Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Gold. And hence Foreigners can never be brought to take your Bills or Writings for any part of Payment, though perhaps they might pass as valuable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations among your own People, did not this very much hinder it, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are liable to unavoidable Doubt, Dispute and Counterfeiting, and require other Proofs to assure us they are true and good Security, than our eyes or a Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone. And at best this Course, if pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable, will not hinder us from being poor; but may be suspected to help to make us so, by keeping us from feeling our Poverty, which in Distress will be sure to find us with greater disadvantage. Though it be certain it is better than let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any part of our Trade fall for want of current Pledges; and better too than borrowing Money of our Neighbours up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Use,</hi> if this way of Assigning Bills can
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56722:21"/>
be made so easie, safe and universal at home, as to hinder it.</p>
            <p>To return to the business in hand, and shew the necessity of a <hi>Proportion of Money to Trade:</hi> Every man therefore must have at least so much Money, or so timely Recruits, as may in hand, or in a short distance of time, satisfie the man who supplies him with the Necessaries of Life, or of his Trade. For no body has any longer these necessary Supplies than he has Money or <hi>Credit,</hi> which is nothing else but an Assurance of Money in some short time. So that it is requisite to Trade there should be so much Money as to keep up the Landholders, Labourers and Brokers Credit; and therefore ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney must be constantly exchang'd for Wares and Labour, or follow within a short time after.</p>
            <p>This shews the necessity of some <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Money</hi> to Trade; but what Proportion that is, is hard to determine, because it depends not barely on the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Money, but the quickness of its Circulation; which since it cannot be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily traced, for the very same Shilling may at one time pay 20 men in 20 days, at another, rest in the same hands 100 days together; to make some probable guess, we are to consider how much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

it is necessary to suppose must rest constantly in each man's hands, as requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the carrying on of Trade.</p>
            <p>First therefore the Labourers, living generally but from hand to mouth, and indeed, considered as Labourers in order to Trade, may well enough carry on their part, if they have but Money enough to buy Victuals, Cloaths, and Tools; all which may very well be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, without any great Sum of Money lying still in their hands. The Labourers therefore being usually paid once a Week, (if the times of Payment be seldomer, there must be more Money for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on this part of Trade) we may suppose there is constantly amongst them, one with another, or those who are to pay them, always one Weeks Wages in ready Money. For it cannot be thought that all or most of the Labourers pay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all their Wages constantly as soon as they receive it, and live upon Trust till next Pay day. This the Farmer and Tradesman could not well bear, were it every Labourer's Case, and every one to be trusted; and therefore they must of necessity keep some Money in their hands to go to Market for Victuals, and to other Tradesmen, as poor as themselves, for Tools; and lay up Money too to buy
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56722:22"/>
Cloaths, or pay for those they bought upon Credit: Which Money thus neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily resting in their hands, we cannot imagine to be one with another much less than a Weeks Wages, that must be in their Pockets, or ready in the Farmer's hands. For he who employs a Labourer at 1 <hi>s. per</hi> Day, and pays him on Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Nights, cannot be supposed constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to receive that 6 <hi>s.</hi> just the same Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; it must ordinarily be in his hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> one time with another, if not a whole Week, yet several Days before. This was the ordinary Course, whil'st we had Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney running in the several Channels o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Commerce: But that now very much failing, and the Farmer not having Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to pay the Labourer, supplies him with Corn, which in this great Plenty the Labourer will have at his own Rate, or else not take it off his hands for Wages And as for the Workmen who are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in our Manufacture, especially the Woollen one, these the Clothier not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ready Money to pay, furnishes with the Necessaries of Life, and so truck Commodities for Work, which, such as they are, good or bad, the Workman must take at his Master's Rate, or sit still and starve, whil'st by this means this new sort of Ing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56722:22"/>
the feeding and supplying this numerous Body of Workmen out of their Warehou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, (for they have now Magazines of all sorts of Wares) set the Price upon the poor Landholder. So that the Markets now being destroyed, and the Farmer not finding Vent there for his Butter, Cheese, Bacon and Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which he was wont to bring home ready Money, must sell it to these Ingrossers, on their own Terms of Time and Rate, and allow it to their own Day-Labourers under the true Market-price; which what kind of Influence it is like to have upon Land, and how this way Rents are like to be paid at Quarter-day, is easie to apprehend; and 'tis no wonder to hear every day of Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers breaking and running away; for if they cannot receive Money for their Goods at Market, 'twill be impossible for them to pay their Landlord's Rent: And if any one doubt whether this be so, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire him to enquire how many Farmers in the <hi>West</hi> are broke and gone since <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas</hi> last. Want of Money being to this degree, works both ways upon the Landholder. For first, the ingrossing Forestaller lets not the Money come to Market; but supplying the Workman, who is employed by him in Manufacture, with Necessaries, imposes his Price and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56722:23"/>
Forbearance on the Farmer, who cannot sell to the others. And the Labourer, who is employed by the Landholder in Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, imposes also his Rate on him for the Commodities he takes. For there being a want of Day-Labourers in the Country, they must be humoured, or else they will neither work for you, nor take your Commodities for their Labour.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as for the Landholder, since his Tenants cannot coin their Rent just at Quarter-day, but must gather it up by degrees, and lodge it with them till Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, or borrow it of those who have it lying by them, or do gather it up by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which is the same thing, and must be necessarily so much Money for some time lying still; for all that is paid in great Sums must somewhere be gathered up by the Retail Incomes of a Trade, or else lye still too in great Sums, which is the same stop of Money, or a greater. Add to this, That to pay the Creditor that lent him his Rent, he must gather up Money by degrees, as the Sale of his Commodities shall bring it in, and so makes a greater stop and greater want of Money, since the borrowed Money that paid the Landholder the 25th of <hi>March,</hi> must be supposed to lye still some time in the Creditor's hand, before he lent it the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56722:23"/>
Tenant; and the Money that pays the Creditor three Months after must lye still some time in the Tenant's. Nor does the Landlord pay away his Rent usually as soon as he receives it, but by degrees, as his Occasions call for it; we cannot but suppose that between the Landlord and Tenant there must necessarily be at least ¼ of the yearly Revenue of the Land con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly in their hands. Indeed considering that most part of the Rents of <hi>England</hi> being paid at our <hi>Lady-day</hi> and <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> and that the same Money which pays me my Rent from my Tenant the 25th of <hi>March,</hi> or thereabouts, cannot pay my next Neighbour his Rent from his Tenant at the same time, much less one more remote in another Country; it might seem requisite to suppose half the yearly Revenue of the Land to be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily employed in paying of Rent. For to say that some Tenants break and pay not their Rent at all, and others pay not till two, three, four, five, six, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Months after Quarter-day, and so the Rent is not all paid at one time, is no more than to say, That there is Money wanting to the Trade: For if the Tenant fail the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, he must fail his Creditor, and he his, and so on, till somebody break, and so Trade decay for want of Money. But
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56722:24"/>
since a considerable part of the Land of <hi>England</hi> is in the Owners hands, who neither pay nor receive great Sums for it at a certain day; and because too, (which is the chief Reason) we are not to consider here how much Money is in any one man's, or any one sort of mens hands at any one time; for that at other t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Money, and Trade is still endamag'd by it) a great part whereof must necessarily lie still before it come out of my Tenants Chest to my Hands: If it be paid once a Quarter 13 <hi>l.</hi> alone will do it, and less Money is laid up for it, and stop'd a less while in its course; But should it be paid every Week, one single 20 <hi>s.</hi> will pay the Rent of 52 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> whence would follow this double benefit; First, that a great deal less Money would serve for the Trade of a Country; And Secondly, That less of the Money would lie still, the contrary whereof must needs happen where growing Debts are to be paid at larger distances, and in greater Sums.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As for the Brokers, since they too must lay up the Money coming in by Retail, either to go to Market, and buy Wares, or to pay at the day appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is often Six Months; for those Wares they have already, we cannot sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them to have less by them, one with another, than One Twentieth part of their yearly Returns, whether the Money be their own, or they be Indebted so much or more it matters not, if it be nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sary they should have constantly by them, comparing one time with another, at least One Twentieth part of their yearly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: Indeed in some great Towns, where
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56722:25"/>
the Bankers are ready at hand to buy Bills, or any other way to lend Money, for short time at great <hi>Interest,</hi> there perhaps the Merchant is not forced to keep so much Money by him, as in other places, where they have not such a Supply.</p>
            <p>But if you consider, what Money to do this must necessarily be constantly lodg'd in the Bankers Hands; to which, if you add, what part of the Money of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Scholars of all sorts, Women, Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and great Mens menial Servants, and all such that do not contribute at all to Trade, either as Landholders, Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, or Brokers, will unavoidably have constantly in their Hands, it cannot well be thought, that less than One Fiftieth part of the Labourers Wages, One Fourth part of the Landholders yearly Revenue, and One Twentieth part of the Brokers yearly Returns in ready Money, will be enough to drive the Trade of any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. At least to put it beyond Exception low enough; it cannot be imagin'd that less than one moiety of this, <hi>i. e.</hi> less than One Hunderd part of the Labourers year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wages, One Eighth part of the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders yearly Revenue, and One Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth part of the Brokers yearly Returns, in ready Money, can be enough to move the several Wheels of Trade, and keep up
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56722:25"/>
Commeree in that Life and Thriving po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture it should be; And how much the ready Cash of any Country is short of this proportion, so much must the Trade be impair'd and hindred for want of Money; But however these measures may be mistaken, this is evident, that the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying of Brokers hinders the Trade of any Country by making the Circulation, the Money goes larger, and in that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit more stops, so that the Returns must necessarily be flower and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cantier, to the prejudice of Trade: Besides that, they Eat up too great a share of the Gains of Trade, by that means Starving the Labourer, and impoverishing the Landholder, whose In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest is chiefly to be taken care of, it being a settled unmoveable Concernment in the Commonwealth; And therefore it would be convenient to hinder, as much as is possible, any one from Selling any of our Native Commodities but he that makes it; Shopkeepers in this being worse than Gamesters; for they do not only keep so much of the Money of a Country con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly in their Hands, but also make the publick pay them for their keeping of it; though Gaming too, upon the account of Trade, (as well as other Reasons) may well deserve to be restrain'd, since Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, in order to their Play, keep great
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56722:26"/>
Sums of Money by them, which there lies Dead; for though Gamesters Money shift Masters oftner than any, and is tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled up and down with every cast of a Die, yet as to the publick lies perfectly still, and no more of it comes into Trade than they spend in Lating or Wearing.</p>
            <p>Here too we may observe, how much Manufacture deserves to be incourag'd, since that part of Trade, though the most considerable, is driven with the least Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, especially if the Workmanship be more worth than the Materials; For to the Trade that is driven by Labour and Handicrafts Men, One two and fiftieth part of the yearly Money paid them will be sufficient; but to a Trade of Commodities of our bare Native growth, much greater proportion of Money is requir'd.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it will be wondered, why having given some estimate (how wide I know not) of the Money necessary in the Hands of the Landholder, Labourer, and Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ker, to carry on Trade, I have said nothing of the Consumer, whom I had mentioned before; But to this I Answer, there are so few Consumers, who are not either Labourers, Brokers, or Landhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: (For those who immediately depend on the Landholder, as his Children and Servants, come in under that Title, being
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56722:26"/>
maintained by the Rent of his Land, and so of the rest) that they make a very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable part in the account.</p>
            <p>By what has been said, we may see what Injury the Lowering of Interest is like to do us by hindering Trade, when it shall either make the Foreigner call home his money, or your own People backward to lend, the Reward not being judged proportionable to the risque.</p>
            <p>There is another seeming consequence, of the reducing of Money to a low Price, which at first sight has such an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of truth in it, that I have known it impose upon very able men, and I guess has no small Influence at this time in the promoting this alteration a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d that is, that the lowering of <hi>Interest</hi> will raise the value of all other Things in proportion. For <hi>Money</hi> being the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>unter-ballance</hi> to all other Things purchasable by it and lying, at it were, in the opposite Scale of Commerce, it looks like a natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, that as much as you take off from the value of money <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> much you add to the price of other Things which are exchanged for it; the raising of the price of any thing being no more but the addition to its value in respect of money, or, which is all one, lessening the value of money. For Example: Should the value
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56722:27"/>
of Gold be brought down to that of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, 100 Guineas would purchase little more Corn, Wool, or Land, than 100 Shillings, and so the <hi>Value</hi> of <hi>Money</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought lower, say they, the price of other Things will rise; and the falling of <hi>Interest</hi> from 6 to 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> is taking away so much of the price of money and so consequently the lessening its value.</p>
            <p>The mistake of this plausible way of Reasoning will be easily discovered, when we consider that the <hi>measure</hi> of the value of Money, in proportion to any thing purchasable by it, is the quantity of the ready Money we have in Comparison with the <hi>quantity</hi> of that thing and its <hi>Vent</hi>; (which vent depends upon its Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity or Usefulness, as convenience of Life or Opinion, guided by Fansie or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, shall determine) or which amounts to the same thing, the price of any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of <hi>Buyers</hi> and <hi>Sellers</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> whereby the vent comes to be increased or decreased, as a greater part of the Money we have is designed to be laid out by several People, at the same time, rather in one thing than another, as we see in the change of Fashions; This rule holds Universally in all Things that are
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56722:27"/>
to be Bought and Sold, bateing now and then an extravagant Phancy of some particular Person, which never amounts to so considerable a part of Trade as to make any thing in the account worthy to be thought an Exception to this Rule.</p>
            <p>I shall begin first with the Necessaries or Conveniencies of Life, and the Consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Commodities subservient thereunto; and shew, That the <hi>Value of Money</hi> in respect of those depends only on the Plenty or Scarcity of Money in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Plenty and Scarcity of those things, and not on what Interest shall be by Necessity, Law or Contract at that time laid on the borrowing of Money: and then afterwards I shall shew that the same holds in Land.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more confirmed by daily Experience, than that Men give any Portion of Money for whatsoever is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary, rather than go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: And in such things, the Scarcity of them alone makes their Prices. As for example: Let us suppose 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Ounce of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or half a Crown now in <hi>England,</hi> is worth a Bushel of Wheat; but should there be next year a great scarcity of Wheat in <hi>England,</hi> and a proportionab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e want of all other Food, five Ounces of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would perhaps in Exchange purchase
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56722:28"/>
but one Bushel of Wheat, so that Money would be then 9/10 less worth in respect o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Food, though at the same value it was before, in respect of other Things that kept their former proportion in their Quantity and Consumption. By the like proportions of Increase and Decrease, does the value of Things more or less convenient rise and fall in respect of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, only with this difference, that things absolutely <hi>necessary</hi> for Life must be had at any Rate; but Things <hi>convenient</hi> will be had only as they stand in preference with other Conveniencies; and therefore in any one of these Commodities, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue rises only as its quantity is less, and vent greater, which depends upon its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s,</hi> Men no question would give far more for Wheat than Oats, as being the healthier, pleasanter, and more convenient Food; but since Oats would serve to supply that absolute necessity of sustaining Life, Men would not rob themselves of all other Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of Life, by paying all their Money for Wheat, when Oats that are cheaper, though with some inconvenience, would
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56722:28"/>
supply that Defect. It may then so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen at the same time, that half an Ounce of Silver, that the year before would buy one Bushel of Wheat, will this year buy but 1/10 of a Bushel: Half an ounce of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that the year before would have bought three Bushels of Oats, will this year still buy one Bushel; and at the same time half an Ounce of Silver, that would the year before have bought 15 pounds of Lead, will still buy the same quantity. So that at the same time <hi>Silver,</hi> in respect of <hi>Wheat,</hi> is 9/10 less worth than it was, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of <hi>Oats</hi> ⅔ less worth, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of <hi>Lead,</hi> as much worth as before.</p>

So that in Exchange of coin'd Silver for any other Commodity, which is buying and selling, the same measure governs the Proportion you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, as if you exchang'd Lead or Wheat, or any other Commodity, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but their Quantity in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their vent.

            <p>
               <hi>Money</hi> therefore in buying and selling being perfectly in the same Condition with other Commodities, and subject to all the same Laws of Value, let us next see <hi>how</hi> it comes to be <hi>of the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with Land,</hi> by yielding a certain yearly Income, which we call <hi>Use</hi> or <hi>Interest.</hi> For Land produces naturally something new and profitable, and of Value to Mankind; but Money is a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren thing, and produces nothing, but by
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56722:32"/>
Compact transfers that Profit that was the Reward of one man's Labour into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man's Pocket. That which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions this, is the <hi>unequal Distribution</hi> of Money; which Inequality has the same effect too upon Land that it has upon Money. For my having more Money in my hand than I can, or am dispos'd to use in buying and selling, makes me able to lend; and another's want of so much Money as he could employ in Trade, makes him willing to borrow. But why then, and for what Consideration doth he pay <hi>Use</hi>? For the same Reason, and upon as good Consideration, as the Tenant pays Rent for your Land. For as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Distribution of Land, (you having more than you can or will manure, and another less) brings you a Tenant for your Land; and the same unequal Distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of Money, (I having more than I can or will employ, and another less) brings me a Tenant for my Money: So my Money is apt in Trade, by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry of the Borrower, to produce more than 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> to the Borrower, as well a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56722:32"/>
Money would bring in no yearly profit, if he did not lend it, (suppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing he employ it not himself) and so his Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> may seem to be the Fruit of another Mans La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, yet he shares not near so much of the profit of anothers Mans Labour, as he that lets Land to a Tenant; for without the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants Industry (supposing as before, the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er would not manage it himself) his Land would yield him little or no Profit; so that the Rent he receives is a greater Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Fruit of his Tenants Labour than the <hi>Use</hi> is at 6 <hi>per Cent,</hi> for generally he that Borrows 1000 <hi>l.</hi> at Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> and so pays 60 <hi>l. per A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It being evident therefore that he that has skill in Traffick, but has not Money enough to Exercise it, has not only reason to Borrow Money to drive his Trade, and get a livelyhood, but as much Reason to pay <hi>Use</hi> for that Money, as he that not having Land of his own, yet has Skill in Husbandry, has not only reason to Rent Land, but to pay Money for the <hi>Use</hi> of it; It follows, that Borrowing Money upon <hi>Use</hi> is not only by the necessity of Affairs, and the Constitution of humane

            <p>But Experience tells us, that neither in Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> nor King <hi>Iames</hi> the First Reigns, when Interest was at Ten

               <hi>per Cent.</hi> was Land Sold for Ten; or when it was at Eighth <hi>per Cent,</hi> for 12 ½ years purchase, or any thing near the low rate that high Use requir'd (if it were true, that the rate of Interest govern'd the price of Land) any more than Land, now yields 25 years purchase, because a great part of the Monied Men will now lett their Money upon good Security at Four <hi>per Cent.</hi> Thus we see in fact how little this Rule has held at home; and he that will look into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> will find that the Purchase of Land was not raised there when their Interest fell. This is certain, and past doubt, that the legal Interest can never regulate the price of Land, since it is plain, that the price of Land has never changed with it in the several Changes have been made in the rate of Interest by Law, nor now that the rate of Interest is by Law the same through all <hi>England,</hi> is the price of Land every where the same, it being in some parts constantly sold for 4 or 5 years Purchase more than in others. Whether you or I can tell the Reason of this, it matters not to the Question in hand, but it being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally so, this is plain Demonstration against those who pretend to advance and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the price of Land by a Law, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Interest</hi> of Money.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:56722:34"/>But yet I will give you some of my Guesses, why the price of Land is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated (as at first sight it seems it should be) by the <hi>Interest</hi> of Money. Why it is not regulated by the <hi>legal Use</hi> is manifest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the rate of Money does not follow the Standard of the Law, but the price of the Market; and Men not observing the legal and forced, but the Natural and Current <hi>Interest</hi> of Money, regulate their Affairs by that; But why the rate of Land does not follow the Current <hi>Interest</hi> of Money requires a farther Consideration.</p>
            <p>All Things that are Bought and Sold, raise and fall their price in proportion, as there are more Buyers or Sellers: Where are a great many Sellers to a few Buyers, there use what Art you will, the thing to be Sold will be cheap; on the other side, turn the Tables, and raise up a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Buyers for a few Sellers, and the same thing will immediately grow dear; this Rule holds in Land as well as all other Commodities, and is the Reason, why in <hi>England</hi> at the same time, that Land in some places is at seventeen or eighteen years purchase, it is about others, where there are pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when the thriving Tradesman has got more than he can well employ in Trade, his next Thoughts are to look out for a Purchase, but it must be a Purchase in the Neighbourhood, where the Estate may be under his Eye, and within convenient distance, that the Care and Pleasure of his Farm may not take him off from the Engagements of his Calling, nor remove his Children too far from him, or the Trade he breeds them up in; And this seems to me the Reason, why in places wherein thriving Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures have erected themselves, Land

            <p>This is that then which makes <hi>Land</hi> as well as other Things <hi>dear</hi>; plenty of Buyers, and but few Sellers; and so by the Rule of Contraries, plenty of Sellers and few Buyers makes <hi>Land cheap.</hi>

            <p>He that will justly estimate the value of any thing, must consider its quantity, in proportion to its vent, for this alone regulates the Price; for the value of any thing, compar'd with its self, or with a standing Measure, is greater, as its quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity is less in proportion to its vent; but in comparing it, or exchanging it with any other thing, the quantity and vent too of that must be allowed for in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of their Value. But because the desire of Money is constantly, almost every where the same, its vent varies very little; but as its greater scarcity enhanses its price, and increases the scramble, there being nothing else that does easily supply the want of it The le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> its Price, and makes an equal portion of it exchange for a greater of any other thing. Thus it comes to pass, that there is no manner of settled proportion between
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56722:35"/>
the value of an Ounce of Silver, and any other Commodity; for either varying its quantity in that Country, or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity changing its quantity in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to its vent, their respective values change, <hi>i. e.</hi> less of one will barter for more of the other; though in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of speaking, 'tis only said, that the price of the Commodity, not of the Money is changed. For example, half an Ounce of Silver in <hi>England,</hi> will exchange sometimes for a Bushel of Wheat, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for ½, sometimes but ¼, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this it does equally, whether by Use it be apt to bring in to the Owner 6/100 of its own Weight <hi>per annum,</hi> or nothing at all; it being only the change of the quantity of Wheat to its Vent, supposing we have still the same Summ of Money in the Kingdom; or else the change of the quantity of our Money in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, supposing the quantity of Wheat, in respect to its vent be the same too, that makes the change in the price of Wheat; for if you alter the quantity or vent on either side, you presently alter the Price, but no other way in the World.</p>
            <p>For it is not the Being, Adding, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing or Diminishing of any good quality in any Commodity that makes its Price greater or less, but only as it makes
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56722:36"/>
its quantity or vent greater or less, in proportion one to another. This will easily appear by Two or Three Instances.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Being of any <hi>good</hi> and useful <hi>quality</hi> in any thing, neither increases its <hi>Price,</hi> nor indeed makes it have any Price at all, but only as it lessens its quantity or increases its vent, each of these in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to one another. What more useful or necessary things are there to the Being or Well-being of Men, than Air and Water, and yet these have generally no Price at all, nor yield any Money, because their quantity is immensly greater than their vent in most places of the World; but, as soon as ever Water (for Air still offers its self every where, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out restraint or inclosure, and therefore is no where of any Price) comes any where to be reduced into any proportion to its consumption, it begins presently to have a Price, and is sometimes sold dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than Wine; and hence it is, that the best and most useful things are commonly the cheapest, because, though their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption be great, yet the bounty of Providence has made their production large and suitable to it.</item>
               <item>2. Nor does the Adding an excellency to any Commodity, raise its Price, unless it increase its Consumption. For suppose
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56722:36"/>
there should be taught a way (which should be published to the knowledge of every one) to make a Medicine of Wheat alone, that should infallibly Cure the <hi>Stone,</hi> 'tis certain the discovery of this quality in that Grain, would give it an excellency very considerable; and yet this would not increase the Price of it one Farthing in Twenty Bushels, because its quantity or vent would not hereby, to any sensible degree, be alter'd.</item>
               <item>3. Neither does the Increasing of any good quality, in any sort of things make it yield more; for though Teasels be much better this Year than they were last, they are not one jot dearer, unless they be fewer too, or the consumption of them greater.</item>
               <item>4. Nor does the Lessening the good qualities of any sort of Commodity lessen its Price; which is evident in Hops, that are usually dearest those Years they are worst. But if it happen to be a Species of Commodity, whose defects may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by some other, the making of it worse does lessen its Price, because it hinders its Vent; for if Rye should any Year prove generally smutty or grown, no question it would yield less Money than otherwise, because the deficiency of that might be, in some measure, made
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56722:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
up by Wheat and other Grain; but if it be a sort of Commodity whose use no other known thing can supply, 'tis not its being better or worse, but its quantity and vent is that alone which regulates and determines its value.</item>
            </list>
            <p>To apply this now to Money as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of different Rates of <hi>Interest,</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Money in its proper use, as a Commodity passing in exchange from one to another, all that is done by <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi> is but adding to Money by agreement or publick Authority, which Naturally it hath not, <hi>viz.</hi> a faculty of increasing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year Six <hi>per Cent</hi>; now if publick Authority sink <hi>Use</hi> to Four <hi>per Cent.</hi> 'tis certain it diminishes this good quality in Money 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> but yet this making the Money of <hi>England</hi> not one Farthing more than it was, it alters not the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures upon which all changeable Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities increase or sink their price, and so makes not Money Exchange for less of any Commodity than it would without this alteration of its <hi>Interest</hi>; but rather if lessening <hi>Use</hi> to Four <hi>per Cent.</hi> does at all alter the quantity of Money and makes it less; it makes Money as it has the Nature of a Commodity dearer, <hi>i. e.</hi> a less quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Money will Exchange for a greater quantity of another Commodity than it
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56722:37"/>
would before. This perhaps will appear a little plainer by these following particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That the Intrinsick Natural worth of any Thing, consists in this, that it is apt to be serviceable to the Necessities or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of human Life, and it is Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally more worth, as the Necessity or Conveniency it supplies is greater; but yet,</item>
               <item>2. That there is no such Intrinsick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural settled value in any Thing, as to make any assigned quantity of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly worth any assigned quantity of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</item>
               <item>3. The value of any assigned quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of two or more Commodities, are <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> equal, when they will Exchange one for another; As supposing one Bushel of Wheat, two Bushels of Barley, 30 <hi>l.</hi> of Lead, and one Ounce of Silver, will now in the Market be taken one for another, they are then of equal worth, and our Coin being that which Englishmen reckon by; An Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishman would say, that now one Bushel of Wheat, two Bushels of Barley, 30 <hi>l.</hi> of Lead, one Ounce of Silver, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually worth Five Shillings.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:56722:38"/>4. The altering of this value, two things in respect of one another, or any one standing common Measure, is not the altering of any Intrinsick value or quality in the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, (for musty and smutty Corn will Sell dearer at one time than the clean and sweet at another) but the alteration of some proportion, the Commodity bears to something else.</item>
               <item>5. This proportion in all Commodities, whereof Money is one, is the proportion of their quantity to the Vent, which Vent is nothing else but the passing of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities from one owner to another in Exchange, and is then called quicker, when a greater quantity of any species of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity is taken off from the Owners of it in an equal space of time.</item>
               <item>6. This Vent is regulated, <hi>i. e.</hi> made quicker or slower, as greater or less quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of any Saleable Commodity are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the way, and course of Trade; separated from publick Commerce; and no longer lie within the reach of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change. For though any Commodity should shift Hands never so fast, and be Exchanged from one Man to another; yet if they were not thereby exempted from Trade and Sale, and did not cease to be any longer Traffick, this would not at all make, or quicken their Vent; but
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56722:38"/>
this seldom or never happening, makes very little or no alteration: And thus the Vent is altered three ways; 1. By Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, when the Commodity in its Use is destroy'd, as Meat, Drink, and Cloths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all that is so consumed is quite gone out of the Trade of the World. 2. Exportation; and all that is so carried away, is gone out of the Trade of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and concerns Englishmen no more in the price of their Commodities among themselves, than if it were out of the World. 3. Buying and laying up for a Mans private Use. For what is by any of these ways shut out of the Market, and no longer moveable by the Hand of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, makes no longer any part of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantable Ware, and so in respect of Trade, and the quantity of any Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, is not more considerable than if it were not in being. All these three termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating at last in Consumption of all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, (excepting only Jewels and Plate, and some few others which wear out but insensibly) may properly enough pass under that Name. Ingrossing too has some influence on the present Vent, but this inclosing some considerable part of any Commodity (for if the Ingrossing be of all the Commodity, and it be of general Use, the price is at the will of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56722:39"/>
the Ingrosser) out of the free common of Trade only for some time, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards returning again to Sale, makes not usually so sensible and general an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Vent as the others do, but yet influences the price, and the Vent more according as it extends its self to a larger portion of the Commodity, and Hoards it up longer.</item>
               <item>7. Most other portable Commodities (excepting Jewels, Plate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) decaying quickly in their Use, but Money being less consumed or increased, <hi>i. e.</hi> by slower Degrees removed from, or brought into the free Commerce of any Country, than the greatest part of other Merchandize; and so the proportion between its quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Vent, altering slower than in most other Commodities, it is commonly look'd on as a standing measure to judge of the value of all Things, especially being adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it by its Weight and Denomination in Coinage.</item>
               <item>8. Money, whilst the same quantity of it is passing up and down the Kingdom in Trade, is really a standing measure of the falling and rising value of other Things in Reference to one another: and the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of price is truely in them only. But if you increase or lessen the quantity of Money current in Traffick in any place,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56722:39"/>
then the alteration of value is in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and if at the same time Wheat keep its proportion of Vent to quantity, Money to speak truly alters its worth, and Wheat does not, though it Sell for a greater or less price than it did before; for Money being look'd upon as the standing measure of other Commodities, Men consider and speak of it still as if it were a standing measure, though when it has varied its quantity, 'tis plain it is not.</item>
               <item>9. But the value or price of all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, amongst which Money passing in Trade is truly one, consisting in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, you alter this, as you do all other proportions, whether you increase one or lessen the other. In all other Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Owners when they design them for Traffick, endeavour as much as they can to have them vented and gone, <hi>i. e.</hi> removed out of the reach of Commerce and Exchange, by Consumption, Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or laying up, which Vent is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times slower, and sometimes quicker, But Money never lying upon Peoples Hands, or wanting Vent, (for any one may part with it in Exchange when he pleases;) the endeavour of the Publick, and almost every Body, is to keep it from Venting or Consuming, <hi>i. e.</hi> Exportation or Hoarding up, which is its proper Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56722:40"/>
The Vent of Money there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being always sufficient, or more than enough, its quantity alone is enough to regulate and determine its value, without considering any Proportion between its quantity and vent, as in other Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</item>
               <item>10. Therefore lessening of <hi>Use,</hi> not bringing one Penny of Money more into the Trade or Exchange of any Country, but rather drawing it away from Trade, and so making it less, does not at all sink its Value, and make it buy less of any Commodity, but rather more.</item>
               <item>11. That which raises the natural <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi> of Money, is the same that raises the Rent of Land, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) its aptness to bring in yearly to him that manages it, a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Overplus of Income above his Rent, as a Reward to his Labour. That which causes this in Land is the greater quantity of its Product, in Proportion to the same Vent of that particular Fruit, or the same quantity of Product, in proportion to a greater Vent of that single Commodity; but that which causes encrease of Profit to the Borrower of Money, is the less quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Money, in proportion to Trade, or to the Vent of all Commodities, taken together, <hi>&amp; vice versa.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:56722:40"/>12. The natural Value of Money, as it is apt to yield such an yearly Income by <hi>Interest,</hi> depends on the whole quantity of the then passing Money of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in proportion to the whole Trade of the Kingdom, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the general Vent of all the Commodities. But the natural Value of Money, in exchanging for any one Commodity, is the quantity of the Trading Money of the Kingdom, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for that Commodity, in proportion to that single Commodity and its Vent. For though any single man's Necessity and Want, either of Money, or any <hi>species</hi> of Commodity, being known, may make him pay dearer for Money, or that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity; yet this is but a particular Case, that does not at the same time alter this constant and general Rule.</item>
               <item>13. That supposing Wheat a standing Measure, that is, That there is constantly the same quantity of it in proportion to its Vent, we shall find Money to run the same Variety of Changes in its Value, as all other Commodities do. Now that Wheat in <hi>England</hi> does come nearest to a standing Measure, is evident, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Wheat with other Commodities, Money, and the yearly Income of Land in <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. time and now.

of the precedent year in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for the next; and <hi>vice versâ,</hi> it must needs fall out that it keeps the nearest Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to its Consumption, (which is more studied and designed in this than other Commodities) of any thing, if you take it for 7 or 20 years together; though perhaps the Plenty or Scarcity of one year, caused by the Accidents of the Season, may very much vary it from the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately precedent, or the following. Wheat therefore, in this part of the World, (and that Grain which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant general Food of any other Country) is the fittest Measure to judge of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Value of things in any long tract of Time: And therefore Wheat here, Rice in <hi>Turkey, &amp;c.</hi> is the fittest thing to reserve a Rent in, which is designed to be constantly the same for all future Ages.

               <item>14. That supposing any Island separate from the Commerce of the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, if Gold and Silver, or whatever else, (so it be lasting) be their Money, if they have but a certain quantity of it, and can get no more, that will be a steady standing Measure of the Value of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things.</item>

That if in any Country they use for Money any lasting Material, whereof there is not any more to be got, and so cannot be encreas'd, or being of no other use, the rest of the World does not value it, and so it is not like to be diminished; this also would be a steady standing Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Value of other Commodities.</item>

That in a Country where they had such a standing Measure, any quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of that Money (if it were but so much that every body might have some) would serve to drive any proportion of Trade, whether more or less, there being Counters enough to reckon by, and the Value of the Pledges being still sufficient, as constantly encreasing with the Plenty of the Commodity. But these three last, being built on Suppositions that are not like to be found in the Practice of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, since Navigation and Commerce
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56722:42"/>
have brought all parts acquainted with one another, and introduced the use of Gold and Silver Money into all Trading parts of the World; they serve rather to give us some light into the nature of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, than to teach here a new Measure of Traffick, though it be certain, That that part of the World, which bred most of our Gold and Silver, used least of it in exchange, and used it not for Money.</item>
               <item>17. That therefore in any Country that hath Commerce with the rest of the World, it is almost impossible now to be without the use of Silver Coin, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Money of that, and Accounts kept in such Money, it is impossible to have any standing, unalterable measure of the value of things; for whil'st the Mines supply to Mankind more than wastes and consumes in its use, the quantity of it will daily grow greater in respect of other Commodities, and its value less.</item>
               <item>18. That in a Country that hath open Commerce with the rest of the World, and uses Money made of the same Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials with their Neighbours, any quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of that Money will not serve to drive any quantity of Trade, but that there must be a certain proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between <hi>Money</hi> and <hi>Trade</hi>: The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof is this, because to keep your

               <item>19. Upon this measure too it is, That the variation of exchange of Money, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween several Countries, does somewhat depend; for it is certain, that one Ounce of Silver is always of equal value to another Ounce of Silver considered in its Intrinsick worth, or in reference to the universal Trade of the World; but 'tis not of the same value at the same time, in several parts of the World, but is of most worth in that Country where there is the least Money, in proportion to its Trade; and therefore Men may afford to give 20 Ounces of Silver in one place, to receive 18 or 19 Ounces of Silver in another: But this is not all to this then, (to find out the alteration of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change)
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56722:44"/>
the over-ballance of the Trade must be taken into consideration; and these two together regulate the exchange in all the Commerce of the World, and, in both the increase of the exchange (<hi>i. e.</hi> receiving a greater quantity of Silver (for that is the measure, let the Coin or the denomination be what it will) in one Country for a less quantity of Silver paid in another Country) depends upon one and the same thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the greater Plenty of Money in one Country than in the other, only with this difference, that where the over-ballance of Trade rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the exchange above the <hi>Par,</hi> there it is the plenty of Money which private Merchants have in one Country, which they desire to remove into another: But where the Riches of the Country raises the exchange above the <hi>Par,</hi> there it is the plenty of the Money in the whole Country. In one, the <hi>Merchant</hi> has more Money (or Debts, which is all one) in a Foreign Country than his Trade there will imploy, and so is willing to allow upon exchange to him abroad, that shall pay him ready Money at home, 1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c. per Cent.</hi> more or less, proportionably as his or his Countrymens plenty of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Money abroad, the danger of leaving it there, or the difficulty of bringing it

home in Specie, and his present need of Money at home is greater or lesi.</item>
            </list>
            <p>In the other, the whole <hi>Country</hi> has more Money than can well be imploy'd in the Trade thereof, or at least, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Money to the Trade is greater than in the Neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where the exchange is below the <hi>Par.</hi>

            <p>For, supposing the ballance of Trade to be equal between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> but that there be in <hi>Holland</hi> a greater plenty of Money than in <hi>England,</hi> (which will appear by the lowness of the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Use</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and the heighth of the National <hi>Use</hi> in <hi>England</hi>; and also by the dearness of Food and Labour in general in <hi>Holland,</hi> and the cheapness of it in <hi>England.</hi>) If <hi>N.</hi> has 10000 <hi>l.</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> which the greater advantage he could make of it in <hi>England,</hi> either by <hi>Use</hi> or <hi>Purchase,</hi> tempts him to transfer into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> 'tis probable he will give as much to a Merchant in <hi>Holland</hi> to pay him 10000 <hi>l.</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> as the ensurance of that time between <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> is worth; which, if it be in a Country where the Exportation of <hi>Bullion</hi> is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, he must pay the more, because his Venture, if he carry it in Specie, will be greater; and, upon this ground, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56722:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Prohibiting the Exportation of Money out of <hi>England,</hi> under Penalties, may be of some use, by making the rate of the exchange greater upon those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries who Import upon us more than they Export in Commodities, and so retain some part of the Money which their over-ballance of Trade would carry away from us, though, after all, if we are over-ballanc'd in Trade it must go.</p>
            <p>But, since the <hi>Holland</hi> Merchant can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive <hi>N—</hi>'s 10000 <hi>l.</hi> in Money in <hi>Holland,</hi> and pay him 10000 <hi>l.</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> unless his over-ballance of Trade make <hi>English</hi>-Men indebted to him 10000 <hi>l.</hi> in Money, which he is not like to take in Commodity. I think the over-ballance of Trade is that which chiefly raises the exchange in any Country, and that plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Money in any Country does it only for so much of the Money as is transfer'd either to be let out to <hi>Use,</hi> or to be spent there; and though lending to Foreigners, upon <hi>Use,</hi> doth not at all alter the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Trade between those Countries, yet it does alter the exchange between those Countries for so much as is lent upon <hi>Use,</hi> by not calling away the Money that should follow the over-ballance of Trade, but letting it rest there, as if it were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for; all one as if the ballance of Trade

does not presently so sink its Value, in respect of Land, that 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> part more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd in exchange: that is, That falling of Interest from Six to Four, will not raise Land from Twenty to Thirty years purchase. The raising and falling of the Price of Land, as of other things, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends much on the quantity of Land, set to Sale, compar'd with the quantity of Money design'd for that Traffick, or which amounts to the same thing, upon the number of Buyers and Sellers, for where there are many Sellers and few Purchasers, though Interest be lessened, Land will be cheap, as I have already shew'd. At least, this is certain, That making a Law to reduce <hi>Interest,</hi> will not raise the Price of Lands: It will only, by driving it more into the Bankers hands, leave the Country barer of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, whereby, if the Price of Land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>London,</hi> should be accidently raised, that of remoter Countries would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by have fewer Purchasers, and at lower Rates.</p>
            <p>This being so, that the low rate of Land depends much on the great number of Sellers in proportion to Purchasers, the next thing to be inquir'd into, is, What makes plenty of Sellers? and to that the Answer is obvious, general ill Husbandry;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56722:47"/>
and the consequence of it Debts. If a neglect of Government and Religion, ill Examples, and depraved Education, have introduced Debauchery; and Art or Chance has made it fashionable for Men to live beyond their Estates, Debts will increase and multiply, and draw with them a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity on Men, first of Incumbring, and then Selling their Estates; This is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the cause why Men part with their Land: And I think there is scarce one of an hundred that thinks of Selling his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony till Mortgages have pretty well Eat into the Freehold; and the weight of growing Debts force a Man, whether he will or no, out of his Possessions. When almost is there ever a clear and unincum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Estate set to Sale? 'Tis seldom a thriving Man turns his Land into Money to make the greater advantage. The Examples of it are so rare, that they are scarce of any Consideration in the number of Sellers.</p>
            <p>This I think may be the Reason, why in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days (when Sobriety, Frugality, and Industry, brought in dai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>d in a thriving Trade, which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56722:47"/>
made the natural <hi>Interest</hi> much higher than it is now, as well as the Parliament then set it higher by Law.</p>
            <p>On the contrary side, what makes scarcity of Purchasers; 1. The same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>Ill Husbandry</hi>; When the Tradesman lives up to the height of his Income, and the vanity of Expences either drains the Merchants Coffers, or keeps them from over-flowing, he seldom thinks of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing: Buying of Land is the result of a full and satiated Gain, and Men in Trade seldom think of laying out their Money upon Land, till their profit has brought them in more than their Trade can well employ, and their idle Bags cumbring their counting Houses, put them upon emptying them on a purchase. 2. Another Thing that makes a scarcity of Buyers of Land, are doubtful and ill Titles, where these are frequent and fatal, one can no more expect, that Men who have Money, should be forward to Purchase, than Ships richly laden to venture themselves amongst Roc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap> for this
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56722:48"/>
threatens an Universal Poverty, which is sure to fall first and heaviest upon Land. The Merchant who furnishes the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Landholder, will not fail to have Money for his Wares with Gain, whether the Kingdom get by his Trade or no, and he will keep his Money rather employ'd in Trade, which brings him in profit, (for the Merchant may get by a Trade that makes the Kingdom poor) than lay it out in Land, whose Rents he sees sinking, and foresees by the course of Trade, is likely to continue on to do so. When a Nation is running to decay and ruine, the Merchant and Monied Man, do what you can, will be sure to starve last: Observe it where you will, the decays that come upon, and bring to Ruine any Country, do constantly first fall upon the Land; and though the Country Gentleman, (who u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Money out of the Kingdom, and the other is kept in the Merchant and Tradesmans Hands, that no Laws he can make, nor any little Arts of Shifting Property a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst our selves, will bring it back to him again: But his Rents will fall, and his Income every day lessen, till general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, and Frugality, join'd to a well order'd Trade, shall restore to the Kingdom the Riches and Wealth it had formerly.</p>
            <p>This by the way, if well consider'd, might let us see, that <hi>Taxes,</hi> however con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, and out of whose Hand soever im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately taken, do in a Country, where their great Fund is in Land, for the most part terminate upon Land.

Effects, he will find he Buys this seeming Ease at a very dear rate, and though he pays not this Tax immediately out of his own Purse, yet there will be more wanting there at the end of the year than that comes to, with the lessening of his Rents, which is a settled and lasting evil, that will stick upon him beyond the present Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>To make this clear, let us suppose in the present State of Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> that the Rents of <hi>England</hi> are Twelve Millions, and that the Charge and Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of the Government requires a supply of Three Millions from the Parliament, which is laid on Land; Here is one fourth part of his yearly Income goes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately out of the Landlords and Landhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Pocket: This is a Burthen very apt to be felt, he readily perceives what goes thus out of his Estate, who actually pays the Money out of his Pocket, or finds it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted out of his Rent at Quarter-day for Taxes; but though this be a Quarter of his yearly Income, and out of an Estate of Four Hundred pounds a year, the publick Tax now openly takes away One hundred; Yet this influences not at all the yearly Rent of the Land, which the Rack-renter or under Tenant pays; it being the same thing to him, whether he pays all his Rent

This lessens not any more the Value of his Farm, than an high or a low chief Rent does, paid out of it to the Lord of the Fee; and the Tenant's Bargain and Profit is the same, whether the Land be charg'd or not charg'd with an Annuity payable to another Man. We see this in College Leases, where though the College Tenant pays for it to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege some years five times as much as he does others, upon the varying Rate of Corn, yet the Under Tenant feels not this Alteration in the least, nor finds a Reason to have his Rent abated, because a greater part of it is diverted from his Landlord. All this is but changing the hand that receives the Rent, without any influence at all upon the yearly Value of the Estate; which will not be let for one Penny more or less to the Renter, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, or amongst whomsoever, the Rent he pays, be divided.

The poor Labourer and Handicraftsman cannot; for he just lives from hand to mouth already, and all his Food, Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Utensils, costing ¼ more than they did before; either his Wages must rise with the Price of things, to make him live, or else, not being able to maintain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and Family by his Labour, he comes to the Parish; and then the Land bears the Burthen a heavier way. If the Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer's Wages be rais'd in proportion to the encreas'd Rates of things, the Farmer, who pays ¼ more for Wages, as well as all other things, whil'st he sells his Corn and Wool, either at the same rate, or lower, at the Market, (since the Tax laid upon it makes People less forward to buy) must either have his Rent abated, or else break and run away in his Landlord's Debt; and so the yearly Value of the Land is brought down, and who then pays the Tax at the years end, but the Landlord; when the Tenant, not able to raise his Rent by his Commodities, either runs away in his Landlords Debt, or cannot be cotinued in the Farm without abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Rent?

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56722:51"/>
Tax laid on his Commodities; How will the Farmer be able to make up his Rent at Quarter Day? For this may be worth our Notice, that any <hi>Tax</hi> laid on Foreign Commodities in <hi>England,</hi> raises its price, and makes the Importer get more for his Commodity; But on the contrary, a Tax laid on your Native Product, and home made Commodities, lessens their price, and makes them yield less to the first Seller.</p>
            <p>The Reason whereof is plain. For the Merchant Importing no Commodity but what the necessity, or fashionable Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness of your People gives him Vent for, will not only proportion his Gain, to the Cost and Risque he has been at before Landing, but will expect profit of his Money paid here, for any Tax laid on it; and take advantage from thence to raise his price above what his Tax comes to; and if he cannot do that, he will Trade no more in that Commodity. For it being not the Product of his Farm, he is not tied to bring it to Market, if he finds its price not answer his Expectation there, but turns himself to other Wares, which he finds your Markets take off better. A Merchant will never continue to Trade in Wares, which the change of Fashion, or humour amongst your People, have
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56722:51"/>
made less vendible, though he may be sometimes caught by a sudden alteration. But that seldom happens in the course of Trade, so as to influence the great bulk of it: For things of Necessity must still be had, and things of Fashion will be had as long as Men have Money or Credit, whatever rates they cost, and the rather because they are dear; For it being Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity not Use that makes the Expensive Fashions of your people, the Emulation is, who shall have the finest, that is the dearest things, not the most convenient or useful. How many things do we value and buy, because they come at dear rates from <hi>Iapan</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> which if they were our own Manufacture or Product, to be had common and for a little Money, would be contemned and neglected? Have not several of our own Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties offered to sale at reasonable Rates been despised, and the very same eagerly bought and brag'd of when sold for <hi>French</hi> at a double Price? You must not think therefore that the raising their Price will lessen the vent of fashionable Foreign Commodities amongst you, as long as Men have any way to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase them, but rather increase it. <hi>French Wine</hi> is become a Modi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h Drink amongst us, and a man is asham'd to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56722:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Friend, or almost to Dine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self without it. The Price is in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Man rais'd from 6 <hi>d.</hi> to 2 <hi>s.</hi> and does this hinder the drinking of it? No, the quite contrary, a Man's way of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is commended, because he will give any rate for it; and a Man will give any rate rather than pass for a poor Wretch, or Penurious Curmudgeon that is not able or knows not how to live well nor use his Friends civilly. Fashion is for the most part nothing but the Ostentation of Riches, and therefore the high price of what serves to that, rather increases than lessens its vent: The contest and glory is in the Expence, not the Usefulness of it, and People are then thought and said to live well, when they can make a shew of rare and foreign things, and such as their Neighbours cannot go to the Price of.</p>
            <p>Thus we see how Foreign Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties fall not in their price by Taxes laid on them, because the Merchant is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated to bring to your Market any but Fashionable Commodities, and those go off the better for their high rate: But on the contrary your Land <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to bring his Commodities to Market, such as his Land and Industry affords them, common and known things, must sell them there at such price as he can get.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56722:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
This the buyer knows; and these home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Commodities being seldom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites of your People, or any farther acceptable than as great conveniency re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends them to the Vulgar or Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right necessity to all, As soon as a Tax is laid on them, every one makes as spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a use of them as he can, that he may save his Money for other necessary or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditable Expences, whereby the price they yield the first seller is mightily abated, and so the yearly value of the Land which produces them lessen'd too.</p>
            <p>If therefore the laying of Taxes upon Commodities does, as it is evident, affect the Land that is out at Rack-rent, it is plain it does equally affect all the other Land in <hi>England</hi> too, and the Gent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to hope to lay the publick charge of the Government on any thing else, there at last it will terminate. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant (do what you can) will not bear it: the Labourer cannot, and therefore the Landholder must; and whether he were best do it, by laying it directly where it will at last settle, or by letting it come to

him by the sinking of his Rents, which when they are once fallen every one knows are not easily raised again, let him consider.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holland</hi> is brought as an instance of laying the Charge of the publique upon Trade, and 'tis possible (excepting some few small Free Towns) the only place in the World that could be brought to favour this way. But yet when examin'd will be found to shew the quite contrary, and be a clear proof, that lay the Taxes how you will, Land every where in proportion bears the greater share of the burthen. The publick Charge of the Government, is, 'tis said in the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> laid on Trade, I grant it is, the greatest part of it; But is the Land Excus'd or Eas'd by it? By no means, but on the contrary so loaded, that in many places ½, in others ¼, in others 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the Yearly value does not come in to the owners Pocket: and if I have not been misinformed, the Land in some places will not pay the Taxes; so that we may say, that the Charge of the Government came not upon Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties till the Land could not bear it. The burthen unavoidably settles upon the Land first, and when it has pressed it so that it can yield no more, Trade must be brought in aid to help to support the Government
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56722:53"/>
rather than let all sink: but the first stress is always upon Land, and as far as that will reach it is unavoidably carried, lay your Taxes how you will. 'Tis known what a share of the publick charges of the Government is supported by the Trade of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> alone, as I remember the 36/100; but are the Lands of <hi>Guelderland</hi> eas'd by it? Let any one see in that Country of Land more than Trade, what they make clear of their Revenues, and whether the Country Genttlemen there grow rich on their Land, whilst the Merchant having the Taxes laid on his Commerce is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verish'd? On the contrary <hi>Guelderland</hi> is so low and out of Cash, that <hi>Amsterdam</hi> has been fain for many years to lay down the Taxes for them, which is, in effect, to pay the Taxes of <hi>Guelderland</hi> too.</p>
            <p>Struggle and contrive as you will, lay your Taxes as you please, the Merchants and Traders will shift it off from their own gain, bear the least part of it, and grow poor last. In <hi>Holland</hi> it self, where Trade is so loaded, who, I pray, grows richest the Land-holder or the Trader? Which of them is pinch'd, and wants Money most? A Country may thrive, the Country Gentleman grow rich, and his Rents increase (for so it has been here) whilst the Land is Taxed.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56722:54"/>
But I challenge any one to shew me a Country wherein there is any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble publick charge raised, where the Land does not most sensibly feel it, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion bear much the greater part of it.</p>
            <p>We must not therefore impute the fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As this Increase of the Fine in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of Land is not an advantage to the Kingdom, so neither is it to the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, who is the person that bearing the greatest part of the burthens of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ought, I think, to have the greatest care taken of him, and enjoy as many Privileges and as much Wealth, as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But pray consider, to raise the Years purchase in buying of Land gives the advantage not to the Landholder, but to him that ceases to be so. He that has no longer the Land has the more Money, and he who has the Land is the poorer. The true advantage of the Landholder is, that his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

price; this indeed is a profit that benefits the owner of the Land and goes along with it; it is this alone raises the Rent and makes the Possessor richer; and this can only be done by increasing our Wealth, and drawing more Money into <hi>England,</hi> which the falling of <hi>Interest,</hi> and thereby (if it could effect it) raising the purchase of Land is so far from doing, that it does visibly and directly one way hinder our increase of Wealth, that is, by hindering Foreigners to come here and buy Land, and settle amongst us. Whereby we have this double loss; First we lose their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, increase of people being the increase both of strength and riches: Secondly we lose so much Money. For though whatever an Englishman gives to another for Land, though raised to 40 Years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, be not one farthing advantage to the Kingdom, yet whatever a Foreigner, who purchases Land here, gives for it, is so much every farthing clear gain to the Nation, for the Money comes clear in, without carrying out any thing for it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Favour, unless, by it, you can raise Land to Thirty years Purchase, which is not at all likely; and I think no Body by falling of Interest to Four <hi>per Cent,</hi> hopes to get Chapmen for their Land at that Rate; and whatsoever they have less, if Law can regulate Interest, they lose of their value of Land, Money being thus abased. So that the Landedman will scarce find his account neither, by this Law when it comes to trial. And at last I imagine this will be the result of all such Attempts, that Experience will shew, that the price of Things will not be regulated by Laws, though the endeavours after it will be sure to prejudice and inconvenience Trade, and put your Affairs out of Order.</p>
            <p>If this be thus, that <hi>Interest</hi> cannot be regulated by Law, or that if it could, yet the reducing of it to Four <hi>per Cent.</hi> would do more harm than good; What then should there (will you say) be no Law at all to regulate <hi>Interest?</hi> I say not so, for,

            <p>Besides the dead intervals of ceasing Profit, which happen to Money more than Land, there is another Reason why the Profit and Income of Money let out, should be a little higher than that of Land; and that is, because Money out at <hi>Interest</hi>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56722:57"/>
away in Arrear of some Rent, the Land remains, that cannot be carried away or lost. Should a Man Purchase good Land in <hi>Middlesex</hi> of 5 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> at Twenty years Purchase, and other Land in <hi>Rumney-Marsh,</hi> or elsewhere of the same yearly value, but so situated, that it were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be swallowed of the Sea, and be utterly lost, it would not be unreasonable he should expect to have it under twenty years Purchase; suppose 16 ½. This is to bring it to just the case of Land at twenty years Purchase, and Money at Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> where the uncertainty of securing ones Money may well be allowed that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of greater Profit; and therefore perhaps the legal <hi>Interest</hi> now in <hi>England</hi> at Six <hi>per Cent,</hi> is as reasonable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient a Rate as can well be set by a standing Rule, especially if we consider that the Law requires not a Man to pay Six <hi>per Cent,</hi> but ties up the Lender from taking more; so that if ever it falls of it self, the Monied man is sure to find it, and his Interest will be brought down to it.</p>
            <p>High <hi>Interest</hi> is thought by some a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to Trade; but if we will look back, we shall find that <hi>England</hi> never throve so well, nor was there ever brought into <hi>England</hi> so great an increase of Wealth
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56722:58"/>
since, as in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s and King <hi>Iames</hi> I. and King <hi>Charles</hi> I. time. when Money was at 10 and 8 <hi>per Cent..</hi> I will not say high <hi>Interest</hi> was the Cause of it; for I rather think that our thriving Trade was the Cause of high <hi>Interest,</hi> every one craving Money to employ in a profitable Commerce. But this I think I may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably infer from it, That lowering of <hi>Interest</hi> is not a sure way to improve ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Trade or Wealth.</p>
            <p>To this I hear some say, That the <hi>Dutch,</hi> Skilful in all Arts of promoting Trade, to out do us in this as well as all other Advancements of it, have observed this Rule, That when we fell <hi>Interest</hi> in <hi>England</hi> from 10 to 8. they presently sunk <hi>Interest</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> to 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and again, when we lower'd it to 6, they fell it to 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> thereby to keep the Advantage which the lowness of <hi>Interest</hi> gives to Trade. From whence these men readily conclude, That the falling of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi> will a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56722:58"/>
why did the <hi>Dutch</hi> so constantly take their measures only by us, and not as well by some other of their Neighbours, with whom they have as great or greater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce than with us? This is enough at first sight to make one suspect this to be Dust only rais'd to throw in Peoples eyes, and a Suggestion made to serve a Purpose. For,</item>
                  <item>2. It will not be found true, That when we abated <hi>Interest</hi> here in <hi>England</hi> to 8. the <hi>Dutch</hi> sunk it in <hi>Holland</hi> to 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> by Law; or that there was any Law made in <hi>Holland</hi> to limit the Rate of <hi>Interest</hi> to 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> when we reduced it in <hi>England</hi> to 6. It is true, <hi>Iohn De Witt,</hi> when he managed the Affairs of <hi>Holland,</hi> setting himself to lessen the publick Debt, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving actually paid some, and getting Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in a readiness to pay others, sent no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to all the Creditors, That those who would not take 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> should come and receive their Money. The Creditors finding him in earnest, and knowing not how otherwise to employ their Money, accepted his Terms, and changed their Obligations into 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> whereas before they were at 5. and so (the great Loans of the Country being to the State) it might be said in this sense, That the Rate of <hi>Interest</hi> was reduced lower at that time;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56722:59"/>
but that it was done by a Law, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to take higher <hi>Interest</hi> that 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> that I deny, and require any one to shew. Indeed upon good Security one might lately have borrowed Money in <hi>Holland</hi> at 3, and 3 ½ <hi>per Cent.</hi> but not by vertue of any Law, but the natural Rate of <hi>Interest.</hi> And I appeal to the men learned in the Law of <hi>Holland,</hi> whether last year (and I doubt not but it is so still) a man might not lawfully lend his Money for what <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi> he could get; and whether in the Courts he should not recover the <hi>Interest</hi> he contracted for, if it were 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> So that if Money be to be borrowed by honest and responsible Men, at 3, or 3 ½ <hi>per Cent.</hi> it is not by the force of Statutes and Edicts, but the natural Course of things, which will always bring <hi>Interest</hi> upon good Security low, where there is a great deal of Money to be lent, and little good Security in proportion to be had. <hi>Holland</hi> is a Country where the Land makes a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little part of the Stock of the Country. Trade is their great Fund; and their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states lie generally in Money; so that all who are not Traders, generally speaking, are Lenders: Of which there are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny whose Income depends upon <hi>Interest,</hi> that if the States were not mightily in Debt, but paid every one their Principal,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56722:59"/>
instead of the 4 <hi>per Cent. Use,</hi> which they give, there would be so much more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney than could be used, or would be ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured in Trade, that Money there would be at 2 <hi>per Cent.</hi> or under, unless they found a way to put it out in foreign Countries.</item>

            <p>
               <hi>Interest,</hi> I grant these Men, is low in <hi>Holland</hi>; but not as an effect of Law, nor the politick Contrivance of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to promote Trade; but as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of great Plenty of ready Money, when their <hi>Interest</hi> first fell, I say when it first fell: For being once brought low, and the Publick having borrowed a great part of private Mens Money, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in Debt, it must continue so, though the Plenty of Money, which first brought <hi>Interest</hi> low, were very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, and a great part of their Wealth were really gone. For the Debt of the State affording to the Creditors a constant yearly Income, that is looked on as a safe Revenue, and accounted as valuable as if it were in Land; (and accordingly they buy it one of another; and whether there be any Money in the publick Coffers or no, he who has 10000 <hi>l.</hi> owing him from the States may sell it every day in the week, and have ready Money for it) this Credit is so great an advantage to private
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56722:60"/>
Men, who know not else what to do with their Stocks, that were the States now in a condition to begin to pay their Debts, the Creditors, rather than take their Money out to lie dead by them, would let it stay in at lower <hi>Interest,</hi> as they did some years since, when they were call'd on to come and receive their Money. This is the state of <hi>Interest</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi>; Their plenty of Money, and paying their publique Debts, some time since lowered their <hi>Interest,</hi> but it was not by Law, nor in consequence of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing it here by Law to 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> For I deny that there is any Law there yet, to forbid lending of Money for above 3, or 6, or 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> What ever some here suggest, every one there may hire out his money as freely as he does any thing else, for what rate he can get; and the Bargain being made, the Law will inforce the Borrower to pay it.</p>
            <p>I grant low <hi>Interest,</hi> where all men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to it is an advantage to Trade, if Merchants will regulate their Gains ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and men be perswaded to lend to them; but can it be expected, when the Publique gives 7, 8, or 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> that private men, whose Security is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no better, shall have it for 4? And can there be any thing stranger, than that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56722:60"/>
the same Men who look on, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore allow high use as an encouragement to lending to the <hi>Chequer,</hi> should think low Use should bring Money into Trade? The States of <hi>Holland</hi> some few years since, paid but 4 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney they owed; if you propose them for an example, and <hi>Interest</hi> be to be regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Law, try whether you can do so here, and bring Men to lend it to the Publique at that rate, this would be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to the Kingdom, and abate a great part of our publique Charge: If you cannot, confess, that 'tis not the Law in <hi>Holland</hi> has brought the <hi>Interest</hi> there so low, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, and that which will make the States, or any body else pay dearer now, if either their Credit be less, or Money there scarcer.</p>
            <p>An infallible sign of your decay of Wealth, is the falling of Rent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and the raising of them would be worth the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Care; for in that, and not in the falling of Interest lies the true advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Landed Man, and with him of the Publick. It may be therefore not besides our present business, to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cause of the falling of Rents in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Either the Land is grown barrenner, and so the Product is less, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56722:61"/>
the Money to be receiv'd for that Product is less; for it is evident that he whose Land was wont to produce 100 Bushels of Wheat <hi>communibus annis,</hi> if by long Tillage and bad Husbandry it will now produce but 50 Bushels, the Rent will be abated half. But this cannot be suppos'd general.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or the Rent of that Land is lessen'd. 1. Because the use of the Commodity ceases: as the Rents must fall in <hi>Virginia,</hi> were taking of Tobacco forbid in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> 2. Or because something else sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the room of that Product: as the rate of Copis-lands will fall upon the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Coal mines. 3. Or, because the Markets are supplied with the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, cheaper from another place. As the breeding Countries of <hi>England</hi> must needs fall their Rents, by the importation of <hi>Irish</hi> Cattle. 4. Or, because a Tax laid on your Native Commodities, makes what the Farmer sells, cheaper, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and what he buys dearer.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Or, the Money in the Country is less. For the exigencies and uses of Money not lessening with its quantity, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the same proportion to be imploy'd and distributed still in all the parts of its circulation, so much as its quantity is les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56722:61"/>
one that has a right to this Money be the less; whether he be Landholder, for his Goods; or Labourer, for his Hire; or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, for his Brokage. Though the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder usually finds it first. Because Money failing, and falling short, people have not so much Money as formerly to lay out, and so less Money is brought to Market, by which the price of things must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily fall. The Labourer feels it next. For when the Landholder's Rent falls, he must either bate the Labourer's Wages, or not imploy, or not pay him; which either way makes him feel the want of Money. The Merchant feels it last. For though he sell less, and at a lower rate, he buys also our Native Commodities, which he Exports, at a lower rate too; and will be sure to leave our Native Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities unbought, upon the hands of the Farmer, or Manufacturer, rather than Export them to a Market, which will not afford him Returns with profit.</p>

And when that begins once seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to be consider'd, and our faces and steps are in earnest turn'd that way, we may hope to have our Rents rise, and the publick Stock thrive again. Till then, we in vain, I fear, endeavour with noise, and weapons of Law, to drive the Wolf from our own to one anothers doors. The breed ought to be extirpated out of the Island.

            <p>If Three Millions were necessary for the carrying on the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> whereof One Million were for the Land-holder, to maintain him; another were for the payment of the Labourer and Handicraftsman; and the Third were the share of the Brokers, coming to them for their care and pains in distributing; If One Million of this Money were gone out of the Kingdom, must not there be ⅓ part less to be shared amongst them for the product of their Land, their Labour and their Distribution? I do not say they will feel it at the same time. But the Landholder having nothing but what
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56722:64"/>
the Product of his Land will yield; and the Buyer, according to the Plenty or Scarcity of Money he has, always setting the Price upon what is offered to Sale; The Land-holder must be content to take the Market-Rate for what he brings thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which always following the scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city or plenty of Money, if any part of our Money be gone, he is sure first to find it in the price of his Commodities. For the Broker and Merchant, though he Sell cheaper, yet he Buys cheaper too; and he will be sure to get by his Returns, or let alone a Commodity which will not produce him Gains; and whatsoever is so let alone, and left upon hands, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways turns to the Land-holders loss.</p>
            <p>Supposing that of our Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, Foreign Markets took off one half, and the other half were consumed amongst our selves; if a sensible part, (as ⅓ of our Money) were gone, and so Men had equally ⅓ less than they had (for, 'tis certain, it must be <hi>tantamount</hi>; and what I 'scape of ⅓ less, another must make up) it would follow, That they would have less to lay out in Cloaths, as well as other things, and so would either wear them longer, or pay less for them. If a Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier finds a want of Vent, he must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sell cheaper or not at all: If he Sells
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56722:64"/>
cheaper, he must also pay less, both for Wool and Labour: And if the Labourer hath less Wages, he must also pay less for <hi>Corn, Butter, Cheese, Flesh,</hi> or else forbear some of these quite. In all which cases, the Price of <hi>Wool, Corn, Flesh,</hi> and the other Products of Land are brought down, and the Land bears the greatest part of the loss. For where-ever the Consumption or Vent of any Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity is stopt, there the Stop continues on till it comes to the Land-holder. And where-ever the Price of any Commodity begins to fall, how many hands soever there be between that and the Land-holder, they all take reprisals one upon another, till at last it comes to the Land-holder; and there the abatement of Price, of any of his Commodities, les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens his Income, and is a clear loss. The Owner of Land, which produces the Commodity, and the last Buyer, who consumes it, are the two extreams in Commerce. And though the falling of any sort of Commodity in the Land-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's hand, does not prove so to the last consumer, the Arts of intervening Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers and Ingrossers keeping up the Price to their own advantage; yet whenever want of Money, or want of desire in the consumer, make the Price low, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56722:65"/>
reaches the first producer; no body between having any Interest to keep it up.</p>
            <p>Now, as to the two first causes of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>Rents,</hi> falling of <hi>Interest</hi> has no Influence at all. In the latter, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it has a great part: Because it makes the Money of <hi>England</hi> less, by making both <hi>English</hi>-Men and Foreigners withdraw or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their Money. For that which is not let loose into <hi>Trade,</hi> is all one whil'st hoarded up, as if it were not in Being.</p>
            <p>I have heard it brought for a reason, why <hi>Interest</hi> should be reduced to Four <hi>per Cent; That thereby the Landholder, who bears the burthen of the Publick Charge, may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:56722:65"/>That which is urged, as most deserving consideration and remedy in the case, is, <hi>That it is hard and unreasonable, that one, who has Mortgaged half his Land, should yet pay Taxes for the whole, whil'st the Mortgage goes away with the clear profit of an high Interest.</hi> To this I answer,
<list>
                  <item>1. That if any Man has run himself in Debt, for the Service of his Country, 'tis fit the Publick should reimburse him, and set him free. This is a care that becomes the Publick Justice; That Men, if they receive no Rewards, should, at least, be kept from Suffering, in having Served their Country. But I do not remember the Polity of any Nation, who altered their Constitution, in favour of those whose mismanagement had brought them behind-hand; possibly, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Publick little beholding to those who had misimploy'd the Stock of their Country, in the excess of their private Expences, and, by their Example, spread a fashion that carries ruine with it: Mens paying Taxes of Mortgaged Lands, is a punishment for ill-husbandry, which ought to be discouraged; but it concerns very little the Frugal and the Thrifty.</item>
                  <item>2. Another thing to be said in reply to this, is, That it is with Gentlemen in the Country, as with Tradesmen in the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56722:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
City. If they will own Titles to greater Estates than really they have, it is their own faults, and there is no way left to help them from paying for them. The Remedy is in their own hands, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themselves when they please. And when they have once Sold their Land, and paid their Debts, they will no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger pay Taxes for what they own, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being really theirs. There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way also, whereby they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, as well as a great many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies remedied; and that is by a <hi>Registry:</hi> For if Mortgages were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred, I and Taxes might reach them, and order the Lender to pay his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</item>

            <p>I have met with Patrons of Four <hi>per Cent,</hi> who (amongst many other fine things they tell us of) affirm, <hi>That if</hi> Interest <hi>were reduc'd to Four</hi> per Cent, <hi>then s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in the Street; but at last, I fear, 'twill be but Wit without Money; and, I wish it amount to that. 'Tis without question, That could the Country-man and the Trades-man take up Money cheaper than now they do, every Man would be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Borrow, and desire that he might have other Mens Money to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy to his advantage; and therefore, I confess, those who contend for Four <hi>per Cent,</hi> have found out a way to set Mens Months a watering for Money at that Rate, and to increase the number of the Borrowers in <hi>England</hi>; if any body can imagine it would be an advantage to increase them. But to answer all their fine Projects, I have but this one short question to ask them: Will Four <hi>per Cent</hi> increase the number of the Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? If it will not, as any Man at the very first hearing, will shrewdly suspect it will not, then all the Plenty of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney these Conjurers bestow upon us for <hi>Improvement of Land, Paying of Debts,</hi> and <hi>Advancement of Trade,</hi> is but like the Gold and Silver which Old Women be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve others Conjurers, bestow sometimes by whole Lapfuls, on poor credulous Girls, which, when they bring to the light, is found to be nothing but wither'd Leaves, and the possessors of it
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56722:67"/>
are still as much in want of Money as ever. Indeed I grant it would be well for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and I wish it were so, that the plenty of Money were so great amongst us, that every Man could borrow as much as he could use in Trade, for Four <hi>per Cent</hi>; nay, that Men could borrow as much as they could imploy for Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> But even at that Rate, the Borrowers already are far more than the Lenders. Why else doth the Merchant upon occasion, pay Six <hi>per Cent,</hi> and often above that rate for Brokage? And why doth the Country Gentleman of 1000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> find it so difficult, with all the security he can bring to take up 1000 <hi>l</hi>? All which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the scarcity of Money, and bad Security; two Causes which will not be less powerful to hinder Borrowing, after the lowering of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

So that these M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

too many already. Whilst they thus set Men a longing for the Golden days of Four <hi>per Cent,</hi> methinks they use the poor indigent Debtor, and needy Tradesman, as I have seen pratling Jack-Daws do sometimes their young, who kawing and fluttering about the Nest, set all their young ones a gaping, but having nothing in their empty Mouths but Noise and Air, leave them as hungry as before. 'Tis true these Men have found out by a cunning project, how by the restraint of Law to make the price of Money ⅓ cheaper, and then they tell <hi>Iohn a Nokes,</hi> that he shall have 10000 <hi>l.</hi> of it to employ in Merchandise, or Cloathing; and <hi>Iohn a Stiles</hi> shall have 20000 <hi>l.</hi> more to pay his Debts; and so distribute this Money as freely as <hi>Dego</hi> did his Legacies, which they are to have even where they can get it. But till these Men can instruct the forward Borrowers where they shall be furnished, they have perhaps done something to increase Mens desire, but not made Money one jot easier to come by. And till they do that, all this sweet gingling of Money in their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, goes just to the Tune of, <hi>If all the World were Oatmeal.</hi> Methinks these Undertakers, whilst they hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and Trades, had done better to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought themselves of a way, how Men need not Borrow upon <hi>Use</hi> at all; for this would be much more advantageous, and altogether as Feisible. For I am sure, 'tis as easie to contrive in a Country that wants Money in proportion to its Trade, how every Man shall be supplied with as much Money as he needs, (<hi>i. e.</hi> can em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy in <hi>Improvement of Land, paying his Debts, and return of Trade</hi>) for nothing, as for Four <hi>per Cent</hi>; As it is as easie to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute Twenty pair of Shooes amongst Thirty men, if they pay nothing for them at all, as if they paid 4 <hi>s.</hi> a pair. Ten of them (notwithstanding the Statute rate should be reduced from 6 <hi>s.</hi> to 4 <hi>s.</hi> a pair) will be necessitated to sit still Barefoot, as much as if they were to pay nothing for Shooes at all. Either we have already more Money than the Owners will Lend, or we have not. If part of the Money, which is now in <hi>England,</hi> will not be Lent at the rate <hi>Interest</hi> is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at, will Men be more ready to Lend, and Borrowers be furnished for all those brave Purposes more plentifully, when Money is brought to Four <hi>per Cent</hi>? If People do already lend all the money they have, above their own occasions,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56722:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whence are those who will borrow more at 4 <hi>per Cent,</hi> to be supplied? Or is there such plenty of Money, and scarcity of Borrowers, that there needs the reducing of <hi>Interest</hi> to 4 <hi>per Cent,</hi> to bring Men to take it? All the imaginable ways of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing Money in any Country, are these two: Either to dig it in Mines of our own, or get it from our Neighbors. That 4 <hi>per Cent,</hi> is not of the nature of the <hi>De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The way of getting from Foreigners, is either by force, borrowing, or Trade. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever otherways besides these men may fansie or propose, for increasing of Money, (except they intend to set up for the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers Stone) would be much the same with a destracted man's device, that I knew, who, in the beginning of his distemper first discover'd himself to be out of his Wits, by getting together, and boiling a great number of Groats, with a design, as he said, to make them plim, and grow thicker. That 4 <hi>per Cent,</hi> will raise Armies, Discipline Soldiers, and make Men valiant, and fitter to conquer Countries, and enrich themselves with the spoils, I think was never pretended. And that it will not bring in more of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours

Money upon Loan, than we have at present among us, is so visible in it self, that it will not need any proof; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders for 4 <hi>per Cent</hi> looking upon it as an undeniable Truth, and making use of it as an Argument to shew the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage it will be to the Nation, by lessening the Use paid to Foreigners, who upon falling of Use will take home their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.

                  </gap> Ounce may do the same. For if the abating 1/20 of the quantity of Silver of any Coin, does not lessen its Value, the abating 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>/20 of the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Silver of any Coin, will not abate its Value. And so a single Three-pence, or a single Penny, being call'd a Crown, will buy as much Spice, or Silk, or any other Commodity, as a Crown-Piece, which contains 20 or 60 times as much Silver; which is an Absurdity so

I believe no body would be content to receive his Debts or Rents in such Money; which though the Law should raise thus, yet he foresees he should lose 11/12 by the one, and by the other ⅘ of the value he received; and would find his new Shilling, which had no more Silver in it than 1/12 of what a Shilling had before, would buy him of Corn, Cloth, or Wine but 1/12 of what an old Shilling would.

If it be good to raise the Crown-piece this way 1/20 this Week, I suppose it will be as good and profitable to raise it as much again the next Week. For there is no reason why it will not be as good to raise it again another 1/20 the next Week, and so on; wherein, if you proceed but 10 Weeks
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56722:77"/>
successively, you will by New-Years-Day next have every Half-Crown raised to a Crown, to the loss of ½ of peoples Debts and Rents, and the King's Revenue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Confusion of all your affairs: And if you please to go on in this benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial way of raising your Money, you may by the same Art bring a Penny-weight of Silver to be a Crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Silver, i. e.</hi> the quantity of pure Silver separable from the Alloy, makes the real <hi>value</hi> of Money. If it does not, coin Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with the same stamp and denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and see whether it will be of the same value. I suspect your Stamp will make it of no more worth than the Copper-money of <hi>Ireland</hi> is, which is its weight in Copper and no more. That money lost so much to <hi>Ireland</hi> as it passed for above the rate of Copper. But yet I think no body suffered so much by it as he by whose Authority it was made current.</p>

               <p n="1">1. It is past doubt, that our <hi>Money is melted down</hi>; The Reason whereof is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently the cheapness of Coinage For a Tax on Coin, paying the Coinage, the particular Owners pay nothing for it. So that 100 Ounces of <hi>Silver Coined,</hi> comes to the Owner at the same Rate, as 100 Ounces of the Standard Silver in <hi>Bullion.</hi> For delivering into the Mint his Silver in Bars, he has the same quantity of Silver deliver'd out to him again in Coin, without any Charges to him.

                  <hi>England,</hi> than you would have otherwise; but only makes you Coin that which otherwise would not have been Coin'd, nor perhaps been brought hither; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not brought hither by an over-ballance of your Exportation, cannot stay when it is here. It is not any sort of Coinage, does or can keep your Money here. That wholly and only depends upon the Ballance of your Trade. And had all the Money in King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. and King <hi>Iames</hi> the II. time, been Minted according to this new proposal, this raised Money would have been gone as well as the other, and the remainder been no more, nor no less than it is now; though I doubt not but the Mint would have Coined as much of it as it has of our present mil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>'d Money. The short is this; An over-ballance of Trade with <hi>Spain</hi> brings you in Bullion; cheap Coinage, when it is here, carries it into the Mint, and Money is made of it; but if your Exportation will not Ballance your Importation in the other parts of your Trade, away must your Silver go again, whether Monied or not Monied. For where Goods do not, Silver must pay for the Commodities you spend.</p>

                  <hi>Mill'd-money</hi> is therefore certainly best for the Publique. But whatever be the cause of melting down our Mill'd-money, I do not see how raising our Money (as they call it) will at all hinder its being melted down. For if our Crown-pieces should be Coin'd 1/20 lighter; Why should that hinder them from being melted down more than now. The intrinsique value of the Silver is not alter'd, as we have shewn already: therefore that temptation to melt them down remains the same as before. <hi>But they are lighter by</hi> 1/20. That cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from being melted down. For Half Crowns are lighter by half, and yet that preserves them not. <hi>But they are of less weight, under the same denomination, and therefore they will not be melted down.</hi> That is true, if any of these present Crowns that are 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For then they will no more melt down the new light Crowns, than they will the old clipp'd ones, which are more worth in Coin, and Tale, than in weight and Bullion.

The one has 1/20 less Silver in it, and goes for 1/20 less, and so being weight, they are melted down upon equal terms.

by the Standard of your Mint; though perhaps by reason of clipt Money, any sum that is ordinarily received is much lighter than the Standard, and so has less Silver in it than what is in a like Sum new coin'd in the Mint.

               <p>The effect and ill consequence indeed is not so easily observed in the one as in the other: Because your accounts being kept, and your reckonings all made in Pounds, Shillings, and Pence, which are denominations of Silver Coins or numbers of them; if Gold be made current at a rate above the free and Market value of those two Metals, every one will easily perceive the inconvenience.

'Tis not convenient that it should in its varying proportion have a settled price. <hi>Let Gold,</hi> as other Commodities, <hi>find its own Rate.</hi> And when, by the Kings Image and Inscription, it carries with it a publick Assurance of its weight and fineness; the Gold Money so Coin'd will never fail to pass at the known Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket Rates; as readily as any other Twenty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The <hi>value</hi> or <hi>price</hi> of any thing being only the respective esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate it bears to some other, which it comes in Competition with, can only be known by the quantity of the one which will exchange for a certain quantity of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There being no two Things in Nature, whose proportion and use does not vary, 'tis impossible to set a standing regular price between them. The growing plenty or scarcity of either in the Market; (whereby I mean the ordinary places, where they are to be had in Tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fick) the real Use, or changing fashion of the place bringing either of them more into demand than formerly; presently varies the respective value of any two Things. You will as fruitlesly endeavour to keep
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56722:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
two different Things steadily at the same price one with another, as to keep two Things in an <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> where their varying weights depend on different Causes. Put a piece of Spunge in one Scale, and an exact counterpoise of Silver in the other, you will be mightily mistaken if you imagine, that because th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t they are to day equal they shall always remain so. The weight of the Spunge varying with every change of moisture in the Air, the Silver in the opposite Scale will sometimes Rise and sometimes Fall. This is just the state of <hi>Silver and Gold</hi> in regard of their mutual value. Their proportion, or use, may, nay constantly does vary, and with it their price. For being estimated one in Reference to the other, they are as it were put in opposite Scales, and as the one rises the other falls, and so on the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Farthings</hi> made of a baser Metal, may on this account too deserve your Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. For whatsoever Coin you make current, above the Intrinsick value, will always be dammage to the publick, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever get by it. But of this I shall not at present enter into a more particular En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. Only this I will confidently affirm, <hi>That it is the Interest of every Country, that all the current. Money of it should be of one and the same Metal; That the several Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56722:90"/>
should be all of the same Alloy, and none of a baser mixture: And that the Standard once thus settled, should be Inviolably and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably kept to perpetuity.</hi> For whenever that is alter'd upon what pretence soever, the publick will lose by it.</p>
               <p>Since then it will neither bring us in more Money, Bullion, nor Trade; nor keep that we have here; nor hinder our weighty Money of what Denomination soever from being melted; to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose should the Kingdom be at the charge of Coining all our Money a-new? For I do not suppose any Body can propose, that we should have two sorts of Money at the same time, one heavier, and the other lighter, as it comes from the Mint. That is very absurd to imagine. So that if all your old Money must be Coin'd over again, it will indeed be some advantage, and that a very considerable one, to the Officers of the Mint. For they being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd 3 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> for the Coinage of every Pound Troy, which is very near 5 ½ <hi>per Cent</hi>; If our Money be Six Millions, and must be Coin'd all over again, it will cost the Nation to the Mint 330000 <hi>l.</hi> If the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Cheapness of Coinage in <hi>England,</hi> where it costs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, will, indeed, make Money be soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er brought to the Mint, than any where else; because there I have the convenience of having it made into Mony for nothing.

examine. But be the Inconvenience of it what it will, this raising the Money he proposes as a Remedy: And to those who say, upon raising our Money Silver will rise too, he makes this Answer, That <hi>it can never be known, whether it will or no, till it be tried.</hi> To which I reply, That it may be known as certainly, without Trial, as it can, That two Pieces of Silver that weighed equally yesterday, will weigh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually again to morrow in the same Scales.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is Silver,</hi> (says our Author) <hi>whereof an Ounce</hi> (i. e. 480 Grains) <hi>will change for</hi> 5 s. 4 d. (<hi>i. e.</hi> 496 Grains) of our Standard Silver coin'd. To morrow you coin your Money lighter; so that then 5 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> will have but 472 Grains of coin'd Standard Silver in it. Can it not then be known, without Trial, whether that Ounce of Silver, which to day will change for 496 Grains of Standard Silver coin'd, will change to morrow but for 472 Grains of the same Standard Silver coin'd? Or can any one imagine that 480 Grains of the same Silver, which to day are worth 496 Grains of our coin'd Silver, will to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row be worth but 472 Grains of the same Silver, a little differently coin'd? He that can have a Doubt about this till it be tried, may as well demand a Trial to be made, to prove, That the same thing is aequipon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derent,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56722:93"/>
or aequivalent to it self. For I think it is as clear, That 472 Grains of Silver are aequiponderent to 496 Grains of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as that an Ounce of Silver, that is to day worth 496 Grains of Standard Silver, should to morrow be worth but 472 Gr. of the same Standard Silver; all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances remaining the same, but the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Weight of the Pieces stamp'd: which is that our Author asserts, when he says, That <hi>'tis only barely asserted,</hi> &amp;c. What has been said to this, may serve also for an Answer to the next Parapraph. Only I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it may be taken notice of, That the Author seems to insinuate that Silver goes not in <hi>England,</hi> as in Foreign Parts, by Weight; which is a very dangerous as well as false Position; and which, if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, may let into our Mint what Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Debasing of our Money one pleases.</p>
               <p>Remark. <hi>That our Trade hath heretofore furnished us with an Overplus, brought home in Gold and Silver, is true: But that we bring home from any place more Goods than we now Export to it, I do not conceive to be so. And more Goods might be sent to those parts; but by reason of the great Value of Silver in this part of the World, more Money is to be got by Exporting Silver, than by any other thing that can be sent; and that is the reason of it. And
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56722:93"/>
for its being melted down, and sent out, because it is so heavy, is not by their Paper denied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. <hi>That we bring home from any place more Goods than we now Export,</hi> (the Author tells us) <hi>he doth not conceive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Would he had told us a Reason for his Conceit. But since the Money of any Country is not presently to be changed, upon any private Man's groundless Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, I suppose this Argument will not be of much weight with many Men. I make bold to call it a groundless Conceit; For if the Author please to remember the great Sums of Money are carried every year to the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> for which we bring home consumable Commodities; (though I must own that it pays us again with advantage.) Or if he will examine how much only two Commodities, wholly consumed here, cost us yearly in Money, (I mean <hi>Canary</hi> Wine and Currants) more than we pay for with Goods Exported to the <hi>Canaries</hi> and <hi>Zant</hi>; besides the Over-ballance of Trade upon us in several other places; he will have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reason to say, <hi>he doth not conceive we bring home from any place more Goods than we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ow Export to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to what he says concerning the melting down and Exporting our Money, because it is heavy</hi>; if by <hi>heavy,</hi> he means, because our Crown-Pieces (and the rest of our <hi>sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cies</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:56722:94"/>
of Money in proportion) are 23 or 24 Grains heavier than he would have them coin'd. This, whoever grants it, I deny; upon grounds which I suppose, when exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, will be found clear and evident.</p>
               <p>Indeed when your Debts beyond Sea, to answer the Over-ballance of foreign Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations, call for your Money; 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the heavy Money, that is that which has the Standard Weight, will be melted down and carried away; because Foreig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners value not your Stamp, but your Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>He would do well to tell us what he means by <hi>the great value of Silver in this part of the World.</hi> For he speaks of it as a Cause that draws away our Money more now than formerly; or else it might as well have been omitted as mentioned in this place: And if he mean, by <hi>this part of the World,</hi> England; 'tis scarce Sense to say. That the great Value of Silver in <hi>England</hi> should draw Silver out of <hi>England.</hi> If he means the Neighbouring Countreys to <hi>England,</hi> he should have said it, and not doubtfully <hi>this part of the World.</hi> But let him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by <hi>this part of the World,</hi> mean what he will, I dare say every one will agree, That Silver is not more valued in this, than any other part of the World; nor in this Age, more than in our Grandfathers Days.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:56722:94"/>I am sorry if it be true, what he tells us, That <hi>more Money is to be got by Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Silver, than by any other thing that can be sent.</hi> This is an Evidence, that <hi>we bring home more Goods than we Export:</hi> For till that happens, and has brought us in Debt beyond Sea, Silver will not be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; but the Overplus of Peoples Gain, being generally laid up in Silver, it will be brought home in Silver; and so our People will value it as much as any other, in <hi>this part of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Truth of the Case in short is this. Whenever we, by a losing Trade, contract Debts with our Neighbours; they will put <hi>a great Value on our Silver, and more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney will be got by transporting Silver than any thing can be sent</hi>: Which comes about thus. Suppose that, by an Over-ballance of their Trade (whether by a Sale of Pepper, Spices, and other <hi>East-India</hi> Commodities, it matters not) we have received great quantities of Goods, within these two or three Months, from <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lland,</hi> and sent but little thither; so that the Accounts ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced between the Inhabitants of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> we of <hi>England</hi> were a Million in their Debt; what would follow from hence? This: That these Dutch Creditors, desiring to have what is due to them, give Order to their Factors
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56722:95"/>
and Correspondents here, to return it them. For enquiring, as we do, what are the effects of an over-ballance of Trade, we must not suppose they invest their Debts in Commodities, and return their Effects that way. A Million then being to be returned from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Holland</hi> in Money, every one seeks Bills of Exchange: But Englishmen not having Debts in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to answer this <hi>Million,</hi> or any the least part of it, Bills are not to be got. This presently makes the Exchange very high; upon which the Bankers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who have the command of great quantities of Money and Bullion, send that away to <hi>Holland</hi> in Specie, and so take Money here to pay it again there upon their Bills at such a rate of Exchange as gives them five, ten, fifteen, <hi>&amp;c. per Cent.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; and thus sometimes a 5 <hi>s.</hi> piece of our mill'd Money may truely be said to be worth 5 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> 9 <hi>d.</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi> And if this <hi>be the great value of Silver in this part of the World,</hi> I easily grant it him. But this great value is to be remedied, not by the alteration of our Mint, but by the Regulation and Ballance of our Trade. For be your Coin what it will, our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, if they over-ballance us in Trade, will not only have <hi>a great value for our Silver,</hi> but get it too; and there will be
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56722:95"/>
                  <hi>more to be got by Exporting Silver to them, than by any other Thing can be sent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Remarks. <hi>The alteration of the Coins in</hi> Spain <hi>and</hi> Portugal <hi>are no way at all like this. For there they alter'd in Denomination near half, to deceive those they paid, with paying those to whom they owed one Ounce of Silver, but half an Ounce for it. But in the alteration here designed, to whoever an Ounce of Silver was owing, an Ounce will be paid in this Money; it being here only designed, that an Ounce of Money should equal an Ounce of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in value, at home, as well as abroad, which now it does not.</hi>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi> In this Paragraph the Author Confesses the alteration of the Coin in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> was a cheat; but the <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration here design'd,</hi> he says, <hi>is not</hi>: But the Reason he gives for it is admirable; viz. <hi>Because they there alter'd in Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion near half,</hi> and here the Denomination is alter'd but 5 <hi>per Cent</hi>; for so in Truth it is, whatever be designed. As if 50 <hi>per Cent</hi> were a Cheat, but 5 <hi>per Cent</hi> were not; because perhaps less perceiveable. For the two Things that are pretended to be done here by this new Coinage, I fear will both fail, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That <hi>to whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

into 5 <hi>s.</hi> 5 <hi>d.</hi> (which is to make our Money 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> higher than it is now) I that am to receive an 100 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> Fee Farm Rent; shall I in this new Money receive 105 <hi>l.</hi> or barely 100 <hi>l.</hi>? The first I think will not be said. For if by Law you have made it 100 <hi>l.</hi> 'tis certain the Tenant will pay me no more. If you do not mean that 400 Crowns, or 2000 Shillings of your new Coin shall be an 100 <hi>l.</hi> but there must be 5 <hi>per Cent,</hi> in tale, added to every 100, you are at the charge of new Coinage to no other purpose but to breed Confusion. If I must receive 100 <hi>l,</hi> by tale, of this new Money for my Fee Farm Rent, 'tis demonstration that I lose five Ounces <hi>per Cent</hi> of the Silver was due to me. This a little lower he Confesses in these Words, <hi>That where a Man has a Rent-SEC, that can never be more, this may somewhat affect it, but so very little, that it will scarce ever at all be perceived.</hi> This <hi>very little</hi> is 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> And if a Man be cheated of that, so he <hi>perceives</hi> it not, it goes for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But this loss will not affect only such Rents as can never be more, but all Payments whatsoever that are contracted for before this alteration of our Money.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it be true, what he affirms, <hi>That an Ounce of Money doth equal an Ounce of Silver in value abroad, but not at home</hi>; then
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56722:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this part of the Undertaking will also fail. For I deny that the Stamp on our Money does any more debase it here at home than abroad, or make the Silver in our Money not equal in value to the same weight of Silver every where. The Author would have done well to have made it out, and not left so great a Paradox only to the credit of a single Assertion.</p>

think the Author there confesses, or else I understand him not.</p>
               <p>Remark. <hi>Nor will this any way interrupt Trade; for Trade will find its own course; the Denomination of Money in any Country no way concerning that.</hi>

               <p>The Price of things will always be estimated by the quantity of Silver is given in exchange for them. And if you make your Money less in Weight, it must be made up in Tale. This is all this great Mystery of raising Money, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Land.

The Land now at Sale yields 105000 Crowns, which is just the same 100000 Ounces of Standard Silver. There's the Land rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. And is not this an admirable Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56722:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for which the Publick ought to be at Charges for new Coinage, and all your Commerce put in disorder? And then to recommend this Invention, you are told, as a great Secret, That, <hi>Had not Money, from time to time, been raised in its Denomination, Lands had not so risen too:</hi> which is to say, Had not your Money been made lighter, fewer Pieces of it would have bought as much Land as a greater number does now.</p>
               <p>Rem. <hi>The loss of Payments therespoken of, will, in no sort, be so great as if the Parties to whom these Debts are owing, were now bound to receive them in the Money now pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and then to melt the same down; so at this they will have no cause to complain.</hi>

The Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers have rob'd the Publick of a good part of their Money (which Men will, some time or other, find in the Payments they receive) and 'tis desired the Mint may have a liberty to be before-hand in it.

The damage is already done to the Publick, by Clipping. Where at last it will light, I cannot tell. But Men who receive Clip'd Money, not being forced <hi>to melt it down,</hi> do not yet receive any loss by it.

When Clip'd Money will no longer change for weighty, than those who have Clip'd Money in their hands, will find the loss of it.</p>
               <p>Rem. <hi>'Twill make the Customs better paid,</hi> because <hi>there will be more Money.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That there will be more Money in Tale, 'tis possible: That there will be more Money in Weight and Worth, the Author ought to shew. And then, what-ever becomes of the <hi>Customs,</hi> (which I do not hear are unpaid now) the King will lose in the Excise above 30000 <hi>l. per annum.</hi> For in all Taxes where so many Pounds, Shillings, or Pence are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by the Law to be paid, there the King will lose 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> The Author here, as in other places, gives a good reason for it. For, <hi>His Majesty being to pay away this Money by Tale, as he received it, it will be to him no loss at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if my receiving my Rents in full Tale, but in Money of undervalue 5 <hi>per Cent,</hi> were not so much loss to me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I was to pay it away again by Tale. Try it at 50 <hi>per Cent.</hi> The odds only is, That one being greater than the other, would make more noise. But our Author's great refuge in this is, <hi>That it will not be perceived.</hi>

                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:56722:99"/>Remark. <hi>If all Foreign Commodities were to be Purchased with this new Species of Money sent out; we agree, That with</hi> 100 l. <hi>of it there could not be so much Silver or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commodities bought, as with</hi> 100 l. <hi>in Crown Pieces as now Coined; because they would be heavier; And all Coin in any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but where 'tis Coined, only goes by Weight; and for the same weight of Silver, the same every where still will be bought; and so there will, with the same quantity of Goods.

before? This confession also shews the Falshood of that dangerous supposition, That Money, <hi>in the Kingdom where it is Coin'd, goes not by Weight,</hi> i. e. is not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued by its Weight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rem. 'Tis true, The Owners of Silver will find a good Market for it, and no others will be damaged; but, on the contrary, the making Plenty of Money will be an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I grant it true, That if your Money were really raised, 5 <hi>per Cent, the Owners of Silver</hi> would get so much by it, by bringing it to the Mint to be Coin'd. But since, as is confessed, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities will (upon this raising your Money) be raised to 5 <hi>per Cent,</hi> this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration will be an advantage to no body but the Officers of the Mint.</p>
               <p>Rem. <hi>When Standard Silver was last raised at the Mint,</hi> (<hi>which it was, from</hi> 5 s <hi>to</hi> 5 s and 2 d <hi>the Ounce, in the</hi> 43 d <hi>of</hi> Eliz.) <hi>and, for above Forty Years after, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uncoin'd was not worth above</hi> 4 s 10 d <hi>the Ounce, which occasioned much Coining; and of Money, none in those days was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported: Whereas Silver now is worth but the very same</hi> 5 s <hi>and</hi> 2 d <hi>the Ounce still at the Mint, and is worth</hi> 5 s 4 d <hi>elsewhere. So that if this Bill now with the Lords does not happen to pass, there can never any Silver
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56722:100"/>
be ever more Coined at the Mint; and all the Mill'd Money will in a very little time more be destroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The reason of so much Money Coin'd in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time, and afterwards, was not the lessening your Crown Pieces from 480 to 462 gr. and so proportionably all the rest of your Money, (which is that the Author calls, raising Standard Silver from 5 <hi>s</hi> to 5 <hi>s</hi> 2 <hi>d</hi> the Ounce) but from the over-ballance of your Trade, bringing then in plenty of Bullion, and keeping it here.</p>
               <p>How Standard Silver (for if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor speaks of other Silver, it is a fallacy) should be worth its own Weight in Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard Silver at the Mint, (<hi>i. e.</hi> 5 <hi>s</hi> 2 <hi>d</hi> the Ounce) and be worth more than its own Weight in Standard Silver, (<hi>i. e.</hi> 5 <hi>s</hi> 4 <hi>d</hi> the Ounce) in <hi>Lombard-street,</hi> is a Paradox that no body, I think, will be able to comprehend, till it be better Explain'd. It is time to give off Coining, if the value of Standard Silver be lessened by it; as really it is, if an Ounce of coin'd Standard Silver will not exchange for an Ounce of uncoin'd Standard Silver, but an Ounce of coin'd Standard Silver will not exchange for an Ounce of uncoin'd Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard Silver, unless you add 15 or 16 grains overplus to it: Which is what the Author
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56722:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would have taken upon his word, when he says, <hi>Silver is worth Five Shillings Four Pence elsewhere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Five Shillings Four Pence of Money Coin'd at the Mint, the Author must allow to be at least 495 grains. An Ounce is but 480 grains. How then an Ounce of uncoin'd Standard Silver can be worth Five shillings Four pence, (<hi>i. e.</hi> How 480 grains of uncoin'd Standard Silver can be worth 495 grains of the same Standard Silver, Coin'd into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney) is unintelligible; unless the Coinage of our Mint lessens the Value of Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard Silver.</p>
