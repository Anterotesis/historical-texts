            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>OUR Bleſſed Saviour, in that incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sermon at his laſt Supper, (of which his Beloved Diſciple St. <hi>John</hi> has given us a Copy, from his thirteenth to his ſeventeenth Chapter) reads a Leſſon to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47751:3"/>
of the higheſt importance to their future Conduct and Comportment. He exhorts them with an Eloquence Divine in its Original, an Eloquence Divine in its Force and Energy, to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of many things, as hard and difficult, as they were neceſſary to be put in practice. Beſides the Command he gave them of loving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Jo. 13.34.</note> and that according to the meaſures of the Love he bore them; <hi>Sicut dilexi vos:</hi> He gave them a clear and ample View, a full Proſpect of all thoſe Pains and Afflictions, of all thoſe Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of that Death they were to undergo for his ſake. He acquainted them with the nature of their Sufferings, with what they were to endure from the Jews and Gentiles, who would both combine, (like as <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> to the Death of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,) in the Contrivance of ſuch exquiſite Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as ſhould put a period to the Lives of the Apoſtles, with the moſt intolerable Pains, that could poſſibly be invented. The Jews would think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to deſtroy them, as Impoſtors, as Preachers of a falſe and pernicious Doctrine, a Doctrine ſo oppoſite to the Tenor of their Belief, as that was, of their <hi>Meſſias</hi> being already come, whom they, obſtinately blind through Ignorance, as groſs as criminal, expect even to this day. The Gentiles would perform their utmoſt Endeavours, to offer up theſe Men a moſt acceptable Sacrifice to the Divinities they ador'd, inaſmuch as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47751:3"/>
were to wage War againſt them, to become their profeſs'd and irreconcileable Enemies. I need not mention with St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> upon this place, the reſt of the Contents of this great Sermon of our B. Saviour: I need not give you a more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Account of his farther Orders or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. You know how he encourag'd them, to raiſe themſelves above the Concerns or Cares of this World; He preſs'd them to an aſſimilation or likeneſs in Holineſs, to his Heavenly Father: He did not bid them aſpire only to the Sanctity of Angels, Cherubins or Seraphins, of any of the ſeven miniſtring Spirits that ſtand before God; they were to bear up to the Eternal Father, and from thence to take a pattern of Perfection. You know how he enjoyn'd them, not only to acquire ſuch Vertues as were to adorn or embelliſh themſelves, but to plant them in the Souls of others, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Rules and Methods of a new Life, of a new Belief, to preach Penance, Afflictions, Croſſes, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions even to death, to Men indulging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all ſorts of inordinate Pleaſures: to preach Poverty of ſpirit at leaſt, as abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, to Men boundleſs in their Riches, boundleſs in their Deſires of ſcraping them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by all means poſſible, good or bad; to preach Humility to the Proud, Patience to thoſe that brook not Affronts, Chaſtity to the Impure, Temperance to the Glutton; to controul lawleſs Uſurpation
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47751:4"/>
and Tyranny; to level immoderate Flights of Ambition; to transform the Idolaters of Vice, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Admirers and Proſelytes of Vertue; In a word, to tranſplant Men from Sin to Grace, from Grace to Glory. It was very hard for the Apoſtles, before whoſe clear view was plac'd ſuch a Scene or Landskip of future Events, ſo diſagreeable to Senſe and corrupted Nature, not to be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd, not to ſhrink back, not to cry out as upon another occaſion,<note place="margin">Matth 19.25.</note> 
               <hi>Quis ergo poterit ſalvus eſſe? Who is it then that can be ſaved?</hi> Our B. Saviour therefore, who well knew how eaſily Men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd from doing good, even at the diſtant view of enſuing Dangers, to animate and encourage his Diſciples to an Enterprize, ſo highly conducing to their own Advantage; that they might not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned or diſmay'd at the mighty Task, after he had convinc'd them in his precedent Diſcourſe, that there was nothing that lay under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but what was ſo far from being not feaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it was eaſie, confers upon them more ſenſible Encouragement in the Verſe foregoing that of my Text. In which he promiſes to give them unconceivable Comfort and Conſolation in the midſt of all their Troubles and Afflictions; and then for the obtaining of it, in the words of my Text adviſes, exhorts, nay commands them to have recourſe to Prayer, as the neceſſary Means to render all Burdens light, all Yokes ſweet, all La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47751:4"/>
and Pains eaſie. <hi>Amen, Amen, dico vobis; ſi quid petieritis Patrem in nomine meo, dabit vobis.— Petite &amp; accipietis, ut gaudium veſtrum ſit plenum. Amen, Amen, I ſay to you, if you ſhall ask the Father any thing in my Name, he will give it you. Ask, and you ſhall receive, that your joy may be full.</hi> As if he had ſaid (as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> remarks),<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. Hom. <hi>23.</hi> in Matth.</note> You muſt not think you muſt rely upon your own ſtrength, to ſurmount the Difficulties you are to encounter with: You muſt implore in your daily Prayers the Aſſiſtance of Heaven, and you'l never fail of its Protection. <hi>Petite &amp; accipietis,</hi> Ask and you ſhall receive, offer up your Petitions to the Father in my Name, and he'l bleſs your Endeavours, he'l ſtrengthen them with his all-ſurmounting Grace, he'l enable you to withſtand and overcome what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever would obſtruct your Proceedings. <hi>Petite &amp; accipietis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ask and ye ſhall receive, that your joy may be full.</hi> Since therefore our Holy Mother the Church, in a Seaſon ſacred to Prayer, do's propoſe to her Children the Goſpel, wherein our Saviour encourages his beloved Diſciples, to addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to that holy Exerciſe, as being the only Sourſe or Origin from whence flows the fulneſs of joy in this World, and the aſſurance of the ineffable Bliſs of the World to come; I think it will not be unſeaſonable from the words of my Text, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you likewiſe (D. Chriſtians) to apply your ſelves with joynt conſent, with united affection
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47751:5"/>
and fervor, to the devout and holy Exerciſe of Prayer; and that, not for theſe enſuing Days only, wherein we are more ſtrictly engag'd by the Church to pay our reſpective Duties to Almighty God, the better to diſpoſe us on <hi>Thurſday</hi> next to aſcend with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Spirit into Heaven, and prepare us to entertain that ſupreme Author of all Sanctity and Grace, the Third Perſon of the ever Bleſſed <hi>Trinity,</hi> who deſcended upon the Apoſtles in fiery Tongues, and will come to enflame our Souls with the fire of Love; but during alſo the ſeries or continuance of your Days; to the end, that by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting your ſelves to an Employment, as neceſſary as advantageous to a Chriſtian, your joy may be full, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t gaudium veſtrum ſit plenum.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I deſign, God willing, this day to ſet before you in the Firſt Part of my Diſcourſe, the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Prayer, together with the Advantages you may reap from it. In the Second, the abſolute Neceſſity of Prayer, with a ſhort Method how to Pray as we ought. <hi>Amen, Amen, ſi quid petieritis Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem in nomine meo, dabit vobis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Amen, Amen, I ſay to you, if you ſhall ask the Father any thing in my Name, he will give it you. Ask, and you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that your joy may be full.</hi> But that God may bleſs and crown my Endeavours, that he may ſeal this ſolemn Promiſe of granting what we ask, and make it good in My behalf, I muſt deſire you to joyn your Prayers with mine, that what I ſhall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47751:5"/>
ſay, may be to his Honour and Glory, to the good of all our Souls. And to this end let us with our beſt Devotion implore his Divine Aſſiſtance, by the Interceſſion of the moſt Holy Virgin-Mother, <hi>AVE MARIA, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Am throughly perſuaded (D.A.) that there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be given a more elevated Idea of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Prayer,</hi> then by ſhewing,<note place="margin">I. Part.</note> 1. That it came from <hi>Heaven.</hi> 2. That it conducts us to <hi>Heaven.</hi> 3. That it makes us find <hi>Heaven</hi> upon Earth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It came from <hi>Heaven,</hi> where it was even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Heavens, before thoſe material Orbs, that now rowl over us, were call'd from the dark, and profound Abyſs of uneſſential Nothing: Before the Angels were eſtabliſh'd in Glory, God himſelf was taken up with <hi>Prayer;</hi> not as the word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſignifies with us, <hi>Petition</hi> or <hi>Impetration,</hi> in as much as that Supreme and Independent Being could neither <hi>Pray</hi> in this Senſe to others, or make ſuch Addreſſes to it ſelf. His <hi>Prayer</hi> was the <hi>Contemplation</hi> of his own Divine Eſſence: His <hi>Prayer</hi> was that <hi>Expreſſion</hi> or <hi>Conſubſtantial Word,</hi> which from all Eternity, as an Eternal, Coeternal Beam ſhone from the Father: His <hi>Prayer</hi> was and is a <hi>Reflection</hi> upon his own unlimited Perfections, in that compleat Reſemblance of himſelf, his Son.</p>
            <p>When this <hi>Word</hi> deſcended from the Boſom of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47751:6"/>
his Eternal Father without either Change or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, to cloath himſelf with our Fleſh in the chaſt Womb of the Virgin-Mother, I find he came among us to teach us what he put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice himſelf, the holy Exerciſe of <hi>Prayer.</hi> It is written of his Houſe, that it is to be Conſecrated to Divine Service or <hi>Prayer:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 21.18.</note> 
               <hi>Domus mea Domus Orationis vocabitur.</hi> And which was his firſt Houſe, but the Womb of his Virgin-Mother, where he dwelt nine Months in that divine Employment? The firſt Chapter of his Prayer-Book, or firſt Leſſon he read, was to comply with the ſacred Decrees, with the holy Will of his Eternal Father, as the Royal Prophet ſays of him, <bibl>
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.10.</bibl> 
               <hi>In capite Libri ſcriptum eſt de me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In the beginning of the Book it is written of me, that I ſhould do thy will.</hi> I'le follow thy Orders, my God, I'le engrave thy Law in the middle of my Heart.</p>
            <p>When he came into the World at the appointed time, he employ'd in that holy Exerciſe of <hi>Prayer,</hi> the ſpace of Thirty Years. This Light of the World ſhed not a Beam upon benighted Man, he broke not from the ſacred Cloud whereinto he had retir'd,<note place="margin">Job 22 14.</note> 
               <hi>Nubes latibulum ejus,</hi> till the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that time was ended. And as if he thought it not enough to ſpend whole Thirty Years under the Roof of <hi>Mary,</hi> he repairs to a Deſert, a lonely and melancholly Deſert, where for Forty Days and Forty Nights, not granting his Body the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47751:6"/>

inviſibilium deſiderium?</hi> For what is <hi>Prayer,</hi> but an elevation of the Soul from terreſtrial to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Cogitations, an inquiſition or ſearch into ſupernatural Concerns, a fervent deſire of purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that Happineſs, which is as yet out of ſight. 'Tis for this Reaſon that Prayer is compar'd to the Ladder <hi>Jacob</hi> the Patriarch ſaw in a Viſion: As that gave an aſcent from Earth to Heaven, as thoſe myſterious Rounds bore the mounting Angels to their Sovereign Lord; ſo Prayer wings our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lumpiſh Nature, that we can ſoar aloft to the Region of Spirits; and to this purpoſe it refines our Humanity from all dregs of Mortality. As our Lord was ſeen leaning upon the utmoſt Rounds of this myſtick Ladder, or rather (as the <hi>Septuagint</hi> give a more congruous Conſtruction) as the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was ſeen leaning upon our Lord that ſupported it; ſo Prayer derives its efficacy, its vigour and force from the gracious aſſiſtance of an all-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God, who both raiſes and draws its Votaries to himſelf. Finally, as there were in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Viſion ſeen <hi>aſcending</hi> and <hi>deſcending Angels,</hi> they are yet upon the ſame Concern for Chriſtians devoted to Prayer. They carry our Petitions (as St. <hi>Hilary</hi> ſaith) to the Throne of Glory, they return to miniſter for us in the great work of our Salvation. The Soul likewiſe upon the Wings of Prayer takes her flight to Heaven; ſhe enters into the Palace of her Lord without controul or diſturbance, (Prayer

being the Key of Paradiſe (ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>) which gives her admittance into the Royal Bed-Chamber, where ſhe freely entertains her ſelf with an infinite Majeſty) ſhe becomes familiar with her God, ſhe not only obtains his Bleſſing as her Father, diſarms his juſt Indignation againſt her own, and the Worlds Offences, atones for her ſelf and others, but addreſſes her ſelf to him as her deareſt Friend, appropriates him to her as her Beloved, with the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles; Dilectus meus mihi,</hi>

               <hi>Sempe rorare;</hi> not always upon our Knees, with <hi>Hands</hi> erected, with <hi>Eyes</hi> lifted up to Heaven, that Ceremony at all times is neither neceſſary nor convenient: Let us <hi>Pray always,</hi> by a conſtant union of our Souls always with God: Let us <hi>Pray always,</hi> by doing what we do, for the ſake of God: Let us <hi>Pray always,</hi> by bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Sufferings for God: Let us <hi>Pray always,</hi> by deſiring what we deſire, may redound to the Honour of God: Let us <hi>Pray always,</hi> by loving what we love for the love of God: Let us <hi>Pray always,</hi> in fine, by rendring our <hi>Thoughts, Words,</hi> and <hi>Works,</hi> conſtant Effects of <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity.
