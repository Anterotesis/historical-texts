            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ENERAL Perſuaſives to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and a good Life, and Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives againſt Sin and wickedneſs at large, are certainly of good uſe to recommend Religion and Virtue, and to expoſe the deformity and danger of a Vicious courſe. But it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged on the other hand, that theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diſcourſes do not ſo immediately tend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Lives of men: Becauſe they fall among the Croud, but do not touch the Conſciences of particular Perſons in ſo ſenſible and awakening a manner as when we treat of particular Duties and Sins, and endeavour to put men upon the practice
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100454:4"/>
of the one and to reclaim them from the other, by proper Arguments taken from the Word of God, and from the nature of particular Virtues and Vices.</p>
            <p>The general way is, as if a Phyſician, inſtead of applying particular Remedies to the Diſtemper of his Patient, ſhould entertain him with a long diſcourſe of Diſeaſes in general, and of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and advantages of Health; and earneſtly perſuade him to be well; without taking his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Diſeaſe into conſideration, and preſcribing Remedies for it.</p>
            <p>But if we would effectually reform men, we muſt take to task the great and common diſorders of their Lives, and repreſent their faults to them in ſuch a manner as may convince them of the evil and danger of them, and put them upon the endeavour of a cure.</p>
            <p>And to this end I have pitched upon one of the common and reigning Vices of the Age, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny</hi> and <hi>evil-ſpeaking;</hi> by which men contract ſo much guilt to themſelves, and create ſo much trouble to others: And from which, it is to be feared, few or none are wholly free. For <hi>who is he,</hi> ſaith the Son of <hi>Sirach, that hath not offended</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ecclus. 19. 16.</note> 
               <hi>with his tongue? In many things,</hi> ſaith <hi>St. James, we offend all: And if any man offend not in word, the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jam. 3. 2.</note> 
               <hi>ſame is a perfect man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100454:4"/>
But how few have attain'd to this perfection? And yet unleſs we do endeavour after it, and in ſome good meaſure attain it, all our pretence to Religion is vain: ſo the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, <hi>If</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 26.</note> 
               <hi>any man among you ſeemeth to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, that man's Religion is vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the more diſtinct handling of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſhall reduce my Diſcourſe to theſe <hi>Five</hi> Heads.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall conſider the nature of this Vice and wherein it conſiſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall conſider the due extent of this Prohibition, <hi>to ſpeak evil of no man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew the evil of this practice, both in the <hi>Cauſes</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I ſhall add ſome further Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to diſſuade men from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I ſhall give ſome Rules and Directions for the prevention and cure of it.</p>
            <p>I. I ſhall conſider <hi>what this Sin or Vice of evil-ſpeaking,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">I.</note> 
               <hi>here forbidden by the Apoſtle, is:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not to defame and ſlander any man, not to <hi>hurt his reputation,</hi> as the <hi>Etymology</hi> of the word doth import. So that this Vice conſiſts in ſaying things of others which tend to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100454:5"/>
and reproach, to the taking away or leſſening of their reputation and good Name. And this, whether the things ſaid be true or not. If they be falſe, and we know it, then it is down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>Calumny;</hi> and if we do not know it, but take it upon the report of others, it is however a <hi>Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> and ſo much the more injurious, becauſe really groundleſs and undeſerved.</p>
            <p>If the thing be true, and we know it to be ſo, yet it is a defamation and tends to the prejudice of our neighbour's reputation: And it is a fault to ſay the evil of others which is true, unleſs there be ſome good reaſon for it beſides: Becauſe it is contrary to that charity and goodneſs which <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity</hi> requires to divulge the faults of others, though they be really guilty of them, without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity or ſome other very good reaſon for it.</p>
            <p>Again, it is <hi>evil-ſpeaking</hi> and the Vice condemn'd in the <hi>Text,</hi> whether we be the firſt Authors of an ill Report, or relate it from others; becauſe the man that is evil ſpoken of is equally defam'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way.</p>
            <p>Again, whether we ſpeak evil of a man to his face, or behind his back: The former way indeed ſeems to be the more generous, but yet is a great Fault, and that which we call <hi>reviling:</hi> The latter is more mean and baſe, and that which we proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call <hi>Slander</hi> or <hi>backbiting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100454:5"/>
And laſtly, whether it be done directly and in expreſs terms, or more obſcurely and by way of oblique inſinuation; whether by way of down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right reproach, or with ſome crafty preface of commendation: For ſo it have the effect to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame, the manner of addreſs does not much alter the caſe: The one may be more dextrous, but is not one jot leſs faulty: For many times the deepeſt Wounds are given by theſe ſmoother and more artificial ways of Slander; as by asking queſtions, <hi>Have you not heard ſo and ſo of ſuch a man? I ſay no more, I only ask the queſtion:</hi> Or by general intimations, that <hi>they are loth to ſay what they have heard of ſuch a one, are very ſorry for it, and do not at all believe it,</hi> if you will believe <hi>them:</hi> And this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times without telling the thing, but leaving you in the dark to ſuſpect the worſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch like Arts, though they may ſeem to be tenderer and gentler ways of uſing mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, yet in truth they are the moſt malicious and effectual methods of Slander; becauſe they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate ſomething that is much worſe than is ſaid, and yet are very apt to create in unwary men a ſtrong belief of ſomething that is very bad, though they know not what it is. So that it matters not in what faſhion a Slander is dreſs'd up, if it tend to defame a man and to diminiſh his Reputation, it is the Sin forbidden in the <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100454:6"/>
II. We will conſider <hi>the extent of this Prohibition</hi> 
               <note place="margin">II.</note> 
               <hi>to ſpeak evil of no man;</hi> and <hi>the due</hi> bounds and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of it. For it is not to be underſtood abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, to forbid us to ſay any thing concerning others that is bad. This in ſome caſes may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and our duty, and in ſeveral caſes very fit and reaſonable. The Queſtion is, in what Caſes by the general Rules of Scripture and right Reaſon we are warranted to ſay the evil of others that is true?</p>
            <p>In general, we are not to do this without great reaſon and neceſſity; as, for the prevention of ſome great evil, or the procuring of ſome conſiderable good to our ſelves, or others. And this I take to be the meaning of that advice of the Son of <hi>Sirach, whether it be to a friend or a foe, talk not of other mens lives; and if thou canſt without offence reveal them not,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ecclus. 19. 8.</note> that is, if without hurt to any body thou canſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal them, divulge them not.</p>
            <p>But becauſe this may not be direction ſufficient, I ſhall inſtance in ſome of the principal Caſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in men are warranted to ſpeak evil of others, and yet in ſo doing do not offend againſt this Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is not only lawful, but very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, and many times our duty to do this in order to the probable amendment of the perſon of whom
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100454:6"/>
evil is ſpoken. In ſuch a caſe we may tell a man of his faults privately; or where it may not be ſo fit for us to uſe that boldneſs and freedom, we may reveal his faults to one who is more fit and proper to reprove him, and will probably make no other uſe of this diſcovery but in order to his amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And this is ſo far from being a breach of charity, that it is one of the beſt teſtimonies of it. For perhaps the party may not be guilty of what hath been reported of him, and then it is a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to give him the opportunity of vindicating himſelf: Or if he be guilty, perhaps being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately told of it he may reform. In this Caſe the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> adviſeth to reveal mens faults, <hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ecclus. 19. 13, 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>a friend,</hi> ſays he, <hi>it may be he hath not done it, and if he have done it, that he do it no more: admoniſh a friend, it may be he hath not ſaid it, and if he have, that he ſpeak it not again: admoniſh a friend, for many times it is a ſlander; and believe not every tale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then we muſt take care that this be done out of kindneſs, and that nothing of our own paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be mingled with it; and that under pretence of reproving and reforming men we do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and revile them, and tell them of their faults in ſuch a manner as if we did it to ſhew our <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> rather than our <hi>charity.</hi> It requires a great deal of addreſs and gentle application ſo to manage the buſineſs of Reproof, as not to irritate and exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100454:7"/>
the perſon whom we reprove, inſtead of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This likewiſe is not only lawful but our duty, when we are legally called to bear witneſs concerning the fault and crime of another. A good man would not be an accuſer, unleſs the publick good, or the prevention of ſome great evil ſhould require it. And then the plain reaſon of the thing will ſufficiently juſtify a voluntary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation: otherwiſe it hath always among well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manner'd People been eſteemed very odious for a man to be officious in this kind, and a forward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former concerning the miſdemeanours of others. <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> may ſometimes think it fit to give en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to ſuch perſons, and to ſet one bad man to catch another, becauſe ſuch men are fitteſt for ſuch dirty work: But they can never inwardly approve them, nor will they ever make them their friends and confidents.</p>
            <p>But when a man is call'd to give teſtimony in this kind in obedience to the Laws, and out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to the Oath taken in ſuch Caſes, he is ſo far from deſerving blame for ſo doing, that it would be an unpardonable fault in him to conceal the truth, or any part of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is lawful to publiſh the faults of others, in our own neceſſary defence and vindication. When a man cannot conceal another's faults without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100454:7"/>
his own innocency, no charity requires a man to ſuffer himſelf to be defamed to ſave the reputation of another man. <hi>Charity begins at home,</hi> and though a man had never ſo much goodneſs he would firſt ſecure his own good name, and then be concern'd for other men's. We are <hi>to love our neighbour as our ſelves;</hi> ſo that the love of our ſelves is the Rule and meaſure of our love to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: And therefore <hi>firſt,</hi> otherwiſe it could not be <hi>Rule.</hi> And it would be very well for the World, if our charity would riſe thus high; and no man would hurt another man's reputation, but where his own is in real danger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This alſo is lawful for caution and warning to a third perſon, that is in danger to be infected by the company, or ill example of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or may be greatly prejudiced by repoſing too much confidence in him, having no knowledge or ſuſpicion of his bad qualities: But even in this caſe we ought to take great care that the ill character we give of any man be ſpread no further than is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the good end we deſigned in it.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe more obvious and remarkable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, this Prohibition doth not I think hinder but that in ordinary converſation men may mention that ill of others which is already made as publick as it well can be: Or that one friend may not in freedom ſpeak to another of the miſcarriage of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100454:8"/>
a third perſon, where he is ſecure no ill uſe will be made of it, and that it will go no further to his prejudice: Provided always, that we take no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in hearing or ſpeaking ill of others: And the leſs we do it, though without any malice or deſign of harm, ſtill the better; becauſe this ſhews that we do not feed upon ill reports and take pleaſure in them.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the uſual Caſes in which it may be neceſſary for us to ſpeak evil of other men. And theſe are ſo evidently reaſonable that the Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Text</hi> cannot with reaſon be extended to them. And if no man would allow himſelf to ſay any thing to the prejudice of another man's good name, but in theſe and the like Caſes, the tongues of men would be very innocent, and the World would be very quiet. I proceed in the</p>
            <p>IIId place, to conſider <hi>the evil of this Practice,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">III.</note> both in the <hi>Cauſes</hi> and the <hi>Conſequences</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We will conſider the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of it. And it commonly ſprings from one or more of theſe evil Roots.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> One of the deepeſt and moſt common <hi>Cauſes</hi> of <hi>evil-ſpeaking</hi> is <hi>ill-nature</hi> and cruelty of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: And by a general miſtake <hi>ill nature</hi> paſſeth for <hi>Wit,</hi> as <hi>Cunning</hi> doth for <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> though in truth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100454:8"/>
they are nothing akin to one another, but as far diſtant as <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is no greater evidence of the bad temper of Mankind, than the general proneneſs of men to this Vice. For (as our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſays) <hi>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi> And therefore men do commonly incline to the cenſorious and uncharitable ſide: which ſhews Human nature to be ſtrangely diſtorted from its original rectitude and innocency. The Wit of man doth more naturally vent it ſelf in <hi>Satyr</hi> and cenſure, than in praiſe and <hi>Panegyrick.</hi> When men ſet themſelves to commend, it comes hardly from them, and not without great force and ſtraining; and if any thing be fitly ſaid in that kind, it doth hardly reliſh with moſt men: But in the way of <hi>Invective,</hi> the Invention of men is a plentiful and never-failing Spring: And this kind of Wit is not more eaſie than it is acceptable: It is greedily entertained and greatly applauded, and every man is glad to hear others abuſed, not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how ſoon it may come to his own turn to lie down and make ſport for others.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak evil of others, is almoſt become the general entertainment of all Companies: And the great and ſerious buſineſs of moſt Meetings and Viſits, after the neceſſary Ceremonies and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements are over, is to ſit down and backbite
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100454:9"/>
all the World. 'Tis the <hi>Sawce</hi> of Converſation, and all Diſcourſe is counted but flat and dull which hath not ſomething of <hi>picquancy</hi> and ſharpneſs in it againſt ſome body. For men generally love rather to hear evil of others than good, and are ſecretly pleas'd with ill reports, and drink them in with greedineſs and delight: Though at the ſame time they have ſo much Juſtice, as to hate thoſe that propagate them; and ſo much Wit, as to conclude that theſe very perſons will do the ſame for them in another Place and Company.</p>
            <p>But eſpecially, if it concerns one of another <hi>Party,</hi> and that differs from us in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; in this Caſe, all Parties ſeem to be agreed that they do God great ſervice in blaſting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of their Adverſaries: And though they all pretend to be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of <hi>Him</hi> who taught nothing but <hi>kindneſs</hi> and <hi>meekneſs</hi> and <hi>charity;</hi> yet it is ſtrange to ſee with what a ſavage and murderous diſpoſition they will flie at one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other's Reputation and tear it in pieces: And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other <hi>Scruples</hi> they may have, they make none to beſpatter one another in the moſt bitter and ſlanderous manner.</p>
            <p>But if they hear any good of their Adverſaries, with what nicety and caution do they receive it? how many objections do they raiſe againſt it? and with what coldneſs do they at laſt admit it? <hi>It</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:100454:9"/>
               <hi>is very well,</hi> ſay they, <hi>if it be true: I ſhall be glad to hear it confirm'd. I never heard ſo much good of him before. You are a good man your ſelf, but have a care you be not deceived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay it is well, if to balance the matter, and ſet things even, they do not clap ſome infirmity and fault into the other Scale, that ſo the Enemy may not go off with flying Colours.</p>
            <p>But on the other ſide, every man is a good and ſubſtantial Author of an ill Report. I do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this to any one ſort of men, though all are to blame in this way; <hi>Iliacos intra muros peccatur, &amp; extra.</hi> To ſpeak impartially, the <hi>Zealots</hi> of all <hi>Parties</hi> have got a <hi>ſcurvy trick</hi> of lying for the Truth.</p>
            <p>But of all ſorts of People, I have obſerved the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Bigots</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the ableſt in this way, and to have the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Faith for a luſty Falſhood and Calumny. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will bandy a falſe Report, and toſs it from one hand to another; but I never knew any that would ſo hug a Lye and be ſo very fond of it. They ſeem to be deſcribed by <hi>St. John</hi> in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in the Revelation, <hi>whoſoever loveth and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a lye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another ſhrewd ſign that <hi>ill-nature</hi> lies at the root of this <hi>Vice</hi> is, that we eaſily forget the good that is ſaid of others, and ſeldom make mention
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100454:10"/>
of it; but the contrary ſticks with us, and lies uppermoſt in our memories, and is ready to come out upon all occaſions: And which is yet more ill-natur'd and unjuſt, many times when we do not believe it our ſelves we tell it to others, with this charitable Caution <hi>that we hope it is not true:</hi> But in the mean time we give it our <hi>Paſs,</hi> and venture it to take its fortune to be believed or not, according to the charity of thoſe into whoſe hands it comes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Cauſe of the commonneſs of this Vice is, that many are ſo bad themſelves, in one kind or other. For to think and ſpeak ill of others is not only a bad thing, but a ſign of a bad man. Our <hi>B. Saviour,</hi> ſpeaking of the evil of the <hi>laſt days,</hi> gives this as the reaſon of the great decay of Charity among men, <hi>becauſe iniquity ſhall</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 24. 12.</note> 
               <hi>abound, the Love of many ſhall wax cold.</hi> When men are bad themſelves, they are glad of any opportunity to cenſure others, and are always apt to ſuſpect that evil of other men which they know by themſelves. They cannot have a good opinion of themſelves, and therefore are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to have ſo of any body elſe; and for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they endeavour to bring men to a level, hoping it will be ſome juſtification of them if they can but render others as bad as themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:100454:10"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another ſource of this Vice is <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Revenge.</hi> When men are in heat and Paſſion they do not conſider what is true, but what is ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and miſchievous; and ſpeak evil of others in revenge of ſome injury which they have received from them: And when they are blinded by their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they lay about them madly and at a venture, not much caring whether the evil they ſpeak be true or not. Nay many are ſo <hi>Deviliſh,</hi> as to invent and raiſe falſe Reports on purpoſe to blaſt mens Reputation. This is a <hi>Diabolical</hi> temper, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>St. James</hi> tells us that the ſlanderous <hi>Tongue is ſet on fire of Hell:</hi> And the <hi>Devil</hi> hath his very <hi>Name</hi> from <hi>Calumny</hi> and falſe accuſation; and it is his <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> too, for he is always ready to ſtir up and foment this evil ſpirit among men: Nay, the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us that he hath the malice and impudence to accuſe good men before God; as he did <hi>Job,</hi> charging him with <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> to God himſelf; <hi>Who,</hi> he knows, <hi>does know the hearts of all the children of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Another <hi>Cauſe</hi> of evil-ſpeaking is <hi>Envy.</hi> Men look with an evil eye upon the good that is in others, and think that their Reputation obſcures <hi>them,</hi> and that their commendable qualities do ſtand in <hi>their</hi> light; and therefore they do what they can to caſt a cloud over them, that the bright ſhining of their Vertues may not ſcorch <hi>them.</hi> This makes them greedily to entertain, and induſtriouſly to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100454:11"/>
publiſh any thing that may ſerve to that purpoſe, thereby to raiſe themſelves upon the Ruins of other mens Reputation: And therefore aſſoon as they have got an ill Report of any good man by the end, to work they preſently go to ſend it abroad by the firſt <hi>Poſt:</hi> For the ſtring is always ready upon their Bow to let fly this Arrow with an incredible ſwiftneſs, through <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Countrey;</hi> for fear the innocent man's juſtification ſhould overtake it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Another <hi>Cauſe</hi> of evil ſpeaking is <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence</hi> and <hi>Curioſity;</hi> an itch of talking and medling in the affairs of other Men, which do no wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them. Some perſons love to mingle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in all buſineſs, and are loth to ſeem ignorant of ſo important a piece of <hi>News</hi> as the <hi>faults</hi> and <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> of men, or any bad thing that is talk'd of in good Company. And therefore they do with great care pick up ill Stories, as good matter of diſcourſe in the next Company that is worthy of them: And this perhaps not out of any great malice, but for want of ſomething better to talk of, and becauſe their Parts lie chiefly that way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Men do this many times out of <hi>wantonneſs</hi> and for <hi>diverſion.</hi> So little do light and vain men conſider, that a man's Reputation is too great and tender a Concernment to be jeſted withal; and that a ſlanderous Tongue <hi>bites like a Serpent,</hi> and <hi>wounds like a Sword.</hi> For what can be more barbarous,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100454:11"/>
next to ſporting with a man's Life, than to play with his Honour and Reputation, which to ſome men is dearer to them than their Lives?</p>
            <p>It is a cruel pleaſure which ſome men take in worrying the Reputation of others much better than themſelves; and this only to divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the Company. <hi>Solomon</hi> compares this ſort of men to diſtracted perſons; <hi>As a mad man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who caſteth firebrands, arrows and Death, ſo is the man that deceiveth his neighbour;</hi> the LXX. render it <hi>ſo is the man that defameth his neighbour, and ſaith am I not in ſport?</hi> Such, and ſo bad are the Cauſes of this Vice. I proceed to conſider, in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> place, the ordinary but very pernicious <hi>Conſequences</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of it; both to <hi>Others,</hi> and to <hi>our Selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To <hi>Others;</hi> the Parties I mean that are ſlandered. To them it is certainly a great <hi>injury,</hi> and commonly a high <hi>Provocation,</hi> but always mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of no ſmall <hi>grief</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>It is certainly a great <hi>injury,</hi> and if the evil which we ſay of them be not true, it is an injury beyond imagination, and beyond all poſſible reparation. And though we ſhould do our utmoſt endeavour afterwards towards their Vindication, yet that makes but very little amends; becauſe the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſeldom reacheth ſo far as the Reproach, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100454:12"/>
becauſe commonly men are neither ſo forward to ſpread the Vindication, nor is it ſo eaſily received after ill impreſſions are once made.</p>
            <p>I will add one thing more, that it is an Injury that deſcends to a man's Children and Poſterity; becauſe the good or ill Name of the Father is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved down to them; and many times the beſt thing he hath to leave them is the Reputation of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſh'd Virtue and Worth: And do we make no Conſcience to rob his innocent Children of the beſt part of this ſmall Patrimony, and of all the kindneſs that would have been done them for their Father's ſake, if his Reputation had not been ſo undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly ſtain'd? Is it no Crime by the breath of our mouth at once to blaſt a man's Reputation, and to ruin his Children, perhaps to all Poſterity? Can we make a jeſt of ſo ſerious a matter? Of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury ſo very hard to be repented of as it ought, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in ſuch a Caſe no Repentance will be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without Reſtitution, if it be in our power. And perhaps it will undo us in this World to make it, and if we do it not, will be our Ruin in the other.</p>
            <p>I will put the Caſe at the beſt, that the matter of the Slander is true; yet no man's Reputation is conſiderably ſtained, though never ſo deſervedly, without great harm and damage to him. And it is great odds but the matter by paſſing through ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hands is aggravated beyond truth, every
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100454:12"/>
one out of his bounty being apt to add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it.</p>
            <p>But, beſides the <hi>Injury,</hi> it is commonly a very high <hi>Provocation.</hi> And the conſequence of that may be as bad as we can imagine, and may end in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and deſperate Quarrels. This reaſon the wiſe Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> gives why we ſhould defame no man: <hi>Whether it be,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to a friend or a foe,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ecclus. 19. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>talk not of other mens lives. For he hath heard and obſerved thee,</hi> that is, one way or other it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably come to his knowledge, <hi>and when the time cometh he will ſhew his hatred,</hi> that is, he will take the firſt opportunity to revenge it.</p>
            <p>At the beſt, it is always matter of <hi>Grief</hi> to the perſon that is defam'd: And <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which is the <hi>beſt-natur'd Inſtitution</hi> in the world, forbids us the doing of thoſe things whereby we may <hi>grieve one another.</hi> A man's good name is a tender thing, and a wound there ſinks deep into the ſpirit even of a wiſe and good man: And the more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent any man is in this kind, the more ſenſible is he of this hard uſage; becauſe he never treats o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſo, nor is he conſcious to himſelf that he hath deſerved it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Conſequences</hi> of this Vice are as bad or worſe to <hi>our ſelves.</hi> Whoever is wont to ſpeak evil of others gives a bad character of himſelf, even to thoſe whom he deſires to pleaſe; who, if
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100454:13"/>
they be wiſe enough, will conclude that he ſpeaks of them to others as he does of others to them: And were it not for that fond partiality which men have for themſelves, no man could be ſo blind as not to ſee this.</p>
            <p>And it is very well worthy of our conſideration which our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſays in this very Caſe, that <hi>with what meaſure we mete to others, it ſhall be meaſured to us</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 7.</note> 
               <hi>again;</hi> and that many times <hi>heaped up,</hi> and <hi>running over.</hi> For there is hardly any thing wherein Man-kind do uſe more ſtrict juſtice and equality, than <hi>in rendering evil for evil, and railing for railing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, Revenge often goes further than words. A reproachful and ſlanderous ſpeech hath coſt many a man a <hi>Duel,</hi> and in that the loſs of his own Life, or the Murther of another, perhaps with the loſs of his own Soul: And I have often wonder'd that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Chriſtians</hi> this matter is no more laid to heart.</p>
            <p>And though neither of theſe great miſchiefs ſhould happen to us, yet this may be inconvenient enough many other ways. For no man knows in the chance of things, and the mutability of human affairs, whoſe kindneſs and good-will he may come to ſtand in need of before he dies. So that did a man only conſult his own ſafety and quiet, he ought to refrain from <hi>evil-ſpeaking. What man is he,</hi> ſaith the <note place="margin">Pſal. 34. 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>Pſalmiſt, that deſireth life, and loveth many days, that he may ſee good: keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from ſpeaking falſhood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:100454:13"/>
But there is an infinitely greater Danger hanging over us from God. If we allow our ſelves in this evil practice, all our Religion is good for nothing. So <hi>St. James</hi> expreſly tells us, <hi>If any man among you ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 26.</note> 
               <hi>to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his own heart, that man's Religion is vain.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> puts <hi>Slanderers</hi> and <hi>Revilers</hi> amongſt thoſe that <hi>ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God.</hi> And our <hi>B.

               <hi>Conſiderations to take men off from this Vice:</hi> As</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the uſe of <hi>Speech</hi> is a peculiar Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of Man above other Creatures, and beſtowed upon him for ſome excellent end and purpoſe: That by this <hi>Faculty</hi> we might communicate our thoughts more eaſily to one another, and conſult together for our mutual comfort and benefit: Not to enable us to be hurtful and injurious, but help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and beneficial to one another.

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider how cheap a kindneſs it is to ſpeak well, at leaſt not to ſpeak ill of any. A good word is an eaſy obligation, but not to ſpeak ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires only our Silence, which coſts us nothing. Some inſtances of Charity are chargeable, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the wants and neceſſities of others: The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence deters many from this kind of charity. But were a man never ſo covetous, he might afford another man his good word; at leaſt he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from ſpeaking ill of him: eſpecially if it be conſider'd how dear many have paid for a ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous and reproachful word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Conſider that no quality doth ordinarily recommend one more to the favour and good-will of men, than to be free from this Vice. Every one deſires ſuch a man's friendſhip, and is apt to repoſe a great truſt and confidence in him: And when he is dead, men will praiſe him; and next to Piety towards God, and Righteouſneſs to men, nothing is thought a more ſignificant commendation, than that he was never, or very rarely heard to ſpeak ill of any. It was a ſingular Character of a <hi>Roman Gentleman, Neſcivit quid eſſet maledicere, he knew not what it was to give any man an ill word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let every man lay his hand upon his heart, and conſider how himſelf is apt to be affected
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100454:14"/>
with this uſage. Speak thy Conſcience <hi>Man,</hi> and ſay whether, as bad as thou art, thou wouldſt not be glad to have every man's, eſpecially every good man's, good word? And to have thy faults con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd, and not to be hardly ſpoken of, though it may be not altogether without truth, by thoſe whom thou didſt never offend by word or deed? But with what face or reaſon doſt thou expect this from others, to whom thy carriage hath been ſo contrary? Nothing ſurely is more equal and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable than that known <hi>Rule, What thou wouldſt have no man do to thee, that do thou to no man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> When you are going to ſpeak reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of others, conſider whether you do not lie open to juſt reproach in the ſame, or ſome other kind. Therefore give no Occaſion, no Example of this barbarous uſage of one another.</p>
            <p>There are very few ſo innocent and free either from infirmities or greater faults, as not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to reproach upon one account or other; even the wiſeſt, and moſt virtuous, and moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect among men have ſome little vanity, or affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which lays them open to the raillery of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical and malicious wit: Therefore we ſhould often turn our thoughts upon our ſelves, and look into that part of the <hi>Wallet</hi> which men common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fling over their ſhoulders and keep behind them, that they may not ſee their own Faults: And when
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100454:15"/>
we have ſearched that well, let us remember our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Rule, He that is without ſin, let him caſt the firſt ſtone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly</hi> conſider, That it is in many Caſes as great a charity to conceal the evil you hear and know of others, as if you relieved them in a great neceſſity. And we think him a hard-hearted man that will not beſtow a ſmall Alms upon one in great want. It is an excellent Advice which the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> gives to this purpoſe, <hi>Talk not of other mens lives: If thou</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ecclus. 19. 10.</note> 
               <hi>haſt heard a word, let it die with thee; and be bold it will not burſt thee.</hi> I ſhall in the</p>
            <p>V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> place, <hi>give ſome Rules and Directions</hi> 
               <note place="margin">V.</note> 
               <hi>for the prevention and cure of this great evil among men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, Never ſay any evil of any man, but what you cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know.</hi> When ever you poſitively accuſe and <hi>endite</hi> any man of any <hi>Crime,</hi> though it be in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and among Friends, ſpeak as if you were upon your <hi>Oath,</hi> becauſe God ſees and hears you. This not only Charity, but Juſtice and regard to Truth do demand of us. He that eaſily credits an ill Report is almoſt as faulty as the firſt inventer of it. For though you do not make, yet you commonly propagate a <hi>Lye.</hi> Therefore never ſpeak evil of any upon <hi>common Fame,</hi> which for the moſt part is falſe, but almoſt always uncertain whether it be true or not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:100454:15"/>
Not but that is a fault, in moſt Caſes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the evil of men which is true, and which we certainly know to be ſo: But if I cannot prevail to make men wholly to abſtain from this fault, I would be glad to compound with ſome Perſons, and to gain this point of them however; becauſe it would retrench <hi>nine</hi> parts in <hi>ten</hi> of the <hi>evil-ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> that is in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Before you ſpeak evil of any man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether he hath not obliged you by ſome real kindneſs, and then it is a bad return to ſpeak ill of him who hath done us good. Conſider al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, whether you may not come hereafter to be acquainted with him, related to him, or obliged by him whom you have thus injured? And how will you then be aſhamed when you reflect upon it, and perhaps have reaſon alſo to believe that he to whom you have done this injury is not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it?</p>
            <p>Conſider likewiſe, whether in the change of Human affairs, you may not ſome time or other come to ſtand in need of his favour; and how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable this carriage of yours towards him will render you of it? And whether it may not be in his power to revenge a ſpiteful and needleſs word by a ſhrewd turn? So that if a man made no conſcience of hurting others, yet he ſhould in prudence have ſome conſideration of himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:100454:16"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let us accuſtom our ſelves to pity the Faults of men and to be truly ſorry for them, and then we ſhall take no pleaſure in publiſhing them. And this common Humanitie requires of us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the great infirmities of humane Nature, and that we our ſelves alſo are liable to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Conſidering likewiſe, how ſevere a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment every Fault and miſcarriage is to it ſelf; and how terribly it expoſeth a man to the wrath of God, both in this World and the other. He is not a good <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that is not heartily ſorry for the faults even of his greateſt Enemies; and if he be ſo, he will diſcover them no further than is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to ſome good end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Whenever we hear any man evil-ſpoken of, if we know any good of him let us ſay <hi>that.</hi> It is always the more humane and the more honourable part to ſtand up in the defence and vindication of others, than to accuſe and beſpatter them. Poſſibly the good you have heard of them may not be true, but it is much more probable that the evil which you have heard of them is not true neither: However, it is better to preſerve the credit of a bad man, than to ſtain the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the innocent. And if there were any need that a man ſhould be evil-ſpoken of, it is but fair and equal that his good and bad Qualities ſhould be mention'd together; otherwiſe he may
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100454:16"/>
be ſtrangely miſrepreſented, and an indifferent Man may be made a Monſter.</p>
            <p>They that will obſerve nothing in a Wiſe man, but his overſights and follies; nothing in a Good man, but his failings and infirmities; may make a ſhift to render a very wiſe and good man very deſpicable. If one ſhould heap together all the paſſionate Speeches, all the froward and impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Actions of the beſt Man; all that he had ſaid, or done amiſs in his whole Life, and preſent it all at one view, concealing his Wiſdom and Vertue; the Man in this Diſguiſe would look like a <hi>Mad-man</hi> or a <hi>Furie:</hi> And yet if his Life were fairly reported, and juſt in the ſame manner it was led; and his many and great Virtues ſet over againſt his failings and infirmities, he would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to all the World to be an admirable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Perſon. But how many and great ſoever any man's ill Qualities are, it is but juſt that with all this heavy load of Faults he ſhould have the due praiſe of the few real Virtues that are in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That you may not ſpeak ill of any, do not delight to hear ill of them. Give no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to <hi>buſy-bodies,</hi> and thoſe that love to talk of other men's Faults: Or if you cannot decently reprove them becauſe of their Qualitie, then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the diſcourſe ſome other way; or if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100454:17"/>
do that, by ſeeming not to mind it you may ſufficiently ſignifie that you do not like it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Let every man mind himſelf, and his own Duty and Concernment. Do but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in good earneſt to mend thy ſelf, and it will be work enough for one Man, and leave thee but little time to talk of others. When <hi>Plato</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from the Court of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> who would fain have had a famous <hi>Philoſopher</hi> for his Flatterer, they parted in ſome unkindnes, and <hi>Dionyſius</hi> bade him not to ſpeak ill of him when he was return'd into <hi>Greece; Plato</hi> told him, <hi>he had no leiſure for it;</hi> meaning that he had better things to mind, than to take up his thoughts, and talk with the faults of ſo bad a man, ſo notoriouſly known to all the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let us ſet a watch before the door of our lips, and not ſpeak but upon conſideration: I do not mean to ſpeak <hi>finely,</hi> but <hi>fitly.</hi> Eſpecially when thou ſpeakeſt of others, conſider of <hi>whom,</hi> and <hi>what</hi> thou art going to ſpeak: Uſe great Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and circumſpection in this matter: Look well about thee; on every ſide of the thing, and on every perſon in the Company, before thy words ſlip from thee; which when they are once out of thy lips, are for ever out of thy power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:100454:17"/>
Not that men ſhould be ſullen in company, and ſay nothing; or ſo ſtiff in converſation, as to drop nothing but <hi>Aphoriſms</hi> and <hi>Oracles:</hi> Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, among Equals and Friends, we ſhould not be ſo reſerved as if we would have it taken for a mighty favour that we vouchſafe to ſay any thing. If a Man had the underſtanding of an <hi>Angel,</hi> he muſt be contented to abate ſomething of this exceſs of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> for fear of being thought <hi>Cunning.</hi> The true Art of Converſation, if any body can hitt upon it, ſeems to be this; an appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring freedom and opennes, with a reſolute reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vednes as little appearing as is poſſible.</p>
            <p>All that I mean by this <hi>Caution</hi> is, that we ſhould conſider well what we ſay, eſpecially of others. And to this end we ſhould endeavour to get our minds furniſhed with matter of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning things uſeful in themſelves, and not hurtful to others: And, if we have but a mind wiſe enough, and good enough, we may eaſily find a field large enough for innocent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; ſuch as will harm no body, and yet be acceptable enough to the better and wiſer part of Mankind: And why ſhould any one be at the coſt of playing the fool to gratifie any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:100454:18"/>
I have done with the <hi>Five</hi> things I propounded to ſpeak to upon this Argument. But becauſe hardly any thing can be ſo clear, but ſomething may be ſaid againſt it; nor any thing ſo bad, but ſomething may be pleaded in excuſe for it: I ſhall therefore take notice of two or three <hi>Pleas</hi> that may be made for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Some pretend mighty injury and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. If in the ſame kind, it ſeems thou art ſenſible of it; and therefore thou of all men oughteſt to abſtain from it: But in what kind ſoever it be, the Chriſtian Religion forbids Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. Therefore do not plead one Sin in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of another, and make <hi>Revenge</hi> an Apologie for <hi>Reviling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is alledged by others, with a little better grace, that if this Doctrine were practiſed, Converſation would be ſpoil'd, and there would not be matter enough for pleaſant diſcourſe and entertainment.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, The deſign of this Diſcourſe is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs a great evil in Converſation, and that I hope which mends it will not ſpoil it. And however, if mens Tongues lay a little more ſtill, and moſt of us ſpake a good deal leſs than we do, both of our ſelves and others, I ſee no great harm in it: I
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100454:18"/>
hope we might for all that live comfortably and in good health, and ſee many good dayes. <hi>David,</hi> I am ſure, preſcribes it as an excellent <hi>Receipt,</hi> in his Opinion, for a quiet, and cheerful, and long Life, to refrain from evil-ſpeaking; <hi>What man is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 34. 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>he that deſireth life, and loveth many dayes that he may ſee good? Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from ſpeaking falſehood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But granting that there is ſome pleaſure in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective,</hi> I hope there is a great deal more in <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence:</hi> And the more any man conſiders this, the truer he will find it; and whenever we are ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, we our ſelves cannot but acknowledg it. When a man examines himſelf impartially before the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> or is put in mind upon a <hi>Death-bed</hi> to make reparation for Injuries done in this kind, he will then certainly be of this mind and wiſh he had not done them. For this certainly is one neceſſary qualification for the <hi>B. Sacrament,</hi> that we <hi>be in love and charitie with our neighbours;</hi> with which temper of mind this qualitie is utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is yet a more ſpecious <hi>Plea</hi> than either of the former, that men will be encouraged to do ill if they can eſcape the tongues of men; as they would do, if this Doctrin did effectually take place: Becauſe by this means one great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint from doing evil would be taken away,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100454:19"/>
which theſe good men who are ſo bent upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the World, think would be great pity. For many who will venture upon the diſpleaſure of God, will yet abſtain from doing bad things for fear of reproach from Men: Beſides, that this ſeems the moſt proper puniſhment of many Faults which the Laws of men can take no notice of.</p>
            <p>Admitting all this to be true, yet it does not ſeem ſo good and laudable a way to puniſh one Fault by another. But let no man encourage himſelf in an evil way with this hope, that he ſhall eſcape the cenſure of men: when I have ſaid all I can, there will, I fear, be evil-ſpeaking enough in the World to chaſtiſe them that do ill: And though we ſhould hold our peace, there will be bad tongues enow to reproach men with their evil doings. I wiſh we could but be perſuaded to make the Experiment for a little while, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men would not be ſufficiently laſh'd for their Faults, though we ſate by and ſaid nothing.</p>
            <p>So that there is no need at all that good men ſhould be concern'd in this odious Work. There will alwayes be offenders and <hi>Malefactours</hi> enow to be the <hi>Executioners</hi> to inflict this puniſhment upon one another. Therefore let no man preſume upon Impunitie on the one hand; and on the other, let no man deſpair but that this buſines will be ſufficiently done one way
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100454:19"/>
or other. I am very much miſtaken, if we may not ſafely truſt an ill-natur'd World that there will be no failure of Juſtice in this kind.</p>
            <p>And here, if I durſt, I would fain have ſaid a word or two concerning that more publick ſort of <hi>Obloquy</hi> by <hi>Lampoons</hi> and <hi>Libells,</hi> ſo much in faſhion in this wittie Age. But I have no mind to provoke a very terrible ſort of men. Yet thus much I hope may be ſaid without offence, that how much ſoever men are pleas'd to ſee others abuſed in this kind, yet it is alwayes grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous when it comes to their own turn: However I cannot but hope that every man that impartially conſiders muſt own it to be a fault of a very high nature to revile thoſe whom God hath placed in Authority over us, and <hi>to ſlander the footſteps of the Lords Anointed:</hi> Eſpecially ſince it is ſo expreſly written, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſpeak evil of the Rulers of thy People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having repreſented the great evil of this Vice, it might not now be improper to ſay ſomething to thoſe who ſuffer by it. Are we guilty of the evil ſaid of us? let us reform, and cut off all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions for the future; and ſo turn the malice of our Enemies to our own advantage, and defeat their ill intentions by making ſo good an uſe of it: And then it will be well for us to have been evil ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:100454:20"/>
Are we innocent? We may ſo much the better bear it patiently; imitating herein the Pattern of our <hi>B. Saviour, who when he was reviled, reviled not again, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may conſider likewiſe, that though it be a misfortune to be evil-ſpoken of, it is their fault that do it, and not ours; and therefore ſhould not put us into Paſſion, becauſe another man's being injurious to me is no good reaſon why I ſhould be uneaſie to my ſelf. We ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the injuries done to us, no not upon them that do them, much leſs upon our ſelves. Let no man's Provocation make thee to loſe thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Be not ſuch a fool, as to part with any one Virtue becauſe ſome men are ſo malicious as to endeavour to rob thee of the Reputation of all the reſt. When men ſpeak ill of thee, do as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid he would do in that caſe; <hi>live ſo, as that no body may believe them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that now remains is to reflect upon what hath been ſaid, and to urge you and my ſelf to do accordingly. For all is nothing, if we do not practiſe what we ſo plainly ſee to be our Duty. Many are ſo taken up with the deep <hi>Points</hi> and <hi>Myſteries</hi> of Religion, that they never think of the common <hi>Duties</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> of human Life. But <hi>Faith</hi> and a <hi>good Life</hi> are ſo far from claſhing with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100454:20"/>
one another, that the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> hath made them inſeparable. True <hi>Faith</hi> is neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a <hi>good Life,</hi> and a <hi>good Life</hi> is the genuine product of a <hi>right Belief;</hi> and therefore the <hi>one</hi> never ought to be preſs'd to the prejudice of the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I foreſee what will be, becauſe it hath ſo often been ſaid in the like caſe; that there is <hi>not one word of Jeſus Chriſt in all this.</hi> No more is there in the <hi>Text.</hi> And yet I hope that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is truly preach'd, when ever his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Lawes,</hi> and the <hi>Dutyes</hi> injoyn'd by the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> are incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated upon us.</p>
            <p>But ſome men are pleaſed to ſay, that <hi>this is mere Moralitie,</hi> I anſwer, that this is <hi>Scripture-Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian-Moralitie,</hi> and who hath any thing to ſay againſt <hi>that?</hi> Nay, I will go yet further, that no man ought to pretend to believe the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Religion, who lives in the neglect of ſo plain a <hi>Duty;</hi> and in the practice of a <hi>Sin</hi> ſo clearly condemn'd by it, as this of <hi>evil-ſpeaking</hi> is.</p>
            <p>But becauſe <hi>the Word of God is quick and powerful, and ſharper than a two-edged Sword,</hi> yea ſharper than <hi>Calumnie</hi> it ſelf; and pierceth the very hearts and Conſciences of men, laying us open to our ſelves, and convincing us of our more ſecret as well as our more viſible Faults; I ſhall therefore at one view repreſent to you what is diſperſedly ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this <hi>Sin</hi> in the <hi>H. Word of God.</hi>

And I have purpoſely reſerved this to the laſt, becauſe it is more perſuaſive and penetrating than any Human Diſcourſe. And to this end be pleas'd to conſider in what company the <hi>H.

               <hi>attainments</hi> in the knowledg of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> could exempt men from obedience to his Laws, and ſet them above the Virtues of a good Life.</p>
            <p>And now after all this, do we hardly think <hi>that</hi> to be a Sin, which is in <hi>Scripture</hi> ſo frequently rank'd with <hi>Murther</hi> and <hi>Adultery</hi> and the <hi>blackeſt Crimes;</hi> ſuch as are inconſiſtent with the life and power of Religion, and will certainly ſhut men out of the Kingdom of God? Do we believe the <hi>Bible</hi> to be the <hi>Word of God?</hi> and can we allow our ſelves in the common practice of a <hi>Sin,</hi> than which there is hardly any Fault of mens lives more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mention'd, more ſeverely reprov'd, and more odiouſly branded in that <hi>H. Book?</hi>

               <hi>in thy Tabernacle, who ſhall dwell in thy holy Hill? He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor taketh up a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach againſt his neighbour.</hi> Have ye never heard what our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſays, that <hi>of every idle word we muſt give an account in the day of Judgment;</hi> that <hi>by thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy words thou ſhalt be condemn'd?</hi> What can be more ſevere than that of St. <hi>James? If any man among you ſeemeth to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, that man's Religion is vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude: The <hi>Sin,</hi> which I have now war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men againſt, is plainly condemn'd by the <hi>Word of God;</hi> and the <hi>Duty</hi> which I have now been
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100454:22"/>
perſuading you to, is eaſie for every man to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, not hard for any man, that can but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to keep a good guard upon himſelf for ſome time, by the grace of God to practice; and moſt reaſonable for all <hi>Men,</hi> but eſpecially for all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> to obſerve. It is as eaſie as a <hi>reſolute ſilence,</hi> upon juſt occaſion, as reaſonable as <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>charitie,</hi> and the preſervation of <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>good-will</hi> among men, can make it; and of as neceſſary and indiſpenſable an obligation, as the Authority of God can render any thing,</p>
            <p>Upon all which Conſiderations let us every one of us be perſwaded to take up <hi>David's</hi> delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Reſolution, <hi>I ſaid, I will take heed to my wayes,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 31. 1.</note> 
               <hi>that I offend not with my tongue.</hi> And I do verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that would we but heartily endeavour to amend this one Fault, we ſhould ſoon be better men in our whole lives: I mean, that the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of this <hi>Vice,</hi> together with thoſe that are nearly allied to it, and may at the ſame time, and almoſt with the ſame reſolution and care be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, would make us Owners of a great many conſiderable Virtues, and carry us on a good way towards perfection; it being hardly to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd that a man that makes conſcience of his <hi>Words</hi> ſhould not take an equal or a greater care of his <hi>Actions.</hi> And this I take to be both the true meaning and the true reaſon of that ſaying of <hi>St.</hi>

               <hi>James,</hi> and with which I ſhall conclude; <hi>If any man offend not in Word, the ſame is a perfect man.</hi>

               <hi>Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the great Shepherd of the Sheep, through the blood of the everlaſting Covenant, make you perfect in every good</hi> word and work, to do his will; <hi>working in you alwayes that which is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to whom be glory for <hi>ever,</hi>
