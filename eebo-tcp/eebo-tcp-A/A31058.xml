         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AMong the <hi>Remains</hi> of this pious

communicated to the publick, none
more likely to be of general use and
advantage than this Explication of
the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Decalogue,</hi>
and the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Sacraments;</hi>
whether we regard the brevity and
plainness, or the admirable weight
and fulness of it. And therefore I
thought fit to publish it in a small
<hi>Manual</hi> by it self, and not to join it
with other <hi>Discourses</hi> of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,</hi>
that so this little <hi>Treatise,</hi>

It were to be wish'd, that the <hi>Creed</hi>
also had been explain'd by him in the

in a larger way, in a great many
excellent <hi>Sermons</hi> upon the several
<hi>Articles</hi> of it, wherein he hath not
onely explain'd and confirm'd the great
Doctrines of our Religion, but likewise
shewn what influence every Article of
our Faith ought to have upon our
practice. These <hi>Discourses</hi> will make
a very considerable Treatise, which will
in due time be made publick. In the
mean time enjoy and make use of this.</p>

            <p>AMong all the Duties, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to us by our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the rendring due
Worship to God is in nature, and
for consequence the principal;
God thereby being most directly
honoured, and served, we from it
immediately deriving most ample,
and high benefits; to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of which duty we are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with excellent direction,
and assistance from that Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which our Lord (at several
times, and upon several occasions)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66525:7"/>
dictated, and recommended to his
Disciples, both as a pattern, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
their devotions <hi>(Pray thus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 6. 9.</note>
or in this manner, saith he in Saint
<hi>Matthew)</hi> and as a form, in which
they should express them <hi>(When
you pray,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 11. 2.</note> 
               <hi>say;</hi> that is, say this or

therefore we should care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
attend as to our best
rule; and we should fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
use it as our best
matter of devotion; to
the well performing of
both which duties, it is
requisite that we should distinctly
understand the particulars contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
therein, in order to which
purpose we shall endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
them; but first let us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
a few words in general about
Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:66525:7"/>
Prayer in its latitude of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

or worship immediately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed
unto Almighty God; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of praise, which we render
to God in regard to his most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
perfections, and glorious
works; of submissive gratulation,
declaring our satisfaction in all the
dispensations of his most wise and
just providence; of thanksgiving,
for the numberless great benefits
we have received from him; of
acknowledging our total depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
on him, and our subjection
to him; of professing faith in him,
and vowing service to him; of
confessing the sins we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
against him, with the guilt
and aggravation of them; of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precating
the wrath and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
due to us for our offences;
of petition for all things needfull
and convenient for us; of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
for others, whose good we
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66525:8"/>
according to duty or charity are
concerned to desire and promote:
Prayer, I say (although according
to its most restrained sense it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doth signifie one of these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
namely the petition of
what is needfull or expedient for
us,<note place="margin">

as it commonly is used, it doth
comprize them all; and so we
may well take it here; this form,
although so very brief, being with
so admirable wisedom contrived,
as without straining the words
beyond their natural importance,
we may, applying a moderate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
discern them all, as to
their main substance, couched
therein;<note place="margin">Totius Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelii breviari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um; <hi>Tert.</hi> de Orat. 1, 9.</note> so that we may indeed
reasonably regard this Prayer as a
compleat directory, and a full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of all our devotion toward
God: of devotion, I say, the
which (to engage, excite, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
us to the carefull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
practise thereof) we may
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66525:8"/>
consider injoin'd us as a necessary
duty, commended to us as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
means of good, and a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
instrument of all piety, and
as a high privilege granted to us
by God.</p>
            <p>1. It is a natural duty and debt
we owe to God (both in corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
to the design of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made and endowed with rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
capacities agreeable to our
relations; and in requital for our
being, and for all the good we
have, and do continually receive
from him) as most highly to love
and reverence him in our hearts;
so to declare our esteem of his
excellencies, and our sense of his
bounty toward us: to avow the
dependence we have upon his will
and providence; the obligations
we are under to his mercy and
goodness; to yield our due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of respect, submission and
obedience to him: if we do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

a God, our Maker,
our Lord, our continual Benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour

acknowledge these performances
in reason, justice and gratitude
due to him; and God according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
requires, and positively injoins
them:<note place="margin">Deut. 10. 20.</note> He is <hi>the Lord our God,

God's hand, and we shall never
by any force or policy get them
thence without his will, moved
by intreaty; all good gifts come
from heaven, and thence we shall

it is an effectual instrument wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in us all true good; It is the
channel, by which God convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
spiritual light into our minds,
and spiritual vigour into our hearts.
It is both the seed and the food
of spiritual life; by which all
holy dispositions of soul,<note place="margin">Difficillimum est opus orare. <hi>Luth.</hi>

in life (without it we certainly
shall have an enstrangement, and

an aversation from him) it alone
can maintain a constant reverence
and awe of God, keeping him in
our thoughts, and making us to
live as in his presence; it chiefly
enliveneth and exerciseth our faith
and our hope in God: it is that
which begetteth in our hearts a
savoury relish of divine things;
which sweetneth and endeareth
to our souls the practice of piety;
which onely can enable us with
delight and alacrity to obey God's
commandments: It alone can raise
our minds from the cares and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
of this world to a sense
and desire of heavenly things. By
it God imparteth strength to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due

also with patience and equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity

with therein. It is, in short,
the onely strong bulwark against
temptation and sin; the onely
sure guard of piety and a good
conscience: no man indeed can
be a faithfull servant to God, a
real friend to goodness, a serious
practicer of duty without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
tenour of devotion.</p>
            <p>4. It is a most high privilege
and advantage to us, that we are
allowed to pray and address our
devotions to God. To have a

of an earthly Prince (to
the effect of receiving from him
all that we could desire) would
be deemed a matter of great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,

are admitted to the presence and

render withall unto him our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

for us to have recourse unto

               <p>It also plainly intimates how

and that we thence hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the good desirable from him
(the which are dispositions neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary

we should come thereto with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

which is also requisite to the same

call him <hi>Father?</hi> with what
heart, or face can we assume to

good things for our selves; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,

in any contrivance or industry
we can use; in any succour of

all these, we do need

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi>

dispensed by God, I have other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
touched, and it is not sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
now farther to insist there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
onely it may be pertinent here
to observe,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:66525:27"/>
1. That this being the first of
Petitions (formally such, and)
purely spiritual; we are hereby
admonished to lay the foundation
of our devotions in humility;
that we are obliged, before we
presume to ask any thing of God
concerning our chief happiness,
and well-being, to reflect upon,
acknowledge, and confess our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness
(not coming to our
prayers as the <hi>Pharisee</hi> did, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon our worthy qualities,
and good deeds; but like the poor
<hi>Publican,</hi> with a sense of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
and miscarriages; so as
to be ready to acknowledge our
selves, as indeed we all are, guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of many, and great sins) this
is here implyed; for in requesting
pardon for our sins, we confess
our selves to be sinners, and to
need God's mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:66525:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
2. We may hence learn the
necessity, and the excellency of
that benefit we here beg. When
the <hi>Psalmist</hi> applied himself to
praise God for his benefits, this
he set in the first place, as most
needfull and considerable to him:
<hi>Bless the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 103. 2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>O my Soul</hi> (said
he) <hi>and forget not all his benefits</hi>
(or rather, not any of his benefits)
<hi>who forgiveth all thine iniquities,
who healeth all thy diseases;</hi> and
answerably, it is the first particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
benefit we pray for.</p>
               <p>3. We must take notice, that
we are obliged to go to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
with universal charity,
and good-will toward others;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>to
lift up</hi> (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> injoineth) <hi>holy
hands without wrath, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
(or <hi>without wrath, and dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion)</hi>
to depose all enmity (as our
Lord adviseth) before we bring
our oblation <hi>to the altar</hi> of God;<note place="margin">Matt. 5. 23.</note>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:66525:28"/>
reserving no spight, or grudge to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
any man, but having a heart
clear of all ill-will, and desire of
revenge; being in affection of
mind toward others as we do
wish, and hope, and pray that
God would be toward us: such
in all reason, equity, and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
should our disposition be;
and such God requires it to be;
and such we do assert, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
it to be; implying also a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
with God, no otherwise to
desire, or expect his favour, and
mercy toward us, than as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
him in kind and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
intentions toward our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
It is implyed on God's
part, that he vouchsafes pardon
onely upon these terms; yea
more, that he doth truly promise
pardon upon our performing this
condition;<note place="margin">Matt. 6. 14.</note> so our Saviour, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
reflecting on this Petition,
doth afterward expound it: <hi>for,</hi>
saith he, <hi>if you forgive to men
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66525:28"/>
their trespasses, your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will also forgive you;</hi> it also
implies a consent on our parts,
and submission to this condition,
as most equal and reasonable; so
that if we break it, if we do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any uncharitable inclinations,
we deal, falsely with God; we
forfeit all pretence to favour, and
mercy from him; we are neither
qualified for mercy, nor shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it from God.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 1.</note> when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded

                  <hi>Israelites,</hi> by leading them in that
long journey through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,<note place="margin">Deut. 8. 2. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>that he might know what was

                  <hi>that he might know,
whether they did love the Lord
with all their heart, and with all
their soul:</hi> And because affliction
is of such a nature, as to try the
temper, disposition, and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men, therefore temptation
often is used for affliction. It see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
also sometimes put in a good
sense, for an occasion designed to
exercise, or to improve, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the vertues of a person; so
the inconveniencies, and crosses
incident to our nature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
here, the which our Lord

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 18. 4. 15.</note> and
others of the <hi>Apostles</hi> styled temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 12. 1. 6, 7.</note>

                  </gap>, to exercise

and refine them, <hi>that</hi> (saith he)
<hi>the trial of their faith might be

so S. <hi>James</hi> biddeth Christians to
<hi>rejoice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>when they fall into divers
temptations;</hi> that is when they
meet with opportunities of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
their faith, and patience;
and so we may understand that
place in <hi>Deuteronomy:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 8. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Who</hi> ('tis

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
say the LXX.) <hi>to do thee good at
the latter end; that he might tempt
thee,</hi> that is, that he might render
thee approved; might exercise,
and improve thy dependence on
God, thy patience, thy obedience.
But the word is commonly taken
in a worse sense, for an occasion
presented with ill purpose, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
tending and not easily
avoided, of falling into sin; a
stumbling block, a snare; as
when S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 9.</note> that <hi>they who
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66525:30"/>
will be rich, do fall</hi>

<hi>into temptation, and
a snare;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 13.</note> thus S. <hi>James</hi> assureth
us, that <hi>God tempteth no man;</hi>
that is, doth not intend to seduce,
or inveagle any man into sin. Yet
because nothing in the world, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good or bad, doth happen
without God's permission, and
governance; and the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
must obtain licence from God,
before he can tempt any man, or
do any mischief (as we see in <hi>Job</hi>'s
case,<note place="margin">Job 2. 6.</note> and in the history of <hi>Ahab)</hi>
since God seeth whatever is done,<note place="margin">1 King. 21. 22.</note>
and with greatest ease could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it; and doth not otherwise
than for some good end suffer any
evill to be designed, or atchieved,
it is the style of Scripture to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
such things in some sense
to him; as when God is said to
<hi>send Joseph into Egypt to preserve
life;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 45. 5.</note> when as in truth his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
out of envy, and ill-will did
sell him thither; and, God is said
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66525:30"/>
to <hi>move David to number the
people;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 24. 1.</note> when as indeed <hi>Satan</hi> (as
it is otherwhere affirmed) <hi>provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
him to number them;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Chron. 21. 1.</note> and
that horrid Tragedy acted by the

said to be brought to pass by the
<hi>hand and definite counsel of God;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 2. 23. 4. 28.</note>
because God foreseeing the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
which those men should
incurr of committing such acts,
and their inclinations to perform
them, did resolve not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
his power in hindrance of
them, but suffering them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
would turn their mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
practices to an excellently
good end, and use them as instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his just, holy, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
purposes: Thus then where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
by <hi>temptation</hi> here is meant
any occasion alluring, or provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to sin, or withdrawing from

considered, exceeding our strength
to resist or avoid; (or however
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66525:31"/>
such an one, that is apt to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
us) God may be said to
bring them into it, whom in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
he permits to be exposed
thereto; although he do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
intermeddle, or concur there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
than by not affording, or by
withdrawing his especial directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and assistance; leaving them
without check blindly or wilfully
to follow the sway of their own
tempers, the instinct of their vain
minds, the bent of their corrupt
wills; the violence of their unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
passions, and appetites; letting
them to fall into the manifold
snares of false opinion, evil cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
and contagious example,
which the World sets before them;
(the <hi>World,</hi> which by its fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and pleasing flatteries enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
to sin, or by its angry frowns,
&amp; fierce threats discourageth from
goodness) permitting the Devil,
without controll or impediment,
by his wiles to delude and seduce
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:66525:31"/>
them; which kind of proceeding
of God with men is clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
in the 81 <hi>Psalm;</hi> where,
of the <hi>Israelites</hi> God says, that
having signally declared his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to them, and by promise of
great benefits invited them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it; upon their wilfull neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
he dealth thus with them:

                  <hi>and Israel would none of me; So I

God, provoked thereto by our

bring us into, or doth let us <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into temptation</hi> (as our Lord
otherwhere expresseth it,<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 40, 46.</note> 
                  <hi>Pray,</hi>

and sometimes be entangled,
when we do walk in the midst
of snares, surrounded with traps
innumerable, most cunningly laid
to catch us: <hi>It is not</hi> (saith the

so as to go streight, and upright;
'tis not in him to see his duty,
to bend his inclinations to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
therewith; to restrain his
appetites, when sensible objects
forcibly press on them; to govern
his passions, when they are vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
stirr'd to disorderly moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
we do continually need God's
instruction to guide us, God's
<hi>hand to uphold us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 37. 23, 24.</note> God's care,

occasions of sin; when our

or betray us thereto; when the

into it; when the Devil violently

solicits, or thrusts on toward it;
thus to be destitute of God's grace,
thus to be left to our selves, is the
most horrible judgment, that can
be. In such cases and seasons God's
interposal is necessary either to
remove those temptations, or to
support, and defend us from the

            <p>ALthough this <hi>Systeme</hi> of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
may seem to have
been in its design rather political,
than moral; to regard publick,
and external, rather than private,
and interiour action; that great
branch of morality, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth
our selves in our private
retirements, or in our particular
conversation, Sobriety of mind
and manners, being scarce tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
herein, at least not openly
and plainly expressed; as also
devotion toward God (in any of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:66525:37"/>
its kinds, of praise, thanksgiving,
confession of sin, prayer and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession)
that great part of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Religion, being not expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly,

to a separate manner of living;
being also perhaps in temper and
disposition as well as in condition
and circumstances of life different
from other People; whence Laws
convenient, (or in a manner ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary)
for them, might not so
well sute to all others; upon which
accompts as other of their Laws,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:66525:37"/>
so perchance some passages in this

be deemed peculiarly
to concern them; Although how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
this <hi>Systeme</hi> doth more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
and immediately oblige that
People, all being formally, and in
style of Law directed onely to
them, promulged in their ears,
expressed in their language, inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the body of their Laws
as a principal member of them;
it being also expresly called a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
with that People <hi>(He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared

               <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 13. 10. 2.</note> says the text,<note place="margin">Exod. 34. 1, 28.</note>

and accordingly was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

named <hi>the Ark of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
the which, when all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
should be converted to God,
and admitted into the Church,
was (as the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told)
to be utterly discarded and

Hence although some passages
herein, according to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary,
strict, and literal meaning
might never have been intended
universally and perpetually to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige;</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
if we consider,</p>
            <p>1. The manner of its delivery;
with what extraordinary solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
it was proclaimed; how it was
dictated immediately from God's
own mouth; and written with his
finger; on</p>
            <p>2. The matter of it, containing
the prime dictates of natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
the chief rules of piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
God, and equity toward
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:66525:38"/>
our neighbour (whence those elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
conferr'd on it,<note place="margin">Neh. 9. 13.</note> in <hi>Nehemiah:
Thou camest also down upon mount
Sinai, and gavest them right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and true laws, good statutes
and commandments;</hi> and by Saint
<hi>Paul:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 12.</note> 
               <hi>The law is holy; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
holy, just and good;</hi>
(for that commendation doth I
suppose especially respect this part
of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law; out of which
he takes his instance,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Thou shalt
not covet)</hi> if we also consider,</p>
            <p>3. The end and design of these
Precepts, which was to ground
them in true notions of Religion,
and to dispose them to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of righteousness; to render
them loyal and acceptable subjects
to God; to promote God's glory,
and their own good;<note place="margin">Deut. 10. 12.</note> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
expressed in general concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their Law, doth more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
agree to this <hi>Systeme;</hi>
being as the base and platform,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:66525:39"/>
the heart and quintessence of all
their other Laws; the which
seem added as superstructures on
it, or <hi>fences</hi> thereof:</p>
            <p>4. If we also consider, that our
Saviour did not derogate from
this Law, but declared his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
onely to expound it, or to
ampliate, and extend it (they are
the words of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus)</hi>
and how the Apostles do
sometimes allege some passages in
it,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 7.</note> as retaining some authority,
and force to oblige.<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>5. Considering also farther,
that there is no commandment
herein (howsoever, according to
its immediate and direct sense
seeming peculiar to that People)
which may not in a larger, or in
a mysterious and spiritual mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
which at least may not
according to good analogy, or
parity of reason concern us; obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:66525:39"/>
us, if not by direct authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in punctual manner to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same thing, yet, as a significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God's pleasure and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
to somewhat answerable
and like thereto;</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Lastly,</hi> If we consider that
all, or the greatest part of, the
main duties concerning us are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
plainly expressed, or closely
insinuated in them; or may at
least be conveniently reduced to
them; our Saviour himself ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
gone before, directing us in
the matter and manner of doing
it;</p>
            <p>Considering, I say, these things,
we have no small reason to yield
great veneration to this ancient
<hi>Systeme</hi> of Precepts; and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the great use thereof
in order to the guidance of our
life, and practice: we according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shall so descant thereon, as by
considering the main drift, intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66525:40"/>
reason, and spiritual inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of each particular, to reduce
the chief Precepts of <hi>Christian</hi>
Doctrine, which oblige us, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>Premising thus much I address
my discourse to the particulars;
omitting all controverted niceties
concerning the division thereof;
and all circumstantial questions;
touching onely such things, as
shall appear substantial, and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <q>God spake all these words, saying:</q>
            <p>This is a title, or superscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:66525:40"/>
               <hi>God spake;</hi> It comes from

the nature and force of
a Law, obliging to highest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
and obedience; as that
which proceedeth from the most
sovereign, unquestionable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controllable
authority; which is
promulged in a way most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and most direct: every sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of God's purpose, or
pleasure is usually called God's
Word;<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 1.</note> for <hi>God</hi> (as the <hi>Apostle</hi>
says) <hi>in divers kinds, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
did speak unto the Fathers;</hi>
and to every such Word our ear
should be attentive, our heart
should be submissive, our hand
should be obedient; but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
they should be so, when God
himself immediately declares his
mind and will; as he did notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
in this case, by a great voice,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:66525:41"/>
distinctly audible and intelligible,
miraculously formed by himself:
<hi>Behold,</hi>

our God hath shewed us his glory,

what regard is due to that
Word, which God is pleased, not

to pronounce?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These words:</hi> that is these

            </p>
            <q>All these words:</q>

Jehovah, thy God, which
brought thee out of the

            <p>These words are by some taken
for a Precept; injoining the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment,
and acceptance
of God, answerable to what is
here implyed; and consequently
all the positive duties of Religion,
deducible hence; but we see the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:66525:42"/>
style is declarative, and assertive,
not directly imperative; and so
it may pass rather as a Preface
farther enforcing obligation to
obedience; wherein are expressed,
or intimated the chief reasons,

of remarkable <hi>emphasis:</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>I am Jehovah;</hi> or that very

homage, worship, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements

the tyrannical dominion of <hi>Satan</hi>
(a far more intolerably cruel and

hath freed us from serving sin in
our souls and bodies, a far harder
service, than making bricks, or

conferr'd on us an assured hope

being plain; as containing a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition

him as such; to yield all sitting
demonstrations of respect to his
name, and to whatever is special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
related to him; patiently to
submit to his will, and readily to
obey his commandments: these
principally and the like acts of
internal devotion, and external

us men, (whom God hath

and since the exhibiting to any

interdicting that mode, which in
the practice of ancient times had
so generally prevailed, of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
the Deities (apprehended

thereto yielding such expressions
of respect, as they conceived su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and acceptable to such Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
I cannot stand to declare
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66525:50"/>
the rise, and progress of such a
practice; how the Devil's malice,
and some mens fraud conspiring
with other mens superstitious ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and fondness, prevailed
so far to impose upon mankind;
I shall onely observe, that men
naturally are very prone to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with suggestions to such gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Religion: for as the sense
of want, and pain, and manifold
inconvenience, not to be removed
or remedied by any present sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
means, doth prompt men to
wish, and seek for help from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhere;
and this disposes them
to entertain any hopes propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to them (with how little so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ground of probability) of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it from any absent, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
power; as it also conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
engageth them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
any conditions required by
those, who propound such hopes,
as needfull for obtaining thereof;
whence the ordinary sort of men
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:66525:51"/>
are very apt to embrace any way
of Religion suggested to them,
especially by persons of credit,
and authority for knowledge;
so also, when the proposition
thereof doth come attended with
circumstantial appearances, and
shews gratifying their senses, or
humouring their passions, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully
amusing their fancies,
it most easily allures, and takes
them; as likewise on the other
side, when abstraction of mind,
and restraint of passion are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and sense or fancy are little
entertained thereby, men are
somewhat averse from such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals
of Religion, and are not so
easily brought heartily to like,
or earnestly to embrace them;
wherefore since the propounding
of images and sensible represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
(relating to somewhat

is the discourse of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to

<hi>who made the world, and all things

temples made with hands; nor is
worshipped by the hands of men,
—we therefore being the off-spring
of God,</hi>

                  <hi>ought not to think that the

as the forming any image to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present

prohibited; so the reasons which
we touched against such practice,
are discernibly enough insinuated.</p>
               <p>Neither should we omit, that
this Law is confirmed in the New
Testament, and there made a part
of God's new Law: for we are
therein often commanded <hi>to flee

to damnation:<note place="margin">Apoc. 9. 20. 21. 8. 22. 15.</note> for the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and notion of Idolatry in
which places, why should we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it otherwise, than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the plain sense of the
word, which is the worship of
images, or resemblances? why
should we take it otherwise, than
as opposite to God's Law, then in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:66525:55"/>
force? why shold we otherwise
expound it, than according to the
common notion and acceptance
of God's People at that time?
The word Idolatry was unknown
to other people than the <hi>Jews;</hi>
among the <hi>Jews</hi> it signified the
violation of the second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
wherefore the observance
of that Commandment is establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
and enforced by the Apostles.
The <hi>Jews</hi> detested the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
any images; their detestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was grounded on this Law;
they therefore, who earnestly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
them to continue in detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, do confirm, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
the obligation of this Law;
nor can we reasonably suppose
any distinction, or reservation for
any Idolatry (or any worshipping
of images) as lawfull, or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Christians; since the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
as they found it univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
prohibited to the <hi>Jews,</hi> so
they continued to charge Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:66525:56"/>
against it. This discourse
hath more force, considering that
the same reason, upon which this
Law was enacted, doth still ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
continue; men still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurably
affecting this fancifull
way of Religion, being apt in
the exercise thereof (if not curb'd
by a Law) to dote upon sensible
representations; being averse from
raising up their minds to the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true object of worship, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with intelligible, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
perfections: this the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of mens wild eagerness for
images, reliques, and other such
foolish trinkets, which had almost
quite oppressed our Religion (as
in many ages the best and wisest
men did observe and complain)
doth plainly evince.</p>
               <p>We may add, that if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
tradition and consent of the
ancient Church is in any case a
ground of perswasion, or rule of
practice to us, we are thence obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:66525:56"/>
to disapprove, and decline
the worshipping images; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more evident than
that all such worship was not
onely carefully eschewed, but zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
detested by the primitive
Christians: This is manifest from
most express words of the <hi>Fathers</hi>
generally impugning and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
all worship of images; which
are as applicable to that worship,
which hath been practised among
<hi>Christians,</hi> as to that of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens;</hi>
their expressions do not
signifie, nor their arguments prove
any thing, if any worship of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
be allowable, if they do
not as well condemn and confute
the <hi>modern,</hi> as the ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi>
They could not with any
reason, or modesty have used such
words, or urged such reasons, if
their practice had been like that,
which afterward crept into the
Church; their darts then against
<hi>Pagan</hi> Idolatry easily might, surely
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:66525:57"/>

themselves; which is so far from

                  <hi>In fine, divers of the Fathers
say, that all the commands in
the Decalogue, excepting the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
do continue in Force, as
naturally obligatory, and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the Christian Law: for
instance S.</hi> Augustin <hi>in his</hi> 119
Epistle <hi>speaketh thus:</hi> The other
precepts <hi>(excepting the Sabbath)</hi>
there <hi>(in the Decalogue)</hi> we do
observe properly as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
without any figurate obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
for we have manifestly
learnt, not to worship idols, and
not to take the name of the Lord
our God in vain, to honour father
and mother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do not figurately
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:66525:58"/>
pretend one thing and mystically
signifie another thing, but are so
observed as they sound.</p>
               <p>But so much for the prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
I shall add, that we may
conceive this positive Precept im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
and intended here, that in
our devotions and religious servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of God we should raise our
mind above gross sense and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
that we should entertain high
and worthy conceptions of God;
that we should apprehend him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
superiour to all things,
which we do see or know; that
we direct our minds unto him as
to a being transcendently perfect
in goodness, justice, wisedom and
power, above what we can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
and think; that which
our Saviour calls <hi>worshipping God
in spirit and truth;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 4. 23, 24.</note> which is (as
I take it) the special positive duty
of this Commandment.</p>
               <p>I need not farther to urge, how
presumptuous and dangerous the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:66525:59"/>
practices of those men are, who
(to the great danger, and scandal
of Christianity among Jews, and
Mahometans, and men of other
Religions) notwithstanding these
commandments of God, backed
with others, of the same import,
frequently occurring in the Holy
Scripture, (never that we find
any intimation of, repealed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed)
particularly against that
signal one made use or by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord,
thy God, and him onely shalt thou
serve;</hi> without any ancient good
authority, or example, without
any necessity or good reason in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing,
do not onely yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but violently force others
to yield unto angels, and unto
the souls of dead men (men of
dubious state in reference to God,
not having past the last trial and
judgment, the result whereof 'tis
a profane temerity in us peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily
to anticipate) all kinds of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:66525:59"/>
worship, both internal (reposing
trust and hope in them of obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
benefits from them; attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
unto them in their esteem
the knowledge and power, which
for all that we can know are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicably
proper unto God
himself) and external, of prayer
and invocation, of praise and
thanksgiving; and not onely thus
as to the substance imparting a
kind of divine worship to them,
but as to the manner, erecting
images of them, even in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
devoted to God's own service,
and affording to them the same
expressions of reverence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
that we do or can present
unto God himself (with great so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
dedicating such Images to
them, with huge care and cost dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them, with great semblance
of devotion saluting them; and
casting themselves down before
them; carrying them in procession,
exposing them to the people, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:66525:60"/>
making long pilgrimages to them;)
so that instead of the spiritual wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God himself, peculiarly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of Christians, and to which
our Religion is perfectly suted, a
Religion chiefly employing sense,
and fancy, and for the greatest
part directed unto the representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of creatures is substituted,
in despight, as it were, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
of these Commandments:
the plain force of which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to elude and evade by
slender pretences, and subtle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions,
by the like to which
there is no Law, which may not
as easily be rendred insignificant,
and invalid; never in the mean
time considering, that these laws
were not given to employ the
wits of Sophisters and Schoolmen;
but to direct the practice of rude
and plain people; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
no law, after such artists
have had the handling of it, can
signifie any thing: nothing being
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:66525:60"/>
so clear which by their cavillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and quirks they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found;
nothing so smooth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they cannot find or make
knots.</p>
               <p>There is subjoined to these two

them; others<note n="*" place="margin">

note that which is very obvious,
and most remarkable here; the
difference between God's procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in way of severity, and in
way of favour; by a vast propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the expressions of God's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
do exceed those of justice, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
both insisting upon like,
or correspondent grounds: <hi>he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siteth
the iniquities</hi> of disobedient
fathers <hi>unto the third or fourth
generation,</hi> but <hi>he sheweth mercy
to a thousand generations of those</hi>
that love and obey him; he soon
forgetteth the wrongs done, but
he long retaineth in memory the
services performed to him; which
consideration should work upon
our ingenuity, and engage us wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly

disobedience is styled hatred of
God, so <hi>loving God</hi> and <hi>keeping

as terms equivalent: they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
inseparably connected, love
being a certain cause of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

grounded in the reason of

light; they consequently have
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:66525:71"/>
been acknowledged as reasonable,
and obliging by the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of men; or might be so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
and asserted by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as easily to extort such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
but this <hi>Command,</hi> (although
as to its general and remote
matter it is most evidently reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
and requireth that, which
no man can deny to be matter of
necessary duty, yet) as to the
more immediate matter, as to the
determinate measure, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of performing those general
duties, no reason can discern an
obligation distinct from, or ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
to the Law givers will,
to practise according thereto:
that we should frequently with
gratefull and joyfull sense reflect
upon the glorious works of God
(especially that grand and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
one,<note place="margin">Psal. 143. 5. 92. 4. 107. 22. 26. 7. 145. 10.</note> wherein God's won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
excellencies of goodness,
wisedom, and power were so il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustriously
displayed; the creation
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:66525:71"/>
of the world, wherein so great
accommodations, and benefits
were generally dispensed to all
the creatures, and to us eminently
among them; remembring with
deepest respect, and most hearty
thankfulness our bountifull Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker;)
that we should be unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of the special favours by God's
gracious providence vouchsafed to
our country, our relations, our
selves (especially such very signal
ones, as was that of the delivery
from <hi>Egyptian</hi> slavery in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
so remarkable and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous);
that we should not spend
our selves, and our time in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
carking and labouring
about affairs touching our body,
and this present life, but should
assign some competent time both
for the relaxation of our mind,
and for attendance to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
of our soul: that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
we should allow fitting time
of respite, and refreshment to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:66525:72"/>
those of our brethren, whom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence hath disposed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a meaner condition, and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of servants to us; that their
lives may not by incessant care,
and toil be rendred over burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
and grievous to them; but
so that they may with some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
serve us; that also they be
not destituted of leasure and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to serve God, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Master; and to regard the
welfare of their souls, no less pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
than our own: that also we
should shew some kindness, and
mercy even toward our beasts,
allowing them some ease from
their painfull drudgeries in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half;
these are all of them things,
which reason evidently dictates;
which common sense must needs
admit, as duties of piety, justice,
and humanity: and to secure the
performance of them both as to
the substance, due measure, and
fit manner of them, common
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:66525:72"/>
prudence would suggest, that set
times should be appointed; in
which they should be solemnly
and notoriously discharged, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the publick testimony and
cognizance: and accordingly we
find, that in all wise and civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
some provision ever hath
been made, by appointing Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
times, for the practice of such
duties, in some kind or
degree: <hi>The founders of
Laws</hi> (saith <hi>Seneca) did
institute festival days,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Legum conditores Festos instituerunt dies, ut ad hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritatem homines publicè co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerentur, tanquam necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um laboribus interponentes temperamentum. <hi>Sen.</hi> de tranq. an.</note>

the substance of these

most wise Author of this Law;
who did see what was most fit
to be prescribed to those, whom
this Law concerned. Here is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
mentioned a reason, why
God specially did choose this day
to bless, and sanctifie it in this
manner to such purposes; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
his resting upon the Seventh
day from his works of Creation;
the which yet doth not certainly
import a natural conveniency,
toward accomplishing those pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
of this precise quantity of
time, or in this way of observing
it, in preference to any other,
that might have been appointed;
it onely seemeth to imply a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of these determinations, as
containing somewhat of profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
significancy; that such a
correspondency in circumstance
of time, and manner of practice
might admonish us concerning
the substance of our duty, or a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:66525:74"/>
principal part thereof peculiarly
designed in the Sanction of this
Law, the gratefull Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God's most glorious work
(the foundation as it were of all
other his acts of beneficence) the
Creation of the World: for thus
in all ceremonial Institutions we
may observe, that some signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
circumstance is selected, on
purpose to instruct or excite us
to practice, by representing to
our fancy the nature and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the main duty required,
as in <hi>Circumcision,</hi> in the <hi>Passover,</hi>
in <hi>Baptism,</hi> and other ritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
it is not hard to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive:
so it being God's design
to enforce the performance of that
excellent duty, by appropriating
a time thereto, we may conceive
that he therefore especially selec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that day, as most apt to mind

we can no wise be assured, that
an universal and perpetual obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation

that its obligation did extend far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<hi>for their iniquity,
and hardness of heart,</hi> by way of
concession and indulgence; for,
because they by their natural dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
were apt to forget their
maker; to neglect the state of
their soul, being wholly intent
on worldly affairs; to exact in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
pains from their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
who served them; to use
cruelly the poor beasts, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in tilling their ground, or
bearing their burthens; therefore
God (considering this incorrigible
temper of theirs) did indulge six
days to them for the prosecution
of those affairs, to which they
were so devoted, contenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to exact from them no more,
than this part of time for his own
service, for the benefit of servants,
and ease of beasts; if he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

it seems or would hardly have
endured it; the command would

perhaps not onely have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed

thereof might have rendred them

               </p>
               <p>Now although upon these ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts
we cannot press the strict
observation of this Law in all its
parts, according to its literal, and
direct intention, yet we may
learn much of our duty, much
of God's will from it: all God's
laws, spiritually and wisely, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
did tend to the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of piety and vertue; and
abstracting from the special cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of that People, to
whom they were consigned, may
(so far as our case is like theirs,
and wherein a common reason
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:66525:78"/>
doth appear) pass for fit patterns
for us to imitate, suggesting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
means of exercising, nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing,
encreasing those qualities
in us; and so from this Law we
may learn these duties:</p>
               <p>1. That we should frequently
call to mind, and consider the
great and glorious works of God,
performed for the general good of
his creatures, and specially for
mankind: The <hi>Creation</hi> of the
World, the <hi>Redemption</hi> of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
the <hi>Nativity, Passion, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,</hi>
and <hi>Exaltation</hi> of our
<hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> and the like,
no less now considerable to <hi>us,</hi>
both in respect of glory due to
God, and of benefit accruing to
us, then was the <hi>Creation</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That we are bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
our selves in the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of worldly business; not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:66525:79"/>
our minds with care,
not exhausting our bodies with
toil about them, but allowing
our mind convenient and seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
freedom, affording our soul
sufficient leisure with vigour and
alacrity to enjoy its nobler en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments,
and to pursue its
higher interests.</p>
               <p>3. That we are obliged to use
the same indulgence toward those,
whom divine providence hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be under our power,
care, or governance: to allow
our children, our subjects, our
servants a competent measure of
rest, and refreshment from their
ordinary labours, sufficient time
and leisure undistractedly to serve
God, and quietly to mind their
spiritual welfare: we must so
charitably tender their good, as
to permit and procure, that their
life may be easie and comfortable
here; and that also they may
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:66525:79"/>
have means to obtain for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a happy immortality here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;
not being in these respects
either harsh to their outward
man, or uncharitable to their
souls.</p>
               <p>4. That we must no be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull
to any creature, not
onely abstaining from inflicting,
in wantonness of humour, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
vexation upon them, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
from wearying and grieving
them too much for our emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or convenience: the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and preeminency bestowed
upon us by God over them should
be managed with moderation,
and clemency; we should be
gentle masters to them, not cruel
tyrants over them: we should
consider, that God did make
them, as to help and serve us, so
to enjoy somewhat themselves of
delight and satisfaction in their
being; which if we go to deprive
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:66525:80"/>
them of, rendring their condition
intolerable and worse than if they
had no being, as we do abuse
and injure them, transgressing the
bounds of our right over them,
so we encroach upon, disappoint,
and wrong their maker, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
therein but displease him;
doing thus is a point of injustice
not enough considered by them,
who commit it: they consider
not how beastly they are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
when they misuse poor
beasts.</p>
               <p>5. We may hence farther learn,
that it is fit certain times should
be allotted for the publick, and
solemn performance of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
duties: common reason
prompteth, that God (upon whose
protection, and disposal the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
good depends) should be
publickly honoured, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
frequently acknowledged;
also that care should be taken in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:66525:80"/>
every society, that all states of
men should lead their lives in
some competent degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
that all objects of grievous
pity should be removed from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
view; also common sense
will inform us, that these things
cannot effectually be executed,
without constituting definite pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods
of time, and limiting cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
according to which
they shall be practised under pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
inspection, and censure:
And these dictates of ordinary pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
the divine wisedom hath
ratified by his exemplary order;
the which in cases, wherein he
hath not interposed his direct au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
by way of precept may
serve for a good direction to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,

they practised; they in all places

And if that blind people
could pick these duties out of this
Law, much more should we see
our selves obliged, according to
analogy thereof, to appoint set
times for ensuring the practice of
them.</p>
               <p>6. Again, We may hence also
learn our obligation to submit
obediently to the constitution of
Governours relating to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
that we readily should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
all solemn times of festivity
and rest, which the Rulers of
Church, or State do appoint for
the securing or the promoting
those purposes of piety, or chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
according to the measure and
manner prescribed by them: for
Reason approving the thing as
good and usefull; and divine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
more clearly and fully confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
it to be so, and it not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
that God hath made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:66525:82"/>
determinations about it, it
remains, that it is left wholly to
them, to whose care God hath
entrusted the publick welfare, and
hath committed to their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the providing means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
thereto; having also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
injoined us in all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
things to follow their gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
and appointment in order
thereto. God decreed death to
be inflicted on those, who viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his command concerning the
<hi>Sabbath;</hi> which sheweth how
great a fault it is to offend in this
particular; and we may reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
esteem that command to be
his, which proceedeth from his
Ministers by authority from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and in conformity to his own
pattern.</p>
               <p>7. We add, that whereas God
required of the <hi>Jews</hi> such a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of time to be solemnly dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Religion, and mercy, we
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:66525:83"/>
to whom he hath vouchsafed
higher benefits, and proposed grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
encouragements, cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
but deem our selves obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to sequester and consecrate as
much or more time to the same
intents: we should indeed be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to withdraw our selves more
frequently from pursuance of our
own profits and pleasures to the
service of God, to the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
and celebration of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours:
we should willingly allow
greater relaxation to our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents:
and should the publick be
deficient in exacting a perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of such duties from us, it
would become us to supply such
defects by our private devoting
fit and frequent seasons thereto:
that in some proportion we may
exceed the <hi>Jews</hi> in gratefull pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as we surpass them in the
matter, and causes thereof; that
we may appear in some degree
more charitable than they, as we
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:66525:83"/>
have much greater reason and
obligation to be so then they.
So much for this;</p>
               <p>I proceed briefly to consider
the remaining Commandments,
the which immediately concern
another Object: those foregoing
did chiefly serve to regulate our
religious practice in yielding due
reverence toward God; these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
(which are supposed to
have made up the second of those
Tables, which written by God's
hand were delivered to <hi>Moses,</hi>
and preserved in the Ark of the
Testimony) do guide our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
and carriage toward our
Neighbour; in the front of which
worthily is placed that which
obligeth to dutifulness toward
our Parents; unto whom after
God, and his supreme Vice-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
we owe the highest respect,
gratitude and duty.</p>

Whence we may learn the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the duty here enjoined,
and what rank it beareth among
other duties; what high obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
belongs thereto, of what
consideration it is with God, and
how grievous a crime the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof is; that, briefly, we
are obliged to yield our parents
high affection of heart, great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of respect and observance
in word and deed; that the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of these duties is, next to
that of profaneness and unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
toward God himself, the
greatest disorder we can be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of: this all civil Nations have
consented to be our duty; and if
we consider the grounds, upon
which it is built, we shall find
that reason, justice, and necessity
do require it: S. <hi>Paul</hi> presseth
his precept of observance to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
with, a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>for this is just and equal:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 1.</note> for if
we look upon the disposition of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:66525:85"/>
parents in their mind toward
children, we may presume them
always full of tender affection,
and good will toward them, full
of desire, and care for their good,
full of pity and compassion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them; in the highest and
most especial degree beyond what
they bear to others; which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
in reason and equity do
require answerable dispositions in
those, upon whom they are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and who from them do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
inestimable benefits: for if
we do regard the effects procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from them we shall discern,
that</p>
               <p>1. From parents children do
receive being and life; that good
which nature inclineth so highly
to value and tender, as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all the good, happiness,
and comfort we are capable of.</p>
               <p>2. They are obliged to their
parents for the preservation, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:66525:86"/>
and protection of their
life: it is a long time before we
came to be able (such is the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
condition of man among
all living creatures, so ordered on
purpose, as it were, to beget this
obligation and endearment) any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to provide for, or to defend
our selves; and the doing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
in that senseless and helpless
state, relies upon the care, pain,
and solicitous vigilance of our
parents; the which they are not
onely always obliged, but are
commonly disposed with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
willingness to spend on their
children.</p>
               <p>3. Parents not onely thus at
first undergo such care and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to maintain their children,
but by expensive education (of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with much inconvenience and
incommodity to themselves) they
provide means for their future
support, and subsistence, during
life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:66525:86"/>
4. Children are so strictly tied
to their parents, as by their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
concession to partake in all
the comforts of their state, and
ornaments of their fortune.</p>
               <p>5. The goods acquired by the
parents industry do usually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
upon their children by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
and succession; whence
that children live handsomely and
comfortably, is the reward of
their parents merit, comes from
the store, that they have care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
provided, and laid up for
them.</p>
               <p>6. To which we may add,
that not onely the provision for
our temporal necessities and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
dependeth upon our
parents,<note place="margin">Deut. 6. 7, 20.</note> but the care of our souls,
and our spiritual welfare is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
on them:<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 4.</note> they are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to instruct us in the fear of
God, and to set us in the way
toward eternal happiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:66525:87"/>
7. We may consider also, that
all this they do most frankly and
out of pure kindness; without
regard to any merit antecedent,
or benefit consequent to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
as they received nothing
to oblige and move them to such
performances, so they can seldom
hope for answerable returns: it
is abundant satisfaction to them
if they see their children do well;
their chief delight and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is in their childrens good
absolutely and abstractedly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
indirect regards to their own
advantage.</p>
               <p>Upon these, and the like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts
it appeareth, that as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
have the affections most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
those of God toward us,
as they perform toward us the
actions most like to his, as they
are the principal instruments of
divine providence and bounty
(by which God's blessings are
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:66525:87"/>
conveyed and conferred upon us)
so they may be deemed in a sort
to represent God, and as his most
lively images have an especial ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
due to them. God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
to endear and render himself
amiable, or in the most kindly
way venerable to us, to engage
us to a more ready obedience of
him,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 6.</note> to declare the nature of our
duty toward him, assumes the
title of Father; and all Nations
have agreed to style him so; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally
also, whereas the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
toward other men are termed
justice, or charity, or courtesie,
or liberality,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> or gratitude, those
toward parents in every Language
(I suppose) are styled <hi>piety,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 4. Colere pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes.</note> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
somewhat divine in the
object of those duties; 'tis more
than injustice to wrong a parent;
'tis more than uncharitableness to
refuse them succour, or relief;
'tis more than discourtesie to be
unkind to them; 'tis more than
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:66525:88"/>
sordid avarice to be in their need
illiberal to them; 'tis rather high
impiety to offend in any of these
kinds.</p>
               <p>He that returns not love in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to their tender affection;
that doth not (as occasion requires,
and his ability permits) requite
the benefits received from them,
doth not defer to them an especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
reverence, in regard to that
sacred name and character they
bear, thereby intimates, that he
would in like manner be unjust,
ungratefull, and disingenuous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
God, from whom he hath
received the like benefits; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and continuance of his
being; the preservation, mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and protection of his life:
if he will not honour his earthly
Parents, whom he hath seen, how
will he reverence his heavenly
Father, whom he hath not seen?
so we may according to S. <hi>John</hi>
argue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:66525:88"/>
I might subjoin, that as justice,
and ingenuity do enforce this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
so for the good of the world
there is a necessity that it should
be observed: If parents are not
onely by natural instinct disposed,
but by divine command obliged,
and by humane Law (the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the world so requiring)
constrained to undergo such hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
for the maintenance, and
education of their children, it is
fit and necessary they should be
supported and encouraged in the
bearing them by reciprocal obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
in children to return them
dutifull respect, observance, and
requital; the world could not
well subsist without children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
engaged to these duties: there
were no reason to exact, there
were no ground to expect, that
parents should cheerfully and
faithfully discharge their part,
upon other terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:66525:89"/>
To this Precept there is added
a Promise (and it is, as S. <hi>Paul</hi>
observeth,<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 2.</note> the <hi>first precept, that
hath a promise</hi> formally annexed;
whereby he enforceth his exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to the observance thereof.)</p>
               <q>That thy days may be
long upon the land,
which the Lord thy
God giveth thee.</q>
               <p>So God expresly promiseth to
bless dutifull children with a long
life in the comfortable possession
of those good things,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> which he
should bestow upon them; this
was the most of reward, expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly
covenanted to the <hi>Jews,</hi> in
regard to their obedience: there
is also implyed a commination of
a contrary curse from God upon
the infringers of this Law, that
they should either be immaturely
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:66525:89"/>
cut off from life (as <hi>Abimelech</hi>
and <hi>Absalom</hi> were upon this score)
or should draw on a wretched life
in banishment from the contents
thereof; by which things respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
are intimated to us the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of piety in this kind, or
the punishments of impiety in the
future state, whereof the land
here mentioned was a shadow,
or figure: what length of days
in <hi>Canaan</hi> was to them, that to
us is immortal life in heaven;
what being excluded thence was
then, that now is everlasting death,
or banishment into the regions of
misery.</p>
               <p>I might also note the congrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the reward propounded, that
they who are gratefull to those
from whom, in subordination to
God, they received life, shall by
God's dispensation enjoy that life
long and well; and that they
who neglect the authours of their
life, shall soon be deprived of it,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:66525:90"/>
or of its comforts.<note place="margin">Deut. 16. 20.</note> But I find
the same reward assigned to the
diligent observers of other duties;
particularly to them,<note place="margin">Psal. 37. 29.</note> who are

unto this Commandment the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
we have to honour all

to lawfull Magistrates, as

in a lawfull course of justice, to

forbidden Sovereigns (in case of
necessity, and when amicable
means will not prevail) to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the safety or welfare of the
Societies entrusted to their care,
even by armed violence, against
such as wrongfully invade them,
or any wise harm them, and will

the Souldier in a just cause being

have imparted to every man a
right to defend his life, with its
necessary supports, against unjust,
extreme, and inevitable violence
upon it, or them: the slaughter
therefore, which may happen in

to the intent of this Law,
<hi>kill;</hi> but rather God himself, the

kill; the authority of killing so
being derived from him, and his
work being done thereby: <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
is his,</hi> and <hi>he</hi> so (by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments)
<hi>repays it.</hi> But here
is forbidden all other voluntary
taking away our neighbour's life,
when a man acts as a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
without just and necessary
cause, in any illegal or irregular
way; upon what motive, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
or end soever (whether it
be out of hatred, spight, envy,

either by direct violence,
or by fraudulent contrivance; in
an open, or clandestine manner;
immediately by our selves, or by
means of others; by advising,
encouraging, any wise becoming
instrumental, or accessory thereto.</p>
               <p>This is the crime expresly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited;
but a positive duty
should also be understood; that
we are obliged, so far as we are
able, to preserve our neighbour's
life; by relieving him in extreme
need, by succouring him in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
danger; by admonishing
him of any destructive mischief,
when he appears tending una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares
thereinto; the neglect of
which things argueth a murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
disposition toward our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
is in reasonable esteem, and
in God's sight a killing of him;
for we mistake, if we think with
<hi>Cain,</hi> that we are not our <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:66525:93"/>
keepers,</hi> or are not bound
when we are able to preserve his
life.</p>
               <p>The violation of which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
is certainly the most
heinous sin, that can be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of all those<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are not
immediately directed against God
himself, or the persons which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
represent him; and a sin
which never can escape vengeance
and due punishment from him.
It is the greatest wrong to God;
it is the extremest injury to our
neighbour; it is the highest sort
of uncharitableness; it is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
offence against publick society.</p>
               <p>1. It is an exceeding wrong and
affront done unto God; in assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the disposal of his gifts; in
dispossessing him of his rights, by
robbing him of a creature, of his
child, his servant, his subject (one
whose life is precious to him, and
toward whom he beareth a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:66525:94"/>
regard) an usurping in a
high way his Sovereign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
his Throne of Majesty, his
Tribunal of Justice, his Sword
of Vengeance; to omit the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
(as <hi>Philo</hi> speaks) committed
herein by violating God's own
Image, which every man doth
bear.</p>
               <p>2. It is also an extreme injury
to the person, who is thereby
deprived of an unvaluable good,
which can no wise be repaired,
or compensated: he that loses his
life, doth therewith lose all the
good he possesseth, or is capable
of here, without any possibility
of recovering it again: the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
therefore of life can be no
sutable revenge, no reasonable
satisfaction for any injury or da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
received; it infinitely, in
a manner, surpasseth all the evil,
which any man can sustain from
another in his estate, or fame, or
welfare of any kind; for those
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66525:94"/>
things have their measure, and
may be capable of some reparation,
but this is altogether extreme and
irreparable; and therefore doth
include greatest iniquity: add
hereto, that not onely all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
good is hereby at once ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
from a man, but the soul al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of the person may incur the
greatest damage or hazard in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to its future estate by being
thus snatched away: the slayer
not onely robbeth his brother of
his temporal life, but of his time
of repentance, and opportunity of
making peace with God.</p>
               <p>3. It is also the highest uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableness
to deal thus with our
neighbour; arguing that nothing
of good will, of pity, of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
toward him is left in us: to
hate his brother to the death is
the utmost pitch of hatred. If in
imitation of our Saviour, and out
of respect to him we ought (as
S. <hi>John</hi> instructeth us) to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:66525:95"/>
to lay down our lives for our
brethren; how enormous a crime,
how opposite to Christian charity
is it to take away our brother's
life?</p>
               <p>4. It is likewise a main offence
against the publick; not onely
by unlawfully bereaving it of a
member and subject, but to its
prejudice and dishonour (yea so
far as lies in us to its subversion
and dissolution) assuming to our
selves, pulling away from it its
rights, and prerogatives of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Such briefly is the direct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and importance of this Law;
but our Saviour in his comment
hereon hath explained and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it farther,<note place="margin">Matt. 5. 21.</note> so as to interdict
all, that any wise approaches in
nature, or in effect tends unto
this heinous evil: he means to
obstruct all the springs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate
all the roots thereof; such
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:66525:95"/>
as are rash, causeless, outragious,
inveterate anger, contumelious
and despightfull language, reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
grudges, or spight in our
heart, not endeavouring speedily
to reconcile our selves to them,
who have done us injury or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure;
for these things as they
commonly do produce the act of
murther, so they argue inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
thereto (which if fear and
self-respect did not restrain, would
produce it), and consequently in
moral accompt, which regardeth
not so much the act as the will,
are of the same quality therewith;
however they arise from the same
bitter root of great uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
upon which score S. <hi>John</hi>
telleth us,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 15, 17.</note> that <hi>He that hateth
his brother is a murtherer;</hi> and
consequently in effect all malice,
and spight, envy, hatred, malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
rancour, immoderate, and
pertinacious anger, and animosity
are here prohibited.</p>

God's people, to signify
mens entring into a new state or

apt and proper for his design,
our <hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi> who never
favoured needless innovations,
was pleased to assume and impose
upon the Disciples and followers
of his Religion, accommodating
it to those holy purposes, which
we shall now endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
               <p>What the action it self enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

all things which I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
you.</p>
               <p>The Action is baptizing, or
immersing in water; the Object
thereof, those Persons of any
Nation, whom his Ministers can
by their instruction and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
render Disciples, that is,
such as do sincerely believe the
truth of his Doctrine, and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
resolve to obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.

relation unto the Persons of
the Blessed Trinity, as the chief
Objects of the Faith professed,

               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:66525:111"/>
Such is the Action it self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be; the mystery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
consists in its being a notable
sign to represent, and an authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Seal to ratify the collation
then made of certain great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
to us; and our undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
correspondent duties toward
God.</p>
               <p>The Benefits which God then
signifies, and (upon due terms)
engageth to confer on us, are
these:</p>
               <p>1. The purgation or absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of us from the guilt of past
offences, by a free and full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of them, (the which
washing by Water, cleansing
from all stains, doth most appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely
represent) and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
God's being reconciled
unto us, his receiving us into a
state of grace and favour, his
freely justifying us, (that is,
looking upon us, or treating us
as just and innocent Persons, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:66525:112"/>
before we stood guilty of
heinous sins, and thereupon lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to grievous punishments)
that these benefits are conferred
in Baptism, many places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
plainly shew; [and the
Primitive Church, with most firm
and unanimous consent, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Just. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. 2. Tertul. de Bapt. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>.] And now (said <hi>Ananias</hi>
to S. <hi>Paul) Why dost thou tarry?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 22. 16.</note>
                  <hi>Arise and be baptized, and wash

(saith S. <hi>Peter,</hi> preaching to the
<hi>Jews) and let every one of you be
baptized for the remission of sins.</hi>
And,<note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ</hi> (saith S. <hi>Paul</hi> again
to the <hi>Ephesians) loved his Church,
and delivered himself for it, that
he might sanctify it, purging it by
the washing of water,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
(that is, he effectually in Baptism
consigned to the members of his
Church, that mercy and remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of sins, which he purchased
and merited by his passion). And
again,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Such</hi> (saith he to the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:66525:112"/>
                  <hi>Corinthians) were some of you,</hi>
(that is, ye were persons guilty
of heinous sins) <hi>but ye have been
washed, ye have been sanctifyed, ye
have been justified in the name of
our Lord, and by the spirit of our
God;</hi> where, having been wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Christ's name, doth (in
congruity with what is said in
other places) denote Baptism in
his name; being sanctified and
justified, do express the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
accompanying that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.
And indeed, where-ever
a general remission of sins, or a
full sanctification, or consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and justification, or consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and justification of mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in God's sight, are menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned;
that remission of sins, that
separation, or dedication unto
God's Service, that reception in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Grace, which are consigned
in Baptism, are (I conceive) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood;
there being no other
season or occasion, wherein or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
and visibly God doth
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:66525:113"/>
exhibit those Benefits.</p>
               <p>It may be demanded,<note place="margin">Quid festinat innocens aetas ad remissionem peccatorum? <hi>Tertull.</hi>
                  </note> How
Children, by reason <hi>of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
age,</hi> are capable of these
Benefits; how they can be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
who never had offended,
how they can be justified, who
never were capable of being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just?
I briefly answer, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they come from that race,
which by sin had forfeited God's
favour, and had alienated it self
from him; because also they have
in them those seeds of pravity
from which afterward certainly,
life continuing, (without God's
restraining Grace) will sprout
forth innumerable evil actions;<note place="margin">—impletur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud nos spiritu sancto puero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum innocens aetas, &amp;c. <hi>Cypr.</hi> Ep. 10.</note>
therefore that God overlooking
all the defects of their nature,
both relative, and absolute, or
personal, doth assume them into
his special favour, is no small be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
to them, answerable to the
remission of actual sin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
from the state con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:66525:113"/>
thereon in others.</p>
               <p>2. In Baptism, the Gift of
God's Holy Spirit is conferred,
qualifying us for the state into
which we then come, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
us to perform the duties
we then undertake, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
we should be unable to
perform; for purification of our
hearts from vitious inclinations,
and desires; for begetting holy
dispositions, and affections in our
Souls; for to guide and instruct
us, to sustain and strengthen us,
to encourage and comfort us in
all the course of Christian piety:
The which effects are well also
figured by water, which purifieth
things both from inherent and
adherent filth. That this benefit
is annexed to Baptism, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
also teacheth us:<note place="margin">Acts 2. 38.</note> 
                  <hi>Be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi>

of the Holy Ghost:</hi> And it is
represented as an advantage of

                  <hi>but with the Holy Ghost, and
Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some preventing operations
of the Holy Ghost (whereby
God freely draweth Men to
Christianity, persuading their
minds to assent thereto, inspiring
their hearts with resolutions to
comply with it) do precede Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism;
but a more full communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
thereof (due by compact,
assured by promise) for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming,
and maintaining us in
the firm belief, and constant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Christianity, is conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
thereon;<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>After ye had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:66525:114"/>
ye were sealed by the Holy
Spirit of promise,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul:</hi>
To signify which benefit then
conferr'd, the ancient Christians
did to Baptism annex the Chrism,
or holy Unction, signifying the
collation of that healing and
chearing Spirit to the baptized
person; that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> may
seem to respect, when he saith,
<hi>He that establisheth</hi> (or confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
<hi>us with you into Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>and

who also hath sealed us, and hath
given us the earnest of the Spirit
in our hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. With those gifts is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
the benefit of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
implying our entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a new state and course of life;
being endowed with new facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
dispositions, and capacities
of Souls, becoming new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17.</note>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:66525:115"/>
our being sanctified in our hearts
and lives; being mortified to
fleshly lusts, and worldly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
being quickned to a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
life, and heavenly conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
in short, becoming in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and in disposition of mind,
the children of God. This the
matter, and the action of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
doth set out; for as children
new born, (for cleansing them
from impurities adherent from
the Womb) both among the
<hi>Jews</hi> and other people,<note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 4.</note> were
wont to be washed;<note place="margin">—<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Theocr.</note> so are we in
Baptism, signifying our purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from natural and worldly
defilements: The mersion also in
Water, and the emersion thence,
doth figure our death to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and receiving to a new life.
Whence Baptism is by S. <hi>Paul</hi>
called <hi>the laver of Regeneration;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 3. 5.</note>
and our <hi>Lord</hi> saith,<note place="margin">John 3. 5.</note> that, <hi>If a
man be not born again of Water
and the Spirit, he cannot enter into
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:66525:115"/>
the Kingdom of God;</hi> that is,
every one becoming a Christian,
is by Baptism regenerated, or put
into a new state of Life, getteth
new dispositions of Soul, and
new relations to God.<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye are
all</hi> (saith S. <hi>Paul) the children
of God by faith in Christ Jesus;</hi>
that is, by embracing his Doctrine,
and submitting to his Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly

                  <hi>We</hi>
(saith S. <hi>Paul</hi> again) <hi>are buried

death; that as Christ was raised
from the dead by the glory of the
Father, so also we should walk in
newness of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. With these Benefits is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
that of being inserted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God's Church, his family, the
number of his chosen people,
the mystical body of Christ,
whereby we become entitled to
the privileges and immunities of
that heavenly Corporation.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>We</hi>
(saith S. <hi>Paul) have been all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:66525:116"/>
in one spirit into one body,</hi>
the mystical body of Christ:
And,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>so many of you</hi> (saith he
again) <hi>as have been baptized into
Christ,</hi> (into Christ mystical, or
the Church) <hi>have put on Christ,
and ye are</hi> (adds he) <hi>all one in
Christ Jesus.</hi> As Proselytes among
the <hi>Jews</hi> by Baptism were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto the Communion,
and privileges of the <hi>Jewish;</hi> so
thereby are we received into the
like Communion and privileges
of the <hi>Christian,</hi> far more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
Society.</p>
               <p>5. In consequence of these
things, there is with Baptism
conferred a capacity of, a title
unto, an assurance (under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of persevering in faith
and obedience to our Lord) of
eternal life and salvation. We
are therein, in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s words,

Faith, and Baptism implyeth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of the conditions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
undertaken; which next is to
be considered.</p>
               <p>For as this Holy Rite signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and sealeth God's collation
of so many great benefits on us;
so it also implyeth, and on our
part ratifieth our Obligation,
then in an especial manner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing,
to several most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
duties toward him. It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth,
that we are in mind fully
persuaded concerning the truth
of that Doctrine, which God
the Father revealed by his blessed
Son, and confirmed by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
operation of the Holy
Ghost; we therein profess our
humble and thankful embracing
the overtures of Mercy and
Grace, purchased for us by our
Saviour's meritorious undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and performances, the which
are then exhibited and tendred
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:66525:117"/>
to us; we therein declare our
hearty resolution to forsake all
wicked courses of life, repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the Doctrine and Law
of Christ; fully to conform our
lives to his Will, living thereafter
in all piety, righteousness, and
sobriety, as loyal Subjects, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Servants, and dutiful Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to God; in brief, we
therein are bound, renouncing
all erroneous principles, all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
inclinations, and all other
engagements whatever, entirely
to devote our selves to the Faith
and Obedience of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
our glorious and good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker;
of God the Son our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Redeemer; of God the
Holy Ghost our blessed Guide,
Assistant, Advocate, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter:
These are the duties an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
unto, and concomitant
of our Baptism (immediately
and formally required of those,
who are capable of performing
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:66525:118"/>
them, mediately and virtually of
them who are not) the which are
signified by our being baptized in
the Name of the Holy Trinity.</p>
               <p>These duties the Scripture
commonly expresseth by the
Word, Faith and Repentance;
sometimes singly, sometimes
conjunctly:<note place="margin">Acts 8. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>If</hi> (said <hi>Philip</hi> to
the <hi>Eunuch) thou believest with

be baptized); Faith was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensible
condition prerequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
thereto; and, <hi>Repent</hi> (saith
S. <hi>Peter) and let every of you be
baptized;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 2. 38.</note> Repentance also was
necessary to precede it; indeed
both these (as they are meant
in this case) do in effect signify
the same; each importeth a
being renewed in Mind, in
Judgment, in Will, in Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
a serious embracing of
Christ's Doctrine, and a stedfast
resolution to adhere thereto in
practice. Hence are those ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,

or consequences attributed
to Faith;<note place="margin">Acts 26. 14. 5. 31. &amp; 20. 21. &amp; 26. 20. &amp; 3. 19. &amp; 17. 30.</note> justifying us, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling

we may be capable of these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits

which must accompany our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance

                  </note>
This is <hi>that</hi> death to sin, and
resurrection to righteousness, <hi>that</hi>
being buried with Christ, and
rising again with him, so as to
walk in newness of life, which
the baptismal action signifies, and
which we then really undertake
to perform.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:66525:119"/>
And as such are the duties
preceding or accompanying
Baptism; so making good the
engagements they contain, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
persisting in them, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
and improving them, are
duties necessarily consequent
thereupon.<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 23.</note>

                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>let us hold fast
the profession of our faith without
wavering.</hi> We should indeed
continually remember, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and seriously consider, what in
so solemn a manner we (upon so
valuable considerations) did then
undertake, promise, and vow
to God, diligently striving to
perform it; for violating our
part of the Covenant, and sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation
then made, by apostacy
in profession or practice from
God and goodness, we certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
must forfeit those inestimable
benefits, which God otherwise
hath tied himself to bestow;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:66525:119"/>
the pardon of our sins, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God, the being mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ, the grace, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
assistance, and comfort
of the Holy Spirit; the right
unto, and hope of Salvation.
We so doing, shall not only
simply disobey, and offend God;
but add the highest breach of
fidelity to our disobedience, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the most heinous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
abusing the greatest
grace that could be vouchsafed
us:<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>If we wilfully sin, after we
have taken the acknowledgment of

trample under foot the Son of God;
we profane the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
we do despite unto the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

and in order to their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> slavery,
a most signal one, was the smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the first-born in every house
of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and passing
over the houses of the Children
of <hi>Israel;</hi> wherein God declared
his just wrath against their cruel
Oppressors, depriving them in a
sudden and dreadful manner of
what was nearest and dearest
to them; and his gracious mercy
toward them, in preserving what
was alike dear to them from so
woful a calamity; <hi>thus</hi> (as the
Text expresseth it) putting a
difference between the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
and the Children of <hi>Israel.</hi> Now
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:66525:120"/>
that the memory of so remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a Mercy might be preserved,
that their affections might be
raised to a strong sense of God's
goodness, and their Faith in them
confirmed, so as in the like need
to hope for the same favourable
help and protection, by the
consideration of so notable an
experiment, it pleased God to
appoint a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> or mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Rite to be annually celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
representing and recalling
to mind, that Act of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his special kindness was so
eminently demonstrated toward
his People: The same also (as did
other Rites and Sacrifices, institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by God among that people)
looking directly forward upon
that other great delivery from
Sin and Hell, which God in
mercy designed toward man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
to be atchieved by our
Saviour; prefiguring, that the
Souls of them who should be
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:66525:121"/>
willing to forsake the spiritual
bondage of sin, should be saved
from the ruin coming upon them
who would abide therein; God
regarding the blood of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
(that immaculate Lamb,<note place="margin">Exod. 12. 23.</note>
sacrificed for them) sprinkled
upon the doors of their houses,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 22.</note>
that is,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 2.</note> by hearty Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
applyed to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.
The occasion of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating
which Holy Rite, our
Saviour we see did improve to
the institution of this Sacrament,
most agreeing therewith in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
as representative and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorative
of the greatest bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and mercy that we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of having vouchsafed to
us; some part of that ancient
Rite, or Sacrifice (which was
most suitable to the special pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
of this Institution, and most
conformable to the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
whereby all bloody Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices

               <p>The Action it self (or rather

done at the first institution and

<hi>And having sung a Hymn, they
went to the Mount of Olives:</hi>
Which action was indeed in it
self proper to conclude the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of this holy Rite, yet what
reference it hath thereto, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
thence be determined; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
with these the Church hath
always joined several acts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
(Confessions, Prayers,
Praises, Thanksgivings, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions,
Vows) suitable to the
nature and design of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
apt to glorify God, and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:66525:122"/>
edify the Faithful in the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof.</p>
               <p>Such is the practice it self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
and injoined by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
the mysterious impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
thereof, as we find it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
in Holy Scripture, (the
only solid and sure ground,
upon which we can build the
explication of supernatural My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries)
consisteth chiefly in these
particulars:</p>
               <p>1. It was intended for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorative
representation of
our Saviour's Passion for us;
fit to mind us of it, to move us
to consider it, to beget affections
in us, suitable to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and consideration thereof:
<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:66525:123"/>
of mind and heart upon
those grievous pains, which I
shall have endured for your
sake, to procure for you a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sins, and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to God:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 26.</note> And, <hi>So often</hi>
(saith S. <hi>Paul) as you eat this
Bread, and drink this Cup,

significantly express) <hi>the death
of our Lord till he come,</hi> or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his absence from us. The
suffering of our Saviour (the
most wonderful act of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Charity, that ever was
performed in the World, which
produced effects of highest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
to our benefit, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
whereof is apt to
work the best dispositions of
piety in us) should very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
be present to our
thoughts and affections; and
that it may be so with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
such a solemn and sensible
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:66525:123"/>
representation thereof is very
conducible; wherein we behold
him crucified, as it were <hi>in
effigie,</hi> his Body broken, his
Blood poured out for us; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a sort a putting us into the
circumstances of those, who did
behold our Saviour for us hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Cross. Our Lord
being absent in Body from us,
(sitting in Heaven at God's
right hand) to supply that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
that we should not be apt
to forget him, and thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
wholly estranged from
him, is pleased to order this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of being present, and
conversing with us, in such a
manner, as may retain in our
memories his gracious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
for us; may impress in
our hearts a kindly sense of
them; may raise us up in mind
and affection to him.</p>

2. The Benefits consequent
upon our Saviour's Passion,
rightly apprehended, heartily
believed, seriously considered
by us, are hereby lively repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
and effectually convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
to the sustenance and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
of our spiritual Life, to
the refreshment and comfort of
our Souls. It is a holy Feast, a
spiritual Repast, a divine Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
to which God in kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
invites us; to which if we
come with well-disposed minds,
he there feeds us with most holy
and delicious Viands, with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Manna, with most reviving
and cherishing Liquor. Bread
is the staff of Life, the most
common, most necessary, and
most wholsome, and most savo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Meat; Wine is the most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
and wholsome also, the most
sprightly and cordial Drink; by
them therefore our Lord chose
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:66525:124"/>
to represent that Body and
Blood, by the Oblation of
which a capacity of life and
health was procured to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
the taking in which by
right apprehension, tasting it by
hearty Faith, digesting it by
careful attention and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
converting it into our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
by devout, grateful, and
holy affections, joined with seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and steady resolutions of
living answerable thereto, will
certainly support and maintain
our spiritual Life in a vigorous
Health, and happy growth of
Grace; refreshing our hearts
with comfort and satisfaction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable;<note place="margin">Joh 6. 51, 47. &amp; 5. 36.</note>

as himself declares and promises:
which Benefits therefore in the
due performance of this holy
Duty, are conveyed unto us.</p>
               <p>3. This Sacrament declares
that Union, which good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
partaking thereof have
with Christ; their mystical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
into him, by a close de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
upon him for spiritual
Life,<note place="margin">Joh. 15. 4.</note> Mercy, Grace, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
a constant adherence to
him by Faith and Obedience, a
near conformity to him in Mind
and Affection; an inseparable
conjunction with him, by the
strictest bands of fidelity, and
by the most endearing Relations:
Which things could not more
fitly be set out, than by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
our best and most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Food; which being taken in,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:66525:125"/>
soon becomes united to us, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similated
and converted into our
substance; thereby renewing
our strength, and repairing the
decays of our nature: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">John 6. 56.</note>
                  <hi>He</hi> (saith our <hi>Saviour)

(saith S. <hi>Paul) which we bless,
is it not the Communion of the
Blood of Christ? the Bread which

of the Body of Christ?</hi> We in the
outward Action, partake of the

(according to the manner
insinuated) intimately united to
him.</p>

is signified and sealed
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:66525:126"/>
that Union, which is among our
Saviour's true Disciples commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
therein; their being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
united in consent of mind,
and unity of Faith; in mutual
good will and affection, in hope
and tendency to the same blessed

and Society; especially upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

               </p>
               <p>In the representing, produce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and promoting these things,
we are taught the Mystery of
this Sacrament doth consist; It
was designed as a proper and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:66525:126"/>
efficacious Instrument, to raise
in us pious Affections toward
our good God, and gracious
Redeemer; to dispose us to all
holy practice; to confirm our
Faith, to nourish our Hope, to
quicken our Resolutions of
walking carefully in the ways of
Duty; to unite us more fastly
to our Saviour, and to combine
us in Charity one toward ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the accomplishing of which
Intents thereof, doth suppose our
faithful and diligent concurrence
in the use thereof; whence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
many Duties incumbent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us in respect thereto, some
antecedent, some concomitant,
some consequent to the use there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>1. Before we address our
selves to the partaking of this
venerable Mystery, we should
consider whither we are going,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:66525:127"/>
what is the nature and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the Action we set our
selves about; that we are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
<hi>to our Lord's Table,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 21.</note>
(so S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it) to come
into his more especial presence,
to be entertained by him with
the dearest welcome, and the
best chear that can be; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the fullest testimonies of
his Mercy, and the surest pledges
of his favour toward us; that
we are going to behold our
Lord in tenderest love, offering
up himself a Sacrifice to God,
therein undergoing the sorest
pains, and foulest disgraces for
our Good and Salvation; that
we ought therefore to bring with
us dispositions of Soul, suitable
to such an access unto, such an
entercourse with our gracious
Lord. Had we the honour and
favour to be invited to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of a great Prince, what
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:66525:127"/>
especial care should we have to
dress our Bodies in a clean and
decent garb, to compose our
minds in order to expression of
all due respect to him; to bring
nothing about us noisome or
ugly, that might offend his sight,
or displease his mind? The like
surely, and greater care we
should apply, when we thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
called, do go into God's
Presence and Communion. We
should, in preparation thereto,
with all our power, endeavour
to cleanse our Souls from all
impurity of thought and desire;
from all iniquity and perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
from all malice, envy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
anger, and all such evil
dispositions, which are most of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
to God's all-piercing
sight, and unbeseeming his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Presence; we should dress
our Souls with all those comely
Ornaments of Grace (with
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:66525:128"/>
purity, humility, meekness, and
charity) which will render us
acceptable and well-pleasing to
him: We should compose our
minds into a frame of reverence
and awful regard to the Majesty
of God, into a lowly, calm,
and tender disposition of heart,
apt to express all respect due to
his Presence, fit to admit the
gracious illapses of his Holy
Spirit; very susceptive of all
Holy and Heavenly Affections,
which are sutable to such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
or may spring from it.
We should therefore remove
and abandon from us, not only
all vitious Inclinations, and evil
purposes; but even all worldly
cares, desires, and passions,
which may distract, or discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
us, that may dull or deject
us, that may cause us to behave
our selves indecently or unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
before God, that may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:66525:128"/>
us of the excellent Fruits
from so blessed an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>To these purposes we should,
according to S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s advice,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 28.</note> examine and
approve our selves; considering
our past Actions, and our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Inclinations, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by serious meditation, and
fervent prayer to God for his
gracious assistance therein, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Souls into a hearty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse
for our past miscarriages,
and a sincere resolution to amend
for the future; forsaking all sin,
endeavouring in all our actions
to serve and please God;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out</hi> (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> again injoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us) <hi>the old leaven of vice and
wickedness;</hi> so that we may feast,
and celebrate this Passeover, in
which Christ is mystically sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
for us, in the <hi>unleavened</hi>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:66525:129"/>
dispositions <hi>of sincerity and
truth.</hi> Such are the duties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to our partaking this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
               <p>2. Those Duties which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
it, are a reverent
and devout affection of heart,
with a suitable behaviour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
an awful sense of mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting
the Majesty of that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
wherein we do appear,
answerable to the greatness, and
goodness, and holiness of him,
with whom we converse; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the sacredness of those
Mysteries, which are exhibited
to us, (that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 29.</note>
to <hi>discern</hi> or distinguish <hi>our
Lord's Body;</hi> that is, yielding a
peculiar reverence of mind and
behaviour in regard thereto) a
devotion of heart, consisting in
hearty contrition for our sins,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:66525:129"/>
which did expose our Saviour
to the enduring such pains, then
remembred; in firm resolution
to forsake the like thereafter, as
injurious, dishonourable, and
displeasing to him; in fervent
love of him, as full of so won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
goodness and charity
toward us; in most hearty
thankfulness for those uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivably
great expressions of
kindness toward us; in deepest
humility, upon sense of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness,
to receive such te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
of grace and favour
from him, (our unworthiness <hi>to
eat the Crumbs that fall from his
Table,</hi> how much more to be
admitted into such degrees of
honourable Communion, and
familiarity, of close conjunction
and union with him?) of pious
joy in consideration of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
privileges herein impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and of the blessed Fruits
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:66525:130"/>
accruing to us from his gracious
performances; in a comfortable
hope of obtaining and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the benefits of his obedience
and passion, by the assistance of
his Grace; in steady Faith, and
full persuasion of mind, that he
is (supposing our dutiful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance)
ready to bestow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us all the blessings then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited;
in attentively fixing
the eyes of our Mind, and all
the powers of our Soul (our
Understanding, Will, Memory,
Fancy, Affection) upon him,
as willingly pouring forth his
Life for our Salvation; lastly,
in motions of enlarged good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
and charity toward all our
Brethren for his sake, in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to his Will, and in imitation
of him; such-like Duties should
attend our participation of this
holy Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:66525:130"/>
3. The effects of having du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
performed which, should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the practice of those
Duties, which are consequent
thereon; being such as these;
An increase of all pious inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and affections, expressing
themselves in a real amendment
of our lives, and producing
more goodly fruits of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
the thorough digestion of
that spiritual nourishment by
our becoming more fastly knit
to our Saviour by higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Faith and Love; the
maintaining a more lively sense
of his superabundant goodness;
the cherishing those influences
of Grace, which descend upon
our hearts in this Communion,
and improving them to nearer
degrees of perfection in all piety
and vertue; a watchful care,
and endeavour in our lives to
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:66525:131"/>
approve our selves in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
worthy of that great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and favour, which God
hath vouchsafed us in admitting
us to so near approaches to
himself; an earnest pursuance
of the Resolutions, performance
of the Vows, making good the
Engagements, which in so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
a manner, upon so great
an occasion we made, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
up unto our God and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
finally, the considering,
that by the breach of such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions,
by the violation of
such Engagements, our sins re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
so mighty aggravation
of vain inconstancy and wicked
perfidiousness, our guilt will
hugely be increased; our Souls
relapsing into so grievous distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
our spiritual strength will
be exceedingly impaired; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
hence our true Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
will be abated, our best
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:66525:131"/>
hopes will be shaken; our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
state will be desperately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered.</p>
               <p>There is one Duty which I
should not forbear to touch,
concerning this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> that
is, Our gladly embracing any
opportunity presented of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
therein; the doing
so, being not only our Duty,
but a great aid and instrument
of Piety; the neglecting it a
grievous sin, and productive of
great mischiefs to us.</p>
               <p>The Primitive Christians did
very frequently use it, partaking
therein, as it seems at every
time of their meeting for God's
Service; it is said of them, by
S. <hi>Luke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 2. 42.</note> that <hi>They continued sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly
in the Apostles Doctrine,
and Communion, and in breaking
of Bread, and in Prayers;</hi> and,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:66525:132"/>
                  <hi>when you meet together, it is not</hi> (as
according to the intent and duty
of meeting it should be) <hi>to eat the
Lord's Supper,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 20.</note> saith S. <hi>Paul:</hi> And
<hi>Just. Martyr</hi> in his second <hi>Apologie,</hi>
describing the religious Service of
God in their Assemblies, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it as a constant part thereof;
and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> reporteth it as a
Custom in the Church, derived
from Apostolical Institution, to
celebrate the <hi>Eucharist</hi> thrice
every week, that is, so often as
they did meet to pray and
praise God; which practice may
well be conceived, a great means
of kindling and preserving in
them that holy fervour of Piety,
which they so illustriously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in their Conversation,
and in their gladsome suffering
for Christ's sake: and the remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of that frequency, as it is
certainly a sign and an effect, so
in part it may possibly be
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:66525:132"/>
reckoned a cause of the dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy
of <hi>Christian</hi> Practice, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that great coldness and slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which afterward did seize
upon it, and now doth appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
keep it in a languishing
and half-dying state.</p>
               <p>The rarer occasions therefore
we now have of performing this
Duty, (the which indeed was
always esteemed the principal
Office of God's Service) of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
this Benefit, (the being
deprived whereof, was also
deemed the greatest punishment
and infelicity that could arrive
to a Christian) the more ready
we should be to embrace them.
If we dread God's Displeasure,
if we value our Lord and his
Benefits, if we tender the life,
health, and welfare of our Souls,
we shall not neglect it; for how
can we but extreamly offend
God by so extream rudeness,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:66525:133"/>
that when he kindly invites us
to his Table, we are averse from
coming thither, or utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
it? That when he calleth us
into his Presence, we run from
him; that when he, with his
own hand, offereth us inestimable
Mercies and Blessings, we reject
them? It is not only the breach
of God's Command, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
us <hi>to do this,</hi> but a direct
contempt of his Favour and
Goodness, most clearly and
largely exhibited in this Office.
And how can we bear any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to our Lord, or be any
wise sensible of his gracious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
in our behalf, if we
are unwilling to join in thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and joyful commemoration
of them? How little do we love
our own Souls, if we suffer
them to pine and starve for
want of that Food, which God
here dispenseth for its Sustenance
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:66525:133"/>
and Comfort; if we bereave
them of enjoying so high a
Privilege, so inestimable a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
so incomparable Pleasures as
are to be found and felt in this
Service, or do spring and flow
from it? What reasonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
can we frame for such
neglect? are we otherwise em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed?
What Business can there
be more important, than serving
God, and saying our own
Souls? Is it wisdom, in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of any the greatest Affair
here, to disregard the principal
Concern of our Souls? Do we
think our selves unfit and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to appear in God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence?
But is any man unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to obey God's Commands?
Is any Man unfit to implore and
partake of God's Mercy, if he
be not unwilling to do it?
What unworthiness should hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
us from remembring our
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:66525:134"/>
Lord's excessive Charity towards
us, and thanking him for it?
from praying for his Grace;
from resolving to amend our
lives? Must we, because we
are unworthy, continue so still,
by shunning the means of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
and curing us? Must we
encrease our unworthiness, by
transgressing our Duty? If we
esteem things well, the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of our sinfulness should
rather drive us to it, as to our
Medicine, than detain us from
it. There is no man indeed,
who must not conceive and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
himself unworthy; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must no man come thither
at God's Call? If we have a
sense of our sins, and a mind
to leave them; if we have a
sense of God's goodness, and a
heart to thank him for it; we
are so worthy, that we shall be
kindly received there, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:66525:134"/>
rewarded. If we will
not take a little care to work
these dispositions in us, we are
indeed unworthy; but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so, from our own perverse
negligence, is a bad excuse for
the neglect of our Duty. In
fine, I dare say, that he, who
with an honest meaning (altho
with an imperfect devotion)
doth address himself to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of this Duty, is far
more excusable, than he that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whatever score declineth it;
no scrupulous shiness can ward
us from blame; what then shall
we say, if supine sloth, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
contempt, are the causes
of such neglect?</p>

the Considerations that offered
themselves upon these Subjects, I
shall conclude all with Prayer to
