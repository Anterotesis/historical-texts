            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II. The Young Mans Case, and Concernments as they now lie before him, stated and offered to his consideration.</head>
                     <p>YOu have more particularly two great <hi>Concerns</hi> lying now upon your hand which had need both of them be seriously thought upon, and duly provided for before you slip any longer time. The one is the wise or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and improvement of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent life; which is commonly spoyled in youth, and scarce ever recovered in riper years. The other the religious providing for a better, which no man can be too diligent in. He that is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faithful in either, will be in some measure conscionable in both. These hath God joyned together; and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is that man who hath learnt to give each its due, and through a well
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40684:19"/>
led life with men on earth, to pass to a better with God himself hereafter in heaven.</p>
                     <p>It will be your wisdome to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand aright the good consistency of both these together. That so you may neither on the one hand think hardly of religion, as that which quencheth the subordinate sweetness of life; as that which overthrows what were otherwaies lovely in nature: Nor yet on the other hand content your selves with bare nature, without the true grace of God; which is ten thousand times more worth, and better indeed than life it self. Be ye in Gods name frugal of all the just comforts of this life, slight them not, waste them not, they are the dear gifts of God, the God of all our mercies, the portion that is given us outwardly under the Sun. But if the Lord be willing to sanctifie these, and bestow yet grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then them upon us; let us not neglect, let us not despise our own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages: but accept it with all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thankfulness, that our water may thus be turned into wine.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore that you may the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40684:20"/>
more understandingly comport with these great <hi>Concerns,</hi> and the better see what lies before you; it will be very necessary for you (what you can) solidly to inform and satisfie your selves very particularly in these three things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The world into which you are now come, and for a time to live; what that is.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The great ends for which you are thus set on shore, and now sent hither; what they are.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The true way and means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by these righteous and desirable ends might be at length happily attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                     <p>He that once understands where he is, what he hath indeed to do, and how he may fairly and safely compass his work, needs not stand idle in the Market-place, he hath enough to take up both his hands, and heart withall. God grant that you may go ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously into your Lords Vineyard,<note place="margin">1 The world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which we are come, what that is.</note> and willingly work the work for which you were sent into the world.</p>
                     <p>First, Then be contented to sit down, and consider what kind of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40684:20"/>
world this is into which you are now come. It may availe you in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of your life to have throughly known it, ere you be further involved in it.</p>
                     <p>It is a world that too much encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers most: but solidly contenteth none. Our Stage indeed whereon to act: but not our Bed whereon to rest.

                     <p>This is that rich grace which the <hi>Prophets</hi> so long ago enquired after, and prophesied of. And this in the Lords name I humbly encourage and exhort you in.

                     <p>Oh! go humbly to the Lord, go by Prayer, go by Faith, go with a full purpose of heart, that if the Lord shall please to speak peace, you will no more return to folly. Prostrate your selves, spread your case before him, tell him, it is not Corn, or Wine, or Oyl that you come for: but the light of his Countenance. Tell him, oh tell him it is the pardon of your sins, and justification in the bloud of his Son,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40684:35"/>
that is to you the mercy of all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which you above all things stand in most need of; and that (if he would please to give you leave) this is all your desire and humble boldness; by the hand of faith to touch his gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Scepter, to take hold of his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercies in Christ, and live.</p>
                     <p>It may be he will say, as in the Gospel, <hi>Son! arise; Daughter! arise; be of good chear, thy sins are forgiven thee.</hi>

                     <p>I could even bitterly mourn, that this sacred mercy, this fundamental mercy is no more in all our thoughts. Men may weary themselves in wide discourses to find out wherein their chief happiness consists, and who is at length the happy man: But alas! the wise man needs not glory in his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the rich man may forbear boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his riches.

                     <p>It is burdensome to none by unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable visits, by idle interruptions, by wearisome detainments, by fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less discourses, by importunate or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becomming requests.
