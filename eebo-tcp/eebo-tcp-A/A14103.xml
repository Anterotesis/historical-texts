         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So that wilde flea≈øh is of no good Nutriment, neither in qualitie nor quantitie, ≈øauinge onely the flea≈øh of wilde Goates. For their naturall coldne≈ø≈øe is mutch repre≈ø≈øed by the ouermutch heate and drieth, wherto they do accu≈øtome them≈øelues. Wherfore, ≈øeinge al≈øo that the ta≈øt and vn≈øaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ≈ømell of their flea≈øh is corrected by their exerci≈øe: it is ≈øome helpe vnto dige≈øtion, that their flea≈øh may be very wel and ea≈øely concocted. Al other tame bea≈øts in compari≈øon to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wilde: are better to b√©e liked of, &amp; do more nouri≈øh, by rea≈øon of their quietnes, &amp; the temperate aire, yet are thei ≈øumdeale gro≈ø≈øe &amp; hard of dige≈øtion. And among the≈øe in my iudgment, the Male bea≈øt is hotter &amp; in different moi≈øt aboue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> female, and is therfore more commended and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ≈øooner dige≈øted. The flea≈øh of the female, is more colde with immoderate moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øture, and therfore ≈ølower of dige≈øtion. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flea≈øh of tho≈øe bea≈øts that are gelded is of a middle nature betw√©ene both.</p>

By Rea≈øon thus: Life con≈øi≈øteth in naturall heate, becau≈øe naturall heate is the beginninge of lyfe, wherfore that thinge which tempereth naturall heate, retayning it in the naturall temperature is more nece≈ø≈øary, but the Aire which by way of breathinge wee drawe in, is of ≈øutch ≈øort: wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But again≈øt the rea≈øon fir≈øt alleaged it may bee an≈øwered negatiuely, for lyfe con≈øi≈øteth in two points, the one is a beginning ≈øumwhat far of, as re≈øtoringe that which is lo≈øt, and the con≈øeruation of all the members and parts. In re≈øpect of which, the nouri≈øhing of natural heat
<pb facs="tcp:11781:38"/>
is mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øarie, whiche is immedyatly and principally maintained by the qualities of the Aire. And therefore Aier is more nece≈ø≈øary to the pre≈øeruacion of lyfe, for that it re≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth the life principally and immediatly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may be demaunded <hi>which of the two, Meate, or Drynke, is more nece≈ø≈øarie vnto life?</hi> To this may bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered that <hi>Meate</hi> is, although that <hi>Drinke</hi> bee commonly more de≈øired then Meate. The rea≈øon of the fir≈øt is, that that is more nece≈ø≈øary which re≈øtoreth the thinge whiche is lo≈øt, then that which ≈øerueth onely to conuey the iuce about al the body. But Meate is ordained to re≈øtore the parts, and Drink to cary the meate about the body: wherfore the conclu≈øion is manyfe≈øt. And that Drink is more gr√©edely de≈øiered: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon is, for that drink delayeth the vehemency of natural heat, in which re≈øpect it is more nece≈ø≈øary vnto lyfe then Meate, as is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Aier al≈øo. Thus <hi>Drinke</hi> hath two offices, fir≈øt it conueieth the Meate vnto all partes of the body, and ≈øo is Meate a thing more nece≈ø≈øary then drink. Secondly, it mitigateth the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heate, and pre≈øerueth it in the iu≈øt temperature, and is therby more nece≈ø≈øarie then meate. Wherfore any lyuinge creature can longer liue without meate, then drinke.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this que≈øtion may be demaunded: <hi>Wether euel Aier or euell Meate do more hurt the bodye?</hi> Whereunto it may be ab≈øolutely an≈øwered, that √©euell Aier hurteth more, for, that it is more noi≈øome vnto the hart, which is the fown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Naturall heat, and of the ≈øpirites.

For when Nature is ≈øtronge, ≈øhe is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue the other qualitie whiche is n√©ere≈øt vnto her, to wit in the ≈øame meate which is receiued, and when it is altered ≈øhe bringeth it vnto her owne qualitie, and ≈øo of √©euel meate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendereth good blood.

               <p>THis Chapter requireth now ≈øome ≈øpeciall treatice of Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, wherin the fir≈øt que≈øtion which offreth it ≈øelf mo≈øt fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be demaunded, is this:
<pb facs="tcp:11781:49"/>
                  <hi>which is the hoater of the yolke or the white?</hi> Amonge all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours blood is warme≈øt in temperate warmth, ≈øo that the yolke as cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ming neere≈øt vnto the blood, is ≈øurely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warmer. Moreouer, the Liuer is hoater then the brea≈øtes, and the blood warmer then the milke, and the yolke in the egge is in temperature vnto the white, as is the blood in the Liuer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>why doth the yolke beeing ca≈øt into water, ≈øinke downe to the bottom, and the white fleete on top?</hi> The white is very ≈ølimy, and cleaueth vnto that which is next vnto it, and by rea≈øon of the ≈ølimines ≈øwimmeth aboue the water, and the yolke bicau≈øe of the ≈øoundnes and want of pores, ≈øinketh downe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>why haue birdes fewer egges and bigger then the fishes, and they haue moe and ≈ømaller then birdes?</hi> The greatne≈ø≈øe in a thinge which is continuall,<note place="margin">Auicen.</note> is procured by a ≈øtrong heate: but a multitude in that which is diuided is long of the matter, bicau≈øe the matter is the beginning of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui≈øion. And bicau≈øe birdes haue more heat then fi≈øhes haue, therfore haue they great egges in continuall, and but few in diui≈øion, and contrariwi≈øe it fareth in fi≈øhes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>why haue birdes egges an hard shell, and fishes egges a ≈øoft?</hi> Fi≈øhes lay their egges in a moi≈øt place, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they n√©ede no hard ≈øhell. But birdes lay their egges in hard and ≈øound places, as vpon the ground, ≈øtones, trees, and ≈øuch like, and therfore haue n√©ede of an harde ≈øhell to keepe them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> hurt, vntil ≈øuch time as the chick or bird be hatched.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>why are birdes egges ≈øpeckled and of diuer≈øe coulers, and it is not ≈øo in fishes?</hi> In birdes ther is a ≈øtrong naturall heat which is able to ≈øeperate thinges of diuer≈øe natures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øunder, as the yolke from the white, and in fi≈øhes this heate is ≈øo weake that it is not able to worke the like effect.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, <hi>why are birdes egges long, and fishes egges round?</hi> Heat moueth from the centre, and e≈øpeciall cau≈øeth a forme like a piller, broad beneath and ≈øharpe aboue, as appeareth in flame of a fire which ri≈øeth vp into a ≈øharp poinct. Wherfore, heat b√©eing more abundant in birdes then in fi≈øhes, the birds
<pb facs="tcp:11781:49"/>
Egges are long, and fi≈øhes round, for the weake heat carieth the matier equally round.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, <hi>what breaketh the eggeshell when the chicke is hatched?</hi> There b√©e two cau≈øes hereof alledged, the one is, for that by long and continuall lyinge the ≈øhell waxeth ≈øofte and thin, as it is if an egge b√©e ≈øtieped nine daies in vineger: the ≈øecond is, for that when the young bird lacketh nutrimente, h√©e breaketh the ≈øhell to s√©eke meat.</p>
               <p>Eightly, <hi>why doth the yolke of an egge which is layd in the full of the moone, and in the light therof,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rha≈øis.</note> 
                  <hi>≈øcoure ≈øpottes out of cloth?</hi> The fatty drop in the middes of the egge b√©einge the meanes of the generation, conceiueth a pearcinge and a diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding heat both by the great light, and the moi≈øture which the Moone moueth, which it can not do at another time.</p>
               <p>Ninethly, <hi>why do ≈øome egges crack when they bee laid into the fire and ≈øome not?</hi> Such crack as haue within them win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines, which is perceiued when the ≈øhell reueth, to i≈ø≈øue forth with great noi≈øe and force. And this hapneth when the fire is great. For if a birds egge were ca≈øt into the middes of the fire, the ≈øhell would ≈øoone breake, &amp; the windines would ≈øtart forth with great noi≈øe and force, which it would not do if the fire were ≈ømall. But proportionably, there is mutch more windines in the egges of fi≈øhes, and therfore they make a great noy≈øe when they bee ca≈øt into the fire, as appeare for example in the rowe of an hearring.</p>

and ≈øuffocate them. Againe, they bee rauenous, and feede gr√©edely and eat downe their meat whole as it cummeth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>why doth the raine profit fishes, and hurt birdes?</hi> Sw√©ete water nouri≈øheth onely, and therwith are fi≈øhes nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhed beeing mingled with mud and clay. As for birdes they liue in the aier, and ≈ø√©eke their liuinge by flying about, and the feathers of their winges will clod and cleaue together with the rain, and ≈øo are hindred in their flying. Wherof it may b√©e gathered, that abundance of raine hurteth a≈øwell fi≈øhes as foules, for in ≈øuch times they fall into oppilations of the nutritiue partes, by rea≈øon of the ≈øw√©etenes of ≈øutch water. For ≈øw√©ete thinges, as ≈øaith <hi>Galen,</hi> do ≈øtop the parts nutritiue.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Why do the Roes of fishes crackle more in the fire then other thinges do?</hi> When the fire is ≈øo hot that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolueth more then it con≈øumeth then do they break in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fire, as it al≈øo appeareth by the example of the che≈øtnut: But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> it is ≈øo temperate that it con≈øumeth as much as it re≈øolueth, then do they neither r√©eue nor breake: b√©e≈øides that fi≈øhes egges or Roes do crackle by rea≈øon of windines included wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
