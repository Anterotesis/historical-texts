         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For as the ſame <hi>Macrobius</hi> writeth, our talke ought to be merie at the table, more poudred with pleaſure the ſauced with ſeueritie.

               <p>THE cauſe why our <hi>Digeſtion</hi> is many times corrupt is this: becauſe at one meale wée féede on ſundrie ſortes of Meates, eatinge the groſſe béefore the fine, and fillinge our ſelues with ſundry kinde of cates made with broathes thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with grated bread, and to to long protracting the tyme from the béeginning of the Meale to the ende. But for the better ordering of our diet, wée muſt note: that it is beſt in Winter to vſe meates actually hot, and in Summer actually colde. Howbeit we muſt beware of Meates ouer hot as they come out of the pot, or from the fire, and take héede of them that are verye colde, as ſutch as are cooled vpon the Snowe. <hi>Auicen</hi> in his <hi>Canticles</hi> ſaieth thus: that moyſt and ſlipperie meates are to bee eaten beefore ſutch as binde,<note place="margin">Auicen.</note> and that which is ſwéete muſt bée mingled with that which is ſower, and the dry corrected with the moyſt, and the colde with the hot.

Thoſe that are ſower do not heaten, but béeing waſhed in cold water, and eaten before meate, do as it were extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh heat. Sower grapes are colde, they binde the belly, and they repreſſe blood and red choler.</p>

Peares that are very ſwéet do not puffe vp, but they all binde the belly, vnleſſe they bee eaten after meat. For béeing eaten after meat they driue the ordure foorth, and then they ſtrengthen the ſtomacke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſaac</hi> alſo ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſweet Peares are temperate, and if they bee boyled with Muſſhroms they take away all theyr clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge, eſpecially if they be wilde Peares, by reaſon of theyr tartnes. <hi>Appels,</hi> after the iudgement of <hi>Iſaac:</hi>

               <p>The bitter <hi>Almondes,</hi> according to <hi>Iſaacks</hi> iudgment,<note place="margin">Iſaac.</note> are hot and dry in the end of the ſecond degrée, they clenſe, ſcoure, and comfort, they mooue vrine, and diſſolue groſſe and clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye humours, by meanes wherof they clenſe the breaſt and Lungues from fleagmatick humours, and releaſe the oppi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacions of the Liuer and Splene.</p>

Conſtan.</note> of whiche na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is our Meate according to the aſſertion of <hi>Auicen.</hi> But indeede <hi>Conſtantinus</hi> is of the contrary opinion, sayinge, that <hi>Aier</hi> is more neceſſary, to the body, prouing the ſame both by Reaſon, and experience. By Reaſon thus: Life conſiſteth in naturall heate, becauſe naturall heate is the beginninge of lyfe, wherfore that thinge which tempereth naturall heate, retayning it in the naturall temperature is more neceſſary, but the Aire which by way of breathinge wee drawe in, is of ſutch ſort: wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rfore it is more neceſſary. By experience thus: If a man be ſuddenly brought out of a ſtinkinge cloſe priſon, firſt he deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eth to take the freſh Aier, and afterwarde calleth for Meate, and Drink. But againſt the reaſon firſt alleaged it may bee anſwered negatiuely, for lyfe conſiſteth in two points, the one is a beginning ſumwhat far of, as reſtoringe that which is loſt, and the conſeruation of all the members and parts. In reſpect of which, the nouriſhing of natural heat
<pb facs="tcp:11781:38"/>
is moſt neceſſarie, whiche is immedyatly and principally maintained by the qualities of the Aire. And therefore Aier is more neceſſary to the preſeruacion of lyfe, for that it reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth the life principally and immediatly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may be demaunded <hi>which of the two, Meate, or Drynke, is more neceſſarie vnto life?</hi> To this may bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that <hi>Meate</hi> is, although that <hi>Drinke</hi> bee commonly more deſired then Meate. The reaſon of the firſt is, that that is more neceſſary which reſtoreth the thinge whiche is loſt, then that which ſerueth onely to conuey the iuce about al the body. But Meate is ordained to reſtore the parts, and Drink to cary the meate about the body: wherfore the concluſion is manyfeſt. And that Drink is more gréedely deſiered: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, for that drink delayeth the vehemency of natural heat, in which reſpect it is more neceſſary vnto lyfe then Meate, as is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Aier alſo. Thus <hi>Drinke</hi> hath two offices, firſt it conueieth the Meate vnto all partes of the body, and ſo is Meate a thing more neceſſary then drink. Secondly, it mitigateth the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heate, and preſerueth it in the iuſt temperature, and is therby more neceſſarie then meate. Wherfore any lyuinge creature can longer liue without meate, then drinke.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this queſtion may be demaunded: <hi>Wether euel Aier or euell Meate do more hurt the bodye?</hi> Whereunto it may be abſolutely anſwered, that éeuell Aier hurteth more, for, that it is more noiſome vnto the hart, which is the fown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Naturall heat, and of the ſpirites. Howbeit wee may vſe a diſtinction herein, that a thinge may do harme af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diuers manner of wayes. Fyrſt, if it touche ſome noble and princypall part, and the other thing do not ſo. Secondly, if it alter it often times and it cannot otherwiſe be avoyded. Thirdly, if it touch it immediatly. And by theſe three meanes éeuill Aier hurteth more then éeuell Meate. For it touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a principall parte, and it is often drawne in, and it tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the part immediatly. Fourthly, a thinge may hurte the more, becauſe it maketh a ſtronge impreſſion. Fiftly, if it continnue there longe, and cleaue longe time vnto the

                  </gap> lack of Meat doth more gréeue the body then lack of ſléep, and therby concluded that Meat is more neceſſary then ſléep. And the reaſon is this, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſléepe reſtoreth not that which is loſt, neither appeaſeth the vehemency of natural heate from woorking vpon the natural moiſture, which being conſumed, then death is at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dore, which meat doth: wherfore it is more neceſſary. Moreouer, there be thrée powers, the <hi>Vitall, Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> and <hi>Animall.</hi> The <hi>Animall</hi> is not ſo mutch appertayning vnto the ſubſtaunce and effecte of lyfe, as the other two are. Wherfore, nutriment which belongeth vnto the <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Vitall</hi> faculties: is more néedefull then ſléepe, which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto the <hi>Animall</hi> vertue onely.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, it may come into queſtion: <hi>whether the Aier or Meat do more nourish the body?</hi> Vnto this may bée anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that there is ſome kinde of Nutriment which goeth into the ſubſtance of that which is Nouriſhed, and is conuerted in to the ſame, and after this maner the moſt fineſt and ſubtileſt partes of the meate is nutriment vnto the ſpirits, and not the Aier. Secondly, a thinge may bee termed a nutriment vnto the ſpirites, becauſe it comforteth them, and thus wee call that the temperature or temperame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of any thing which preſerueth the ſame and nouriſheth it, hauing ſome proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with that which is nouriſhed.

<pb facs="tcp:11781:39"/>
alſo. The reaſon is this, good Meate may be éeuelly digeſted, and ſo therof become éeuell blood. And contrarywiſe, naughty meat well digeſted, and ſo conuerted into good blood. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in euery kinde of meat, yea if it were of a venimous qualiti are found two natures. The one, wherein it is vnproportionable vnto the nature of the partes of the body, and by this meanes eeuel meat ingendreth éeuel iuce, and this is the proper effect which éeuel meate worketh. The .y. nature is wherby meats haue the qualitie to become proportionable vnto the partes &amp; like vnto them, and in this ſort naughtie meates may ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der good iuce. For when Nature is ſtronge, ſhe is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue the other qualitie whiche is néereſt vnto her, to wit in the ſame meate which is receiued, and when it is altered ſhe bringeth it vnto her owne qualitie, and ſo of éeuel meate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendereth good blood. And contrarywiſe, if Nature be weake and feable, ſhe is not able to ouercome the meates, &amp; to bring it vnto good effect, which of it ſelf is of power to be conuerted into commendable nutriment, &amp; therefore fayling for want: turneth good meate into éeuell iuce.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly it may be demaunded: <hi>Whether a ſimple, or a compowned Meate be eaſieſt of digeſtion?</hi> To this wee muſt anſwer with <hi>Dyaſanus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dyaſanus.</note> as appeareth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt of the <hi>Saturnalia</hi> that ſimple meate is the eaſieſt. For cruditie and ſurfeit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth two maner of waies, either by the qualitie or quantitie of the meate. By the qualitie, into which the meat is conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted if it be not agreeable vnto the reſt of the humours of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, &amp; by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quantitie therof, if ther be more receiued into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy then nature is able to digeſt. Then, for as much as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of meats hath diuerſity of Natures, &amp; ſome are ſoone digeſted and conuerted into iuce, whiles the harder lye boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng in the ſtomack: the firſt waxeth ſower and vnprofitable and is perceiued by ſower &amp; euell ſauouring belching, &amp; there whiles that which is harder of concoction procureth gulping, &amp; boyling in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> belly, euen as gréene wood lieth ſmoking when it taketh heat of the fire. Beſides that, the diuerſitie of meats prouoketh gurmandize, &amp; a deſire to eate more then enough,
<pb facs="tcp:11781:40"/>
ſo that <hi>Socrates</hi> counſelled very wiſelye that men ſhoulde ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayne from ſutch meates as ſeeme to prouoke appetite when the belly is full, or to increaſe thirſt, when a man hath drunken ſufficient.</p>

               <p>Tenthly, <hi>What is the cauſe that if a man ſtay lenger for meat then his accuſtome houre, hee leeſeth his appetite?</hi> It muſt bée anſwered, that when the ſtomack hungreth and findeth no meat to worke vpon, it draweth éeuil humours from al parts of the body &amp; feedeth vpon them, and is therby falſly and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Eleuenthly, <hi>Are our bodies warmer beefore meat or after? Galen</hi> ſaith in his ſecond booke of the ſumme of Phiſick,<note place="margin">Galen.</note> that naturall heat is augmented thrée waies: either in quantity, as in applying ſwéete and warme furres, or the bellye of a young whelp vnto the ſtomack: or in quality by medicines, or ioyntly by both meanes in meates, and by this meanes the

               <p>Tweluethly: <hi>whether doth faſting hurt more a cholerick perſon or a flegmatick?</hi> I anſwere according to <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hyppocr.</note> that it hurteth moſt a cholerick, the reaſon is, for that heate more abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in a cholerick perſons ſtomack then in a fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke ſo that the ſame heat conſumeth more, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently maketh him more to deſire foode.

               <p>Fyfthly, <hi>whether can the ſicke or the whole beſt indure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?</hi> Some hold opinion that the ſicke can, bicauſe naturall heat in a ſicke perſon is buſie in reſoluing mo fumoſities, breathes, and vapours riſing from the humours, then in an whole perſon. Howbeit this reaſon is weake, firſt bicauſe there can bée no partes nouriſhed, nor ſpirites engendred by corrupt humours, and ſecondly if this were ſo, then ſhoulde there bée moe ſpirites in a ſicke body then in an whole, and bicauſe the ſpirits are the carriers of the powers and ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth into althe parts, the ſicke ſhould bée ſtronger then the whole, which is euidently falſe.

                  <pb facs="tcp:11781:42"/>SOme man may haply moue this queſtion: <hi>what is the cauſe that when a man which is hungry drinketh, thereby he aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his hunger? but if hee bee a thirſt and eate, his thirſt is not therby ſlaked?</hi> Vnto this demaund there is anſwere made in the <hi>Saturn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that there is no impediment but that liquor may paſſe into euery part of the body, and repleniſhe the veines therof. But the ſubſtance of meat is more groſſer, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſſe into the veines vntil it bee digeſted by litle and litle, ſo that it cannot ſlake the thirſt which it findeth, yea rather it ſoketh vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moiſture which it findeth, wherby thirſt which is the want of moiſture, is more increaſed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Such as are faſting, whether bee they more an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred then a thirſt?</hi> By the ſame place I anſwere y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they thirſt moſt, foraſmuch as naturall heat worketh continually vpon the foode and nutriment which wée receiue, conſuming it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.

               <p>Fiftly, <hi>If a man be thirſtie and haue a drie ſtomack, whether may a litle drinke ſuffice him or not?</hi> It is hereunto to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered according vnto <hi>Galen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Galen.</note> thoſe which haue drie ſtomackes are ſoone a thirſt, and a litle drinke ſufficeth them. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wherof may be this, for that euery member which is dry, ſhrinketh togither and waxeth to be of leſſe capaſitie then it was before, whiche hapneth vnto the ſtomack which is drye, and therfore is ſoone filled, and with a litle drink. And in the ſtomack there is ingendred great thirſtines, when the mouth therof waxeth drie and deſireth to bee moiſtned with drinke, and then a litle drink ſufficeth it. For when that which was drie and hard, is ſhrunken togither, the capacitie thereof is ſoone filled with drink and a litle extinguiſheth the thirſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomutch as it féeleth not it owne emptynes, and this thirſte ſoone returneth againe.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, <hi>May the ſtomack be ouer charged and troubled with to mutch drink?</hi> Surely <hi>Galen</hi> affirmeth the ſame,<note place="margin">Galen.</note> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may appeare out of the premiſſes. For if a dry ſtomack by reaſon of the narrownes therof, be full with a litle drinke, if then the drink be more then the capacitie of the ſtomacke be able to conteine, néedes, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, muſt much drink ouer flow and runouer in it.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, <hi>why can a moiſt ſtomack beare mutch?</hi> A moiſt ſtomack is in all points contrary to a drye, for it is very ſoft, like vnto a ſoft bottle or bladder, &amp; for that cauſe is able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine more, for it yéeldeth euery way as the meate which is receiued chanceth to fall or ſway in it, &amp; alſo apparent it is to ſence, that a moyſt bladder will receiue more then wyll a dry one, and ſo likwiſe wil a moyſt ſtomack. And moreouer forſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutch as it is moiſt without any drieneſſe, which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure thirſte, therfore it mutch deſireth not drinke, howbeit it receiueth much and is nothinge gréeued therewith, as is the

And for this cauſe, the <hi>Danes, Polonians, Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynges,</hi> yea, and the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> can beare mutch drink, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their ſtomackes are wide, procured by the ſoftneſſe of moyſture. But in hoat Regions as are <hi>Spayne, Barbarie,</hi> and ſutch like, the inhabitants do thirſt mutch, and drinke but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, bicauſe of the drineſſe of the mouth of the ſtomacke, and in ſutch their ſtomackes can receiue but litle, bicauſe of the dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe therof.</p>

               <p>Secondly, <hi>what is the cauſe why thirſtines, which cummeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lungues, is appeaſed by drawyng in cold and moiſt aier?</hi> And the drineſſe of the ſtomack by drink? It is thus to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that there be two paſſages, the one for ayer, which is directed vnto the Lungues: the other for meate and drinke, &amp; that paſſeth into the ſtomacke. And for this cauſe the thirſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which cummeth of the Lungues, is abated by drawyng in of colde aier, and that which riſeth of the ſtomack, is ſlaked with drinke.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Is thirſt a deſire of that which is colde and moiſte, or of that which is hoat and moiſt?</hi> There are in the body two appetites or deſires: the one in reſpect of meat, to reſtore that which is loſt, which appetite is ſatiſfied with that whiche is hoate and moyſt, accordyng to the nature of the partes to bée nouriſhed. The other looketh for that which is cold and moiſt, to repreſſe the flame and firines of naturall heate, whiche is accompliſhed by drinke only, and ſutch drinke as men ſeldom vſe but in the way of medicine, or when they bée ſicke.</p>

               <p>Eleuenthly, <hi>whether is it good to permit ſutch as recouer out of ſicknes to drinke wine immediatly after their fleash, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?</hi> In this poinct the common people is deceiued, for the fleaſh ſhould firſt bée eaten, and afterward the wine drunken bicauſe aboue all things wine is ſooneſt conuerted into blood, and ſpirits, &amp; augmenteth natural heat, and therefore ought to bee giuen later then fleaſh.</p>
               <p>Tweluethly, <hi>whether ought one that is recouering out of ſicknes, to be dieted &amp; gouerned two daies, like as when he was ſicke?</hi> verely hée ought ſo, and that for thrée cauſes. Firſt, for the debility of naturall power: Secondly, bicauſe of cuſtome: Thirdly bicauſe of ſome diſtemperature remaining yet with in the body ſince the ſicknes. This alſo may be a reaſon, that it is not good to change ſuddenly from that whereto a man is accuſtomed but by litle and litle, and therfore the recouerer ought for a while to reteine the ſame diet.</p>
               <p>Thirtenthly, <hi>Is groſſe meat good for ſuch as recouer out of ſicknes?</hi> According vnto the iudgment of <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> it is not
<pb facs="tcp:11781:45"/>
for, ſaith hée, it is conuenient that they bée nouriſhed two or thrée daies with the ſame diet which they vſed béefore. For otherwiſe they would ſoone bee altered by feeding on groſſe meates, which were not good for them to do.</p>
               <p>Fourtéenthly, <hi>which of theſe two alterations hurteth a man moſt, from emptines to repletio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or from repletion to emptines?</hi> The ſudden change from emptines to fulnes is more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then from fulnes to emptines, according to the opinions of <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> and <hi>Auicen.</hi>

               <p>Fiftly, <hi>why doth wheaten paſt riſe, and barly paſt fall both in woorking and baking?</hi> Barly meale when the water cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto it ſhrinketh down, bicauſe it lieth houer and thin, and is full of huſkes. And wheaten meale riſeth vp, bicauſe beefore it lay very neere togither: but when once it cummeth to heat, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dooth it puffe vp, and riſe vp into a greater heap.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, <hi>Why looketh the dough which is of wheat, white when it is wrought, and barly dough blacke?</hi> For two cauſes, firſt for that that which is in the vppermoſt of the wheaten bread is ſooner altered by the heate of the ouen as béeinge a thing hot and is conuerted into whitenes: And ſecondly by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the huſky part of the barly reteineth in it more moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture then doth wheat, which cauſeth the blacknes.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, <hi>Since hony is a more clammye ſubſtance then water, how chanceth it that paſte which is made vp with hony is more brittle in the baking?</hi> Water is ioyned &amp; glewed togither by heat of the fire. But hony glueth togither &amp; drieth with al, and therfore is more brittle, for brittlenes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of drineſſe</p>
               <p>Eightly, <hi>why is bread which is made of new corne worſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which is made of olde?</hi> In new corne there yet remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth much watriſh and ſlimy clammineſſe, wherby it is leſſe commendable then that which is made of old grain.</p>

it be good once in a month to be drunken with wine?</hi> Vnto this anſwereth <hi>Auerois,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Auer. Auicen. Galen.</note> in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentarie vpon the Canticles of <hi>Auicen,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this opinion of drunknes is but a drunken opinion, &amp; erroneus. For although accordinge vnto the iudgement of <hi>Galen,</hi> Wine is as agréeable to the mayntenance of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heate, as Oyle in the Lampe to preſerue the burnynge light: notwithſtanding like as to mutch oyle rather hindreth the light and extinguiſh the candle, ſo doth ouermutch Wine quench natural heat altogether. Howbeit if it be delayd with water it is more conuenient, but it hurteth the animal heate and the ſenſible organes therof, both the brain, and ſinews.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>why ſurfet they ſooner that drink delaid Wine, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they which drink it pure?</hi> Concerning pure Wine generally, <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Galen.</note> that for ſutch as naturally haue weake veynes, it is better to drinke water then Wine. And to come nearer to the purpoſe,<note place="margin">Ariſtotle.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the third part of his Problemes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a thréefolde cauſe vnto this demaunde: the firſt, bicauſe that which is tempered or mingled by reaſon of the ſubtilitie thereof entreth into more narrow paſſages then doeth that which is not tempered: ſecondly, bycauſe men drinke leſſe of that which is mingled as liking not ſo well of it as of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is not tempered, and thirdly, that which is impermixt and without minglyng is hoater and digeſteth the reſidue of the meat, which is in the ſtomack, ſooner, then the delayd Wyne is able to do.</p>
               <p>Thyrdly, <hi>Why doth Wyne which is vnmingled with water ſooner cauſe a mans head to ake then that which is mingled?</hi> The vnmingled Wine is thick, and ſticketh in the paſſages, ſendyng vp the vapours and fumes with heat into the head: and the mingled Wine beeing thinner and alſo delayd, bothe perceth ſooner, and fumeth leſſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>what is the cauſe that mingled wine moueth a man more to vomite then the cleane wine doth?</hi> The ſwimminge of the watriſhnes of it about the ſtomacke, procureth lotheſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and maketh apt to vomit.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>why do not children which are hoat of complexion,
<pb facs="tcp:11781:46"/>
loue wyne, which aged perſons, and men of perfit ſtrength bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hoat alſo, do greedely deſire?</hi> Men are hoat and drie, and children hoat and moyſt, and the deſire vnto Wine is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite vnto moyſture, which moyſture abundyng in children kéepeth them from drinkyng, and the drieth which is in aged men &amp; ſtronge perſons, prouoketh them to a deſire of drinke.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, <hi>when wine is clenſed from the Lees why is it ſtronger and not durable? Macrobius</hi> in his <hi>Saturnalia</hi> the fourth booke,<note place="margin">Macrobius</note> writeth that hauing no ſtrength nor matter to cleaue vnto, it is on euery ſide expoſed vnto dangers: for the Lees is as it were the roote wherby the Wine is ſtrengthned &amp; preſerued?</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, <hi>why doth wine immoderatly taken ingendre both hoat and cold diſeaſes?</hi> It is to be noted that there be two quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Wine: the firſt is to heaten, and in this reſpect it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther procureth hoat then colde ſickneſſes: the ſecond is to ſtuf the brayne, and to fill the ſinews. Thus when cold vapours ariſe from the Wyne, they cauſe vnluſtineſſe, fulneſſe, and vndigeſtion, and conſequently procure cold diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Eightly, <hi>Whether doth Wyne ingender moſt of Fleame or Blood?</hi> Séeing as wée haue béefore concluded Wine bréedeth colde humours, doubtleſſe it breedeth alſo more Fleame then any other humour. The reaſon is, that when wine is quaffed in great abundance, it is not perfectly digeſted &amp; cauſeth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the reſidue of the meat to fayle in concoction, thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendring abundance of Fleame: But indéede if it bee mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly drunken, it increaſeth blood aboue other humours.</p>
               <p>Ninethly, <hi>Doth Wine hurt the brayne? Iſaac</hi> ſaith yea.<note place="margin">Iſaac.

And albeit that at the firſt drinkyng wyne doth properly warme, yet bicauſe it fumeth mutch, it anoyeth the brayne, fillyng it with vapours and ſtoppyng the ſinews.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, <hi>Why doth ſtrong Wine hurt the braine and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the ſtomacke, and weake wyne worketh the contrary effect?</hi> Bicauſe Wine heateth the ſtomacke whereon conſiſteth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, ſtronge Wine is of greater effect in this caſe then is the weake.

               <p>Eleuenthly, <hi>Why doth the vſe of Wine ingender the ſower gulpyng or belchyng in the ſtomacke, more then water?</hi> The ſower belchyng neuer hapneth in the ſtomacke but when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion is beegun, and Wyne ſtirreth vp naturall heate, and is as ſoone digeſted as Milke. Wherfore, like as when they bée out of the ſtomack they ſoone waxe ſower: ſo do they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the ſtomack.</p>
               <p>Tweluethly, <hi>Whether doth wine or meate comfort naturall caliditie? Iſaac</hi> ſaith that wine doth, and the reaſon is, bicauſe it is very ſwiftly conuerted into natural heat,<note place="margin">Iſaac.</note> comfortinge it mutch more then any meat doth. But meate when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into nutriment, doeth more reſtore that which is loſt, and comforteth and preſerueth the body longer.</p>
               <p>Thirtenthly, and laſtly, <hi>If wyne muſt needes be giuen vnto the ſicke, whether were it moſt expedient to giue them new wine or olde?</hi> Although the common people do contrary and mutch amiſſe, yet new wine is far more holſom for them then olde. The reaſon is, for that how mutch the newer the wine is, ſo mutch the leſſe it is inflatiue or windy, and for that cauſe is more conuenient for them, then are the old wines.</p>

               <p>HEnceforward now let vs ſée what may bée ſayd of Fleaſh.
And firſt it may demaunded, <hi>why ſtrong Fleash is ſooneſt digeſted?</hi> It is anſwered in the <hi>Saturn.</hi> that naturall heate is ſtrong in a man which ſtoutly inuadeth the matter and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which reſiſteth it, conſuming &amp; diſſoluing the ſame, and that which is tendre &amp; light it burneth ſooner into aſhes, then turneth it into iuice. For like as ſound wood being hewen in to pieces is ſoone conuerted into coales, &amp; if chaf fal into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fier there ſcarce remaineth any aſhes therof to be found: ſo fareth it in the digeſtion of ſtrong and light meates. So likewiſe an heauy milſtone breaketh the greateſt cornes, and letteth the ſmale depart whole. The ſtrong windes alſo throw downe hie Firtrees &amp; mighty Oakes to the ground, &amp; letteth the low
<pb facs="tcp:11781:48"/>
ſhrubs, &amp; buſhes to ſtand: Euen ſo naturall heat digeſteth the hard fleaſh, and ouerpaſſeth the fine and tendre nutriment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Why be Cullices which are made of Fleash, harder of digeſtion then the fleash it ſelf?</hi> The lightnes which it get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by pounding, cauſeth it to ſwim vpon the top of all kynde of moyſture which it findeth in the ſtomacke, ſo that it cannot cleaue vnto the ſides of the ſtomack, the truth wherof is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued if ſome portion of the cullice be thrown into water, for it will alwaies fléete vpon the toppe, and for that cauſe is the ſlowlier concocted in the ſtomacke.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>which is moiſter of roſted or ſodden fleash?</hi> Wée muſt anſwer hereunto with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the. 4. booke of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors,</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> that the roſted is moiſteſt: for in roſt fleaſh by reaſon of the fire the outward parts are hardened, and conſequently y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the pores are ſtopped, ſo that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inmoſt moiſture cannot iſſue foorth. But in ſodden fleaſh the outward pores are reſolued through the heate and moyſture of the water, and ſo opened y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moiſture departeth. Thus it hapneth that roſted fleaſh ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth drie without and is moiſt within, and ſodden fleaſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe. Fourthly, <hi>why do the beames of the Moone cauſe fleash ſooner to putrify, then of the Sunne?</hi> There can bée no putrifaction vnleſſe heat and moyſture do méete. And the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction of fleaſh is nothing els but a certain ſecret diſſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conuerting the ſodility of the fleſh into moiſture. And heat if it bée temperate, nouriſheth humours, but being immoderate drieth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp, &amp; doth extenuate.

               <head>The. 10. chap. Of Egges, conteining. 9. queſt.</head>
               <p>THis Chapter requireth now ſome ſpeciall treatice of Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, wherin the firſt queſtion which offreth it ſelf moſt fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be demaunded, is this:
<pb facs="tcp:11781:49"/>
                  <hi>which is the hoater of the yolke or the white?</hi> Amonge all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours blood is warmeſt in temperate warmth, ſo that the yolke as cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming neereſt vnto the blood, is ſurely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warmer. Moreouer, the Liuer is hoater then the breaſtes, and the blood warmer then the milke, and the yolke in the egge is in temperature vnto the white, as is the blood in the Liuer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>why doth the yolke beeing caſt into water, ſinke downe to the bottom, and the white fleete on top?</hi> The white is very ſlimy, and cleaueth vnto that which is next vnto it, and by reaſon of the ſlimines ſwimmeth aboue the water, and the yolke bicauſe of the ſoundnes and want of pores, ſinketh downe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>why haue birdes fewer egges and bigger then the fishes, and they haue moe and ſmaller then birdes?</hi> The greatneſſe in a thinge which is continuall,<note place="margin">Auicen.</note> is procured by a ſtrong heate: but a multitude in that which is diuided is long of the matter, bicauſe the matter is the beginning of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion. And bicauſe birdes haue more heat then fiſhes haue, therfore haue they great egges in continuall, and but few in diuiſion, and contrariwiſe it fareth in fiſhes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>why haue birdes egges an hard shell, and fishes egges a ſoft?</hi> Fiſhes lay their egges in a moiſt place, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they néede no hard ſhell. But birdes lay their egges in hard and ſound places, as vpon the ground, ſtones, trees, and ſuch like, and therfore haue néede of an harde ſhell to keepe them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hurt, vntil ſuch time as the chick or bird be hatched.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>why are birdes egges ſpeckled and of diuerſe coulers, and it is not ſo in fishes?</hi> In birdes ther is a ſtrong naturall heat which is able to ſeperate thinges of diuerſe natures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, as the yolke from the white, and in fiſhes this heate is ſo weake that it is not able to worke the like effect.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, <hi>why are birdes egges long, and fishes egges round?</hi> Heat moueth from the centre, and eſpeciall cauſeth a forme like a piller, broad beneath and ſharpe aboue, as appeareth in flame of a fire which riſeth vp into a ſharp poinct. Wherfore, heat béeing more abundant in birdes then in fiſhes, the birds
<pb facs="tcp:11781:49"/>
Egges are long, and fiſhes round, for the weake heat carieth the matier equally round.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, <hi>what breaketh the eggeshell when the chicke is hatched?</hi> There bée two cauſes hereof alledged, the one is, for that by long and continuall lyinge the ſhell waxeth ſofte and thin, as it is if an egge bée ſtieped nine daies in vineger: the ſecond is, for that when the young bird lacketh nutrimente, hée breaketh the ſhell to séeke meat.</p>
               <p>Eightly, <hi>why doth the yolke of an egge which is layd in the full of the moone, and in the light therof,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rhaſis.</note> 
                  <hi>ſcoure ſpottes out of cloth?</hi> The fatty drop in the middes of the egge béeinge the meanes of the generation, conceiueth a pearcinge and a diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding heat both by the great light, and the moiſture which the Moone moueth, which it can not do at another time.</p>
               <p>Ninethly, <hi>why do ſome egges crack when they bee laid into the fire and ſome not?</hi> Such crack as haue within them win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines, which is perceiued when the ſhell reueth, to iſſue forth with great noiſe and force. And this hapneth when the fire is great. For if a birds egge were caſt into the middes of the fire, the ſhell would ſoone breake, &amp; the windines would ſtart forth with great noiſe and force, which it would not do if the fire were ſmall. But proportionably, there is mutch more windines in the egges of fiſhes, and therfore they make a great noyſe when they bee caſt into the fire, as appeare for example in the rowe of an hearring.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, <hi>why doth the raine profit fishes, and hurt birdes?</hi> Swéete water nouriſheth onely, and therwith are fiſhes nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed beeing mingled with mud and clay.

Wherof it may bée gathered, that abundance of raine hurteth aſwell fiſhes as foules, for in ſuch times they fall into oppilations of the nutritiue partes, by reaſon of the ſwéetenes of ſutch water.

as all that is milted by hoat and drie is of the nature of water as appeareth by all kyndes of Mettals. And Earth is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Salt, when it is clenſed from the droſſe in moyſture and burnyng heat, and drieth congelyng and hardenyng it, ſo that Salt is a certayn drineſſe of the earth burned by an heat into a watriſh hardnes, wherby the taſt therof co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth néere vnto bitterneſſe, which is ingendred of heat woorkyng vpon an earthly drie ſubſtance. Then beeing of this nature, by heat it is hot and drie, and by reaſon of the bitterneſſe it killeth the belly wormes, and by drithe it drinketh vp putrifiynge moyſture, aboliſhyng the ſame, and conſequently prohibiting all ſtinking. Now bicauſe it drieth, and conſumeth moyſture and heate, it hindreth generation and fruitfulneſſe of the grounde, and bicauſe it hath a ſharpneſſe of a burnyng heate, it ſharpneth the things that are mingled with it.
