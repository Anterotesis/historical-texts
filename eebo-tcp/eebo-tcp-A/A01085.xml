            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the ende of a iust warre,

intention of a right peace.
The Subiect then is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

loue Peace. But commonly
they, with whom it med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles,
<pb facs="tcp:15688:3"/>
refuse to meddle with
it. Let such take the course
of their vnhappy precipice
into euerlasting vnquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
who wilfully reiect
the cure of their affected

consciences a trouble that
may saue them, for feare
of loosing a trouble that

man were lesse then mad,
that will leap into the fire,
o auoid the smoke. There
is <hi>Pax fundamenti,</hi> the
peace of Doctrine: and
<hi>Pax Ordinis,</hi> the peace of
Discipline. The Heretike
would pull downe the first
Pillar, the Schismaticke
<pb facs="tcp:15688:3"/>
the other: The former
would break our peace with
Christ; the latter with our
selues &amp; the Church: both
these are almost desperate.
But there is a third, <hi>Pax
Politica,</hi> a ciuill Peace:
and the common distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of this are such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious
spirits; that either

prouoked, out of mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
reuenge; set all in

this <hi>Babel,</hi> if at least shee
will bee cured, is the scope
of this Tractate. Peace
<pb facs="tcp:15688:4"/>
was Christs blessed Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
to his Church; and we

Executours are often

the blessing of the Apostle':
a Valediction, and

<hi>Liue in Peace:</hi> there are

            <p>Generall, so that all

            <p>It must be Good, for

If you require it Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,

Or if the <hi>Grecians</hi> kept

Philosophy in their

that brings the

home to the heart. Vse

looseth more of the

man takes no notice of

takes notice of the

bee pleased with God
himselfe! And either he
must take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with their

To refuse the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
in anger, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill:
to receiue it in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
thats worse. Is the

no more worth, but that
for loue of a peeuish hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
we should neglect
it? Shall we starue our
consciences, to feed our
misbegotten passions?
What is then to be done
in this straight? The
answer is easie: Let vs
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:15688:24"/>
excommunicate our
wrath, that wee may
communicate with the
Church: leaue our lusts
behinde vs, and wee are
welcome;<note place="margin">Gen. 22. 5</note> as <hi>Abraham</hi>

In the Leuiticall

not be approched. Now
for the Israelite to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

He knew the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die;
either not to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane

get himselfe clensed.
The first best is to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
no malice; the next
to deliuer our selues

speed.</p>
                  <p>In a word, let vs turne
our anger whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it comes,
another way. Let all our

That wee may know

passion in the Law-goer.</p>
               <p>O that men could see
the folly of this litigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.
1. That hee is
not in the state of grace,
but a meere carnal man.
This is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians;
If there be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions

                  <hi>Long-suffering,
Gentlenesse.</hi> 2. That hee
doth not so much find,
as make himselfe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
we may say of him
as the Angel said to <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi>
concerning her son
<hi>Ishmael;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 16. 12</note> 
                  <hi>His hand is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
euery man, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mans hand against him.</hi>
3. That he vexeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
without need: they
that goe to Law for tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles,
are like nice people
that continually lie in
the hands of Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and Phisicians, for
pimples &amp; warts: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:15688:52"/>
as the Physician and
Lawyer are for necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
not wantonnesse.
Their boxes and papers
are the Books &amp; Badges
of their profession: they
trudge vp and downe,
more busie to cast away
their money, then Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
are to catch it: their
word is <hi>Currat Lex,</hi> let
the law haue his course:
but by their willes that
course should neuer haue
an end.</p>
               <p>They plead, wee haue
stood before the best, in
Courts of highest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor:
alas, so doth the
spider,<note place="margin">Pro. 30. 28.</note> euen <hi>in kings pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>

So did the Deuill,
when the Sons of God
presented themselus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him,<note place="margin">Iob. 2. 1.</note> Satan was ther
also. 4. They consider
not the root of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
them: want of
<hi>Wisdome</hi> to compound
controuersies; <hi>Is there
not one wise man among
you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 5. &amp;c.</note> able to iudge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
brethren? Want
of <hi>loue, Brother is against
brother.</hi> Want of <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
Why do ye not rather

<hi>Iustice; Ye defraud and do
wrong.</hi> For want of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
<hi>foro conscientiae,</hi> they
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:15688:53"/>
prosecute their malice,
<hi>foro Iustitiae.</hi> Wee may
add, want of <hi>Mercy,</hi> they
cannot forgiue: but if
they forgiue not others,
their finall <hi>Quietus est</hi>
was neuer yet sealed; and
they shal be called to an
after-reckoning. As that
wicked serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t sped; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the <hi>Lord
forgaue him</hi> at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 22</note>
because he did not
forgiue his brother at
his intreaty, he was <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
ouer to the tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, they weigh not
how they are deceiued.
Lawyers first inuented
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:15688:54"/>
Lawes to secure our
lands and titles: now
they make those lawes
engines to get away our
lands and titles. Their
frequent Session hath
not beene euermore to
preserue a mans possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And for those that
can tarry the leasure of
the Lawe, they haue
quirks &amp; delayes: which
are like the corrosiue
plaisters of an vnconsci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Leach, that turnes
a small greene wound to
an incurable <hi>Fistula,</hi> by
poysoning and exulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of it for filthy lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre.
When a man must
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:15688:54"/>
die without mercy, it is
some ease to die quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and bee out of his
paine. But such, when
they purpose to murther
a mans estate, haue tricks
to keepe him long a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
that hee may still
languish and pine away
in hope of recouery.</p>
               <p>And what doth the
winner get, that at the
Tearmes end, hee may
bragge of his gaines?
Doth hee not come
home dry-founderd?
Doth he not follow the
Mill so long, till the toll
be more then the griest?
It is a token of vnwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:15688:55"/>
ayre, wher the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

As Christians may

warre in loue, so they
may iarre in loue: when

me,</hi> I will hold me where

I must shew them no

So if to conuince that

               <p>Of all Nations we are

a King of peace:
therefore all bound to
bee children of peace.
There are three wayes
of chusing Kings. 1. An
immediate nomination
from God. 2. A Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of blood. 3. An
election of the people.
The first ceaseth, the last
hath been found dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
the best remaines.
They that are suddenly
chosen out of the flock,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:15688:64"/>
doe seldome manifest
such royall behauiour,
nor become their Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie;
for it is not their
Trade. <hi>Iehu</hi> remitted
much of his noble zeale,
when hee was setled in
his kingdome. It is one
thing to say, <hi>With a great
summe of money,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 22. 28</note> 
                  <hi>obtained
I this kingdome:</hi> and for
another to say, <hi>I was a
King borne.</hi> Wee may
iustly say of our King,
<hi>Dignissimus Regno, si non
natus ad Regnum.</hi> When
the Poets called some
men the Sonnes and off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
of the gods; they
meant that they were
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:15688:65"/>
men of a more noble
and vncommon nature:
and that those graces
were, <hi>Ex Diuino afflatu.</hi>
It was as familiar with
<hi>Homer,</hi> to make a King
fight with a god at his
elbowe, as a common
Souldier with his sword
in his hand. To whom
the Lord giues most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
he giues most assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
<hi>The heart of the
King is in his hand, as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of waters;</hi> the heart
of a priuate man as a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
brook: in the former
is more need of his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence.
Howsoeuer,
the grace of adoption, in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:15688:65"/>
the Apostles time,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 26</note> was
<hi>not giuen to many mightie

of administration are.</p>
               <p>Anarchie is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of diuision, the step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother
of peace. While
the State of Italy wants
a King, all runnes into
ciuill broiles. It is the
happinesse of this Citie,
that there is no distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Not a King at
<hi>Iudah,</hi> and another at
<hi>Dan:</hi> not one in <hi>Hebron,</hi>
another in <hi>Gibeon:</hi> not
the redd Rose here, and
the white there. We are
not shuffled into a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
gouernment, nor cut
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:15688:66"/>
into Cantons, by a
headles, headstrong A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristocracie:
but <hi>Henricus
Rosas, Regna Iacobus:</hi> in
<hi>Henry</hi> was the vnion of
Roses, in <hi>Iames</hi> of the

is not a Peace-maker;
ours, like a second <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi>
hath shut the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie

it would haue trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

complaines the want of

What the Senators? a

                  <note place="margin">The Riuer of this Citie.</note> It is one
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:15688:80"/>
principall happinesse of
a Citie, to bee scituated
by a Riuers side: that as
it hath fortified it selfe
by land, so it may haue
commaund of the Sea.
Prosperitie is the Riuer
to this Citie, that like a
louing Meander, winds
it selfe about, throwing
his siluer Armes vpon
her sides; ebbing slowly,
but flowing merrily, as
if he longed to embrace
his loue. Peace is the
mother of Prosperitie,
but Prosperitie is too
often the murtherer of
Peace. For peace breeds
wealth, wealth breedes
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:15688:80"/>
pride, pride breeds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
and contention
kils peace. Thus shee is
often destroyed by her
owne issue, as <hi>Senache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib</hi>
was by his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels.</p>
               <p>Take this Citie wee
liue in for an Instance.
Peace hath brought
Gods plentie: the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
neither plowe,
nor sowe, nor reape; yet
are fed like the fowles
of heauen. They fare
well with lesse trouble,
then if come grewe at
their doores, and cattell
grased in their streets.
But as <hi>Nylus</hi> may rise
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:15688:81"/>
too high, and water E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt
too much; so the
inundation of opulency
may doe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hurt. Thus
may the influence of
heauen, and the plentie
of earth, be a <hi>Snare</hi> vnto
vs; and our abundance,
an occasion of our <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
Prosperitie is hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
meat, but not digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by a weake stomack,
strong wine, but naught
for a weake braine. <hi>The
prosperitie of fooles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth
them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 1, 32</note> It is not
simply prosperitie, but
the prosperitie of fooles
that destroyeth them.
The swelling Riuer by
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:15688:81"/>
the surfet of a Tyde,
doth not sooner bring
in our encrease; but our
encrease doth breed in
our minds another swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
in our bodies ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

in pride, and surfet in

and at night ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected

When they did daily

               <p>There be (as I heard

and this Citie is placed
in the best Seate of the

it with all plentie of bad

&amp; we send it loaden

               <p>Such toward God is
the impious ingratitude

peace with our selues: a
conformitie of affection
to reason, of reason to
grace: that the conflicts
which a distressed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
finds with legall
terrors, shall bee turned
to mild embracements.
Faith leading the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding,
the vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
guiding the wil, the will

all. For indeed
hee is the Fountaine of
peace,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1.</note> and wee <hi>through

Through the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

He reconciles vs to
God, as <hi>Ioab</hi> did <hi>Absolon</hi>
to <hi>Dauid</hi> by the woman

two sorts of sons Angels
&amp; men: the Angels that

fel, if they were lost too,
where should God haue
sonnes? I know that he
needs not man: he hath

is able to raise sonnes of
stones: he can want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingwhile
he possesseth
himself. Wel, yet in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
Christ reconciles vs:
<hi>Dauid</hi> askes,<note place="margin">Verse 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Is not the

Yes, hee hath made our

Thus wee haue a reall
abridgment of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
<hi>Citie of Peace;</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
euery way. Vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
is her <hi>Officer of Peace;</hi>
that hath an eye in the
darkest angles, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couers
the first concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of strife. Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
is her <hi>Clerke</hi> of the
peace, that keepes the
Records, and indicts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.
Authoritie is
her <hi>Iustice</hi> of peace: that
if any will not be ruled,
binds them ouer to the
peace. Equitie is her
<hi>Burse,</hi> where men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change

on whose stayres
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:15688:94"/>
Iniurie and imposture

<hi>Standard,</hi> which with
the Trumpet of Fame
shall resound her happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

is her <hi>Treasurer,</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie

Conscience her <hi>Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi>

               <p>All her Garments are
greene and orient; all
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:15688:95"/>
her paths bee Milke, her
words Oracles, and her
works Miracles: making
the blind to see, and the
lame to goe, by a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
supply to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
Her breath is swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the new blowen
Rose; millions of soules
lie sucking their life fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
it: and the smell of her
garments is like the smel

are more reuiuing then
the Vertumnall Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine:
and her fauours,
like seasonable dewes,
spring vp flowers and
fruits wheresoeuer shee
walks. Holinesse is the

her foot. All her <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants</hi>
wait in order; and
can with contentfull
knowledge, distinguish
and accept their owne
places. Her <hi>Court</hi> is an
Image of Paradise; all
her channels slow with
milke, and her Conduits
runne wine. Enuy and
murmuring, as priuy to
their owne guilt, flye
from her Presence. Her
