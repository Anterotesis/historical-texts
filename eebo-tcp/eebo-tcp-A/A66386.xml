         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>3. The Expedience, Usefulness, and Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity

            <p>It is the Second I am to proceed to, <hi>viz.</hi> The
<hi>Certainty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under which I shall shew,</p>
            <p>I. That God has reveal'd himself; or that
there has been such Revelation.</p>
            <p>II. The Difference between Pretended and
Real Revelation.</p>
            <p>III. That the Scriptures of the Old and New
Testament contain such a Revelation, and have
upon them all the Characters necessary and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to such Revelation.</p>
            <p>I. That there has been a Divine Revelation.</p>
            <p>What I have principally in my eye, is the
Proof of the Divine Authority of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures;
but for the present I shall lay that aside,
and take my rise towards it from such general
Principles and Observations as are founded upon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35903:3"/>
Reason; or such particular Instances and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Fact as manifestly proceeded from Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>And accordingly I shall dispose of what I
have to say in Proof of it, under these Four
Heads; as we have for it,
<list>
                  <item>1. A Rational or Moral Evidence.</item>
                  <item>2. A Natural.</item>
                  <item>3. A Traditionary, or Testimony.</item>
                  <item>4. A Supernatural.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Moral: Where in the first place I take
for granted what I have before proved, <hi>viz.</hi> That
a Divine Revelation is Expedient, Useful, and
Necessary; and upon that Supposition shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to prove the <hi>Certainty</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge, where the Necessity is created
by our own fault, there lies no obligation upon
the Creator to provide a Remedy; and since the
Necessity Mankind is now in, proceeded from
their Apostacy, that Necessity can in reason be
no just Plea for it, nor a sufficient Excuse in the
want of it. When Man was created in such a
state as made Revelation a necessary Help to his
Reason, God immediately afforded him such an
extraordinary Manifestation of himself: But
when he forfeited that Divine Gift, he could
have no allowable Right or Claim to it; For <hi>to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35903:4"/>
him that hath,</hi> and improves what he hath, <hi>shall
be given;</hi> but to <hi>him that hath not,</hi> and takes no
care to preserve and improve it, may justly be
denied what was otherwise fit and necessary for
him to have.</p>
            <p>This indeed is the Case, if rigorously stated;
but considering the miserable Circumstances
Mankind were in after the Fall, more especially
through want of a Revelation, we may reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
conclude, That the Goodness of God would
no less incline him to give it, than if he had
been obliged to it by a special Grant, Promise,
or Covenant. Decrees are Secrets lock'd up in
the Breast of Almighty God; and whatever
Good is therein intended, how beneficial soever
they may be in the Event, yet afford no Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to us, till they are opened and revealed:
And though the Redemption of Mankind were
decreed, and were according to Circumstances to
operate, and in due season to be fully executed,
yet what would They have been the better, if for
4000 Years together that Decree had lay hid in
the Bosom of the Father, and the Decree had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been a Promise, and that Promise had never
before that time been reveal'd unto them? So
that had we no such Promise upon record, as,
<hi>The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head;</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:35903:4"/>
yet however, we might be as sure that there
was some such kind of Revelation made to <hi>Adam,</hi>
some Promise of Forgiveness, when God did
intend to Redeem him and all Mankind, as there
was a Design to Redeem them: It being as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
toward their present Comfort to have a
Revelation of that Mercy in their Redemption,
as Redemption it self was necessary toward their
Happiness.</p>
            <p>And this will farther be confirmed, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what has been before proved in the former
Discourse, <hi rend="margQuotes">That all men have had a Sense of the
Want of a Revelation;</hi> and have been possess'd
with an earnest and impatient desire of obtaining
it; which being a desire becoming Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
useful and fit to be cherish'd, it is not to be
conceiv'd, that where there is provision made to
answer all sensible and natural Appetites
throughout the Creation, that this no less impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
though supervenient Desire, should have
no regard paid to it, but be suffered, like <hi>Aetna,</hi> to
be always burning within, tormenting, as it
were, the Bowels of Mankind with an unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Fire, or an unsatiable Desire of knowing
what was not to be known, and of obtaining
what was not to be obtained. This is a State
that the Consideration of God's Goodness will
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35903:5"/>
not admit us to suppose; and we must therefore
necessarily conclude, That the same Divine
Power and Wisdom that made Man a Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Inquisitive Being, and has allowed him a
World of Wonders to employ that Faculty in the
Contemplation of, hath also provided for that
Noble Desire of knowing what the Will of his
Maker is, and what relates to his own Eternal
Welfare; and that is, by a Revelation. Indeed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this, 'tis with him as with one that is born
Blind, that whatever other Evidence he may
have of the Being of a God, wants one of the
most convincing of all, which is, The Wonders
of an Almighty Power and Incomprehensible
Wisdom, conspicuous in the Frame of Nature,
and the visible parts of the Creation: So what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
sense men, that have only Reason for their
Guide, may have of the Mercy and Goodness
of God; whatever they may observe in the
Course of his Providence to confirm them in the
Belief of it; whatever Hopes they may have
of it, from the general Notion of the Divine
Nature; whatever Desire they may have of it,
from a sense of their own Misery, yet they want
that Evidence of it, which, as we find by constant
experience, alone can satisfy and compose their
doubtful and distracted Minds, and that is <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:35903:5"/>
or, which is the same, <hi>Revelation;</hi> by which
and nothing less, That <hi>Certainty</hi> is to be attained.
And therefore we have just reason to believe <hi>that</hi>
was not wanting to the First Ages of the World:
For the same reason we have to believe God to
be good, the like reason we have to believe that
he did after that manner make himself known
in those early times from the first to Mankind.</p>
            <p>But it may be said, What is all this Reasoning
to Matter of Fact? For if after all, there has
been no such Revelation, or no Proof can be
made of it, That is more than a Thousand Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Arguments for it. And besides, supposing
there was once a Revelation, what was that to
those Ages and Nations that afterwards wanted
it, and were condemned, as it were, to <hi>sit in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and the shadow of death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The last of these is not to be denied, and so I
shall first of all consider it. And in answer to it
it shall suffice to say for the present, That if there
has been such a Revelation made known to the
World, and all due care taken by the Almighty
and Beneficent Creator for the Preservation of it,
and it afterwards be damnified, or corrupted, or
in fine, utterly lost, through the Negligence or
Perverseness of men themselves, the Fault of
the Miscarriage wholly rests upon them. The
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35903:6"/>
making known the Revelation, was an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Case, and is a voluntary Act of Grace
and Favour in Almighty God; the Preservation
of it is the ordinary Case, and belongs to Men:
and when once the Extraordinary Case becomes
Ordinary, God leaves it to its proper and natural
Course, to Second Causes, to Human Prudence,
Care, and Inspection.</p>
            <p>Thus it is with Reason, the Noblest Principle
of Human Nature, which if not attended and
nurtur'd, may degenerate into Stupidity, and a
kind of Brutality. As it happen'd to some
Nations in the <hi>Southern</hi> Parts of <hi>Africa, West-Tartary,</hi>
and <hi>West-Indies,</hi> that notwithstanding the
Characters of an Almighty Being legibly stamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Face of the whole and every part of
the Creation, have so far degenerated, that it
has been questioned, Whether they have had
any Notion or Sense of a God, or any sort of
Worship for him. And so it is in the case before
us: For as God had made a special Revelation
of himself to <hi>Adam</hi> after as well as before the
Fall, so he took a very effectual way for the
Conveyance and Preservation of it, by the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaevity
of those Patriarchs with whom it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited,
and who were to take care that it
might be preserv'd inviolable: Three of which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35903:6"/>
alone fill'd up the first Period of 1656 Years,
from the Creation to the Flood; <hi>viz. Adam, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuselah,</hi>
and <hi>Noah:</hi> So that <hi>Methuselah</hi> lived 243
Years with <hi>Adam,</hi> (for so old was he when <hi>Adam</hi>
died;) and <hi>Noah</hi> lived 600 Years with <hi>Methuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi>
(for so old was <hi>Noah</hi> when <hi>Methuselah</hi> died,
and the Flood came.) And four again of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
after the Flood (tho the Extent of their Lives
was shortned) fell in with the 856 Years from
the Flood to the giving of the Law by <hi>Moses</hi> at <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai:</hi>
So that <hi>Abraham</hi> is well supposed to have lived
150 Years with <hi>Shem, Jacob</hi> about 20 with <hi>Abraham,
Levi</hi> 60 Years with <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Amram</hi> the Father of
<hi>Moses</hi> lived in the Time of his Grandfather <hi>Levi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what course, in the Circumstances and
the State the World was at that time in, could be
more fit, if duly observed, for conveying the
matter of a Revelation through the several Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods
and Ages of the World, so far as Personal
Teaching was sufficient?</p>
            <p>And especially, when the Things revealed,
and after this manner to be delivered from Age
to Age, were of Importance sufficient to oblige
both Teacher and Scholar; and withal so Few,
as might without any Difficulty be retained.
And therefore, if notwithstanding the Method
taken by Almighty God for the registring what
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35903:7"/>
he had revealed, in the memories of men, and
for delivering it down to future Ages, there was
afterwards no care taken on their part, and no
reasonable provision made for conserving such
a Revelation, but that in process of time, it
was either totally obliterated, or vilely corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Miscarriage was (as I have said) wholly
chargeable upon such as by their Negligence or
Wickedness <hi>made</hi> Mankind <hi>to sin,</hi> in not deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or not faithfully delivering down to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
what they themselves had received in its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Purity from their Ancestors. The Case is
indeed very lamentable, but what is not to be
helped, without Almighty God alters the Nature
of things, turns them out of their proper and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Course, and acts solely by his own Power
and Prerogative, either without or above the
Agency of Second Causes. Which is no more
with reason to be expected, than that when God
has made the Earth in its own nature fertile, and
capable of yielding all things necessary for man's
subsistence, with Cultivation; that He should
also be obliged to continue it in the same state it
was created in; and when by the Sloth and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity
of men it brought forth nothing but
Thorns and Thistles, should miraculously make
every Tree that is <hi>pleasant to the sight, and good for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35903:7"/>
food,</hi> and whatever was beneficial and necessary,
to grow out of the Ground, as at first, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there was a <hi>Man to till the ground.</hi> Now if
this be unreasonable for Man to expect, it is so
then in the case of Revelation, which God had
committed to the Custody of Men themselves,
and made them whose Interest it was, to be the
Conservators of it.</p>
            <p>Having thus far considered the Case of those
that had not, or have no Revelation, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the Main Point, which is, To shew that
there has been such a Revelation. And that brings
me to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IId.</hi> Sort of Proof, which I call <hi>Natural,</hi> as it
belongs to things Natural, and is opposed to
what is of mere Institution, (which I conceive
to be equivalent to Revelation): And they are
Speech, and common Notions.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Speech:</hi> For which there is in Man a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Capacity, and Organs admirably contrived
and disposed (as we see by experience.) But
now there is a vast difference in that case betwixt
Us and other Creatures; for other Creatures
have not only Organs as we have, fitted
for their proper Notes, but at once have
all those Organs in Tune and in Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
so that whatever they would signify in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35903:8"/>
their way, and according to their kind, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
thereby express: But though the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
of Speech in us are as exquisitely framed, yet
we gradually grow up to the use of them; and
again, can never apply them, or know how to
use them, without some precedent Instruction.
And therefore it has been the Opinion of many,
That without hearing others speak, we should
be eternally dumb<note n="*" place="margin">V. Postel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, lib. de Orig. c. 4.</note>; as the Experiment of
<hi>Psammeticus</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> shews<note n="†" place="margin">Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe. c. 2.</note>, (if true) of
shutting up Two Children in separate Caves,
where they never heard one Articulate Word,
and so could use none.</p>
            <p>So that now Man must be taught, and as he is
taught, so he speaks. But we will put the case
in which there was no Human Instructor, and
yet the Person spoke as articulately, and had
the free use of Words, and knew as well how to
express his mind by them from the very first,
as if he had had the best Helps for it in the world,
and had been never so long a time versed and
practised in it; and that Person was <hi>Adam,</hi> who
was created in a full Age, and had none before
him; and yet must as soon have Words for use,
and Skill how to use them, as he had to give
Names to the Creatures, according to their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
kinds. For without this, what Conversation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35903:8"/>
could he have with <hi>Eve,</hi> or what Comfort could
he take in her presence, (for it was not to be
call'd Society); and what a Dejection must there
be in each of them, when all other Creatures
had their Notes for understanding each other,
according to the Species they were of, but they
themselves alone were mute. So that though 'tis
not expresly said, That <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had any
Discourse; yet 'tis as certain from the reason of
the thing, as it is that God spake to them, or the
Serpent and <hi>Eve</hi> spake together. But 'tis certain
<hi>Adam</hi> must then be self-instructed, or be instructed
by God: He must then invent a Language of
himself, or he must be taught by him that made
him. If he was to teach himself, how could he
know that he was able to speak; or how can we
think he would begin his Conversation by an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
that way? For 'tis highly probable, that
they would first have began with dumb signs, or
some external motions (as we see those ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
do, that have no Words which others can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand);
or if they should at length have found
out such an Expedient, and formed some Articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Sounds, yet what a tedious course would this
have been, and how long before it could be
wrought into a Language, that they could first
Think of Words, and then Remember them,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35903:9"/>
and then Use them, and then fall into Discourse?
Don't we find how difficult it is to learn to speak
a Foreign Language, when we have all Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
for it, by Instruction and Discourse with
those that speak it? But suppose Two Persons
wholly strangers to one another, and of a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
as different as <hi>Chinese</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> should
meet together, and be constrained by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
being without other Society, to converse
with each other; though each had a Language
of their own, and knew how to speak and form
Words for Pronunciation, yet how long would
it be before they could fix the Words for it, and
to have a Term for every thing they were to
discourse about; to invent and agree upon it,
and then to remember them, and then to use
them? And then much more will the difficulties
increase, were these Two in the case of <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eve,</hi> and to beat out the Track which never any
walked in before; to invent Speech it self, and
Words to be spoken, and sufficient to express
the Thoughts of each other, so as to make Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and that Company agreeable, acceptable,
and useful. This must have been the work of
Time, if it had been practicable; and the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of it would have made each others Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
a Burden rather than a Pleasure, till such
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35903:9"/>
time as they could come to a mutual understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one anothers minds and inclinations. And
therefore to make them <hi>meet helps</hi> for each other,
it was of Necessity that they should have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Power communicated from Heaven,
and be enabled by that Instinct as soon to speak,
as the other Creatures are in a course of Nature
to utter such Voices as are suitable to their kind,
or as Mankind are to express their Passions of
Joy or Sorrow, by Laughter or Tears.</p>
            <p>So that 'tis not without reason, I rank the
Gift of Speech among those things that are of a
Divine Infusion, and so equivalent to Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>2. Another Instance of this kind, is what is
usually called Common Notions, or Natural
Impressions: <hi>Common Notions,</hi> because they are
common to all Mankind; and <hi>Natural Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
because they are conceiv'd not to be acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by any Human Means, such as Education
and Instruction, Observation and Experience;
but are imprinted on our Nature by an Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
and Supernatural Power.</p>
            <p>That there are such Notions as all Mankind do
agree in, is undeniable; such as the Belief of a
God, an Adoration to be given to him; and that
there is an essential difference between Good and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35903:10"/>
Evil, so that Good cannot by any art or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
be made or esteemed to be Evil, nor Evil
Good: For as the Natures of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
cannot be altered, so neither can our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of them.</p>
            <p>It is as undeniable, That these Notions or
Impressions are so early to be discovered, and do
so grow up with our Reason, that they seem not
to be the Effects of our Reason, but rather to be
antecedent to it; and that it is rather what we
Find, than what we Chuse; what belongs to our
Nature, than what we add to it. And accordingly
as we have a Notion, so a Sense of those things,
antecedent to all Reasoning and Instruction,
which we call Conscience, <hi>excusing or else accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi>
according to the nature of the things,
whether good or evil. Now as the Nature of
the things must be before our Conception of
them, so both must be before we pass this practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Judgment upon them: And if we do exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
this Faculty antecedent to all Instruction,
then so must the Sense of the things be, about
which it is exercised. So the Apostle, <hi>Rom. 2. 14.
When the Gentiles which have not the law, do by nature
the things contained in the law, these having not the
law, are a law unto themselves: Which shew the work
of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35903:10"/>
bearing witness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ad Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com.</hi> l. 4. c. 5. l. 5. c. 9. l. 8. c. 1.</note> &amp;c. Which is exactly agreeable
to the Phrase of the Wisest among them; So
<hi>Aristotle</hi> calls it, the <hi>Natural, Common,</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written
Law.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rhet. l. 1.</hi> c. 10, 13, 15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But above all, <hi>Cicero</hi> (who best knew the
sense of the Philosophers, and how to express
it) doth speak fully to this point, both as to
the Universality of these First Notions, and the
agreement in them by all Mankind; both as to
the nature and rise of them.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pro</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</note> 
               <hi>There is,</hi> saith he,
<hi>a certain Law, not written, but native to us, which we
have not learned, received, nor read: But we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and derived it from Nature it self; to which we were
not Taught to be conformed, but Made; it was not by
Institution,</hi>
               <note place="margin">L. 1. de Nat. Deor. &amp; L 2. de Legib.</note> 
               <hi>but Infusion.</hi> This, in another place,
he saith all men have by a <hi>certain Anticipation,</hi> and
calls them <hi>innate Cogitations;</hi> and will allow it to
come from no less a Power than what is Divine.
<hi>We have,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entio.</note> saith he, <hi>received a Conscience from the
Immortal Gods, which cannot be plucked away from us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that whatever Improvement these Notions
and Impressions may receive from an after Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
yet they seem to be implanted in us by
the same Power that made us reasonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
who no more could <hi>leave himself without
Witness</hi> in our Minds, than in the Works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And being thus antecedent to our own
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35903:11"/>
Reasoning, or other information, can proceed
from no other a Principle than Revelation doth,
and is therefore equivalent to it.</p>
            <p>III. There is a Traditionary Proof of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
which is by Testimony, or by such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
as are a part of the Revelation; and of
which, as I conceive, no tolerable account can be
given, if they are not allowed to be of Divine
Institution. In order to which,</p>
            <p>1. I observe, That the Want of a Revelation
in any particular Nation or Age, is not an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
sufficient to prove that there never was any
Revelation. For Revelation being more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of things not knowable by the mere Light
of Nature, may be lost, while the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
remains. It being in this case much as it is
in Matters of History, which may be derived
from one Generation to another, and especially
by Registers and Memorials: But if a former
Generation be careless and slothful, or the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
not faithfully wrote or kept, the Matters
of Fact in one Age are irrecoverably lost in the
next, or turned into Fables. Of which the
Earliest Times are too manifest an Instance; and
for which reason <hi>Varro</hi> did not divide them amiss,
into <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>obscure</hi> or unknown, and
<hi>fabulous.</hi> Which lasted till the First Olympiad,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35903:11"/>
and that was, at soonest, <hi>Anno Mundi 3173;</hi> when
the Historical Age, according to him, begins.
Now as the want of such Histories will not prove
that there never were any such, and much less
that there were no Matters of Fact for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
such Histories: So though there be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
or no Memorials of such a Revelation,
in some particular Nations or Ages, it will not
necessarily follow that there never was any such
Revelation made to the World.</p>
            <p>2. When I propose the Proof of a Revelation,
I would not be understood so much as to suppose,
That there was from the beginning, or before
the Time of <hi>Moses,</hi> a Pandect or Collection of
Divine Revelations; but only that there were
Inspired Persons to whom God did (as occasion
served) reveal himself <hi>in sundry times and divers
manners,</hi> such as <hi>Adam, Enoch, Noah,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. Where there has been or is no Revelation,
or pretence to it (if any such Age or People
ever were) yet there are or have been in those
Ages or Nations, certain Footsteps of such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation;
and which whereever they are found,
are as evident Marks of such a Revelation, as
Pillars or Crosses found in a Countrey at present
uninhabited, are, that there have been some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that have been there before, and have erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
those Monuments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:35903:12"/>
4. I account such Usages, Rites, and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
to proceed from Revelation, that have no
foundation in Reason, and the nature of the
thing, but are correspondent to what we call Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation;
and which can well have no reason at all
assign'd for them, if not the Reason given in that
Revelation: Such are Expiatory Sacrifices, and
other things relating to Divine Worship.</p>
            <p>5. This is the more confirmed, if such Usa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Rites and Principles have been observed,
practised, and believed, in Nations that have
had no relation one to another, no Commerce
or Communication, nor sometimes knowledge
of one another; for then they must arise from
some common Head, from whence they were ab-originally
dispersed among the several Branches
of the same Stock.</p>
            <p>When one People has been mixed with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Egyptians;</hi> or derived from
another, as the <hi>Colchi</hi> from the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> or
there have been Commerces and Confederacies,
Wars and Conquests, 'tis no wonder they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingle
in several Rites and Observances. Of
this we have a notorious Instance in Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which by the abovesaid means came to be
received by several Nations, as the <hi>Ethiopians,
Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Colchi,</hi> the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and some of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35903:12"/>
the <hi>Syrians,</hi> as <hi>Herodotus</hi> shews<note n="*" place="margin">Clio. cap. 36, 37. <hi>Enterp. cap. 104.</hi> V Bochart Geogr. Saci. Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg. <hi>l. 4. c. 31.</hi>
               </note>. But when
the Usages, Rites, and Principles have been
as well found where there has been no Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
as where there has; 'tis no less a sign
they descend from one and the same Original,
than when the Waters of the Seven Branches
of the River <hi>Nilus</hi> have one and the same Taste
and Colour, without any Communication, that
they do all descend from the Main Stream.</p>
            <p>In like manner, if we find, suppose, among
the Seventy Nations (into which 'tis said Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
was divided, upon the Confusion at <hi>Babel)</hi>
several of the same Rites and Usages, generally
speaking, concurring with those of what we call
Revelation, we must conclude, That they were
observed before that Dispersion, and were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
owing to as early an Institution.</p>
            <p>Among the Instances that I shall make use of
for the Proof of a Revelation, I shall begin with
those that relate to Divine Worship, such as
Time, Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Time.</hi> That there is some particular Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Time to be set apart for the Publick
Worship of God, either by Divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or Humane Consent, is absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
when it is to be the Act of a Society; for
Worship, without some time for such Society to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35903:13"/>
convene and assemble in, must inevitably end
in Confusion and Dissolution.</p>
            <p>And therefore as God created the World as a
Temple to exhibit and manifest himself in, and
created such Beings as should in their several Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
celebrate his Praise; so when he had finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all his Work, he established that Day which
he rested upon, to be from thenceforward devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to that Service; as we may see the Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Gen. 2. 2.</hi> I call this an Institution; for
when could that be more seasonably instituted
by Divine Authority, than at the Close of the
Creation, when the Sanctification and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of it were so immediately connected; <hi>God
blessed and sanctified it, because in it he had rested from
all his work?</hi> It being not probable that there
should be at that time no Institution, when the
Reason for it is expresly given; or that there
should be no present Obligation to observe it,
when there was an Institution. If God had no
sooner finished his Work, but he <hi>sanctified</hi> the Day
following, 'tis evident that the Obligation to
observe it must begin with the Institution: And
if he <hi>sanctified</hi> it, because on that Day he <hi>rested,</hi>
'tis as evident the Institution did begin with the
Reason of it. And then how improbable is it
that God should <hi>bless</hi> and <hi>sanctify</hi> a Particular
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35903:13"/>
Day, and yet for the space of Two thousand
Years together should leave that Day in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with the other Days of the Week, without
any distinction? How improbable again, that
it should be first instituted and made a Duty to
the <hi>Jews</hi> only for a Reason that equally concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all Mankind as well as them, because he <hi>rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi>
and for a reason existent from the first, as
well as in the time when it was instituted at <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai?</hi>
'Tis highly unreasonable to add one <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepsis</hi>
to another, and to heap Figure upon Figure,
when there is no necessity for it, contrary to all
the Rules of a Just Interpretation.</p>
            <p>Now if this be an Original and Primaeval In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
we have one Instance of a Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
so far as the Scripture is of Authority;
and surely we may demand in its behalf, to have
as much regard paid to it as we give to Prophane
Histories.</p>
            <p>But however, we are not without a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Testimony from them also in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
For it is manifest that there hath been of
great Antiquity such a Distribution of Time as
we call a Week of Seven Days; and which is
more to our purpose, That the Seventh Day was
a Festival and Religious Day. This <hi>Lucian</hi> doth
more than intimate; and long before him, <hi>Solon,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:35903:14"/>
who calls it <hi>Most Holy Day,</hi> in his Elegies, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Eusebius</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Praepar.</hi> l. 13. c. 12, <hi>p.</hi> 667</note>; and one earlier than he, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
who calls it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>The Holy Day.</hi> But
<hi>Calimachus, Homer,</hi> and <hi>Linus,</hi> are still more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
for they say it was because all the Works
of Creation were then finished. So <hi>Homer,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and 'tis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called by <hi>Linus, The Birth-day of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now there is nothing in Nature to point to
this; for there is no more to be observed from
the Motion of the Heavens for such a Septenary
distribution of Time, or Division into Weeks,
than there is for the dividing of a Day into
Hours: And consequently it must proceed from
some Institution, and from a very early Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
because of what I have observed from the
fore-cited Authors, who are of great Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
especially <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Linus:</hi> For <hi>Homer</hi> is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to have lived in or about the time of <hi>Saul,</hi>
in the Year of the World 2940, and <hi>Linus</hi> in the
time of the <hi>Judges,</hi> about the Year 2570. The
consideration of which doth make it probable,
that these Ancient Poets owed their Information
to the general Tradition of the World, rather
than to the <hi>Jews.</hi> Indeed <hi>Aristobulus</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi>
from whom <hi>Eusebius</hi> drew the abovesaid Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
saith, these Poets had borrowed them
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35903:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from the <hi>Jewish</hi> Books. But if it be consider'd how
little the <hi>Jewish</hi> Books, the Scriptures, were
known to the World before the Translation of
them by the Seventy into <hi>Greek,</hi> which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
300 Years before the Birth of our Saviour;
or how little the Opinions of the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
before the Captivity were known abroad,
it will hardly be conceived, that these things
should be known so early, and spoke of so po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
by the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets, <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Linus,</hi>
within so short a time after the Institution of the
Sabbath at <hi>Sinai,</hi> as these two lived; for <hi>Linus</hi>
must have lived within less than half an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years after the time of <hi>Moses;</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi>
in less than 400. Where if we take the lowest
term, that of <hi>Homer,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> were hardly in
a setled State, and no more in a Condition,
than they were disposed in their Temper, or
permitted by their Religion, to inform other
Nations in the Articles or Mysteries of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
So that it seems very evident, that the
Observation of the Seventh day for the Service
of God, was an ancient and general Opinion,
and especially of those who may be best pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to understand what had been the
sense of Mankind in the Ages before, or those
in which they lived. And if this was the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35903:15"/>
Opinion of those early Times, conformable to
the History of Scripture, we have sufficient
reason to offer this as an Instance of a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>2. Another instance of Revelation is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
and especially those of Expiation.
Amongst all the Rites and Usages relating to
Divine Worship, there are none that exceed
these in their Antiquity (except the Sabbath) or
Extent.</p>
            <p>For we no sooner read of God's Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Mankind, but that they offer'd Sacrifice;
no sooner of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Deliverance and Escape out
of the Deluge, but he offer'd Sacrifice: And
without doubt, as it begun, so it continued,
and was as much dispersed and observed among
Mankind before the Flood, as after it. But how
probable soever it is, that this Rite was thus
universally observed before, yet That we are not
so certain of, as we are of the Observation of it
after the Flood, when there was no Age nor Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
where it was not to be found, how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed
soever they were; of which no tolerable
Account is to be given, unless it be allowed to
have been in use before the Dispersion at <hi>Babel,</hi>
and that it was of Divine Institution. It must
have been, I say, in use before that Dispersion;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35903:15"/>
for how could all Nations fall into one and the
same Practice, and have the same Opinion of
Sacrifices, when there is nothing in the Nature
of the thing to lead them to it, if it had not
been, that they had all descended from <hi>one
Blood,</hi> from one Family, from one Body; by
which means it was conveyed into all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Branches issuing from it, and went along
with them where ever they went.</p>
            <p>Now the question is, Whence this should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise,
and what gave it this universal Acceptance
and Authority? whether the Invention of some
Eminent Persons, suppose, in those early Times?
or whether it was by Revelation from God, and
of his special Institution?</p>
            <p>There seems no great reason to think this
Service should proceed merely from the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Men, even of those pious and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed
Persons, since (as I have said) there is
nothing in the nature of the thing to lead to it. For
how could it be supposed that this should be
acceptable to Almighty God, which in it self
holds no Conformity, nor is at all suitable to
his Nature?<note place="margin">Psalm 50<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13.</note> 
               <hi>Will I eat the flesh of bulls, and drink
the blood of goats?</hi> is a true representation of it.</p>
            <p>It might become a sanguinary sort of Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
or false Gods, and wicked Spirits, to be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35903:16"/>
pleased with the Fumes and Reakings of the
Bleeding Sacrifice, as the Heathens generally
thought: But men of any understanding would
rather chuse a <hi>reasonable Service</hi> for the God that
made them reasonable Creatures, and might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
another sort of Sacrifice would be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to him than this, and acceptable without
it, <hi>viz.</hi> a Sacrifice of Praise and Prayer, of a pure
Mind, and a good Life, which the wiser Heathens
did in their Opinion exceedingly prefer. But as
for the Sacrifices and Blood of Beasts, such Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> spoke of them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with regret and displeasure; and others won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
how they first came into the World,<note place="margin">Euseb. Praepar.</note> as
<hi>Porphyry,</hi> that wrote expresly against them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What Expression could thereby be given,
suppose, of mens gratitude to God for their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and their Preservation?</hi> Who of all Mankind
is fo stupidly credulous, so foolish, that can think the
Gods delighted with such a present of Bows,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. lib. 2. Sect. 58.</note> Gall,
and Blood, which a hungry Dog would scarcely touch;
and that they should repay the favour to those that offer
it? <hi>said an ancient Heathen Poet, cited by</hi> Porphyry.</p>
            <p>But if we descend to Expiatory Sacrifices,
who could think that <hi>the Blood of Bulls and of Goats
could take away sin,</hi> and that God would accept
of that as a fit Compensation for their Crimes;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35903:16"/>
the Blood of a Brute for that of a Man, the
Life of one that is not in its own power, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of him that was?</p>
            <p>And if men were so weak as of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
to offer it; can we think the Almighty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
would accept of what was for it self only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming
his Majesty, and be so highly delighted
with it, as to testify his Acceptance of <hi>Abel</hi>'s by
the descent of a Miraculous Fire to consume it;<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. So <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </note>
and to <hi>smell a sweet savour</hi> upon <hi>Noah</hi>'s Oblation;
to appoint it as a sign of his Covenant with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi>
and lastly, to embody it into the <hi>Mosaical</hi>
Institution?</p>
            <p>It was enough, one would think, that the
Majesty of Heaven and Earth hath accepted of
the good will of the first Inventors, how poor
and low soever the Invention was; but it was
too great a Condescension to do by these as the
Heathens by their Heroes, to translate them into
the number of their Deities; too much to have
such a Mark of the Favour of Heaven, as none
of the Divine Institutions could have more.</p>
            <p>But why should we think so meanly of those
<hi>Antediluvian</hi> Patriarchs, of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abel, Enoch</hi>
and <hi>Noah,</hi> &amp;c. the first Inventors or Encouragers
of this way of Worship? At this rate happier
far were the Inventions of <hi>Adah, Jubal,</hi> and <hi>Tubal-Cain,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:35903:17"/>
that taught others how to order Cattel,
to handle the Harp and the Organ, to work in
Brass and Iron;<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 20.</note> for these did serve either the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
or Pleasures of Mankind, and were suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their nature and condition: But to offer
Bestial Sacrifices to an Infinite Spirit, was as if
we should present Mankind with the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Pleasures of the Brutes; and so it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be thought that Men (how low soever their
Understandings were) would think the Blood
of Beasts a decent Present to their Creator,
which indeed would not be so to their Superiors
here.</p>
            <p>But we have another sort of Character of
those Holy Men, who were Persons of great
Knowledge and vast Experience; who both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
their Religion from the Almighty, were
the great Props and Stays of it in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to whom the care of transmitting it
to Posterity was committed; and for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as well as others, God seemed to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
their Lives to so vast an Extent. They
were such as were eminent for their Piety; as
<hi>Abel</hi>'s Faith is one of the renowned Instances,
<hi>Heb. 11.</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> is said to <hi>walk with God,</hi> and
was in an extraordinary way rewarded for it.
Such again were they as were endued with the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35903:17"/>
Spirit of Prophecy,<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 25.</note> as <hi>Adam, Abel, Enoch,
Noah.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 9. 26.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore it cannot in reason be supposed
that ever they should think the offering the
Blood,<note place="margin">Jude 14.</note> and burning the Flesh of a Beast,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 5.</note> to be a
fit expression of their Gratitude to Almighty
God, or a means to obtain his Favour by way
of Expiation for their Sins, without his Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
            <p>It is then (as far as I conceive) evident, that
Sacrifices, of what kind soever, were not invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by men. But if they were not invented by
men, How came they to be admitted, and at
last so much to obtain in the world?</p>
            <p>I answer, They were of God's own Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and therefore were received by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs,
and accepted by himself.</p>
            <p>But then it may reasonably be demanded,
Why they should be thus honoured by a Divine
Legislation and Authority, when it is allowed
that they are in themselves not suitable to his
Nature?</p>
            <p>I answer, They were instituted as those Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were Typical, and had respect to a greater Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
that of Christ. And therefore 'tis observable,
That as Almighty God for the Comfort of <hi>Adam,</hi>
and preventing his Despair, (as has been before
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35903:18"/>
shewed) did immediately after his Expostulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with him, and Sentence pass'd upon him,
reveal his intention to pardon him, and the
Means by which it was to be procured and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3. &amp; 4.</note> 
               <hi>The Seed of the Woman:</hi> so in consequence of
this, and to shew their Faith in that Promise,
we read in the next Chapter, of their Sacrifices
and Offerings which they brought unto the Lord,
as a Representation of what they for their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy
had deserved, and should have suffered, had
not the Divine Mercy interposed.</p>
            <p>Now if we have represented this aright, we
have a fair account of an Expiatory Sacrifice,
and how it came to take such place among men,
and to be so universally received.</p>
            <p>We have a reason again how and why it came
to be framed into the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> and why
those Sacrifices and the Rites belonging to them,
were made a principal part of it, and have
thereby a Key to unlock many Mysteries in that
Law, and to answer many Difficulties about it,
when it is a <hi>shadow of good things to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this means again we come to understand
the special Providence of God, that this was so
much preserved and so universally dispersed and
received among mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:35903:18"/>
By this means again we have a fair account
how the Doctrine of the Cross, and the Notion
of our Saviour's Death as an Expiatory Sacrifice,
came to be soon entertained among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi>
for being of God's Institution, as he preserved it,
so being thus preserved, it became an excellent
introduction, and prepared Mankind for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
and reception of our Redemption by Christ.</p>
            <p>To the same Original may the First Fruits,
Priesthood,<note place="margin">Gen. 14. 18. 20.</note> and Tenths be referr'd; the first of
which was observed from the time of <hi>Abel, Gen. 4.</hi>
and the two last long before the time of the
<hi>Mosaical</hi> Law; and therefore are to be derived
from an ancient Institution.</p>
            <p>But because it may be thought these Instances
may be liable to exception, forasmuch as they are
sometimes disputed among those themselves that
do contend for a Revelation, I shall proceed to</p>
            <p>IV. Sort of evidence, which is Supernatural,
and that is either it self a Revelation, or the
Proof of it; of the former is Prophecy; of
the latter, Miracles.</p>
            <p>1. Prophecy, or the foretelling of things to
come; whatever time they are to exist in, near
or remote. I add this latter Clause to it, to
prevent all Exception, and to distinguish Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
truly so called, from Sagacity, or Human
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35903:19"/>
Providence; which from Precedent Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and proximate Causes, may be often fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in its Conjectures or Predictions. But
now as to Infinite Power all things are alike pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and easy, and there is nothing great or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
more or less, with respect to it; so to Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Knowledge, to which <hi>one day is as a thousand
years, and a thousand years as one day,</hi> all things,
the remotest as well as nearest, are alike pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
and there is nothing distant or near with
respect to it. And therefore whereever the true
Spirit of Prophecy is, the same Power that can
foretell what shall happen to morrow, could, if
he so pleased, as easily foretell what shall happen
a Thousand Years hence; since <hi>all things are alike
naked and opened unto him with whom we have
to do.</hi> Now this sort of Knowledge can
proceed from nothing less than him, who as he
knows all things, so has all Causes in his own
Power, and can foresee how they will operate,
and what shall be the Event of such Operations,
or can dispose them to it as he pleaseth, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Causes be, whether (as we usually say)
they are Voluntary, Necessary, or Contingent;
and being thus peculiar to him, and his sole Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
'tis no less than a Species of Divine
Revelation. And therefore as none can know
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35903:19"/>
the Certainty of such Futurities and Events but
God; so none can foretell them but such as he is
pleased to reveal them to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> From whence it
was that <hi>Plato</hi> somewhere calls Prophecy, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
a <hi>Communication</hi> or <hi>Fellowship</hi> with God. For sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
now we should set before us any <hi>Epocha</hi> or
Character of Time, which the Prophecy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects;
the 160. Years from <hi>Isaiah</hi>'s naming of
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> to his Decree for building <hi>Jerusalem, Isa.
44. 28.</hi> Or the 350. Years from the Prophet's
naming <hi>Josiah,</hi> to the time he defiled those Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Places, 1 <hi>Kings 13. 2. 2 Kings</hi> 23. 16.
Or the 490. Years in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks, from his
time to the Death of Messiah <hi>Dan. 9. 2. 4.</hi> What
an infinite number of intercurrent Passages must
there be before it be brought in its proper season
to its accomplishment? And how amazing a
sight would it be, if we could lay our hand
upon the Clue of the Prophecy at its first setting
out, and follow it, making its way through all
Oppositions and Interferings, to the last Period
and Completion! But then if we turn our
Thoughts to the chief Subject of Revelation,
the Prophecy of the Incarnation of our Saviour,
as it began immediately upon the Fall, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
along through the 61 Generations, for 4000
Years together, it would be like the dispersed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35903:20"/>
Parts of a Human Body, to the Time and State
of the Resurrection, that are carried safe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
through all Transformations; and at last
when the <hi>Sea and the Grave</hi> are called upon to <hi>give
up their dead,</hi> all the Atoms and Particles are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
from their several Vehicles or Tribes they
were joined to, and fall into the same Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as before in this present state. Much such a
Subject have we before us, which after various
Windings and Turnings, and an Infinite Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Causes and Events; we read, <hi>That it might
be fulfilled—and as it was spoken by the mouth of the
holy Prophets, which have been since the world began,</hi>
Luk. 1. 70.</p>
            <p>So that as many Prophecies as we have, or the
world ever had, so many Evidences have we of
a Supernatural and Divine Revelation.</p>
            <p>And this all Mankind have had a belief of, as
is manifest from the Oracles they consulted upon
all emergent occasions; many of which were
very ancient, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> tells us that of <hi>Jupiter
Hammon</hi> in <hi>Lybia</hi> was. I acknowledge that these
were full of Imposture, and were despised for it
by the Wiser part of the Heathens, such as <hi>Tully,
(Lib. 1, 2. de Divinat.)</hi> and detected, as <hi>Eusebius</hi>
shews, <hi>(Praepar. Evang. l. 4. Init. &amp; l. 9. c. 5.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:35903:20"/>
And I mention these, not that I esteem them
of any Authority; rather the contrary; but to
shew what the World thought of Prophecy,
and that even those Philosophers who diverted
themselves with the Mistakes and Impostures
of their own Oracles, never questioned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ever there were any true Prophecy; but
always allowed it, and took it for granted.</p>
            <p>So that the Impostures of their own Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
never engaged them so far, as to call in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
the Veracity of all Prophecy, or to deny
it where it was able to justify it self.</p>
            <p>2. Sort of Supernatural Evidence, is Miracles.
But of that, God willing, I shall Discourse
afterwards.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have endeavoured to shew, That
there has been a Revelation, antecedent to, or
where there was no Written Revelation: And
the Arguments and Instances have been such as
were proper to those Circumstances; such as we
are led to by the Light of Nature, and Human
Observation: And therefore though they receive
Light and Confirmation from a Written Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
are not supposed to depend upon it for
their Evidence. And if this Point has been
hereby made out and proved, we then find that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35903:21"/>
God has <hi>at sundry times and in divers maners,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
himself to mankind <hi>by the Prophets</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
Persons, from the beginning through the
<hi>Ante-diluvian</hi> and <hi>Post-diluvian</hi> Times, till the
Promulgation of a Written Law by <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be said, That these are far from amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a Certainty, and from giving us an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Assurance of a Revelation, since some
of them are disputed even among those that
own a Revelation; as the Original of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
and Sacrifices; and at the most are but
Probable Arguments.</p>
            <p>1. I answer, Probability is a fair Step to Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty;
and I may after all affirm, That the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
here offered is the best that can be given o
those Instances:</p>
            <p>2. There are such Arguments as are taken
from the Consideration of God's Nature; and
there cannot be a stronger, than what is fetch'd
from the nature of things.</p>
            <p>3. There are other Instances that are equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to a Revelation, and can proceed from no
lower a Principle; such are Speech and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Notions; the former of which in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
before recited, must be from Divine
Inspiration, and the latter from a Divine Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:35903:21"/>
4. There are those things which when they
accompany what we call a Revelation, prove
the Truth and Certainty of it; and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in a Written Revelation, become of the
Body of it, and they are Miracles.</p>
            <p>5. There are others that are the Matter of
Revelation, and they are Prophecies, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
such as are carried along in a continued Train,
and mutually confirm each other.</p>
            <p>6. There are others that are not only conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to what we own to be a Revelation, but
to Human Testimonies; and being confirmed
by both, are of great Authority.</p>
            <p>All which laid together, give us, I may say,
unquestionable Evidence, That there has been a
Revelation, or that God has made himself and
his Will known to the World by Persons cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
out, and inspired, and commissioned by him.</p>
            <p>And this is a good Preparative and Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for what is to follow, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is a
special Revelation, and that Revelation recorded
and transmitted by Writing to the World;
which is a Point in Reserve, and that will in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
be discoursed of.</p>
