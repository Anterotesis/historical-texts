            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT is to be hoped the Gentlemen of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> here at home, will give over expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we ſhould fall in love, with either their Religion, or good natures; if they allow us the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of reflecting on their ways of making Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts abroad; and That they will, at length, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of their attempts, againſt a Church; on which they could never yet faſten, the leaſt colour of theſe deceits, and crueltys.</p>
            <p>It's very hard, and even contrary to the ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Human Nature; and more to the principles of Chriſtianity, to be unconcern'd, at the ſufferings of thoſe, who are not only men, as well as our ſelvs; but members too of the ſame myſtical body.</p>
            <p>Our Church enjoyns us to pray for all thoſe, who in this tranſitory life are in trouble, ſorrow, need, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or any other adverſity. But how ſhall we do this, if we muſt take no notice, have no compaſſionate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards to thoſe, who ſuffer, on the ſole account of a Religion, which they dare not relinquiſh, out of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of conſcience; and unfeign'd love of the truth?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96006:3"/>
Till thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do ſincerely abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate theſe principles, and practiſes; they muſt not take it ill, if they be often put in mind; That theſe uſages of thoſe, who differ from them in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do unavoidably put a man on chooſing, to lye at the mercy of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> (who tho equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly zealous) yet happily differ from them in this, That a man may live under them, tho he be no <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan.</hi>

            <head>An account of the Perſecution of thoſe in the Vallys of <hi>Piemont.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT'S not our preſent deſign to give a large and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular relation of whatever has hapned on this occaſion: ſeeing what we ſhall briefly declare, will ſhew; That there was never a more cruel and unjuſt perſecution, than this lately exercis'd on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Vallys of <hi>Piemont;</hi> on the ſole ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Religion.</p>
            <p>The Churches of the Vallys of <hi>Piemont,</hi> or of the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> as they were commonly call'd, were the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienteſt of all thoſe, who drew their original from the Apoſtles; whoſe doctrine they have ever taught and follow'd.</p>
            <p>They had no need of Reformation; having never partaken of the errors and Idolatrys wherewith the Romaniſts have infected the Chriſtian Church. The ſimplicity of their manners agreed ſo well with that of their doctrins, as has forced their Enemys to confeſs; that this has eſpecially contributed to their preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They did not content themſelvs with a bare not entring into an Idolatrous and ſuperſtitious commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; but took all proper occaſions to declare their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of it; with as great courage and freedom of mind, as any of the ancient Reformers; who have all (on full enquiry) approv'd of their doctrins; as very agreeable to the Apoſtolic ſimplicity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96006:4"/>
It's no marvel then, if theſe Churches, have been ever the object of the Popiſh rage and fury: if Popes have publiſh'd cruſado's, and engag'd ſeveral Princes againſt them; if ſeveral famous Inquiſitors have employ'd at all times whatever their deviliſh malice cou'd invent to exterminate theſe poor people; and if the Council <hi>de propaganda fide, &amp; extirpandis hoereticis</hi> have omitted nothing for the obtaining their deſign. But here we cannot enough admire the eſpecial providence of God, in his particular protection of theſe Churches; ſeeing maugre all theſe violent perſecutions; the perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and treacherys wherewith their Enemys have ever recompens'd their fidelity; not withſtanding 27 or 28 invaſions, which their Religion has drawn on them; and the Maſſacres which have ſo many times bathed the Vallys with the Bloud of the <hi>Vaudoiſes;</hi> yet has God ſtill preſerv'd them, by the continual turns of his providence.</p>
            <p>All Hiſtorians, even thoſe of the contrary party, are agreed, that theſe Churches were in an immemorial poſſeſſion of the exerciſe of their Religion, before they were under the government of the Dukes, or Earls of <hi>Savoy;</hi> for it was only in the year 1233, that Thomas Earl of Savoy became Maſter of the Town of <hi>Pignerol</hi> and the Vallys of <hi>Piemont,</hi> under pretence the race of the Princes of <hi>Piemont</hi> was extinct.</p>
            <p>It is alſo certain, the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> ſubmitted themſelvs to the Earls of <hi>Savoy</hi> (whence his preſent Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is deſcended,) on condition of being maintain'd in all their priviledges. And in effect, it's on this foundation, that theſe Earls being become Princes of <hi>Piemont,</hi> have maintain'd and confirm'd the <hi>Vaudois</hi> Churches, in the exerciſe of their Religion, and their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96006:4"/>
other rights and priviledges. They have granted them for this end, from time to time, ſeveral authentic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions; eſpecially in 1561, 1602, and 1603, which having been verifi'd and entered in the ſenate and cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Turin,</hi> in the year 1620 by means of a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſumm of money, (which the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> had paid for this purpoſe; as appears from the authentic act:) theſe conceſſions therefore paſt into the form of an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable deed, and perpetual and inviolable law; whoſe execution was enjoyn'd by ſeveral ſolemn decrees of the Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> from the years 1638, 1649, 1654, and 1655.</p>
            <p>The Council <hi>de propaganda fide</hi> which is oblig'd by it's foundation, title, and oath, to procure the ruin of thoſe, ſhe terms Heretics; obſerving with extream regret the calm which the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> enjoy'd, by means of theſe patents; took all poſſible meaſures to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it.</p>
            <p>To this end the Council, which then conſiſted of the principal Miniſters of the Court of <hi>Savoy,</hi> taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from the minority of <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> caus'd to be publiſh'd in the Month of January 1655 an order, which oblig'd all the Inhabitants of the Vallys, to quit the plain in 3 days; and to retire into the Mountains, on pain of death; cou'd they not make it appear, they were become Catholics.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> obey'd this order, as unjuſt and cruel as it was: but their obedience, which took away all pretences from their Enemys, cou'd not preſerve them from that horrid Maſſacre in 1655, of which poſterity will freely ſpeak as an action the moſt in human and perfidious, mention'd in any writing.</p>
            <p>This Maſſacre was likely in all appearance, to have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96006:5"/>
cut off all the <hi>Vaudoiſes;</hi> but there were many of them, who eſcaping-out of the hands of theſe Butchers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to defend their lives. They executed then this reſolution, with ſuch Vigor and Courage, that they put their executioners to flight, in ſeveral rencounters; till the Proteſtant Princes and States became mediators in their behalf.</p>
            <p>Theſe generous protectors having heard of this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Maſſacre, were not contented to open the Bowels of their charity and benificence; but interpoſed earneſtly for them with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> by their interceſſions. The Evangelic Cantons amongſt others, ſent for this reaſon four Embaſſadors to the Court of <hi>Turin,</hi> who joyn'd themſelvs to the envoy of <hi>France,</hi> who was to be arbitrator in this affair for his Maſter; all which joyntly ſollicited this matter, and obtain'd for the Churches and inhabitants of the Vallys, the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their priviledges definitively and irrevocably, by a ſolemn patent which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> granted the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Auguſt 1655, entered according to form in the ſenate and chamber of <hi>Turin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may ſeem, that after a patent of this nature, which carrys the title and character of a perpetual and inviolable law, giv'n in the preſence, and at the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Embaſſadors of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Switzerland;</hi> and of which the King of <hi>France</hi> had declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf guarante; it wou'd ſeem (I ſay) that the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> ſhou'd enjoy the fruits of a peace, purchaſed by the Bloud of above 6000 of their Brethren; but all this cou'd not preſerve them from the violence of their Enemys.</p>
            <p>The Council for <hi>propagation</hi> violated this patent in the moſt eſſential points, and perſecuted the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:96006:5"/>
by divers unjuſt and wrongful means. And they offering only complaints againſt theſe perſecutions, their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys took their patience, for want of courage, and thinking they cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d oppreſs them without any reſiſtance, they brought in again amongſt 'em the diſmal effects of Fire and Sword; and renew'd in 1663 the miſerys and violencys of 1655.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> knowing by experience, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was their only means of ſafety, were therefore forced to ſtand on their guard, which ſucceeded ſo well, that they had procured their peace, and ſettled their affairs towards the end of the year 1663.</p>
            <p>Then it was, that the Evangelic Cantons, ſent again Embaſſadors to the Court of <hi>Turin,</hi> to be mediators of the peace; which Embaſſadors being joyn'd, as the preceding were, to the <hi>French</hi> reſident at <hi>Turin,</hi> they procured again for the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> a ſolemn, perpetual, and irrevocable patent in the Month of Feb. 1664. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative of the preceding, and entered according to form as before.</p>
            <p>But this patent was not executed with greater ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than the former, altho' the Duke had paſt his word to the Cantons of <hi>Switzerland</hi> in a letter of the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Feb. 1664. to make it be punctually obſerv'd.</p>
            <p>It's hardly poſſible to deſcribe the turnings and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the ſhifts and tricks which the Council for <hi>propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> made uſe of, to render this patent of none effect to the <hi>Vaudoiſes.</hi> It's ſufficient to ſay, they cou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have defended themſelvs againſt ſuch malicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, had not God, in whoſe hands are the hearts of Kings and Princes overruled that of <hi>Charles Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Prince having nearly examin'd the conduct of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96006:6"/>
the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> found it was without reaſon they were made ſo odious; and calling to mind the zeal they had ſhew'd in his ſervice in ſeveral occaſions, eſpecially in 1638 and 1640, when they expoſed themſelvs ſo vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly in his defence againſt his Enemys, whilſt moſt of his Eſtates had revolted againſt him, he reſolv'd to uſe them for the future as ſubjects, which deſerv'd his love, as well as his protection.</p>
            <p>The warr which he had with the <hi>Genoiſes</hi> in 1672. greatly confirm'd him in his good opinion of the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiſes.</hi> For they ſerv'd him in it with ſuch zeal and courage, that this Prince thought it not enough, to give 'em publick commendations for their valor and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, in a letter he wrote to them on this occaſion; but protected them as long as he liv'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam Royal</hi> his <hi>Widow,</hi> treated them after his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; not only with great gentleneſs and favors, but engag'd her ſelf by a letter to the <hi>Switz</hi> Cantons dated 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Jan. 1679. to maintain and protect the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> in the full exerciſe of their Religion, and their other priviledges.</p>
            <p>We have lightly touch'd on all theſe things, that we might not paſs the bounds preſcribed. For beſides that they ſerve to ſhew, that the rights and priviledges of the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> were grounded on unmovable foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; and that their Enemys have ever violated the moſt ſolemn and authentic engagements, and only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed crueltys, injuſtices, and perfidiouſneſſes againſt them; They likewiſe ſerve to juſtify the conduct, which the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> have obſerved to the end; which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the ſubject of this relation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> had flattered themſelvs, that under the government of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> now reigning,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96006:6"/>
they might enjoy ſome hopes of tranquility. They had done him very conſiderable ſervices in 1684. in the warr againſt the <hi>Banditi</hi> of <hi>Mondovi.</hi> And this Prince had giv'n them authentic aſſurances of his ſatisfaction, &amp; good will towards them, in a letter he wrote to them on this occaſion; and the beginnings of his reign ſeem'd to promiſe them for the future, that in rendring to Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar that which is Ceſar's, they ſhou'd have the liberty of rendring to God what belong'd to him. They fed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs with theſe hopes, when the Governor of the Vallys of <hi>Piemont</hi> publiſh'd towards the end of the year 1685 an order, forbidding all ſtrangers to inhabit in theſe Vallys, and to remain therein more than 3 days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his leave, and alſo the inhabitants to entertain or lodg them under grievous penaltys.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> had by this time bin inform'd of the violences offered in <hi>France,</hi> to force the Proteſtants to change their Religion: They farther underſtood that the King of <hi>France</hi> had cancel'd the edict of <hi>Nants,</hi> and they well perceiv'd this prohibition of ſheltring their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren might prove of dangerous conſequence to them. But they did not forſee the miſerys which have hapned to them, becauſe men do naturally love to flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, and their Enemys uſed all endeavors, to remove out of their minds all the thoughts which fear might inſpire them with, to the end they might be taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided.</p>
            <p>They were in this condition, when his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs orders were proclaimed in the Vallys, being the 31<hi rend="sup">st</hi> of Jan. 1686. which ſtrictly forbad the exerciſe of their Religion on pain of death, and confiſcation of their eſtates; enjoyning all their Churches to be demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd, and the baniſhment of all the Miniſters; that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96006:7"/>
the Infants ſhou'd be Baptiz'd and brought up in the Popiſh Religion, on penalty of their Fathers being ſent to the Gallys, with many other particulars, to the ſame purpoſe, as the King of <hi>France</hi>'s declaration, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul'd the edict of <hi>Nants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's impoſſible to deſcribe the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> fears and griefs, at the news of ſo ſurpriſing an order, ſo much more terrible than the former, as being to produce ſuch tragical effects. For the preceding tended only to bound them in more narrow limits, and to deprive them of the right of inhabiting the plain, which they had done time out of mind; but the order of the 31 of Jan. wholly took from them all liberty of conſcience, and exerciſe of their Religion.</p>
            <p>They ſaw themſelvs immediatly precipitated into a dreadful abyſs of miſerys, without any remedy; and forced to behold either the light of the Goſpel extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh't in the Vallys, which had there ſhined for ſo many ages, or the renewing thoſe cruel Maſſacres, which has ſacrific'd ſo many of their Brethren: yet being perſwaded this order was the effect of ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation of them by their Enemys to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they betook themſelvs to their uſual courſe of ſupplications, and humble remonſtrances; and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted four requeſts to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to obtain the revocation of this order. But gaining only ſome time in the execution of it, they ſaw their misfortune was without remedy. And they were more confirm'd in the aſſurances of their miſerys, when they underſtood the King of <hi>France</hi> (who on politic reaſons had always protected them, and even declared himſelf the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dante of the patents aforementioned) had not only oblig'd the Duke to iſſue forth this order; but that his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96006:7"/>
moſt Chriſtian Majeſty had cauſed his Troops to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to <hi>Piemont</hi> to ſee it executed.</p>
            <p>Then it was, that the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> began to think of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending themſelvs from the Invaſions of theſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, and not to dye like Beaſts or fools.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Evangelic <hi>Cantons</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of this order, and the meaſures taken for it's exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, believ'd themſelvs no waies oblig'd to forſake a people perſecuted for mere Religion, and that they ought to appear on this occaſion as heretofore.</p>
            <p>It was reſolv'd then in an aſſembly held at <hi>Baden</hi> in the month of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1686. to ſend again Embaſſadors to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to intercede in the behalf of the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiſes:</hi> who arriv'd at <hi>Turin</hi> in the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> and offered their requeſt, tending to the revocation of the order ſet forth in the 31 of <hi>Jan.</hi> They ſhew'd, That the Evangelick <hi>Cantons</hi> were intereſſed in this affair, not only as being of the ſame belief, as the <hi>Vaudoiſes;</hi> but for that the Patents of 1655 and 1633. which this order annul'd, were the fruits of their mediation; and they accompany'd theſe their demands with ſeveral ſolid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
            <p>The Court of <hi>Turin</hi> pretended not to anſwer their reaſons, thinking it enough to tell the Embaſſadors, that the engagements of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> with the King of <hi>France,</hi> were directly oppoſite to the ſucceſs of their negotiation. Which oblig'd the Embaſſadors to remonſtrate, in a memorial for this purpoſe, That his Royal Highneſs's Predeceſſors having given their Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al word to ſeveral States, and particularly to the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick <hi>Cantons,</hi> for the executing the Patents granted to the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> he could not renounce ſuch formal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, becauſe theſe Patents were not mere Tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96006:8"/>
but perpetual Conceſſions, and inviolable laws; and for as much alſo that they having been granted at the requeſt of ſeveral Princes, they be, according to the law of Nations, laſting Monuments of publick faith; in that the words of Princes ſhould be Sacred and inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>They alſo ſhew'd, that ſeveral politick reſpects ſhould induce the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to maintain the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> in their priviledges: That it conſiſted not with his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and bounty to ſuffer his Countries to be fil'd with blood and ſlaughter; by deſtroying a people, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored his grace and Clemency; and who had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deſerving theſe ſeverities.</p>
            <p>But neither the reaſonings of the Embaſſadors, nor their preſſing ſollicitations, nor the letters of interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which ſeveral Proteſtant Princes wrote again in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of theſe poor people, produced any effect. They ſerving only to confirm the Embaſſadors in their belief, of the engagements wherein the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with the King of <hi>France,</hi> to deſtroy the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>All this while the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> were ignorant of what paſt in <hi>Turin.</hi> They knew nothing of the Embaſſadors being at Court, nor their Tranſactions; becauſe care was taken to ſtop two Meſſengers in their paſſage, who were to carry the news into the Vallys. It's true indeed they knew ſometime after, by a common report, that theſe Embaſſadors were at <hi>Turin</hi> to demand the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the order of the 31 of <hi>January;</hi> but they could hear nothing certain, touching the effect of their Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation. They durſt not go themſelvs to <hi>Turin,</hi> ſince the time allowed them was expired, and for that the Court had refuſed a ſafe conduct, which the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96006:8"/>
had deſired for the deputies of the Vallys appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to ſollicit their own affairs, as was practis'd in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer occaſions.</p>
            <p>However the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> had fortified themſelvs with ſome Retrenchments in their Country, and ſtood on their guard, to hinder the entrance of the Troops, moſt of which were already encamped, at the foot of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> return'd anſwer to the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors propoſals, by the Marqueſs of St. Thomas, one of his Miniſters of State; who has the management of Forreign affairs; and who ſwore to them, that the Duke could not revoke this order, he not being the maſter of this affair.</p>
            <p>He alſo proteſted to them, as from the part of his Highneſs, that provided the order was executed, the Duke would not refuſe to enter into ſome expedients. He alſo ſhew'd them that on their account, the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> ſhould have leave to depart the Country, and diſpoſe of their eſtates.</p>
            <p>The Embaſſadors thinking the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers nor Troops, could not ſuſtain a war, againſt two ſuch powerful enemies, as the King of <hi>France</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who were united for their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; They imagin'd then, that to avert the Tempeſt, with which theſe poor people were threatned, they ought to ſollicit their departure, and diſpoſal of Eſtates. But foraſmuch as before they could enter on this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation, they muſt conſult thoſe of the <hi>Vallys;</hi> the Embaſſadors therefore got leave of the Court of <hi>Turin,</hi> that they might take a Journey thither; for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they had a Letter from the Duke, to the Governor of the <hi>Vallys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Embaſſadors arriv'd there the 22 of <hi>March,</hi> and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96006:9"/>
the next Morning cauſed an Aſſembly of the people's Deputys, to be ſummon'd, to whom they declared, what they had done. In fine, they ſhewed them, that in the condition they were in, depriv'd of all hope of ſuccour; they had no other part to take, but that of leaving their Country; provided it could be obtain'd with the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of their Eſtates; and if they would accept of this propoſal, they would offer it as from them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> deputys greatly ſurpriz'd, that they muſt expect no ſuccour, in an occaſion wherein they hoped all the Proteſtant States would concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs; anſwer'd the Embaſſadors they were ſenſible they could not do better than to follow their advice; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could reſolve on an affair of this importance, they muſt conſult a general aſſembly.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Embaſſadors return'd to <hi>Turin,</hi> where they inform'd the Marqueſs of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of the ſucceſs of their Journey, who aſſured them this Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was very agreeable to the Court. They afterwards deſired a paſs-Port to bring thither ſome of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the <hi>Vallys,</hi> with the determinations of this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. But this was refuſed them under two preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the firſt, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> would have no <hi>Vaudoiſe</hi> to be ſeen following his Court; and the other was, that he would not have it thought, that what he did, was out of any other reſpect than the gratifying the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors. They were then obliged to ſend into the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys</hi> the Secretary of the Embaſſy, to fetch theſe people's determinations.</p>
            <p>The Secretary found the people aſſembled at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grogne</hi> the 28 of <hi>March,</hi> being much divided in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions; for if on the one hand, they ſaw the dreadful conſequences of this War; ſo on the other the dangers
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96006:9"/>
and inſuperable difficulties in departing the Country; which ſuppoſing they could do, without any danger, yet they could not, without great regret, leave their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and Country, to travel to Forreign parts; where they muſt lead a vagrant and uneaſie life.</p>
            <p>In fine they agreed to ſend a memorial to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, of the dangers and difficulties, which hindred their paſſage; and to write them a Letter ſign'd by nine Divines, and eight of the Laity, in which having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated them to reflect on theſe obſtacles, they declared, they would remit themſelvs to their prudence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
            <p>On this Letter the Embaſſadors endeavour'd to obtain leave for the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> to leave the States of <hi>Piemont,</hi> and to diſpoſe of their goods; But the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to whom the propoſal was carried, ſent word to them, that before he could give a poſitive anſwer to what they deſired, he expected the people of the <hi>Vallys</hi> ſhould ſend Deputys to him, with full power to make him thoſe ſubmiſſions, which were due to him; and to beg leave of him to withdraw from his States, as a favour which they implored of their Prince.</p>
            <p>The Embaſſadors might well be ſurpriz'd at this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the Scene; having bin refuſed the ſafe conduct which they had a little before requeſted, to bring the <hi>Vaudoiſe</hi> Deputys to <hi>Turin.</hi> They had binſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times told, that the grant of a Retreat to the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiſes</hi> ſhould be wholly in conſideration of the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors. Whereas now, it muſt not be the Embaſſadors, who demand the leave, as a propoſal coming from them; but it muſt on the contrary be the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> who make this requeſt themſelvs.</p>
            <p>This contrary courſe was not without ſome reaſon;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96006:10"/>
For the Council of <hi>propagation</hi> who manag'd this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, had without doubt theſe two ſeveral conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; The one, that they wou'd not have the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors named in the permiſſion of departure, that they might have leſſ right to demand the execution of the things promiſed to the <hi>Vaudoiſes;</hi> The other, that the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> alone requeſting this permiſſion, as a grace, or favour, they might impoſe on them ſuch conditions, as they pleas'd; and laſtly, that the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> making the ſubmiſſions which the Duke required, they muſt appear in the condition of ſupplicants, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay down their arms, otherwiſe they cou'd not be receiv'd, as ſuch.</p>
            <p>But however it was, the Embaſſadors being deſirous to take away all pretence from the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> Enemys, took the ſafe conduct, and ſent it by the ſecretary of the Embaſſy; who aſſembled the people for the naming their deputys. But as on the one hand, there were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who never deſign'd to leave their Country; ſo on the other, the ſuddain march of their Enemys, filled them with ſuſpicions and contrary opinions; ſo that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions giv'n into their Deputys, prov'd quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. For ſome were for requeſting the permiſſion of retiring from the Country, and diſpoſing of their eſtates; and others for petitioning, that they might have the free exerciſe of their Religion, and enjoyment of their other rights and priviledges.</p>
            <p>Theſe Deputys being come to <hi>Turin,</hi> the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors thought it not fitting, they ſhou'd appear at Court thus divided; they ſent them therefore back again to the Vallys to be united, and labour'd in the mean while to get a farther delay.</p>
            <p>Their Enemys apprehended with great ſatisfaction
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96006:10"/>
the diviſions, about leaving the Country; and were ſo well perſwaded this wou'd be an infallible means to ruin them; that they ſent perſons expreſly amongſt them, to keep up this contrariety of determinations. It's alſo to be preſum'd, they had deviſed this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, touching the departure; as a means to diſunite the <hi>Vaudoiſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To make then the greater advantage of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reſolutions of theſe people, their Enemys altered again their deſign. They had lately before declared, they expected firſt that the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> themſelvs ſhou'd ſue for leave to depart, and to offer their ſubmiſſions. The <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> had not made theſe ſubmiſſions, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented their petition for a departure; there being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral amongſt them, who never yet reſolv'd to leave the Country; neither did the Embaſſadors ſollicit the permiſſion of departure, but a delay, as appears from a letter which they wrote to the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> the 8 of April 1686. However to compleat the diviſion of the <hi>Vaudoiſes;</hi> to deſtroy them with greater eaſe, there ſuddainly iſſued out, unknown to the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, an edict of the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the ſame Month of April, which granted to the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> a pardon and leave to retire out of the Countrys of <hi>Piemont.</hi> But to the end we may the better judg of the deſign of the Council of <hi>propagation,</hi> here's a copy of this edict tranſlated out of <hi>Italian.</hi>

            <p>This edict was publiſht in the <hi>Vallys,</hi> on the 11th of <hi>April,</hi> the ſame day the Embaſſadors wrote a Letter to ſome of the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> to know their reſolutions. They in the mean time preſented a very earneſt Memorial to the Marqueſs of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> to obtain ſome aſſurance, that the Troops ſhould not enter into the <hi>Vallys,</hi> and to procure the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> ſome more favorable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than thoſe in the edict.</p>
            <p>But the Court of <hi>Turin</hi> gave them to underſtand, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96006:13"/>
there was nothing to be done for the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> till ſuch time as they had laid down their Arms, of which the Embaſſadors gave advice to the Deputys of the <hi>Vallys,</hi> which had bin at <hi>Turin,</hi> by a Letter of the 13 inſtant, which they wrote them on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>On the 14th the Commons call'd a general Aſſembly at <hi>Rocheplate,</hi> in which having examin'd the terms and conditions of the edict, they judged that their enemies had nothing farther from their intentions, than to let them have the benefit of the pretended paſs, and that this edict was but a ſnare to entangle them, the more eaſily to work their deſtruction. They reſolved then, not to accept it; to follow the example of their Fathers, and to remit the events to God's providence. So that this Edict which was only given for the dividing them, had a direct contrary effect, and turned to the uniting them, in the ſame particular judgment.</p>
            <p>The chief reaſons which hindered them from accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Edict were firſt, that ſeeing it enjoyned the perfect execution of the declaration of the 31 of <hi>Jan.</hi> which commands all the Churches to be demoliſht in eight days time, becauſe the edict expreſsly ſays, that if in eight days they perform not what it contains, they are deprived of the favors and benefits which it offers them. To perform then the commands contained in the Edict, the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> themſelvs muſt demoliſh their own Churches or their enemies for them. The <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> could never bring themſelves to the doing this, with their own hands, they muſt then have Soldiers ſent them, who under pretence of this demolition, would have infallibly fal'n on them. Secondly, had they bin permitted to depart fairly, why was not the execution of the order of the 31 of <hi>Jan.</hi> ſuſpended, till ſuch time
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96006:13"/>
as they could poſſibly get away? why ſhould they be obliged to demoliſh their Churches in the eight days time allowed them to prepare themſelvs to leave for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Country? What is this for, but to render their eſcape impoſſible. Thirdly, this Edict commands they ſhould lay down their Arms, and lay open their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys to Popiſh Prieſts, and other Emiſſarys. Now it's plain, that in laying down their Arms, they muſt lye at the mercy of their Enemies and at the fury of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who would not have fail'd entring in upon them, to hinder their eſcape; and torment them till ſuch time as they had chang'd their Religion, as they have done in <hi>France.</hi> And their dreadful apprehenſions had too certain grounds, ſeeing they had no aſſurance given them, That the Troops ſhould not come down into the <hi>Vallys.</hi> Fourthly, the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> are alſo oblig'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in three ſeparate Companys, and to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs in ſuch places, where the Soldiers being encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they could not fail of having their throats cut. Fifthly, The permiſſion which the ſame Edict gives the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> of ſelling their goods, was to them of no uſe. For beſides that Sale could not be made, till after their departure, to Catholicks, and that too by Popiſh Officers, ſo alſo out of the money rais'd from the Sale of the ſame goods muſt be indemnis'd, the Fryers, the Miſſionarys, the Ancient, the Modern, and the future Catholicks for the dammages and intereſts which they might pretend to, and which they would not fail to make to amount to above the value of the eſtates ſold. Sixthly, the Edict imports, that beſides thoſe who ſhall leave the <hi>Vallys</hi> of their own free will, the Prince reſerves to himſelf the power of baniſhing ſuch as he ſhall think good, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the peace of thoſe who ſhall remain; which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96006:14"/>
not only that the conditions of the Edict were ſo diſadvantagious, that there muſt be ſeveral <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> who wou'd not accept of them, nor move thence: but moreover that the departure it ſelf was to be lookt on, not as a favor, but as a puniſhment to be impoſed on ſeveral <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> ſeeing they reſerv'd the power of ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing thoſe, who were willing to remain. Seventhly, the Embaſſadors were not named in the Edict, and the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> had no ſecurity for the faithful performance of the things therein contained. They had then reaſon to be in a great diſtruſt; but the coſtly experiences which they had had in ſeveral occaſions of the perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs of their Enemys, and particularly in this, wherein were violated all the laws of juſtice, made their ſuſpicion but too well grounded.</p>
            <p>In fine, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> having declared, that he was not the Maſter of this affair, by reaſon of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements he lay under to the King of <hi>France,</hi> it was not to be preſum'd that his moſt <hi>Chriſtian Majeſty,</hi> who had intereſs'd himſelf in the buſineſs, wou'd be more kind to the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> than he had bin to his own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> ſent then their determinations to the Embaſſadors, who uſed all poſſible means to procure them more certain and advantagious conditions, than thoſe contain'd in the Edict, but neither their reaſons or ſollicitations cou'd obtain any thing for them. They were continually told, that as long as the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> were in arms, there cou'd be nothing granted them, or any poſitive promiſes made. So that the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> being perſwaded, that the deſign of diſarming them, was to deſtroy them with leſs difficulty, cou'd by no means aſſent to ſo fooliſh propoſals, and therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96006:14"/>
in the reſolution of defending themſelvs, in caſe of invaſion.</p>
            <p>There hapned a paſſage which ſerv'd greatly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in this reſolution. For 2 or 3 days after the publication of the Edict Mr. <hi>Tholozan,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gautier,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gavante,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cabriol,</hi> and ten or twelve others of the inhabitants of the Vallys, came to the Intendant to acquaint him, that they and their familys deſign'd to be gon out of the eſtates of <hi>Piemont,</hi> conformably to the Edict; and therefore requeſted of him paſs-ports, which he refuſed them, on pretence they muſt ſtay to go out with the reſt.</p>
            <p>And farther, there being ſeveral, who refuſed to yield to the ſollicitations he made them, for the changing their Religion, he caus'd 'em to be put in Priſon, where they have many of 'em periſhed. There needed no more to ſhew they intended, not to let them leave the Country, or tarry behind without turning Papiſts.</p>
            <p>However the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> having read a letter from the Embaſſadors, aſſembled themſelvs again at <hi>Rocheplate,</hi> on the <hi>19th</hi> of April, where they found it neceſſary to ſtand on their own defence. It was alſo decreed in this aſſembly, that all the Miniſters ſhou'd preach, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacrament, the Sunday following, which was Eaſter day.</p>
            <p>Some of this Vally chang'd their minds, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating their purpoſes to the reſt. And the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Church of <hi>Villeſeche,</hi> wrote to the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, which were then at <hi>Turin,</hi> on the point of their departure, a letter dated the <hi>20th</hi> of April, in which they declared, they wou'd obey the Edict, and on this account entreated them, to procure them a paſs-port and ſome time to prepare themſelvs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:96006:15"/>
One of the Embaſſadors took the pains to go to the Camp, to make this requeſt, but it was refuſed him, under pretence that the time was expired. For it was always too ſoon or too late.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> came to the Camp ſome days after the publication of the Edict, to diſcourage the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> by his preſence, and to oblige them to ſubmit to the conditions impoſed on them. He had made a review of his troops, and thoſe of <hi>France;</hi> who were encampt near the plain, at the foot of the <hi>Alps.</hi> His army conſiſted of the troops of his houſhold, of all his forces, both horſe and foot, of the militia of <hi>Mondovi, Barjes, Bagnols,</hi> and a great number of free <hi>Booters.</hi> And the <hi>French</hi> army conſiſted of ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of horſe and Dragoons, of 7 or 8 Batalions of foot which had paſt the Mounts, and part of the garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Pignerol</hi> and <hi>Caſal.</hi> He had moreover ſet all things in order, to attack the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> aſſoon as the limited time ſhou'd be expired, having appointed his army to force the Vally of <hi>Lucerna,</hi> and the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of <hi>Angrogne:</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> army to attack the Vallys of St. <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Peirouſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> on their ſide, had taken ſome care to defend themſelvs. They only held one part of the Vally of <hi>Lucerna.</hi> For the Town which gives the name to this Vally, and ſeveral other conſiderable places was in the Enemys hands. The Commonalty of <hi>Angrogne,</hi> to which ſeveral give the name of a Vally, by reaſon of it's great extent, was not wholly in the hands of the <hi>Vaudoiſes.</hi> They were Maſters in the Vally of <hi>Peirouſe,</hi> only of ſome places which depend on the ſtates of <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont;</hi> for this Vally is divided between the <hi>French</hi> King and the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> but they held all the Vally of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96006:15"/>
St. <hi>Martin,</hi> which is ſtronger than any of the reſt by it's ſituation.</p>
            <p>They had fortify'd themſelvs in each of theſe Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys, by ſeveral Retrenchments of Wood and Stone; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about 2500 men able to bear Arms, having choſen their Officers from the moſt conſiderable Perſons of their own Countrey, there being no Forreigners amongſt them, and they thus expected the Enemy with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. But as on one hand they had no regulated Troops, nor experienc'd Officers, and on the other, there were ſeveral <hi>Vardoiſes</hi> who had bin corrupted or fal'n off from their reſolutions, during the Negotiation, ſo it is not to be marvel'd at, if they took not all neceſſary precautions. One of the greateſt faults they committed was their undertaking to keep all their Poſts. For had they abandoned thoſe at the fartheſt diſtance, and retired into the Retrenchments, within the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, ther's no likelyhood they could have bin attackt with any ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>The 22 of <hi>April</hi> being the day appointed for the On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, the French Army commanded by <hi>Catinat</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Caſal,</hi> marcht two hours before day by Torch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, againſt the <hi>Vallys</hi> of <hi>Peirouſe</hi> and St <hi>Martin,</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along the River of <hi>Cluſon,</hi> being the French King's Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Catinat</hi> drew out a Detachement of Foot, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Ville-Vielle</hi> a Lieutenant Colonel, who having paſt over the River on a Bridge, entred into the vally of <hi>Peirouſe Piemontoiſe.</hi> He poſſeſt himſelf of St. <hi>Germain,</hi> a Village which the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> had forſaken, and came and inſulted over a Retrenchment, not far off, wherein there were 200 men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> after ſome reſiſtance, quitted this
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96006:16"/>
Poſt; and betook themſelvs to another, which lay more advantagiouſly. In the mean time, a new Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Horſe and Dragoons, having in like manner paſt the River, came to the aſſiſtance of the Infantry, who had began the fight. They did all they could to gain the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> Retrenchment which they thought no hard task, ſeeing they were ſix to one; but they found here ſuch vigorous defence, that having loſt a great many men, they Retrench'd themſelvs within Piſtol ſhot. Both partys held continual firing for 10 hours, but in fine, the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> iſſued out from their Trenches, with their Swords in their hands ſurprizing the <hi>French,</hi> who did not expect ſuch a bold action, and drove them into the plain beyond <hi>Cluſon,</hi> where by good hap, they found a Bridg, which ſav'd them from drowning.</p>
            <p>There were in this Rencounter, above 500 <hi>French</hi> kil'd, and wounded; and amongſt the reſt, ſeveral Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of note; and the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> on their ſide, loſt but two men, and had ſome few wounded. The relation, which the contrary party has wrote, on this ſubject, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled an account of the war againſt the Religionarys called <hi>Barbets,</hi> agrees touching the great loſs, the <hi>French</hi> made; ſaying the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> fought ſo deſperately, as forced the <hi>French</hi> to an unhandſome retreat beyond <hi>Cluſon.</hi> In this defeat, <hi>Ville-Vielle</hi> betook himſelf to the Church of St. <hi>Germain,</hi> with 70 Soldiers, and ſome Officers; who being ſummon'd to ſurrender himſelf on terms of good Quarter, he refuſed, and ſhew'd great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, tho' ſeveral of his people were kil'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> had certainly forced him to yeild, had not the approaches of the Night, and the wearineſs of that day's exerciſe induced them to give over. Having therefore left a guard at the Church door, the reſt went
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96006:16"/>
to ſeek ſome refreſhments. <hi>Ville-Vielle</hi> was carry'd off at break of day, by the aſſiſtance of ſome Troops, which the Governour of <hi>Pignerol</hi> had ſent ſecretly in the night. The <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> then return'd to their Retrenchments, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to be again attackt, but the Enemy, altho re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited by freſh forces, contented themſelvs with En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping about Piſtol ſhot diſtance, without firing on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, for two days together.</p>
            <p>Whilſt things thus paſt in <hi>Peirouſe,</hi> the body of the <hi>French</hi> King's Army advanced from <hi>Cluſon,</hi> to the Fort of <hi>Peirouſe.</hi> When <hi>Catinat</hi> drew out a Retrenchment of Horſe, commanded by <hi>Melac,</hi> which having paſt over the River, on two Bridges, went wheeling about to gain the high grounds, which ſeparate the Vally of St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> by a Village named <hi>Rioclaret.</hi> But thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in this Vally, not expecting to be attackt after their offers of compliance with the terms of the Edict; eſpecially conſidering the day, denoted for their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of this Vally, was not come. They therefore had not put themſelvs into a condition of defence, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they make any reſiſtance; whereupon they choſe to lay down their Arms and to implore the pitty and compaſſions of the Victors. But the French, being enraged, at what had paſt, at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> contented not themſelvs with burning, raviſhing and plundering, but Maſſacred, without diſtinction of age and ſex with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of fury, all thoſe, whom flight could not ſave from their cruelty. <hi>Catinat</hi> having ravag'd all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Rioclaret,</hi> in the moſt barbarous manner imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, left ſome Troops in the Vale of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> and traverſt with the main body of the Army, the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which ſeparate this Vally, from that of <hi>Peirouſe;</hi> and went and encampt, without finding any reſiſtance,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96006:17"/>
in the vally of <hi>Peirouſe;</hi> where the Souldiers Maſſacred all thoſe, who fell into their hands; without ſparing men, women, or children. In the mean time the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, which <hi>Melac</hi> commanded, having encampt one night on the riſings of the Vally of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered through ſeveral parts into this Vally, directed by the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> who were ſo wicked to lead them, thro unknown ways, to all others, but only the inhabitants of the Countrey.</p>
            <p>He left in all places, where he paſt, the marks of an unheard of fury; and went and joyned himſelf to the reſt of the Army, which lay encampt at <hi>Pramol.</hi> We ſhall not give here a particular account of the crueltys exercis'd, in theſe occaſions, and ſeveral others; but content our ſelvs in reciting in the ſequel of this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſome inſtances, which may make us judg of the reſt.</p>
            <p>We muſt of neceſſity, break off the relation, of what the <hi>French</hi> did in <hi>Peirouſe;</hi> ſeeing there happen'd ſuch things in the Vallys of <hi>Lucerna,</hi> and <hi>Angrogne,</hi> which ſhould be firſt taken notice of.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy's</hi> Army being come to the plain of St. <hi>John</hi> the 22 of <hi>April,</hi> were drawn out into ſeveral bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys which attackt diverſe Retrenchments, which the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> had in the Vallys of <hi>Lucerna</hi> and <hi>Angrogne.</hi> The <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> not being able to withſtand the Enemy's Cannon, in ſuch places, which likewiſe lay open to the Horſe, were forced after ſome reſiſtance to abandon part of theſe Retrenchments, and to betake themſelvs to a Fort, more advantagiouſly ſituated, near <hi>Angrogne,</hi> to the number of 500 men.</p>
            <p>The Enemy having burnt all the houſes which they came near, they afterwards aſſaulted the Fort of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96006:17"/>
               <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> who defended themſelvs ſo vigorouſly, with ſhot and ſtones, againſt this great body, that they kept their poſt all that day, with the loſs only of five men. Wheras the Enemy loſt 300, altho' defended by an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious retrenchment.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> fearing they cou'd not keep this fort, becauſe the army continually grew bigger, betook themſelvs to another, at 200 paces diſtance, that was better ſituated; where they expected the army with great courage, which advanced to aſſault them, when advice was ſent them, that the Vale of St. <hi>Martin</hi> had ſurrendred, and that the <hi>French</hi> was coming on them behind; for to this Vally, there is an eaſy paſſage from <hi>Lucerna</hi> and <hi>Angrogne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This news oblig'd the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> to enter into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, with <hi>Don Gabriel</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> Uncle and General of the Duke of <hi>Savoy's</hi> army, and with the reſt of the other Officers, who on notice of his Royal Highneſs's will and pleaſure, poſitively promiſed, as well from him, as from themſelvs, that the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> ſhou'd receive a full pardon, and be remitted to the terms of the order of the <hi>9th</hi> of April, provided they ſtood to his mercy. But the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> making ſome ſcruples at the confiding on this promiſe; <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> who had notice of it, ſent them a letter, writ and ſign'd with his own hand in his Royal Highneſs's name, and in theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lay down immediatly your arms, and throw your ſelvs on his Royal Highneſs's mercy, in doing which, aſſure your ſelvs, he grants you pardon; and that no violence ſhall be offered to your ſelvs, your wives, or children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An aſſurance of this nature, one wou'd think, ſhou'd be ſufficient, for the ſecuring the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> lives and libertys. For beſides that this promiſe was made in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96006:18"/>
the name, and on the part of the Duke, it muſt have ſeem'd no leſs valid, had it only came from <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> and other Chief Officers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> then laid down their arms, in relyance on this promiſe, and went moſt of them to ſurrender themſelvs to their Enemys; hoping they ſhou'd be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly releaſed. But all thoſe who put themſelvs into their hands, were made priſoners, and led to the Town of <hi>Lucerna,</hi> under pretence, they were to be brought to his Royal Highneſs, to make their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions.</p>
            <p>The Enemys alſo ſeized on all the poſts, which the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> had held in <hi>Angrogne.</hi> They contented not themſelvs with ſacking, plundering, and burning the houſes of theſe poor people; they moreover put to the ſword a great number of <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> of both ſexes, Old and Young. They Raviſht ſeveral Women and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and committed, in fine, ſuch brutiſh actions, as ſtrike with horror all perſons, endued with any ſenſe of humanity. Yet there were ſeveral <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> who after this compoſition, ſlipt privately out of their hands, unwilling to deliver themſelvs to the mercy of ſuch bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous wretches, before they knew what wou'd become of their companions, who had yielded themſelvs. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then on one hand, that the army exercis'd horrid crueltys, wherever it paſt; and on the other, that they detain'd all thoſe who ſurrendred themſelvs, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hid themſelvs in the woods, and ſent a requeſt to <hi>Don Gabriel</hi> by one <hi>Bartholomew Fraſchie,</hi> to entreat him to releaſe their brethren, detain'd contrary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; and to forbear thoſe acts of hoſtility, which were carry'd on with ſuch barbarous cruelty. <hi>Don Gabriel</hi> made no anſwer to this humble requeſt: but ſome Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96006:18"/>
told <hi>Fraſchie,</hi> that the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> were carry'd to <hi>Lucerna,</hi> only to beg pardon of his Royal Highneſs, and that after this, they ſhou'd be releaſt.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the <hi>Marqueſs de Parelle</hi> gain'd the riſing ground of the Vallys of <hi>Angrogne,</hi> with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachement from the army, who finding no reſiſtance, made up to the moſt conſiderable ſort of the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> and in which they had moſt of their cattel. The <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs</hi> gave the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> to underſtand, that the peace being made, by the capitulation of <hi>Angrogne,</hi> it was their fault, they enjoyed not the fruits of it. He aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, for this effect, on the word of a man of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, that if they wou'd put themſelvs into his hands, neither they nor their wives or children, ſhou'd be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and that they might carry with them, whatever they pleas'd, without any fear of it's being taken from them. That nothing wou'd be required of them, but to make their ſubmiſſions. And that as for thoſe, who wou'd become Catholics, they might return in all ſafety to their familys and Eſtates, and as to the reſt, who were willing to leave the Country, they ſhou'd have free liberty to depart, according to the order of the <hi>9th</hi> of April.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> then ſurrendred themſelvs again on the faith of theſe promiſes, which were no better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, than the others. For the Enemys were no ſooner entered into the fort, but not only whatever the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiſes</hi> there had, was delivered up to the Rapin of the Soldiers, and <hi>Banditi</hi> of <hi>Mondovi,</hi> their capital Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys, who enriched themſelvs with their ſpoils: but theſe poor people, the greateſt part of which were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Men, Women, and Children, were made Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, with ſome Miniſters, who were amongſt them; and conducted with ſuch fury, that thoſe whoſe age,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96006:19"/>
or other infirmitys permitted not to travel faſt enough to the Soldiers minds, were ſlain with their Swords, or thrown down from Rocks.</p>
            <p>To return to the <hi>French,</hi> whom we have left at <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mol,</hi> in the Vally of <hi>Peirouſe,</hi> they behaved themſelvs after the ſame manner, as the troops of the Duke had done at <hi>Angrogne,</hi> and in the Vale of <hi>Lucerna.</hi> They had encampt themſelvs in a part of the common of <hi>Pramol;</hi> call'd the <hi>Rua;</hi> which is about half an hour's march from another place, term'd <hi>Pieumian,</hi> where a party of thoſe of <hi>Pramol,</hi> St. <hi>Germain, Praruſtin</hi> and <hi>Rocheplate</hi> had retired, to the number of 1500 perſons, Men, Women, and Children. The <hi>French</hi> might eaſily from their quarter come down to St. <hi>Germain,</hi> and fall on the 200 <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> who had ſo valiantly defended themſelvs, and had reſettled themſelvs in their trenches. But having notice of the loſs of the Vally of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> and the Enemys march, they thereupon left this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment, for fear of being attackt behind, and went to their brethren in <hi>Pieumian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt they deliberated on the courſe they ſhou'd take to defend themſelvs, againſt the <hi>French,</hi> who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to invade them; ſome Inhabitants of the Vallys, being ſuborned and won over to the Enemy, came and told them, that the Vallys of <hi>Angrogne</hi> and <hi>Lucerna</hi> had ſubmitted to the will of their Prince, who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken 'em into favor, and granted them the terms of the order iſſued out the <hi>9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> of April. They alſo told them, it was in their power, to end a warr, the burden of which they were not able to ſuſtain alone, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for themſelvs an advantagious and laſting peace. Which news having taken from the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> part of their reſolution; they ſent Deputys with a Drum, to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96006:19"/>
the <hi>French</hi> General, to treat of peace. Who told them, that the intention of his Royal Highneſs was to pardon them, and poſitively promiſed them from his part and his own their lives and liberties, with leave to return with all ſecurity to their houſes, provided they layd down their Arms immediatly. And the Deputys telling him they fear'd leſt the <hi>French</hi> enrag'd at what had paſt, at St. <hi>Germain,</hi> would take vengeance, on the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> when they had nothing to defend themſelvs: he made them great proteſtations and oaths, that ſuppoſing their whole Army ſhould paſs by their doors, they would not offer the leaſt violence.</p>
            <p>This compoſition being made, <hi>Catinat</hi> retained one of the Deputys with him, and ſent the others to give ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> to oblige all thoſe who had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſt themſelvs, to repair the next morning being the 25 of <hi>April</hi> at <hi>Pieumian;</hi> that every man might return to his houſe on notice of the peace. Whilſt the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> aſſembled at <hi>Pieumian</hi> the ſcattered familys, <hi>Catinat</hi> gave an account of this Capitulation to <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> who ſent him over night a meſſenger, who paſſing by <hi>Pieumian,</hi> aſſured the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> he brought good tidings of peace, and the next morning in his return, he told them it was concluded. They were ſo well perſwaded of the truth of it, that the day before they had layd down their Arms according to the conditions of the treaty, entirely confiding in <hi>Catinat's</hi> promiſe: They waited in this condition for news from <hi>Pieumian,</hi> when there ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd one named St. <hi>Peter,</hi> one of the <hi>French</hi> King's Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Garriſon in the Fort of <hi>Peirouſe,</hi> follow'd with ſeveral Dragoons. Which Captain was well known by the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> and immediatly reiterated to them the aſſurances of the peace; but preſently caus'd the men to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96006:20"/>
go together apart, in a certain place, and the women and children in another.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Troops being at the ſame time arriv'd, told the men, they had order to conduct them to their houſes, and made them paſs along through them four in a rank. Theſe poor people having bin conſtrain'd to leave their Wives and Daughters expoſed to the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers diſcretion, were led not to their houſes, as they had bin told, but to <hi>Don Gabriel,</hi> who was encampt on the Mountain of <hi>La Vacherie,</hi> and who caus'd them to be carry'd priſoners to <hi>Lucerna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, the women ſuffer'd whatever the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and brutiſh inhumanity of the Soldiers could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe againſt them. For theſe Barbarians, contented not themſelvs with taking from them their money, but violated their Chaſtity, with ſuch Circumſtances, as are a ſhame to nature; and kil'd many of them in their reſiſtance of their filthy attempts. <hi>Catinat</hi> was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, at what paſt at <hi>Pieumian.</hi> He left the ordering of this affair to ſome Officers, to keep out of hearing the juſt reproaches, and complaints of the <hi>Vaudoiſes;</hi> or elſe that he might not be the Spectator of ſo many Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous actions. But however it is certain, that excepting ſome women, who were kil'd, and ſuch as fled away from the perſecution of theſe Monſters, and ſaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs in the neighboring Woods, in danger of the Guns, that were ſhot at them, to ſtop them; all the reſt, were dragg'd into divers priſons, with great cruelty.</p>
            <p>It will be needleſs, to uſe here many arguments to ſhew, that the Enemys of the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> have violated in theſe rencounters, the moſt Sacred and inviolable obligations. The relation of what is paſt, ſuffices, to clear this truth; ſeeing it clearly juſtifys, That the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96006:20"/>
               <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> have bin the victims of their Enemys perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. And it's in vain to think to excuſe this breach of promiſe, under pretence the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> were rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Subjects, who had taken arms againſt their lawful Prince; for it will be eaſy to ſhew, that they cannot be accuſed of rebellion; ſeeing they only made uſe of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural defence, againſt the unjuſt oppreſſions of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of propagation,</hi> and their other Enemys. But the preſent queſtion is not, whether the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> could juſtly do what they did; but touching the performance of the promiſes, which have bin made them; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this their pretended rebellion; ſeeing their ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of themſelvs, was grounded on the faith of theſe promiſes. So that it's certain the violation of an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of this nature, can have no other colour, than the authority of this maxim, That <hi>faith is not to be kept with Hereticks.</hi> It's alſo certain, That Kings and Princes are eſpecially oblig'd to condemn this vile maxim, in that they be the repreſentatives of a being, who never fail'd of being faithful to his promiſes, and who has ever puniſht perfidiouſneſs, either in the perſon of thoſe who have bin guilty of it, or in their deſcendants.</p>
            <p>It's alſo in vain to alledge, that when the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred themſelvs, they had only promiſe of life; for it's plain they were promis'd likewiſe their liberty. But had the promiſe extended no farther than life, can it be affirm'd they kept their word, when they made them all periſh under the weight of an intollerable miſery, and the hardeſt captivity as ever was.</p>
            <p>The Vally of <hi>Peirouſe</hi> being reduced as the reſt by the Capitulation of <hi>Pieumian,</hi> one part of the <hi>French</hi> Army left this Vally, and went and joyn'd <hi>Don Gabriel</hi> at the <hi>Vacherie;</hi> Then it was that on all ſides they hunted, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96006:21"/>
caught, theſe poor <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> who were dragg'd to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Priſons, under pretence of being led before his Royal Highneſs, to entreat his pardon. But that which ſeems moſt deplorable, was their refuſal to hear the complaints, and tears, of familys, who implored the favor of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together. For they ſeparated the Fathers from their Children, and the Husband from the Wife, to deprive them of the means of comforting and ſtrengthning one another. They violated the ties of nature and conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity, that they might be leſs able to bear the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and other miſerys, they provided for them. They deſigned, that thoſe who could reſiſt the ſufferings, and miſerys of a rigorous priſon; ſhould be overcome by the reſtleſs longings, to be with their relations. There were ſeveral young people of both Sexes, who were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſt, and placed in ſeveral particular houſes in <hi>Piemont;</hi> but this was not from a motive of equity, but to make them change their Religion, and to keep them from coming near their Parents.</p>
            <p>Yet there were then a great number of <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> who had not delivered up themſelvs, nor were as yet taken; For thoſe of <hi>Villars, Boby,</hi> and ſome other places, in the Vally of <hi>Lucerna,</hi> would not conſent to the compoſition, as did the reſt, that they might keep themſelvs free. Many of thoſe of <hi>Angrogne</hi> had joyned themſelvs to theſe, having obſerv'd how the Enemys kept their word. And ſeveral of the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> of the vale of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> had ſearcht for ſhelter, and hiding places, in Woods and Rocks, to eſcape the barbarity of the <hi>French</hi> fury; who gave no quarter. The enemys reſolv'd to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of theſe <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> by force or fraud; as they had bin of the reſt. For this effect, whilſt part of the Duke of <hi>Savoy's</hi> Army, was employ'd againſt thoſe, who were
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96006:21"/>
ſtill in arms, in the Vally of <hi>Lucerna;</hi> the <hi>French</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to that of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> with the Marqueſs <hi>Parelle;</hi> who was well known to the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> and the better able to perſwade them. He knew by experience, that craft was a more likely means to ſucceed, than open force. He made uſe then of ſome <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> who had yielded themſelvs, and in whom the people conſided; cauſing them to march at the head of the army, with piſtols at their throats, who were forced not only to be guides to the <hi>French;</hi> to diſcover the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> in the ſecret places of their retreat, but moreover to write ſeveral notes, to exhort their Brethren, to throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs on the clemency of their Prince; whoſe favor was offered, to all thoſe, who wou'd accept it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the uſage of thoſe who had already ſurrendred themſelvs, might diſcredit this ſollicitation; it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in ſeveral of theſe notes, that the priſoners wou'd be ſoon ſet at liberty. On the credit then of theſe notes, many of theſe poor people delivered up themſelvs, for ſeveral days, as relying too on the aſſurances, which the Marqueſs <hi>Parelle,</hi> and the other Officers gave them, of his Royal Highneſs's pardon.</p>
            <p>Several others were Maſſacred, or taken by the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; but both thoſe who ſurrendred themſelvs, and thoſe who were taken, had both the ſame deſtiny; and were equally led away priſoners, into divers priſons and caſtles.</p>
            <p>Whilſt thus craft or cruelty waſted the Vally of St. <hi>Martin</hi> of it's inhabitants; let us ſee what paſt in the Vally of <hi>Lucerna.</hi> The <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> here, held amongſt others, two ſtrong places; the one call'd <hi>Jaimet,</hi> and the other <hi>Chamruma,</hi> above the Caſtle into which one part of thoſe who had eſcaped out of <hi>Angrogne</hi> had fled.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96006:22"/>
Theſe two places ſheltred <hi>Villars,</hi> wherein there were above a Thouſand Perſons, as well Old as Young. A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachement of the Duke of <hi>Savoy's</hi> army, aſſiſted by the <hi>Banditi</hi> of <hi>Mondovi,</hi> came and attackt theſe two places; where the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> defended themſelvs, for a whole day with an extraordinary courage. They kild a great number of Soldiers, and conſiderable Officers, amongſt which was the Commander of the <hi>Banditi.</hi> They had only ſix men kild, and as many wounded. The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys were extraordinarily tired and intended a retreat: but for aſ much as they might be purſued eaſily, and defeated in retreating, they there upon be thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs of this ſtratagem.</p>
            <p>Several Officers having laid down their arms, and layd by their hats, drew near at night, near the trenches of <hi>Chamruma,</hi> with an hankerchief at the end of their ſticks; and deſired a parley, to make propoſals of peace. They ſhew'd a paper, and told the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> they came from receiving letters, that peace was concluded, in all the Vallys; that his Royal Highneſs had granted a general pardon to all his ſubjects, and that it was their fault, who were ſtill in arms, that they were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in it. They added they had order to ceaſe all acts of hoſtility, and exhorted the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> to do the ſame, and to accept the grace his Royal Highneſs offered them, of which the <hi>Podeſtat,</hi> there preſent, cou'd give them aſſurance. Which perſon being well known by the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> having adjoyn'd his proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to thoſe of the other Officers, and altogether ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving promiſt them, with the greateſt earneſtneſs, their lives and libertys; provided they withdrew; the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiſes</hi> of <hi>Chamruma</hi> truſting to theſe promiſes, left the place to the Enemys and retired, being perſwaded of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96006:22"/>
the certainty of the peace. There were ſeveral of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grogne,</hi> who came to the Caſtle to enjoy the fruits of this peace, but they were immediatly ſeized on, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd away. This credulity of the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> took from 'em a favorable opportunity, of overthrowing their Enemys; for they might, without any danger, or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, vanquiſh troops, who had waſted all their warlike ammunition.</p>
            <p>The Enemys, who pretended they had marcht away, only to make the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> leave their poſt, which was a very advantagious place, having receiv'd ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits, immediatly return'd and poſſeſt themſelvs of it. Thoſe who were at <hi>Jaimet,</hi> and had not entered into compoſition, were then oblig'd to Abandon theirs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was commanded by the other, and to betake themſelvs to the mountains of <hi>Villars.</hi> The Enemys marched after them, and encampt at <hi>Bonnet,</hi> on the avenues of <hi>Villars</hi> and <hi>Boby;</hi> where they remain'd two days without attempting any thing againſt the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiſes,</hi> who might be about 4 or 500 men. The Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Army, employ'd this time, in offering them propoſals of peace, attended with ſpecious promiſes; provided they ſurrendred themſelvs, and terrible threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, if they ſtood on their defence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> reply'd to theſe propoſals, that they deſired nothing more; but that which was offered them, was more to be dreaded than war, ſeeing it was not to be purchaſed, but by the loſs of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. That not withſtanding the peace promiſed to thoſe of <hi>Chamruma,</hi> and on the faith of which they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up their poſt, yet were they impriſon'd, who had ſurrendred themſelvs, and that the example of their Brethren taught them plain enough, what they muſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96006:23"/>
expect, if they relyed on theſe aſſurances. Yet did not this hinder, but a great number of the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered themſelvs to the Enemy, in that they ſwore to 'em, that thoſe who had yielded themſelvs ſhou'd ſoon be ſet at liberty to return to their houſes; having been carry'd to his Royal Highneſs only to ask his mercy, but theſe were alſo lead away captive, and uſed in no better ſort than the reſt.</p>
            <p>One wou'd marvel at the eaſineſs, wherewith the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiſes</hi> ſuffered themſelvs to be deceived ſo often. But it's to be obſerv'd, there were ſeveral, who did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any defence cou'd avail, after ſo many perſons and places ſurrender. Others feared leſt their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, ſhou'd prove more than ordinary prejudicial to their Wives, and Children who were in priſon. And the moſt part, cou'd not imagin, their Enemys cou'd be cruel enough, to ſtarve in priſon ſuch as delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelvs up to their mercy. They hoped how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhou'd be ſet at liberty, after ſome months im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment.</p>
            <p>But the reſt of the other <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> being much weakned, quitted <hi>Villars,</hi> on which the Enemy ſeized; who ceas'd moleſting them till May 4; when the troops being reinforced, attack'd <hi>Boby,</hi> where the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> were retired; but they were vigorouſly beaten back by an 150 <hi>Vaudoiſes;</hi> who were in the mountain of <hi>Subjuſque,</hi> and who without the loſs of one Man, kild ſome Officers, and a great many common Soldiers. Eight days after the <hi>French</hi> army joyn'd that of the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> The Enemys then made their laſt effort to be Maſters of <hi>Boby,</hi> but the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelvs ſo well, that after a fight, which laſted the whole day, they conſtrained the army to retire,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96006:23"/>
and to encamp at <hi>Serre de la Sarſena,</hi> with the loſs of many Men.</p>
            <p>The next morning, the Marqueſs <hi>de Parrelle,</hi> who came from the Vally of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> with a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachement, paſt over the ridge of <hi>Julien,</hi> which is an <hi>Alpe</hi> which was thought inacceſſible, and prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to attack the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> behind. Which oblig'd the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> to quit <hi>Boby,</hi> and to betake themſelvs to the Woods and Rocks. The Marqueſs <hi>de Parelle,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Brichantan</hi> having poſſeſt themſelvs of theſe poſts, which the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> had now forſaken, ſent ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perſons to them in their retreats, to exhort them to ſurrender, and to accept of a pardon; and ſeveral of theſe poor people being preſt with miſery and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſurrendred themſelvs to theſe offers, and became captives by their own credulity. Others yielded to the Governor of <hi>Mirebouc,</hi> on aſſurance from him of their lives and libertys; but they alſo payd for their truſt in his word, by a rigorous impriſonment. There were ſeveral, who had betaken themſelvs to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Vandelin,</hi> and who fought for ſome time with great courage and ſucceſs. Yet they at laſt too ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelvs to be over-perſwaded by the Count <hi>de la Roche,</hi> Governor of the Vallys, on promiſe which he made them of their lives and libertys. He aſſured them, by a note, writ with his own hand, they ſhou'd return to their houſes; but they had no ſooner forſaken their places of retreat, but they were clapt up in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the note taken from them which he had giv'n them.</p>
            <p>The Enemys of the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> having by the means afore related, taken away the lives of an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Perſons, and deprived above 12000 of them of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96006:24"/>
their libertys, and carry'd away, and diſperſt above 2000 Children, thought they had now done their work. They carry'd on then their unjuſt practiſes to the end, and cauſed all the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> Eſtates to be confiſcated.</p>
            <p>And thus were the Vallys of <hi>Piemont</hi> depopulated of their ancient Inhabitants, and the light of the Goſpel extinguiſht in a Country, where it had ſhined for ſo many ages. Thus did perfidiouſneſs, and violence, triumph over the ſimplicity of the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> which the Council <hi>de propagatione,</hi> and their other Enemys have executed to their utter extirpation. But to the end we may know throughly, with what ſpirit their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors have been animated, we may here ſee ſome of the barbarous acts and crueltys, which they have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd in theſe occaſions.</p>
            <p>Altho' we deſign to ſpeak only of thoſe, which have been practis'd, after the compoſitions; yet we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſome of the barbaritys, with which the <hi>French</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis'd their entrance, into the Vally of St. <hi>Martin;</hi> not only becauſe they tranſcend the bounds, which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ought to ſet to their Victorys; but moreover, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have been committed on Perſons, who offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no reſiſtance. We may then here mention the Murthers of ſo many Old Men, Women, and Children, who were then the Victims of the Soldiers cruelty; the inexpreſſible lamentations of thoſe poor Women and Maidens, who after the abuſe of their Bodys, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to travel all night, at the head of the army, to ſerve for guides to the <hi>French;</hi> and the monſtrous and diabolical actions of theſe furious Soldiers, who glutted their filthy luſts, on the ſame Bodys, they came from depriving of life. But we ſhall ſet aſide the deſcription of theſe things, to ſpeak of ſome inſtances of crueltys
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96006:24"/>
and violences exercis'd after the ſurrender of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys.</p>
            <p>The Soldiers made ſeveral Maſſacres at <hi>Angrogne,</hi> not here to be inſtanc'd, leſt it ſhou'd put us on a long relation of particulars. There were ſeveral Women and Maidens violated, on the account of whoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, we ſhall conceal their names, ſome of them being yet alive. They wou'd likewiſe have violated <hi>Marguerit Maraude,</hi> who was but 14 years of age; and becauſe <hi>James Maraude</hi> her Father, and <hi>Margaret Maraude</hi> her Ant oppoſed themſelvs, to theſe violences; they were cruelly murthered. <hi>Suſanna Olviette,</hi> and <hi>Margaret Baline</hi> ſtriving to ſave their chaſtity, loſt their lives by the hands of theſe <hi>Barbarians. Joſeph David</hi> having been wounded at <hi>Angrogne,</hi> was carry'd by the Soldiers into a neighboring houſe, where they burnt him. Four Women and three Children of <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſtin</hi> were kild in a hole of a Rock, where they had hid themſelvs. The Mother of <hi>Daniel Fourneron</hi> aged 80 years, was thrown down from a precipice in coming from the <hi>pre' de Tour,</hi> becauſe ſhe cou'd not go faſt enough. At <hi>Pieumian</hi> the Soldiers ſlew the Wife of <hi>James Fourneron</hi> and <hi>Magdalen Roche,</hi> becauſe they did not readily enough deliver the money they had. <hi>Mary Romain</hi> a Young and Beautiful Damoſel, promiſed in Mariage to <hi>James Griot,</hi> was kil'd for endeavoring to ſave her Chaſtity. Another Virgin to ſecure her's, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving caſt her ſelf into a River, was there ſhot to Death. Several Women and Maidens, who are yet alive, were dragg'd by the hair of their heads into neighboring houſes, where they were Raviſht with horrible circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; one through deſpair, throwing her ſelf out of a Window, <hi>Honoree Jayer,</hi> a young Child, having
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96006:25"/>
been found among the women, was ſhot to death. A great number of women and maidens running away into woods, fell by the Musket-bullets, ſhot after them to ſtop them. The Marqueſs <hi>Parelle,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiſes,</hi> which he made to march before him, to ſerve for guides; paſſing by <hi>Pieumian,</hi> to go into the Vally of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> found the bodys of ſeveral little children, cut in pieces; ſeveral naked women, ſlain with blows, ſome of which had Stones thruſt into their privitys. They alſo ſaw ſeveral Soldiers, who carry'd in their hats, the marks of an horrible cruelty, and a deviliſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudicity, at which the Marqueſs <hi>Parelle</hi> was ſcandalis'd.</p>
            <p>In the Vale of St. <hi>Martin</hi> there were ſix men, twenty women, and ſome children, who went and ſurrendred themſelvs in the Town of <hi>Peirouſe,</hi> on promiſe made them, they ſhould have no harm done them; but they were no ſooner come, but theſe ſix men, were ſhot in the preſence of their wives. <hi>John Ribet</hi> of <hi>Macel</hi> having bin taken, he had his Arms and Legs burnt to oblige him to change his Religion; but God gave him the grace, to obtain the Crown of Martyrdom, in ſuffering conſtantly the death, which theſe executioners gave him. They likewiſe inhumanly put to death <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew Ribet, James Brues,</hi> and his ſon. They faſtned one poor infirm man to an horſe's tail, whom they dragg'd about, till he expired. They hang'd up a poor blind woman at her own door. They found a woman at the point of being delivered, and perform'd two murthers at one Blow, in taking away her life, and that of the child in her womb. They purſued two young women, from a place called the <hi>Colet,</hi> to another named <hi>Boniot,</hi> where over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking them, they violated them, and afterwards both ſhot them and hewed them in pieces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:96006:25"/>
Four women having fallen at the ſame time into the hands of theſe Barbarians, met with the ſame misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, only with this difference, that before they were vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and maſſacred, they ſaw their childrens throats cut, in a place called the <hi>Fountains.</hi> They opened the bodys of a mother and her child, and tore out the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, which they caus'd to be burnt. They ſlew a great many children in the ſame place, becauſe they were ſick, and were not able to follow them to the priſons, where they would have ſecured them. Twenty two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who had for a long time layn hid in Woods, and moſt of which were women and children, were found by theſe murtherers on the Mountain of <hi>Pelue,</hi> and thrown off into dreadful Abyſſes; being miſerably ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and torn by the edges of ſharp-pointed Flints, on which the entrails of theſe poor wretches were ſeen to hang, a long time after.</p>
            <p>In the vale of <hi>Lucerna, Suſannah</hi> the wife of <hi>Daniel Violin, Katherina</hi> the wife of <hi>James Negrin, Anne Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note,</hi> and her daughter were ſtabb'd in the throats with Bayonets. Some Soldiers having uſed all their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to flea <hi>Daniel Pellene</hi> alive, and ſeeing they could not get the skin over his ſhoulders, they layd him on the ground, and placed a great ſtone on his belly, and made him thus expire. <hi>Daniel Brumerol</hi> loſt his life with a cord, with which they faſtned and ſtraitned with a dreadful violence his head to his belly and privitys. <hi>Anne</hi> and <hi>Magdalen Vittories,</hi> and ſeveral others were burnt; the wiſe of <hi>Daniel Monin</hi> was ſlayn with a Sword, with which her head was cleaved aſunder. <hi>Anne Baſtianne</hi> was thrown down from high Rocks into a dreadful bottom. <hi>David Moudon</hi> had alſo his head cleaved aſunder with the blow of a Sword. <hi>Margaret Salvajot</hi> having bin ſtript
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96006:26"/>
naked, had ſeveral blows of a dagger ſtruck into her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but ſhe ſuffered not only a cruel death, in her own perſon; ſeeing that before ſhe dyed, theſe wretches had ſo bruiſed the head of her daughter but 7 months old againſt rocky places, that the brains came out in the mother's ſight. They cut in pieces <hi>Mary Salvajot;</hi> and poignarded <hi>Mary Durand</hi> for reſiſting the attempts, made on her chaſtity. They cut the throat of M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trand,</hi> the Miniſter's mother, who was 80 years of age, and lay bedrid. A young maiden of <hi>Boby</hi> was faſtned naked on her back on a Mule, and thus expoſed; and led openly through all the Town of <hi>Lucerna.</hi> Amongſt a great number of <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> which were hang'd in <hi>Boby,</hi> there was one named <hi>Anthony Malanot,</hi> on whom the Soldiers diſcharged their Guns ſeveral times after he was dead, making their mark thoſe parts of his body, which modeſty puts on ſcrupling the mention.</p>
            <p>The Soldiers having found a woman, named <hi>Jaimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> in a cavern of a Rock, on the Collier's Mount, they led her to the Marqueſs <hi>de Bavil,</hi> Colonel to the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who askt her how long ſhe had layn in that place, and how ſhe ſuſtained her ſelf; ſhe anſwered ſhe had there hid her ſelf 8 days, and liv'd on the milk which a Goat ſhe had taken along with her had yielded her. They would have afterwards obliged her to tell them where the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> were, who hid themſelvs in Rocks; and proteſting ſhe knew nothing in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, the Soldiers, after having given her a kind of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in faſtning and then ſtraitning her fingers with matches to make her confeſs, tyed her neck and heels, and in this poſture threw her down from an high Rock; but being ſtopt in the way, They with ſtones ſo bruiſed her, that her bowels came out, and at length beat her
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96006:26"/>
quite off, in the preſence of the Marqueſs <hi>de Bavil.</hi> A youth of the Vallys, named <hi>David Magnot,</hi> whom this Marqueſs had a fancy to, and had kept to wait on him, having ſince gotten away, was an eye-witneſs of this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid action. <hi>Daniel Moudon,</hi> one of the Elders of the Church of <hi>Roras,</hi> having bin the ſpectator of the death of <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>James Moudon</hi> his two children, (whoſe heads the Soldiers cut off) after he had ſeen the body of the wife of <hi>John</hi> ript up from the Navil, and her daughter's brains beat out, who was not above 6 weeks old, and the two children of <hi>James</hi> cut in pieces, (one of which was 4 years old, and the other 14 months,) was conſtrained by theſe Monſters, to carry croſs his ſhoulders the heads of his two ſons, and to march barefoot 2 hours journy, near <hi>Lucerna,</hi> where he was hang'd in the midſt of theſe two heads, which were faſtned to a Gibbet.</p>
            <p>There would be no end in reciting particular inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of theſe kinds of crueltys. Neither ſhall we inſiſt on the pitious death of ſo many Ancient and infirm peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all ages and both Sexes, who periſhed thro' cold and hunger, as well in Woods as holes in the Rocks. We here paſs over an infinite number of priſoners, who were hang'd, without any formality of juſtice, on the arms of Trees; and in Towns and Villages, amongſt which was <hi>Paul Megle</hi> an infirm young man, who was carry'd out of his bed to execution.</p>
            <p>What we have related may ſuffice, I think, to ſhew how far extended the fury of the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> Enemys. We ſhall only then add here the death of Mr. <hi>Leidet,</hi> which is equally worthy of pitty and admiration. He was Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of <hi>Prabz</hi> in the vale of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> who had eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Surrender of the Vallys, and hid himſelf for ſome time in the holes of Rocks. He was taken by a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96006:27"/>
Detachment of Soldiers, and carry'd away to <hi>Lucerna,</hi> into the Pallace of the Marqueſs of <hi>Angrogne,</hi> where was then the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> He was put into priſon in a Tower of this Pallace, and one of his feet lockt into a kind of Stocks: where he long remained in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with bread and water, not being able to lye down. It was ſayd he was taken with his arms in his hands, but this appearing to be a falſe accuſation, as it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards juſtifyed, by thoſe who took him, he was left ſeveral months in Priſon, without having any judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſt on him, and ſeveral Judges excuſed themſelvs from medling with him. Yet in the mean time no day paſt, in which he was not expoſed to the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of the Monks and Popiſh Prieſts, with whom he earneſtly diſputed, touching his Religion, and always confounded them. They brought him one day two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, in which he ſhewed them ſo clearly the truth of his belief, that they left him, and ſhamefully withdrew, after a diſpute which held four hours, They often put him in mind of his approaching death to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright him, and told him ſeveral times, there was no ways of eſcaping it, but by turning Roman Catholic. But he receiv'd the news of his death with great tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity. He anſwer'd them, that tho he well knew, they could not juſtly put him to death, ſeeing he was not taken with his arms in his hands, and that moreover the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had promis'd pardon to all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, Yet was he ready to ſuffer, what they might lay upon him, eſteeming himſelf very happy, if he might ſuffer death for the name of Chriſt. He ſtrengthned by his example and exhortations the priſoners, which were with him, ſome of which had leave to come to him. In fine the Monks and Fryers, being enraged at his zeal
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96006:27"/>
and conſtancy, found at length Judges compliant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to condemn him to dye.</p>
            <p>The day whereon he was executed, the Recorder <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vay</hi> pronounced ſentence on him, in the preſence of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Monks, which he heard read with admirable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, not ſhewing the leaſt trouble or alteration in his countenance. The Monks left him not all that day, altho he deſired them, ſeveral times, to let him be in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, that he might the better pray to God; but they would not give over troubling him, but forced him into diſputes with them, as believing he was not now in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to defend himſelf againſt them, but he diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd himſelf with ſuch ſmartneſs and preſence of mind, that they were all aſtoniſht at it. Yet this hinder'd them not from returning the next morning, to have the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of tormenting him, to the end of his life. He ſayd when he was going out of the Priſon, that this was a day of double deliverance for him, ſeeing his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy would ſoon be freed, not only, from it's corporal pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but his ſoul tranſlated into immortal joy and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. He went to the place of execution with inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible chearfulneſs and reſolution, both deſpiſing life, which the Monks offered him, and death, which was now before his eyes. He made a long and affectionate Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, at the foot of the Scaffold, with which thoſe who ſtood by, were ſenſibly touched. He uttered theſe words on the Ladder, <hi>My God into thy hands I commend my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and dyed ſo edifying a death, that the Fryers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, who would not leave him, were forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he dyed like a Righteous perſon.</p>
            <p>There only then remain'd in the Vallys ſome Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, who preferring death before ſervitude, would not hearken to the propoſals of peace. Some of theſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96006:28"/>
were in the Vally of St. <hi>Martin;</hi> and although the one knew not the deſign of the others, becauſe the Army lying encampt between theſe two vallys, they could have no Communication: Yet they were all of the ſame mind, and took both a reſolution worthy of immortal praiſe. They remain'd a long time hid and diſperſt in the Mountains, to prevent falling into the Enemys hands, who went every day out in ſmall partys to ſurpriſe them. One cannot ſufficiently admire the conſtancy, with which they endured, all the wearyneſſes, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys, to which they lay expoſed; being often glad to feed on graſs, and the dogs, and other beaſts which came to prey on the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> dead bodys; which lay unburied in the fields. But the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Banditi</hi> of <hi>Mondovi</hi> being retired, they were not ſo ſtrictly purſued by the Duke of <hi>Savoy's</hi> Army, which remain'd alone in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys. Then it was, that thoſe who were in the vally of <hi>Lucerna</hi> began to come out of their hiding places, to ſeek for food to ſuſtain their languiſhing Spirits. There were not in this vally above 42 men, beſides ſome wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children, when they were all together met, yet they made ſeveral attempts in the plain, always load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelvs with proviſion and other neceſſarys, and worſted in ſeveral rencounters divers of the Enemys de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments, and kil'd and put to flight a great number of the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> who were come to inhabit in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys, and in fine performed, for ſeveral months, ſuch gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant actions, that they put the Enemys under contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, and forced them to furniſh them with proviſions, for ſome time; to hinder them from making their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads into the plain.</p>
            <p>We ſhall not now make a particular relation of theſe geuerous attempts, leſt we engage in a long diſcourſe,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96006:28"/>
but content our ſelvs with ſaying, that the Court of <hi>Turin,</hi> having in vain attempted by force, to extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them from the Vallys, ſent them paſs-ports, in good form, under hand, and hoſtages, for greater ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their retreat; tho' thoſe who carry'd theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals to the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> wou'd by no means allow they acted by the Court of <hi>Turin</hi>'s order. They affirm'd on the Contrary, that what they did, was of their own motion, and at the deſire of ſome other Perſons, who undertook to obtain theſe paſs-ports, and deliver them hoſtages. But it's certain, an affair of this nature, cou'd not be carry'd on, without a more than bare conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance from the Court of <hi>Turin.</hi> For beſides, that no particular Perſon, dared to have undertaken, of his own head, ſuch a buſineſs; the paſs-ports which were diſpatched, did afterwards fully ſhew, that all was done by the Court's order.</p>
            <p>However the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> at firſt refuſed to hearken to this propoſal, whether they thought they ought not to put any confidence in the promiſes made them, or whether reſolving to periſh themſelvs, but they wou'd deliver their Brethren out of Captivity, Death being more ſweet to 'em than life, whilſt they groan'd in their chains. A while after, this propoſal was renewed, and ſeveral conſiderations were offered to oblige them to an acceptance. They were told that the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> had declared, that as long as they were in arms, the Priſoners ſhou'd not be releaſed, and they were poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively promis'd, that aſſoon as ever they were departed, their Brethren ſhou'd be ſet at liberty.</p>
            <p>So that the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> conſidering on the one hand, that Winter came on, and that they muſt expect no ſuccors; and on the other, that their reſiſtance, might
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96006:29"/>
furniſh their Enemys, with a pretence, for the detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Captives; they thereupon determind to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part their Country. It was then agreed and reſolv'd, they ſhou'd leave the Vallys, and depart with their Wives and Children, arms and baggage, in two troops or companys, having their charges defrayed; and they conducted, as far as <hi>Switzerland,</hi> at two ſeveral times, by one of his Royal Highneſs's Captains, with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient paſs-ports.</p>
            <p>That for the greater ſecurity of the firſt troop, which ſhou'd ſet out, hoſtages ſhou'd be left in the Vallys, in the hands of the ſecond; who ſhou'd keep them, till ſuch time, as they had heard, that the firſt company was arriv'd; and then this Captain ſhou'd deliver into their hands an Officer of his Relations, for an hoſtage, till ſuch time, the ſecond troop or company ſhou'd be arrived.</p>
            <p>This treaty was faithfully executed, for thoſe two companys happily got out of the Country into a place of ſurety, with their arms and baggage, under the conduct of this Captain. We muſt not forget one remarkable circumſtance; which is, that the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> wou'd never conſent to leave the Country, till ſuch time, as their kindred, who were in Priſon, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed, and ſent to them; whence it muſt be concluded, that this treaty, was mannag'd by the Court of <hi>Turin;</hi> ſeeing theſe Captives, cou'd not be releaſed, but by it's order.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> who were in the Vale of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> did almoſt the ſame things, as thoſe had done in the Vally of <hi>Lucerna.</hi> For altho' they were reduced, at laſt, but to 25 Men, and ſome Women and Children, yet they defended themſelvs, with ſuch vigor and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96006:29"/>
that they alſo procured themſelvs paſſes, to retire to <hi>Switzerland,</hi> with their Wives and Children, arms, and baggage.</p>
            <p>We have already ſayd, that thoſe in one Vally, knew not what paſt in the other, becauſe the army cut off all communication. Cou'd they have joyned, or heard of each other, no doubt they had made a more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious compoſition, and perhaps delivered their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren out of their captivity. For if the Court of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi> were willing to keep an Army in the Vallys, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the attempts of the <hi>Vaudoiſes;</hi> or deſign'd to Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple this Country with <hi>Savoyards;</hi> who wou'd be far from inhabiting there, as long as there were theſe People in Arms; there is likelyhood, that to get rid of them, they wou'd have conſented to the deliverance of the Priſoners.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> retired into <hi>Switzerland,</hi> by means of their own Valor, which procured 'em both hoſtages and letters of ſafe conduct, the Evangelic <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> did all they cou'd, for the deliverance of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. They had wrote ſeveral times fruitleſly to the Court of <hi>Turin</hi> on this occaſion. But their zeal and charity being never weary'd, they therefore convocated an aſſembly at <hi>Arau</hi> in the Month of <hi>September</hi> 1686, in which 'twas reſolv'd to demand again the releaſment of the Priſoners: they ſent for this effect two Deputys to the Count <hi>de Govon,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s reſident, at <hi>Lucerna</hi> in <hi>Switzerland;</hi> and having ſhew'd him the reaſons, which engag'd the Evangelic <hi>Cantons</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs themſelvs in behalf of the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a treaty with him in the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> with the conſent of their ſuperiors. Which treaty obliges the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to permit all the Priſoners
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96006:30"/>
to come into <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and to Cloath them, and defray the charge of their Journy till they came on the frontiers; where the Evangelic <hi>Cantons</hi> wou'd take care of them, and conduct them into the heart of their Country; To the end they might not be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to return to <hi>Piemont.</hi> When this treaty was made, it was without doubt, unknown at <hi>Lucerna,</hi> that the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> we now ſpoke off, were already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired; for there is an article, which ſays, that the Duke ſhou'd give them paſs-ports in good form, to enable them to depart ſafely, and freely, which wou'd not have been inſerted in this treaty, had what had paſt, on their account, been known. However the <hi>Cantons</hi> immediatly ratifi'd this treaty, which the Duke did not, till ſome time after in a letter, he wrote, on this occaſion, in which he directs the courſe, which the Priſoners were to take, over Mountains, then inacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and thro' the Country of <hi>Valay,</hi> which depends, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> nor the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and thro' which there cou'd be no entrance, without negotiating with the Biſhop of <hi>Sion,</hi> to whom it belongs. It's appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, 'twas deſign'd to raiſe obſtacles againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this treaty, otherwiſe they wou'd not have markt out the way into other Countrys, than thoſe of <hi>Savoy,</hi> where the Roads lye more commodious to go into <hi>Switzerland.</hi> The Evangelic <hi>Cantons</hi> complain'd of this, to the Count <hi>de Govon,</hi> about which having writ to the Court of <hi>Turin,</hi> the Duke at length gave order, they ſhou'd paſs thro' <hi>Savoy,</hi> to the <hi>Canton</hi> of <hi>Berne,</hi> and caus'd the Priſon doors to be ſet open: but this was not before the midſt of Winter, and in ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous a ſeaſon, that according to all appearances, thoſe who had eſcaped the hardſhips in the Priſons, muſt periſh in their way.</p>

It will be very difficult to repreſent all the miſerys and calamitys, which the Captives have endured, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nine Months impriſonment. Yet there are exact memorials of what hath paſt, in each particular Priſon, which is matter enough for a particular hiſtory. But we ſhall content our ſelvs, with giving ſome general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of the miſerys they have ſuffered. They were carry'd then into Priſon, at divers times; and as faſt as they ſurrendred themſelvs, or were taken. They were diſpers'd to the number of twelve Thouſand Men Women and Children into 14 Priſons, or Caſtles of the ſtates of <hi>Piemont;</hi> and were more or leſs ſeverely uſed, according to the humor of thoſe, who were the keepers of the Priſons; but it's certain they were every where expoſed to great hardſhips, and ſufferings. Their allowance in every Priſon, was but bread and water, neither had they enough of that; in ſome Priſons they had very black bread allow'd 'em, which had no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and ſuch as was kneaded with filthy water, that run down the kennels, and in which was found all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of naſtyneſs. In other places they had ſtinking wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter giv'n them, and ſuch as cou'd not be drank, but by thoſe, who were ready to periſh with thirſt. They were obliged in ſome places, to go and fetch water out of horſe-ponds, and wherein were dogs thrown, at the ſame time they took it. In certain places they were not ſuffered to draw water out of wells; that being judg'd too good for them. In other places they were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have water only, at certain hours, out of which they were not to have any; which has occaſion'd ſeveral ſick Perſons to expire thro' need of a glaſs all of water to refreſh them. They were forced all of 'em to lye on bricks, with which the floors are paved in <hi>Piemont,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96006:31"/>
ſtraw; or if they had any giv'n them, in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; it was either ſuch as was ſo ſhort, that it was mere duſt, or elſe ſuch as was muſty. They were ſo ſtraitned, and pen'd up in ſome Priſons, that they cou'd not ſtir without great difficulty, and when they dyed, which every day hapned, the apartments were fil'd up with others, that they might have no more eaſe. The ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling heat of the ſummer, and the filthy corruption with which the Chambers were infected, by reaſon of the ſick, had engendred ſuch a great quantity of lice, that the Priſoners cou'd have no reſt, either night or day. They were alſo troubl'd with great worms, which gnaw'd their skins. There were ſeveral ſick people, who may be ſayd to have been the worms food in their life time. For theſe poor people, not being able to riſe up, they were ſo gnaw'd with them, that their skin, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready rotted, fell off from their fleſh in ſmall pieces; and in this miſerable and languiſhing condition, did they lye, till their deaths had put an end to all their ſufferings. They did not only endure all the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencys of an exceſſive heat, but moreover thoſe of a ſevere cold; ſeeing that in the midſt of Winter, they had never any fire giv'n them, nor any cloaths to warm them, altho' they were in high rooms, the greateſt part of which lay expoſed (without windows) to the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They never had any light allowed 'em in the Winter or Summer, to relieve the ſadneſs of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions in the dark nights, and to help the ſick amongſt them, ſeveral of which have periſhed for want of ſuccor. A great many Women have alſo dyed in Child-birth, for want of help in the night; and their loſs has been follow'd with that of their Children, who have receiv'd death, at the inſtant, wherein they ſhou'd have obtain'd
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96006:31"/>
life. Sick people have bin ſevered from the ſound, and layd in open places, expoſed to the injurys of the Air, the winds and ſtorms. But this cruelty, has bin in ſome ſort, a kindneſs; ſeeing it has brought them to the end of their miſerys, in the end of their lives. In other priſons, there have bin ſeveral children ſick of the ſmall Pox, lay'd in wet yards, and under the ſpouts, to have the water fall on them. They were not contented in not aſſiſting the ſick themſelvs, they alſo hindered cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable people, from bringing them broth, and other neceſſarys. When the priſoners, have dared to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the little charity ſhew'd them, they have bin la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with injurys, threats, and blows. They were told that inſtead of ſhewing them compaſſion, they ſhould be uſed like dogs, till they were all dead. There was ſcarcely any priſoner, who was not burthened with ſome diſtemper. There have bin ſo many ſick, that no leſs than 75 have bin counted to lye ill at one time in a Room. There have bin taken out of the priſons a great many young children, notwithſtanding the tears and ſupplications of both them and their Parents. In fine the priſoners have underwent ſuch hardſhips, that it's ſcarce credible, there ſhould be ſo much cruelty, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe who bear the Chriſtian name; were it not well known, to what point the Enemys of the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> have extended their fury. But we cannot doubt of the exceſs of their rage, when 'tis notorious that above eight thouſand of theſe poor creatures have expired, under the weight of this cruel ſlavery.</p>
            <p>Yet as if it was not enough, that their bodys were thus afflicted, they have bin moreover perſecuted in their ſouls. For the Monks and Fryars have uſed all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible means to make them change their Religion. But
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96006:32"/>
God had endued them with the grace of perſevering to the end, and there were few who fell under the burthen of the temptation. Thoſe who turn'd were not uſed ſo ſeverely as the reſt, but were notwithſtanding detain'd in captivity.</p>
            <p>The priſoners were in this piteous condition, when the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> caus'd to be publiſht in the priſons the order, which permitted them to go forth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into <hi>Switzerland.</hi> This publication was not made every where in the ſame manner, nor at the ſame time; but ſucceſſively, and according as the priſoners were ſet at liberty. Yet it was read in moſt of the priſons by an Officer of Juſtice, who cauſing the priſoners to come before him, declared to them that all thoſe who would depart out of the States of <hi>Piemont,</hi> to go into <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> might do it, and even thoſe who had promis'd to change their Religion; becauſe the promiſes which had bin made in priſon, were to be conſidered, as forced, and conſequently void. He added they were at liberty either to go or ſtay, if they became Catholicks. Yet the priſoners had not all the liberty of choice which they pretended was granted them. For the Monks and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Priſons, who were preſent at this publication, endeavor'd to avert the effect of it. Sometimes they were told that the rigour of the ſeaſon, and the cruelty of the Soldiers which conducted them would deſtroy a great part of them in the way. Other times, they were flattered with the hopes of returning into their own houſes, if they would abjure their Religion. But theſe conſiderations not being able to prevail on them, they were many times grieveouſly beaten, as it happen'd in the Priſons of <hi>Aſt</hi> where the Governor gave them a thouſand blows, with a Cane, in the preſence of the Auditor <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardy.</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:96006:32"/>
They were ſhut up in Dungeons, and in the moſt noyſom, and filthy parts of the Caſtles of <hi>Queiraſque</hi> and others. In fine, there were ſo many obſtacles, layd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, that ſome fall under the temptation, and yielded to a change of Religion. But inſtead of reſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them in their houſes, they were lead (as it were) into captivity into the Province of <hi>Verceil,</hi> the leaſt grateful, and moſt barren place in all the Duke's Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. We muſt not omit ſome Circumſtances, which are conſiderable enough, the one, that ſeveral young children, as well thoſe who were brought up in priſon, as others who were diſperſt over <hi>Piemont,</hi> having known that liberty was granted the priſoners, preſt earneſtly to go with their Fathers and Mothers, but this could not be obtained; the other, that the permiſſion of depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was not publiſht, in the Priſons of <hi>Lucerna,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixt up at the place, to the end the priſoners might not have the advantage of it; and in fine the priſoners who were in the Dungeons of <hi>Aſt</hi> and their familys, which were in the Cittadel of <hi>Turin,</hi> had not the benefit of this Declaration.</p>
            <p>Soon after this publication, the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> were made to ſet forth in ſeveral Troops or Companys, which were conducted to <hi>Geneva</hi> by the Duke's Officers and Soldiers. It was promis'd by this treaty made with the Count <hi>de Govon,</hi> that the Captives ſhould be cloathed, and yet there were nothing given them, but ſome ragged old coats and breeches; but it was not only in this point, that the Treaty was not executed, it was violated in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, of greater importance. For beſides the crueltys which were exercis'd on ſeveral Companys, they were bereaved of a great many of their children, in their journy. There hapned two things amongſt others, from
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96006:33"/>
which one may judge of the reſt. The one regards the priſoners which were at <hi>Mondovi,</hi> who about <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> were told, there was an order the Contents of which was, that if they did not immediatly depart, this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would be revoked the next morning.</p>
            <p>Theſe miſerable poor creatures were all in a ſick and languiſhing condition. Yet did they chooſe to be gon immediatly without any convoy, and to expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs to eminent danger, rather than to groan any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, under this cruel Captivity. They ſet out then in a night, the moſt cold and incommodious imaginable, and travelled 4 or 5 Leagues without reſting on Snow or Ice, but with that misfortune, that there were above 150 who fell by the way and dyed; their brethren not being able to give them any aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>The other reſpects the priſoners which were at <hi>Forſan.</hi> There were a company of theſe poor Captives, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing layn at <hi>Novalaiſe,</hi> at the foot of Mount <hi>Senis,</hi> perceiv'd the next morning, at their ſetting out, that a great ſtorm was riſing on this Mountain. Some of this company ſhew'd the ſtorm to the Officer, who conducted them; and entreated him to ſtay till it was paſt, and not to expoſe them to apparent danger, and to have pitty on ſo many perſons, moſt of which were without any ſtrength or ſpirit; they alſo told him, that if he would be ſo charitable to them, they ſhould ask him for no bread; chooſing rather to abide without any nouriſhment, than to throw themſelvs into this danger. But this Officer had the cruelty to make them travel immediatly, and to Sacrifice a part of them to his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity. For there were fourſcore and ſix who periſhed on the Mountain by the ſtorm. Theſe were Ancient infirm people, women and ſmall children, who had not
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96006:33"/>
ſtrength to reſiſt the ſeverity of the weather, and whom their friends were forced to leave, as a prey to the wild Beaſts. This Officer not ſuffering them to pay them any charitable Office. The following Companys, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Merchants, who paſt ſoon after over this Mountain, ſaw the bodys of theſe poor creatures, ſtretcht out on the Snow; the mothers having ſtill their children in their arms.</p>
            <p>The Evangelic <hi>Cantons,</hi> having bin inform'd of the taking away of the children, from their parents, and other bad uſages of the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> in their way; thought themſelvs ſtill oblig'd in charity, to endeavor their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. They ſent Deputys for this end to the Court of <hi>Turin,</hi> as well to favour the journy of the ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panys, who were not then arriv'd at <hi>Geneva,</hi> as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the reſtitution of the children, taken up in the way, and other young people of both Sexes, who were diſperſt in <hi>Piemont,</hi> at the ſurrender of the Vallys. And receiving at the ſame time a Letter from the Count <hi>de Govon,</hi> by which they were inform'd, that his Maſter had referred for ſome time the deliverance of the Miniſters, and would not releaſe ſome priſoners, who had bin taken with their Arms in their hands, and were condemn'd to work all their lives on his Royal Highneſs's fortifications. The Evangelic <hi>Cantons</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commanded their Deputys to demand the liberty of the Miniſters, and all other priſoners, according to the treaty made with the Count <hi>de Govon.</hi> But before we ſpeak of the ſucceſs of this Negotiation, we muſt ſee in what condition the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> were, when they arriv'd at <hi>Geneva.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They came thither at ſeveral times, and in ſeveral Companys, which in all made not above 2500 perſons;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96006:34"/>
but they were all in ſo bad and deplorable a condition, that it is not poſſible to expreſs it. There were ſeveral of theſe poor people who dropt down dead at the Town gates; and who met with the end of their lives, in the beginning of their liberty. Others were ſo diſpirited with ſickneſs and grief, that they were expected every moment to expire, in the arms of thoſe who had the charity to ſuſtain them. Others were ſo frozen with cold, that they had not the power to ſpeak; ſome ſtagger'd under the weight of their diſtempers and wearyneſs, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were deprived of the uſe of their limbs, and could not hold out their hands to receive the aſſiſtance which was offered them. The greateſt part of them were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and without ſhoes, in fine, both one and the other carry'd ſuch marks of an exceſſive ſuffering and extream miſery, that the hardeſt heart muſt needs be grieved at it.</p>
            <p>The Companys ſtaying ſome time at <hi>Geneva,</hi> to reſt and refreſh themſelvs, before they parted for <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> thoſe who were firſt arriv'd, went out to meet thoſe who came next, to inform themſelvs touching the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their relations, of whom they had not heard, ſince the troubles in the Vallys. A Father demanded news of his child, a child what was become of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, an husband of his wife, a wife enquired after her husband, and every one endeavor'd to learn what was become of his friend; but this being commonly in vain, ſeeing moſt part of them were dead in priſon, this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd ſuch a ſad and lamentable Spectacle, that all the beholders melted into tears, whilſt theſe poor people oppreſt and overwhelm'd with exceſs of their grief, were not able to weep and bemoan themſelvs.</p>
            <p>But if it be difficult fully to repreſent the miſery of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96006:34"/>
theſe poor Peoples condition, it's no leſs hard a task to expreſs the abundant Charity, thoſe of <hi>Geneva</hi> ſhewed in theſe occaſions. The Inhabitants ſtrove ſo faſt to meet theſe piteous objects to bring them into their houſes, that the Magiſtrat was obliged to forbid the peoples going out of the Town, to avoid the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencys which this hurry cauſed. Every one ſtrove who ſhou'd have the moſt of theſe ſick and diſtreſſed Perſons, to have the more occaſion for the exerciſe of their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. They were tended not only with the ſame care, as their own Children, but moreover as Perſons which brought peace and a bleſſing into their familys. There has been an extraordinary care taken of the ſick, of which ſeveral have dyed at <hi>Geneva;</hi> and ſome of which, do ſtill carry the marks which the worms have made in their bodys. All the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> who needed cloaths, have been furniſht, either by thoſe who lodged them, or out of the <hi>Italian</hi> ſtock, the mannagers of which have ſhew'd from the beginning, to the end, the marks of a tender compaſſion and ardent charity.</p>
            <p>But it was not only in <hi>Geneva,</hi> where the <hi>Vaudoiſes</hi> were ſo kindly entertain'd, they met with the ſame compaſſion in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> where the Evangelic <hi>Cantons</hi> receiv'd them, in the moſt generous and Chriſtian man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner imaginable. And 'tis not only in reſpect of the <hi>Vaudoiſes,</hi> but alſo of the other Proteſtants, that one may ſay, that the Country of <hi>Switzerland</hi> is an aſſured port of divine appointment, for the reception of thoſe, who are expoſed on the waves of Perſecution.</p>
            <p>The Deputys then of the Evangelic <hi>Cantons</hi> being arriv'd at <hi>Turin,</hi> demanded the liberty of the Miniſters, and other Priſoners, and the reſtitution of the Children, as well of thoſe who were taken away from their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96006:35"/>
in their Journy, as of thoſe who were diſperſed in <hi>Piemont,</hi> at the time of the ſurrender of the Vallys. They ſhew'd that in reſpect of the Miniſters, there cou'd be no lawful pretence to detain them, not only becauſe they were comprehended in the treaty, made with the Count <hi>de Govon;</hi> but moreover becauſe they were the principal objects of the <hi>Switzers</hi> interceſſion; beſides that it's very juſt to remit the paſtors to their flocks, to comfort and encourage them under their ſufferings. As to the Priſoners, condemn'd, for all their life time, to work on the fortifications, they likewiſe ſhew'd, they were not to be diſtinguiſht from the reſt, under pretence they are more faulty. For <hi>1ſt.</hi> the treaty makes no exception to their prejudice: and ſays that all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners in general ſhall be releaſed. <hi>2dly.</hi> The Count <hi>de Govon</hi> has himſelf declared in a letter, which he has wrote on this ſubject, on the part of the Duke his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; that they pretended not to retain any Priſoners. <hi>3dly.</hi> That ſeeing his Royal Highneſs was willing to grant ſafe conducts to thoſe who were actually armed, on greater reaſon, liberty ſhou'd be granted to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners in queſtion, to depart; who have been always conſidered, as far leſs criminal. And as to the little Children, they ſhew'd, that as well thoſe ought to be releaſed, who had been taken away in their paſſage, as them who had been diſperſed in <hi>Piemont,</hi> becauſe both one and the other were retained contrary to the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the treaty. But neither the ſollicitations nor arguments of theſe Deputys, produced any effect, they only ſerv'd to procure the reſtitution of ſome of the Children, which were carry'd away in the paſſage. For the ſurplus are ſtill in the ſtates of <hi>Piemont.</hi> It's true that the Court of <hi>Turin</hi> hath promis'd to deliver the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96006:35"/>
Miniſters but wou'd not fix the time. As yet they are diſperſt, with their familys which conſiſt of forty ſeven Perſons, into three Priſons or Caſtles, where they be ſtrictly kept, and expoſed to ſeveral incomodiouſneſſes and miſerys, without any appearance of their libertys.</p>
            <p>And thus you have an abridgement of what has paſt that is moſt conſiderable on the occaſion of the diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Churches and Inhabitants of the Vallys of <hi>Piemont.</hi> There needs no more to ſhew, there was never any perſecution more unjuſt and violent. As to theſe poor People themſelvs, they hope that all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſtates, will look with an eye of pitty on their ſufferings, and have ſome feeling of their griefs. They are the remains of thoſe Mother Churches, that can claim the greateſt and pureſt antiquity, who from the bottom of their <hi>Alps</hi> had enlightned a great part of the <hi>Univerſe.</hi> But they are ſuch ſad remnants, and thoſe reduced into ſo ſmall a number, and ſuch a deplorable condition, that we cannot behold either their diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or their miſery, without being pierced with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ſorrow. They implore then the protection of Kings and Princes, and Proteſtant ſtates, and in fine of all true Chriſtians. They entreat them by the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of what Chriſt has done and ſuffered for them, to give ear to the ſorrowful crys of the oppreſſed, and to continue their charitable exhibitions to a remnant, whom God has delivered from both a corporal and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual bondage. By which means they ſhall be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to pray without ceaſing for their Benefactors, that God wou'd reward their charity with uninterrupted peace, health and plenty, in this life, and with immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal glory, in the world to come.</p>
