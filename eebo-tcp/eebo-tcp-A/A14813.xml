            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that the literall sense, as the woordes purporte, is the true sense, that the holy Ghost dyd principally intende. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.

               </gap>o considre to what purpose &amp; intent Christ spake these wordes, &amp; I sayde they were woordes not of a bare narration teaching some doctrine, but the woordes of thinstitution of a Sacrament of the newe Testamente.

For so it is in al other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. In Baptisme, these wordes, <hi>Ego baptizote,</hi> I ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptise thee, and so forth, lyke as outwardly to the eares, of the
<pb facs="tcp:20208:22"/>

            <p>And likewise in penaunce as the woordes of the Prieste saying: <hi>Ego absoluo te ab omni bus peccatis tuis in nomine Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris, &amp; filij, &amp; spiritus sancti,</hi> I absolue thee from all thy sin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes in the name of the father, and the sonne, and the holye ghoste, do signifie forgiuenes, so God doth inwardly forgiue yf the partye be truelye peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>

            <p>Now to our purpose: The grace whyche is included in these wordes, This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, This is my bloude, is not only accidental grace as in the other, but the body of Christe to be our Sacrament, whiche is the substaunce of grace, the aucthor, fountayne, and well of al grace, as S. <hi>Bernarde</hi> sayth <hi>Dicitur Eucharistia per excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiam.</hi>

This Sacramente is called <hi>Eucharistia,</hi> for some ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cellencye aboue al other, for in this sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is receaued not only anye other grace, but he of whome procedeth al grace.</p>
            <p>Then it foloweth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whereas the grace of this sacramente, which the wordes purport to the outward eares of all men, is the essential grace of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes bodye and bloude to be there presente, it foloweth, I saye that Christ by these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, as by a conuenient instru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, worketh inwardlye, in that he gaue to his disciples y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> reall presence of his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud,<note place="margin">

            <p>Thirdly we maye considre, that these wordes be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of a former promise, where Christe (as it is wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the .6. Chapiter of S. Iohn) promised to giue vs y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same fleshe to eate, that he woulde giue to the deathe for the life of the worlde, sayinge: <hi>Panis quem ego dabo caro mea est,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> 
               <hi>quam ego dabo pro mundi uita.</hi> The breade which I shal giue vnto you, is my fleshe, whiche I shal giue for the lyfe
<pb facs="tcp:20208:24"/>
of the world.</p>
            <p>Whiche promise we neuer reade, that Christ whiche is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> verye trueth and can not lye, did euer at any time performe but in his last supper, when he gaue his bodye and bloude to his disciples: and to promise his fleshe, &amp; to giue bare bread and not his fleshe, is no perfor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myng, but a breakynge of hys promise, and a deludynge of them, to whome he made the promise: for as for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, whiche some menne make of Christes wordes, that he wyl gyue his fleshe to vs to be eaten spirituallye by sayth is but a vaine and feined glose for that text.</p>
            <p>And although Christ do so gyue it to be eaten by faythe,
<pb facs="tcp:20208:25"/>
yet we maye not exclude one trueth by an other trueth, as sophisters do. For Christ gaue his fleshe to vs to be eaten spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituallye by fayth, euer from the beginning of the world, &amp; also at that presente, when he spake those wordes, so that it were a very vayne thyng for Christe to promise to gyue a thyng, which he euer before, &amp; also at that present, and euer after continually doth giue.</p>
            <p>But it was neuer so taken of any good auncient aucthor which al with one consent doo expounde this text of Saynt Iohn, of the giuing of his flesh in his laste supper vnder the forme of bread, and therefore <hi>Cirillus</hi> wryteth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cirillus in Ioan. lib</hi> 4 <hi>cap.</hi> 14.</note> that oure saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ dyd not expounde
<pb facs="tcp:20208:25"/>
and make plaine the maner of the misterye, and the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunce of this his promise, to them that asked the vnfayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful question. Howe, withoute fayth, but to his disciples that beleued him and asked no such question of hym, he declared the maner of it in his last sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>Wherfore we may wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude vpon this circumstance, that Christes fleshe is verelye present in the Sacrament to be giuen vnto vs, because he promised before, that he wold giue vs the same fleshe for our foode, that he would gyue on the crosse for our redemption.</p>
            <p>The tyme also is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, that he spake these wordes the nyghte before he
<pb facs="tcp:20208:26"/>
suffered death, at which tyme and the next daye after he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and fulfilled all fygures saying on the crosse: <hi>Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum est.</hi> All figures &amp; sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes be ended and expired, whyche was no tyme, then to institute and beginne newe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</p>
            <p>It is likely or probable, that our Sauiour Christ then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teryng into his agony and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnynge his passion, accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge commonlye before to teache his disciples in playne wordes, without parables or figuratiue speaches: woulde then so lightly behaue him self as to delude his choysen and intierlye beloued disciples, in callyng those thynges hys bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dye, that is gyuen for them, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:20208:26"/>
his bloude, that is shedde for them, whiche were neyther his bodye nor his bloude, but bare breade and wine?</p>
            <p>Or is there any religion in oure christen fayth in nyckna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namyng thynges, or callynge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> otherwyse, then they be?</p>
            <p>Yf any man thynke him self able to aunswere that, because Christ sayd he was a vyne, he was a doore, beynge neyther vyne nor doore: that man se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me not substantiallye to waye the woordes &amp; spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of scripture.</p>
            <p>For lette him considre tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughoute all the Scripture, wheresoeuer he shal find, that Christ spake any thing of him selfe by woordes of oure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon speache (for the godhead
<pb facs="tcp:20208:27"/>
and the properties of the god heade be ineffable, and can not be expressed to our capacitye, but by woordes and names of worldly and naturall thinges here among vs.) He shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes fynd, that Christe was a better and more syngulare thyng then the worde dyd pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perlye signifye, that was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute vnto him, and to make thys matter more playne by examples.</p>
            <p>Where Christe sayde, I am the way, he meant not, that he was the waye, that leadeth to the city, or to some other place but that he was a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent waye: A waye that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the father, to heauen, to euerlastyng lyfe.</p>
            <p>When he sayde, he was the
<pb facs="tcp:20208:27"/>
doore, he meante not,<note place="margin">Iohn. 10</note> that he was the doore of the shepefold here in earth, but a farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doore, the doore of the churche, the spirituall shepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde, by the which doore who soeuer entreth, shall be saued.</p>
            <p>Also calling him selfe a vine he meant that he was the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall vyne,<note place="margin">Iohn. 15</note> whereof all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten men be braunches, &amp; bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then suche a vine, as gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth in the fieldes.</p>
            <p>And lykewyse by that he calleth himselfe the lighte, we vnderstande, that he was not the sensible light of this world but the heauenlye lyghte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that neyther by course is chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, nor by shadowe is darkened.</p>
            <p>So that it maye be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for a rule, when Christe
<pb facs="tcp:20208:28"/>
dothe attribute the name of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye sensible creature to hym selfe, euer the vnderstandyng exceadeth and excelleth the word in dignitie.</p>
            <p>And yf this be true in all kind of teaching and doctrine shall we now in the high miste<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ries and sacramentes of God, come from the hall to the kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, from the better to the worst? y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> where Christ sayeth, This is my body, we shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande, that it is breade a worse thinge, then his bodye, This is my bloude, that is to saye, wine a worse thing then his bloude? These be fonde &amp; false gloses, neyther true, nor likely, nor yet tolerable.</p>
            <p>Wherefore leauynge oute a great many other circumstan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cies,
<pb facs="tcp:20208:28"/>
that woulde serue verye well, to set forth the trueth of this doctrine, I shall conclude thus, seing S.

It was no newe thing, worthy the newe Testamente, to eate &amp; drynke Christe in a fygure: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is certayne, that Christ in hys mysticall supper dydde not eate and drynke his body and bloude onlye fyguratiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

            <p>Here I noted a great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of the oblation of Christes body, to consiste in supplyinge that lacketh in the oblation of our bodyes: that whereas we be exhorted of saynt Paule to offre vp our bodyes a sacrifice to almightye God, and also do vnderstand by other scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, that it is our dueties so to do: whych maye be done three wayes: By voluntarye suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge

            <p>This foundation of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all presence I presupposed to haue bene beleued of vs all, &amp; yet I dyd not so rawlye leaue it, but declared vnto you suche reasons, as moued me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue styll in that fayth I was borne in, whych were the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and playne scriptures of God, opened wyth the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunces of the places in suche wyse, as the vayne cauillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Sacramentaries can not delude them, and also the effectes of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whych be so greate and so wonderful, that they can be asscribed to no other cause, but

only to almightie God, and to suche creatures, as gods sonne hath ioyned vnto hym in vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of person, as be the body &amp; bloude of our sauioure Christ.</p>
            <p>I alledged also the sayinges of the holy fathers, not in such numbre as I wold haue done, but choosed out a fewe, whych not only declared the authors fayth, but conteyned a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry argument to proue our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fayth in this matter. Concernynge the third poynt, whych is the consent of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church, neyther the tyme then suffered to speake as behoued, nor yet suffereth nowe, yf I shuld performe my promise, as I intende GOD wylling.

            <p>Further it teacheth, that this lambe of God is offered to almightye God by the prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, whiche is a distincte offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng from that Christe made vpon the crosse, for there he offered hym selfe by sheddyng hys bloude, whiche he did but ones, and neuer shall do it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne any more.</p>

            <p>After this it declareth the receauing of it saying, that we verelye receaue his preciouse body and bloude, which word (verelye) is as muche as that we call (reallye) and declareth the vse of the sacrament in the receypte of it wyth the seruice of our mouth, as Christe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded sayinge: Take, eate, whyche is a corporall eatinge,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.</note> not a spirituall beleuyng.</p>

            <p>Thys is the doctrine of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes catholike churche which I haue as yet but simplye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, not euidentlye proued, which is sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to persuade an obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t catholike man that foloweth the churche, but not sufficient to conuince an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heretike, that denieth the Churche, impugnyng the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and determination of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Churche.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:20208:110"/>
and bloude in the Masse is the sacrifice of the Churche, and propre to the new Testament I shall proue it you by the best argumentes that we haue in our schoole of diuinitie, that is to saye, first by the institution of our Sauiour Christe, then by the prophecye of Malachie the Prophete, thirdlye by the figure of Melchisedech in the olde lawe, and thys shal I doo not expoundyng the scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res after myne owne heade, but as they haue bene taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning of the moste auncient &amp; Catholike fathers in all ages.</p>
            <p>This sacrifice was institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the commaundemente of CHRIST saying to hys Apostles,<note place="margin">1. cor. 11</note> do this in my reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20208:111"/>Our new men laughe at vs where we saye, that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of Christe doth proue the oblation of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. But we pitye them, that sette so lyghte by that they are bounden to beleue, &amp; can not disproue, semyng eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlye not to regard &amp; waye the facte of Christe, and their obedience to his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>When Christe sayde, Do this: by thys word (this) must nedes be vnderstande all that he did, concerning the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Sacrament. Let vs nowe see what Christ did.</p>
            <p>First he did consecrate hys preciouse body and bloude by blessing the bread, saying, this
<pb facs="tcp:20208:111"/>
is my body, this is my bloude, for yf this consecration be not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended vnder this word (<hi>Hoc,</hi> this) then haue we no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente nor authoritye to consecrate this sacrament, and so shoulde we be vsurpers to do that thynge we haue no warraunt to shew for vs in ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye scripture. But wythoute doubte, this is so playne, that we nede saye no more of it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we shoulde vtterly denye this sacrament, and the whole ministration of it, whiche (I thinke) no man doth.</p>
            <p>Secondarely Christe dyd offre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he did consecrate, whych appeareth by these his woordes: This is my bodye, whyche is giuen for you. And although this oblation maye
<pb facs="tcp:20208:112"/>
be proued sufficientlye other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, yet to my simple iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t there semeth to be no litle argument in this worde (<hi>datur</hi> is giuen): for seinge the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture sayeth, it is gyuen for vs, and not to vs, as <hi>Zwinglius</hi> and our great Archebisshoppe his disciple wold haue it, we must nedes vnderstande by (gyuen for vs) offered for vs, so that in this place and many other, to giue, is to offre.</p>
            <p>And althoughe it be true, that Christ was giuen &amp; offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for vs to the father vpon the crosse the next day folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge, yet because the worde (<hi>datur</hi>) is in greke in al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelistes, where it is expressed in the present tense, and also e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye sentence is true for the
<pb facs="tcp:20208:112"/>
time it is pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced: therfore me thinke I may certenly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, because Christe sayeth, <hi>datur pro uobis,</hi> is giuen for you, that euen then in the supper tyme he offered hys bodye for vs to his father.</p>
            <p>Thirdly Christ did deliuer to hys disciples to be eaten &amp; dronken, that he hadde before consecrated and offered, and thys appeareth by hys wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, Take, eate,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.</note> and drynke ye all of this. The fyrst and third whyche be the consecration &amp; receauyng, be out of all contro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uersy confessed of al men.</p>
            <p>The seconde whiche is the oblation, is of late broughte in question, which I haue partly proued by the playne wordes of scripture, as it semeth to
<pb facs="tcp:20208:113"/>
me, so that I may well reason thus: Christes action is oure instruction (I except his won<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derful workes and miracles) specially when his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is ioyned vnto it. But Christe in hys supper offered hym selfe verely and really vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der the formes of breade and wine after an impassible ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and commaunded vs to do the same, tyll hys seconde commynge: me thynke ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that in the Masse we do and ought to do sacrifice, and offre Christe vnto his father, whyche oblation is the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal sacrifice of the Churche, &amp; propre to the newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And for further proue that Christ offered hym selfe in his
<pb facs="tcp:20208:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
last supper, I shall alledge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the aucthoritie of the Churche, and the consente of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fathers in this poynt, which ought to suffise any Christen man.</p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20208:138"/>Secondly we offre Christe mysticallye in oure daylye sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Masse, where Christe is by hys omnipotent power presented to vs in the Sacramente, and of vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne represented to his and our father, and his passion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, not by sufferynge of death agayne, but after an vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bloudye maner, not for thys ende, that we shoulde thereby deserue remission of oure syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but that by our fayth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, and thys represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of hys passion we moste humblye praye almyghtye GOD to applye vnto vs by Christe that remission, whych was purchased and deserued by his passion before.</p>

               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this godlye honoure called <hi>Latria,</hi> the oblation of sacrifice doeth pertayne, and for that cause it is called Idolatrye if any sacrifice be done to Ido<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les, &amp; therfore we do sacrifice neither to martir nor yet to an angel, but onelye to god.</p>
            <p>Fayth ought to be vnfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and lyuely and then it is true honour. For he that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in fayth, or fayneth to haue fayth, doeth not exhibit honour and reuerence due to God.</p>
            <p>Agayne he that hath true fayth, but yet dead for lacke of charitie, he geueth reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to god, but not perfite,
<pb facs="tcp:20208:143"/>
and therfore not pleasaunte to god, because he honoureth god with his vnderstandyng but not with hys affection.</p>
            <p>He that hath true and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely fayth, honoureth &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppeth god in spirite and trueth.</p>
            <p>The external and outward honour procedeth from the inwarde honour, and is the protestation practise and vse of it, the worke of fayth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly declared, And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as sacrifice is the speciall and chiefest adoration that canne be, therefore this sacrifice of Christes owne body &amp; bloud in the masse beynge institute of Christ by his own expresse commaundement (as I haue shewed alreadye) doeth not
<pb facs="tcp:20208:144"/>
only not diminishe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of God, but is the very highest honour of God that manne canne geue.</p>
            <p>They saye it is a deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the passion of Christe, but it is not so good people, for the sacrifice of the masse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doeth ascribe altogether to Christ, for it is the passion of Christ.</p>
            <p>Understande well what I say &amp; iudge not tyll ye heare what I meane.</p>

And surely these be most foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe of al, for yf it be a sacrifice, it must nedes be a propitiatory sacrifice taking (propitiatory) as it ought to be taken, not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:20208:161"/>
that degree of propitiation, as Christes body is, but after an other sorte. And therefore I must diuide the word (propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory) whyche is taken two wayes also. First for that that worthely deserueth mercy at Gods hand, and so the acte of the prieste in offerynge, is not propitiatorye, of it selfe deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng mercy, as Christe doth.</p>
            <p>Nexte for that prouoketh God to gyue mercye and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, alreadye deserued by Christ. And so the oblation of the priest is propitiatory, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng and prouokinge God to applye hys mercye vnto vs. So Prayer is a sacryfyce for synnes, as Saynte Iames sayeth, <hi>Oratio fidei saluabit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmum,<note place="margin">Iac. 5.</note> &amp; fi in peccatis sit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittentur

ei.</hi> The Prayer of fayth shall saue the sycke, and yf he be in synne, they shalbe remitted vnto him.

            <p>Then ye see, that prayer beynge a sacrifyce, is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of GOD, and a meane to atteyne remyssion of oure synnes, and therefore maye be well called propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torye.</p>

Of thys place we gather the maner of the churche in that time, shortly after Christ, that the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing the Sacrament at the priestes hande in the Churche, did carye it home with them, &amp; kept it secretlye and deuoutlye at home with them selfes, and euery mornyng as their deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion serued them, did receaue a parte of it by them selfes, &amp; that secretly, lest the infideles amon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges whome they dwelt should gette knowledge of our myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And thus of this place of Tertulliane, lyke as we maye learne, that the Sacrament is not breade, as the infideles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, yf they chaunce to se it: but Christ as it is called, as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full onelye knowe, to be so: so

            <p>If a man make hys excuse, that he is not worthye the sacrifice, nor to communicate, then is he not worthy to be present there at the prayer. He sayeth so in dede.
