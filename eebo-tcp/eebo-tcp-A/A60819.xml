            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>FInding in the humour of this Age, nothing more frequent than (in Printing of Tryals) wilful or ignorant miſtakes and omiſſions; witneſs <hi>Mr. Reading</hi>'s Tryal, (and the reſt) where <hi>Mr. Juſt. Wild</hi> told <hi>Bedloe, God forgive him, he was perjur'd</hi>; by <hi>Bedloe's</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, that was thought fit to be omitted in his Printed Tryal: I thought it my Duty to rectifie the Miſtakes in theſe last Printed Tryals, eſpecially as to what concerns <hi>Mr. Ander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> having it from an impartial Protestant Pen, who ſtood by him as he ſpake it. Thoſe Scriblers who (as my <hi>L. C. J.</hi> hath well obſerved) write for Bread, without any reſpect to Truth, have only this to ſay for their Miſtakes, That <hi>Mr. Anderſon,</hi> by reaſon of his weakneſs, might eaſily have been miſ-underſtood. Well, admit it; But why <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s open Perjury about <hi>Mr. Anderſon</hi>'s Father omitted? and why <hi>Mr. Anderſon</hi>'s Appeal to <hi>Capt. Rich.</hi> if that was not true what he urged against <hi>Dangerfield?</hi> with many other material Omiſſions, as in this Supplement you will ſee; why theſe paſſages, I ſay, were omitted, truly I cannot tell: unleſs <hi>Dangerfield</hi> had the ſame Influence over thoſe Scriblers, or the Printer, that <hi>Bedloe</hi> had in Printing <hi>Mr. Reading</hi>'s Tryal; or elſe foreſeeing that his moſt Gracious Majeſty would either Pardon them, or Reprieve them, thought they need now prove ſo ſincere in the relation of what the Priſoners ſaid for themſelves; but it proves otherwiſe, and their malice reflects on none but themſelves; for, <hi>Magna eſt veritas &amp; praevalebit.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>PAge 6.line 7. <hi>Anderſon.</hi> My Lord, for my ſtaying in the Kingdom, I had the Kings expreſs Command, and an Order from the Council-Board: In the year 71. they ordered Mr. <hi>Peter Welſh,</hi> and my ſelf, with four or five others who had in writing aſſerted His Majeſties juſt Rights over all his Subjects, whether Proteſtant, or Papiſt, againſt thoſe ſo frequently imputed Uſurpations of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> After this Plot was diſcovered, I came to the King, being afraid of being involv'd in the general Calamity, and ſaid to him, <hi>Sir, I deſire to know what to do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P.16.l.23. <hi>Anderſon.</hi> My Lord, I that am but a poor little <hi>Individuum,</hi> who am born with an innate and implicite Obedience to my King, pray judge whether it lie in my power to diſpute with Him and his Council, whether they can legally do this or no? or that I ought to obey the Kings Command. My Lord, I am put upon a hard <hi>Dilemma</hi>; if I (notwithſtanding His Majeſties Command to the contrary) go out of the Kingdom, then the ſevere imputation upon us, is urged againſt me, That I have, with my Religion, renounced my Natural Allegiance: And if I ſtay, then by the Law, (as you tell me) I forfeit my Life.</p>
               <p>P.8.l.31. <hi>Anderſon.</hi> No, I won't. Pray do not interrupt me; I perceive you have a Pick againſt my Life, and it may be I am as ready to give it, as you are to deſire it; I wiſh that all the puniſhments of Hell and Damnation may come upon me, if ever I open'd my mouth to this Rogue for one farthing, or about any ſuch buſineſs in the World.</p>
               <p>P.9.l.11. <hi>Anderſon.</hi> But my Lord, this one thing I have to ſay againſt this Rogue; there is a Statute, made ſince his Majeſties Happy Reſtauration, which judges what ſhall be Treaſon during his Majeſties Life: And after enumerating the Crimes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting that the Offender <hi>ſhall be convicted by the Oaths of two Lawful,</hi> adds, <hi>and Credible Witneſſes:</hi> as if the prudence of our Legiſlators, which brings good out of evil, and meaſures the Subjects future ſafety, by paſt practices, judges that clauſe neceſſary, <hi>and Credible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P.16.l.37. <hi>L. C. J.</hi> You muſt not do thus, abuſe perſons with words, without proof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anderſon.</hi> What, to prove it is day?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Just. Pemb.</hi> He muſt not be ſuffer'd ſo to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anderſon.</hi> Why here is Captain <hi>Richardſon,</hi> (taking him at the ſame time by the ſhoulders) knows what I ſay to be true: Come ſpeak, you have been familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that Rogue, (pointing at <hi>Dangerfield</hi>) [Capt. <hi>Richardſon</hi> laughing, <hi>I muſt not witneſs.</hi>] My Lord, I will do thus no more, indulge a little to my innocency and infirmity.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Juſt. Pemb.</hi> You don't ſeem to have ſo much infirmity upon you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anderſon.</hi> My Lord, I will produce that worthy Gentleman Col. <hi>Manſell,</hi> whoſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101788:2"/>
Bloud was deſigned to be ſhed by that Villain; who ſtood qualified then (as he doth now) with that magnificent Title of the <hi>Kings Evidence</hi>; but as ſoon as Colonel <hi>Manſell</hi> urged, that he was Pillory'd twice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> our worſhipful <hi>Kings Evidence</hi> was clapt up, and Col. <hi>Manſell</hi> left at liberty.</p>
               <p>P.10.l.6. <hi>Anderſon.</hi> 'Tis very true, I did it; but, my Lord, I will ſhew you, Maſs is no proof of a Prieſt: for, 1. the Statute makes a difference between ſaying Maſs, and being a Prieſt; in puniſhing Prieſts, with Death; but ſaying of Maſs, with a pecuniary mulct of 200 Marks, and a years Impriſonment.</p>
               <p>P.16.l.29. <hi>Anderſon.</hi> I underſtand by the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> that I am tryed upon a Statute, which makes Prieſthood a Crime. Now I will ask Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> a Queſtion; Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> can you prove that I received Orders from the See of <hi>Rome?</hi> You are to prove by this Statute three things againſt me: I am tryed upon a Penal Statute, which ought to be proved ſtrictly againſt me, and conſtrued moſt favourably on behalf of the Priſoner.</p>
               <p>P.17.l.13. <hi>Anderſon.</hi> My Lord, how comes it to paſs that I did not come here in a Yellow Coat; and was not arraigned for a Fool, and not for a Traytor? if I am a Prieſt, that I ſhould tell him I was ſuch an one?</p>
               <p>P.16.l.23. Strictly and in favour of the Priſoner.</p>
               <p>P.16.l.29. Mr. <hi>Bedloe.</hi> He is a Prieſt, and an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> if his Mother be honeſt, and he honeſtly born; for he is Mr. <hi>Anderſon</hi>'s Son of <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> a Gentleman of 2 or 300 <hi>l.</hi> a year; I know him and his Father very well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anderſon.</hi> My Lord, could I but apprehend that I lay under ſo great a Guilt, as to have been acquainted with ſo great a Rogue, as this Fellow is, I would have been my own Executioner, and not have expected my Sentence at this Bar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L. C. J.</hi> Do you know him well?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bedloe.</hi> Very well, both him and his Father; his Father is an <hi>Oxfordſhire</hi> Gentleman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anderſon.</hi> Now I think I ſhall prove the Rogue perjur'd: Is my Lord Chief Baron in the Court? <hi>Court.</hi> Yes, he is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anderſon.</hi> Why then my Father has the honour to be well known to his Lordſhip, who knows this to be falſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L. Ch. Bar.</hi> No, no, Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> he is a Gentleman's Son of Quality in <hi>Lincolnſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L C. J.</hi> You are miſtaken, you are miſtaken, his Father is a <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> Gentleman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anderſon.</hi> And yet this Rogue is upon his Oath; but indeed all his Life is full of ſuch miſtakes.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bedloe.</hi> I don't know, my Lord Privy Seal's Nephew told me ſo. [<hi>Note Mr.</hi> Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe<hi>'s manifest Perjury.</hi>]</p>
               <p>P.12.l.34. <hi>Anderſon.</hi> My Lord Chief Juſtice, I will bring Witneſſes to prove, that I did never ſay Maſs at <hi>Wild-houſe,</hi> nor went to the Chappel; for ſome (forſooth) would needs have me to have been Excommunicated for writing for the Kings Temporal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction over all his Subjects, (independent of the Pope) as appears by a Letter of the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> on my behalf, to Sir <hi>Clement Armiger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P.13.l.26. <hi>Anderſon.</hi> Nor would I tell a Lye to take away the Life of the greateſt Villain upon Earth; No not that Rogue, (<hi>pointing at Dangerfield:</hi>) but my Lord, I proteſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P.14.l.2. <hi>Anderſon.</hi> I ſuppoſe the Gentlemen of the Jury being apprized of theſe my Exceptions to theſe Witneſſes, notwithſtanding give credit to them, whom perhaps they would not truſt for 6 <hi>d.</hi> in their Shops, and make themſelves their Compurgators; &amp; as in waging Law, do take it upon their Conſcience, that what theſe Rogues ſay is true.</p>
               <p>P.17.l.12. <hi>Anderſon.</hi> That the Clerk does at Maſs, he gives Abſolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Much more</hi> Mr. Anderſon <hi>would have ſaid, if his great indiſpoſition of health had not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him; or</hi> Mr. Juſtice Pemberton, <hi>by his too frequent (as vehement) interruptions would have permitted him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P.20.l.7. <hi>Corker.</hi> I would not tell a lye, though I ſhould thereby ſave my life; and I do again proteſt before God and the Court, I never in my life ſaid Maſs, or heard Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions at <hi>Somerſet-houſe</hi> Chappel, nor at Mr. <hi>Paſton</hi>'s in <hi>Duke-ſtreet.</hi> And as to the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> ſeeing I will be ſincere, I ſhall only ſay, that as my denial will not clear me, ſo I beg I may not be my own Accuſer. At which ſeveral perſons gave a Hum, as approving of his ſincerity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L. C. J.</hi> Here is one hath ſwore it. <hi>Corker.</hi> 'Tis only <hi>Oates,</hi> my Lord.</p>
               <p>P.34.l.20. Mr. <hi>Prance.</hi> I know he is a Prieſt, and have heard him ſay Maſs at the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſador's, and at Mr. <hi>Paſton</hi>'s, and he went by the Name of <hi>Johnſon.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Parry.</hi> No, I never went in my life but by my own Name <hi>Parry,</hi> that is my Name, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſays, and I am not aſham'd of it.</p>
               <p>P.34.l.46. <hi>Parry.</hi> I have no reaſon to forget my ſelf, for I never did any ſuch thing, for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver brought or ſold to him any Chalice, or any ſuch thing, and beſides ſuppoſe I had, that doth not argue that I am a Prieſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L. C. J.</hi> No, but if he were ſo holy as to touch the Chalice, he would be a Prieſt.</p>
               <p>P.35.l.5. <hi>Parry.</hi> I was never in my life at the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſador's, nor at Mr. <hi>Paſton</hi>'s, nor at <hi>Wild-houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P.35.l.8. <hi>L. C: J.</hi> Can you ſwear that he is the man? <hi>Bedloe.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L. C. J.</hi> Then ſet him aſide.</p>
               <p>P.36.l.1. Mr. <hi>Prance.</hi> Yes; and I heard him confeſs himſelf to be a Prieſt.</p>
               <p>P.36.l.3. <hi>Parry.</hi> 'Tis falſe.</p>
               <p>P.35.l.46. <hi>Parry.</hi> I know not Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> my Name is <hi>Parry</hi>; I hope it is not juſt I ſhould be hang'd for another perſon.</p>
               <p>P.36.l.12. And then for the private Room, what Room of the Houſe was it? (<hi>This Mr.</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>ſaid, in Anſwer to Dr.</hi> Oates<hi>'s Teſtimony about the private Room in</hi> Wild-houſe.)</p>
               <p>P.37.l.46. <hi>Jacob.</hi> No, we did.</p>
               <p>P.38.l.4. <hi>Parry.</hi> I would ask Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and deſire him to anſwer me to it, what he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe againſt me before my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> viz. that he heard me ſay Maſs in <hi>Wild Chappel,</hi> and there heard Mr. <hi>Collins</hi>'s Confeſſion, and now he ſays, it was in a private Room; now I have it to ſhew that I did not Officiate there, nor frequent the Houſe.</p>
               <p>P.ib.l.9. <hi>L. C. J.</hi> Who is it that will prove that you did not come to the Houſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parry</hi> The Ambaſſador's Servants.</p>
               <p>P.38 l.49 <hi>Parry.</hi> He is one of the Servants to my Lord <hi>Egmond,</hi> and he lived in the Houſe, and he knows that by his Maſter's Order all his Domeſticks were examined, and all proteſted they neither knew nor ſaw me ever in <hi>Wild-houſe</hi>; all which I have under his Hand and Seal to ſhew, (<hi>and ſo pluckt it out of his Pocket.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L. C. J.</hi> It ſignifies nothing.</p>
               <p>P.39.l.49. <hi>Starkey.</hi> He tells me of Prieſts Habits; what are they, Sir?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L. C. B.</hi> What Habit had he on?</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Oates.</hi> A Thing about his Neck, and a Surplice, and a Thing about his Arm; he had a Surplice girt about him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Starkey.</hi> I know you not; and I perceive you neither know what a Prieſt's Habit is, nor the difference between his Habit and his Ornaments. A Prieſt's Habit is a Caſſock down to the ground, and a ſide Cloak; the Ornaments of a Prieſt are not a Surplice, (as <hi>Oates</hi> ſays) but an Albe that falls to the ground, and other things beſides that.</p>
               <p>P.40.l.6. <hi>Starkey.</hi> And how did you know that I ſaid Maſs? Did you know that I took Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? For if I took no Orders, it was no Maſs; for it is the Prieſt makes the Maſs, and not the Maſs the Prieſt, and then if I were no Prieſt, it could be no Maſs.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>J. Pemberton.</hi> That is a pretty Argument indeed: Do any but Prieſts ſay Maſs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Starkey.</hi> I can bring inſtance of a Gentleman in this Town, a private Lay-man, who ſaid Maſs about this Town, and he was a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and at laſt he ſtole the Chalice, (his Name was <hi>Gardner.</hi>)</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>J. Pemberton.</hi> He did well, did he not? Is that your uſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Starkey.</hi> Yes, with ſuch Prieſts as he.</p>
               <p>P.40.l.24. Mr. <hi>Prance.</hi> My Lord, I heard him ſay Maſs at my Lady <hi>Somerſet</hi>'s in <hi>Lincolns-Inn</hi> Fields, and at Mr. <hi>Duncomb</hi>'s, that taught School in <hi>Princes-ſtreet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Starkey.</hi> As I hope for mercy from Almighty God, I was never there in all my life (except <hi>Pantly</hi>) her Houſe in <hi>Glouceſterſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P.16.l.33. Mr. <hi>Prance.</hi> Did you know one Mr. <hi>Duncomb</hi> that is dead? <hi>Starkey.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Prance.</hi> Well, I heard you ſay Maſs at his Houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Starkey.</hi> My Lord, I was never at Mr. <hi>Duncomb</hi>'s in my life, but at 3 or 4 a Clock in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, and if I ſaid Maſs there, it was over a Pot of Ale.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Prance.</hi> I have heard him ſay he ſaid Maſs in the King's Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Starkey.</hi> I know neither of theſe two Fellows.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Recorder.</hi> Come, I would fain ſee whether you Prieſts and Jeſuits can ſpeak one word of truth or no: Come, Mr. <hi>Starkey,</hi> did you ever ſay Maſs in the Army?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Starkey.</hi> I never did: But pray give me leave to ſpeak; I appeared for the King, when he had not above 500 men in appearance for him; I am but a younger Brother, ſecond Brother to <hi>John Starkey</hi> of <hi>Darley</hi> in the County of <hi>Cheſter</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and yet with an Annuity of ſeven ſcore pounds a year, which I bought, and other Moneys which I had, I ſpent above 4000 <hi>l.</hi> in the King's Service, (which I bled for before I had it) for I got it in another Monarch's Service; I loſt my Leg for him by a Cannon-ſhot, and ſo ſpent my Eſtate to that degree, that that day
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101788:3"/>
when I received my Sentence of Baniſhment, I had but three half Crowns in the World, which were given me that ſame morning by two Friends.</p>
               <p>P.40.l.41. <hi>Starkey.</hi> Pray, my Lord, give me leave to add ſomething more: I was baniſh'd for 14 years into <hi>France,</hi> becauſe I refus'd to take an Engagement never to bear Arms again for the King; I did diſcover to this King a Plot deſign'd againſt his Life, State, and Government, I ſuffer to this day for it; and I delivered (into his own Hand) 11 Articles of High-Treaſon againſt the Plotters and their Abettors.</p>
               <p>P.41.l.3. <hi>L. C. B.</hi> You may be a Prieſt for all that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Starkey.</hi> But, my Lord, by the Civil Law it is a Concluſion, that although a man be a Traitor, and in the ſame Plot, he is to be indempnified for diſcovering the Conſpiracy againſt his Prince; much more for diſcovering another, (that I was not a Party in.)</p>
               <p>P.41.l.20. <hi>Starkey.</hi> If I was there, ſure there was ſome body elſe beſides my ſelf, I did not ſay Maſs alone; produce but one Witneſs for you, then I'le ſubmit.</p>
               <p>P.44.l.28. <hi>Anderſon.</hi> I can ſay this, I would have gone out of <hi>England,</hi> but the King kept me here, telling me, I ſhould not go; and I had a Protection from the Council-Board. The Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> when I was taken firſt, ſent a Letter to Sir <hi>Clement Armiger,</hi> that neither I nor my Books ſhould be medled with, that I had written for the King and the Government, for which he conceived I might be excommunicated at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that I was then under a ſpecial Protection of his Majeſty and Council; and when I was again taken and put in cuſtody of the Horſe-Guard, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſent Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi> to have me freed again; I begg'd of the King that I might go, ſaid I, I won't expoſe the King to the worſt of Rabbles; but he told me, I ſhould ſtay in <hi>England</hi>; and Mr. <hi>Peter Welſh</hi> and I had Orders from the Council, he one and I another, to ſtay:</p>
               <p>P.48.l.38. <hi>Parry.</hi> What have I to ſay for my ſelf? I have this to ſay, That thoſe that did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe againſt me, did not ſay one word of truth as to their Allegations, I take God to witneſs for it; I am a dying man, and thank moſt heartily the Court for what they are to pronounce againſt me, and I am as ready to ſuffer, as any man may be to have me to ſuffer, for it is God's Glory, and his Cauſe. Then I inſiſted upon two parts, and complained, Firſt, Of Sir <hi>William Turner,</hi> that being brought before him by Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> and ſhewing him my Protection under an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, and I profeſſing my ſelf a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> he ſlighted it, which I held to be a manifeſt breach againſt the Law of Nations: Secondly, I was wronged by Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> when (in his Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of me with Juſtice <hi>Warcup</hi>) in the Preſs-yard, <hi>Newgate,</hi> he threatned me with Irons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if I did not take my Oath I was not born in <hi>France,</hi> and I refuſing, (which none could be compelled to) for 'twas my Opponents part to prove the contrary; and who can prove me to be other than a <hi>Frenchman?</hi> Mr. <hi>Recorder.</hi> No body can; we believe you to be an <hi>Engliſhman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parry.</hi> If I be a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> I am not ſubject to the penal Laws.</p>
               <p>P.49.l.21. <hi>Starkey.</hi> In the firſt place, Mr. <hi>Recorder,</hi> here is the man (<hi>pointing at</hi> Mr. <hi>Prance</hi>) hath ſworn two lyes at one breath.</p>
               <p>P.ibid:l.31. <hi>Starkey.</hi> Becauſe there are hundreds, perhaps thouſands, that have ſuffered death for it.</p>
               <p>P.80.l.1: <hi>Starkey:</hi> I was threatned my life and liberty by the Plotters:</p>
               <p>ibid.l.13. He took me in his Arms, and told me, you are welcome:</p>
               <p>P.ibid.l.26. <hi>Starkey.</hi> Mr. <hi>Recorder,</hi> I have wiſhed an 100 times, and wiſh now, that if there were any Commiſſions, as is pretended, the firſt that had delivered one to me, ſhould never have delivered a ſecond; for I would either have brought him to juſtice, where he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his reward, or elſe I would have kill'd him in the place: Tell the King, Mr: <hi>Recorder,</hi> that I ſay ſo.</p>
               <p>P.ibid. <hi>Starkey.</hi> If the King does not own what I told you, then count me the greateſt Knave that ever you ſpoke withal.</p>
               <p>P.81.l.11. Mr. <hi>Recorder:</hi> Mr. <hi>Starkey,</hi> What can you ſay for your ſelf?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Starkey:</hi> Mr. <hi>Recorder,</hi> I have here (<hi>plucking it out of his Pocket</hi>) his Majeſty's gracious Pardon, of the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his Reign:</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Recorder.</hi> I allow that, but you have ſtay'd here ſince:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Starkey.</hi> Why then, Mr. <hi>Recorder,</hi> pray will you adviſe me what to have done? Nature teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heth all men to ſhun danger, for I was threatned with Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if I ſtay'd in <hi>France</hi>; whether ſhould I ſtay there, or return to my native Countrey with my King? Now, Mr. <hi>Recorder,</hi> I deſire to know what you would have had me done?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Recorder.</hi> I ſhall acquaint the King, and will do you all the kindneſs I can with him:</p>
               <p>P.53.l.13. <hi>Starkey.</hi> Mr: <hi>Recorder,</hi> Give me leave to ſpeak one word: If any one ſhould have held to me that Poſition, that it is lawful to depoſe and murther Kings, I would have kill'd him in the place: Tell the King, Mr. <hi>Recorder,</hi> I ſay ſo.</p>
               <p>P.53. Mr. <hi>Anderſon.</hi> It is my comfort, that no one of common ſenſe can believe it:</p>
               <p>After the Sentence was pronounc'd;</p>
