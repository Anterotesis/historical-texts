            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou haſt here an Abridgment of our Parliamentary Laws againſt Jeſuites, Prieſts, and Popiſh Recuſants; (a people unquiet alwayes where they have not their Wills, or rather the will of their <hi>Romiſh Prelate,</hi> and his <hi>under-fry</hi> of Popiſh Prieſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) for a common <hi>Papiſt</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but <hi>Pars animata Domini Papae</hi>; And as it is a true Rule in the Civil Law, touching Servants or Children, <hi>Velle non creditur, qui obſequitur imperio patris vel Domini.</hi> So it is moſt true touching moſt Papiſts, their Souls are acted by, and tacked to the Dictates and will of their Supream Prieſt or falſe Prophet; elſe why ſhould his Canon Lawyers ſo ſordidly affirm as they do, &amp; have long agoe done in Print, <hi>Omnia Jura ſunt in ſcrinio pectoris Papae, &amp; Papa in omnibus juribus humanis diſpenſare poteſt, &amp; in quibuſdam Divinis</hi>? But I ſhall not trouble the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with ſuch <hi>dirty</hi> Aſſertions as his Canoniſts and other Writers, touching his <hi>pretended Authority,</hi> do and have made publick. As for my ſaying, That they are unquiet, it is too true, the Raigns of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:29472:3"/>
firſt, all teſtifie it; and his preſent Majeſty, in His Royal Proclamation, calls them [<hi>Inſolent</hi>;] I wiſh they were not ſo for their own ſakes as well as us <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> But I will travel no further into this Coaſt, onely I deſire the Reader to obſerve theſe two things in reading this Abridgment.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he take this Paper as an Abridgment of the Statute, and not the whole Statutes; and therefore let him reſort to the Statutes themſelves for fuller information, though here he hath the ſubſtance of every of the Statutes againſt <hi>Recuſants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That he be not offended with the Abridger for the Repetitions of things in later Statutes, that are mentioned in former Statutes; it pleaſed the Parliament to do ſo, and why may not the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridger do ſo too? And beſides, where ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions are, the latter Statutes, for the moſt part, enlarge the former Laws, either in the preceptive or penal part of them.</p>
            <p>I have no more to ſay to thee, but to deſire thee to take my pains in good part, for it is for my Countreys good I have done it, what ever the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh party may think on the contrary ſide, Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>

Experience hath dearly taught <hi>England</hi> that there was little ſafety to it, or ſecurity to Proteſtant Profeſſors, when your Religion Triumphed. Our Hiſtories are too full of your cruelties, to thoſe that were contrary minded to you, touching the pretended Authority of your Pope. <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> an Hiſtorian of your own Religion, and many others ſince, have given us an account of the many <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations of the Papal Chairs over the Kings of <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> To this Objection, I ſhall give you theſe anſwers for the preſent. <hi>1.</hi> This was your Predeceſſors complaint ever ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Reformation in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, even then, when your Predeceſsors were plotting and endeavouring to take away her life, witneſs Doctor <hi>Parry, Parſons,</hi> and many others deſigns againſt her, by the directions and countenance of your Romiſh Prelate, as our Hiſtories tells us. Is this Conſcience? No rational man can affirm it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If you will take the pains to look into a Book called the <hi>Cabbala, or Secrets of State;</hi>

Catholicks of</hi> England <hi>be ſo ſeverely handled, as they then were by her Laws, for their Conſciences? VValſingham</hi> anſwers him to this effect, as far as my memory ſerves me to remember, for I have not the Book by me.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That the Queen puniſhed none of the Papists for their Conſciences, for this was a Rule with her, <hi>That Conſcience is not to be forced, but to be rectifyed and reduced by the help of all good means and inſtructions, and by the ayd of time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Another Rule that ſhe alſo obſerved, was to this effect, <hi>That if men, who pretended Conſcience, did grow Seditious, and diſturb the Government, then it was no more Conſcience, but the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate might puniſh ſuch people notwithſtanding their pretended Conciences;</hi> and ſhews him the many diſturbances the Papiſts attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the Queens government, and deſigns againſt her perſon, which was the cauſe of her making ſo ſevere Laws: and I think none of you can deny the truth and wholeſomneſs of theſe Rules againſt your preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Conſciences.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> But to add one anſwer more to theſe of <hi>VValfinghams</hi> againſt your pretended Conſcience, Do you not all hold it as a certain principle, that <hi>the Pope is ſuperiour to all the Kings in the VVorld in Spirituals, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in their own Kingdoms?</hi> And ſo (by conſequence) to the King of <hi>England;</hi> And do you not hold that <hi>in ordine ad Spiritualia,</hi> he may cauſe Inſurrections to be raiſed in any Kings Dominions, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate and depoſe Kings? &amp;c. And are not you bound to do what ever he commands you in order to Spirituals? Nay, have not your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors by their practices verified theſe things? Every underſtanding man that knows ought of your Religion, and practiſe of your Anceſtors, knows this to be true; Is this Conſcience? Is not this <hi>high Treaſon by the Laws of moſt Princes in the World, who make Laws but according to meer Reaſon?</hi> Is it not moſt certain, that <hi>no other ſort of Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or Religions in the known world holds this wicked Principle but your ſelves</hi>? and will you alone call this <hi>Conſcience?</hi> away with ſuch pretentions; take but the Oath of Supremacy, and you will clear us of the great and certain fears had by all the Parliaments of <hi>England,</hi> and all ſober men, for above fourſcore years laſt past: <hi>That you are more faithful to the Pope, then to our</hi> Engliſh <hi>Kings and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> Elſe you muſt let us ſtill believe, you are <hi>Factious</hi> and not <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious.</hi>
