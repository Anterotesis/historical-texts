            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But becauſe I would reuiue the memory of famous men to the good example of others, and relate ſome paſſages worthy the obſeruation to the renowne of vertuous and worthy exploites,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19613:3"/>
giue me leaue by way of introduction to ſpeake ſomething of thoſe times, and ſo by coherence of Story you ſhall ſee me fall into the matter now propoſed.</p>
            <p>It pleaſed the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> in the behalfe of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> being then his abſolute Gouernour in the Low Countries, after that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer memorable Victory in 88. to lay ſiege vnto <hi>Bergen</hi> with aboue 30000. men, as if hee reſolued to doe ſome thing worthy of his Honour, and memorable to poſterity, as it were in recouery of thoſe loſſes and fortunes, which both hapned to him and his Maſter at that time: but ſo many Skirmiſhes, Stratagems, and encounters were then put in practice, that hee was compelled to riſe and leaue the Siege, till better opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fairer dayes.</p>
            <p>I will not ſpeake a worde of neither Armies, nor their skirmiſhes, nor their Aſſaults, nor their Batteries, nor their Sallies, nor their ſtratagems, nor of <hi>Grimſton</hi> and <hi>Redhead,</hi> by whoſe pollicy and ſeruice, 400. of <hi>Parma's</hi> beſt Gentlemen loſt their liues: but of the brauery of the beſieged and the glory of the Engliſh, whoſe fame flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ouer the world.</p>
            <p>For in this ſiege, that Sonne of <hi>Mars</hi> the Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> was Generall of the Engliſh, and ſuch a Generall, that his authority extended in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of honour vpon well deſeruers, which appeared in Knighting thoſe famous Dutchmen
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19613:3"/>
Sir <hi>Paul Buxe,</hi> and Sir <hi>Marcellus Buxe,</hi> who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proued Gouernour of <hi>Bergen,</hi> and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued many yeares.</p>
            <p>But at this inſtant Sir <hi>Thomas Morgan</hi> a Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell was Gouernour of the place, and had 6000. braue defendants in the Towne: there were alſo famous Commanders all Engliſh, the Lord <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> Gouernour of <hi>Brill,</hi> a ſpirit of vnmatchable Valour: Sir <hi>Nicholas Parker</hi> called Captaine of the blacke Lances: Sir <hi>William Drury,</hi> Sir <hi>William Pellam,</hi> and ſo many other, all Commaunders, that their well deſeruing commaunds me to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, leaſt I ſhould by this my ſlender diſcourſe extenuate their Noble fame, and merit.</p>
            <p>There came likewiſe as Voluntiers, and ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of this Theater of Warre, the Right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Earle of Northumberland, Sir <hi>Iohn Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi> and diuers others: yea heere were faire Ladies too, who were ſo farre from artificiall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminatenes, that they ſcorned the ſmoake of powder, and knewe (beſides the iuſtification of their courages) that true beauty would not, nor could not be impaired with a little duſt, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours of a thickned ayre.</p>
            <p>All theſe endured this Siege, and in ſteed of Courtly muſicke had the roaring Cannon ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in their eares: in ſteed of ſumptuous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broderings, and beſpangled Cloakes with golde and Pearle, or other dainty fights, many times beheld bloody Caſſocks, &amp; wounded Soldiers:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19613:4"/>
and all the ſences both of men and women were here to ſuffer vnſauery obiects, and ſubiects, and to make tryall of their patience and conſtancy, which they did with perſeuerance to the end: yea this is moſt remarkeable, that when the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> made his approaches, as if hee pretended a battery, and ſo a breach, the heroijck Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> ſent him word to ſpare that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, if he pleaſed: For he ſhould haue a Port o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, enter if hee could: whereupon the Prince was much amazed, and ſo hauing a full halfe, yeares tryall of the buſines, and ſtill encombred with the dayly ſallies, and excurſions of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, he thought it farre better to raiſe his ſiege with honour, and vpon equall tearmes, then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture ſo many liues, and yet (as he had beene in ſome caſes put to it) hazard his renowne with fearefull loſſe and detriment.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore ouerlooke their actions to vnderſtand, which way this ſiege comes about, and how time hath brought them into this threatning and danger.</p>
            <p>After the taking in of <hi>Weſell</hi> and <hi>Gulick</hi> by <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola,</hi> wherein the firſt they left <hi>Don Lewis de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſco</hi> for Gouernour: and in the laſt <hi>Henry Vande Bergen,</hi> the Army retired to their ſeuerall Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſurely meant to repoſe themſelues in ſome reſt and quietnes, had not contrary to cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and the time of the yeare to draw men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fields. <hi>Don Ynigo,</hi> Gouernour of the Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19613:4"/>
of <hi>Antwarp,</hi> proiected to doe ſomething worthy of his renowne, and the ſeruice of his Miſtreſſe the Arch-Dutches, and this was the beſieging of <hi>Sluice:</hi> whereupon hee vndertooke the buſineſſe in the beginning of Aprill laſt, with ſeuen or 8000. Wallons and Spaniards, diſpier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them ſome to <hi>Dyſendike:</hi> ſome to St. <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> a Fort builded and poſſeſſed by the States, and ſome to ſuch places, where hee thought it moſt conuenient to beſtow them, reſoluing to enter vpon <hi>Caſſant,</hi> and other paſſages, whereby hee might with eaſe come vpon the bankes, and ſo bring his approches neerer the Towne, which to effect, he built a Fort, and put therein a Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon to come neerer and neerer, to ſet his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne on her beſt feet.</p>
            <p>This he firſt attempted, when <hi>Spinolas</hi> Army watched the <hi>Rhine,</hi> &amp; the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked his Army by <hi>Weſell:</hi> and this hee did of purpoſe, as I take it, to diuert his Excellencie from following him any further, ſuppoſing hee would returne to defend a Towne of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as <hi>Sluice</hi> was: but the States had leiſure and meanes (without troubling the Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> at all) to ſupply their wants, &amp; ſend more Companies into the Towne: ſo that <hi>Spinola</hi> got nothing, but the loſſe of men, with cold, hunger, and ſicknes all the Winter, and ſo conſumed his Army, that he tried many friends and Countries
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19613:5"/>
to fill vp his troupes and Companies. At laſt, the Winter falling out ſo ſtrange, and <hi>Don Ynigo</hi> perceiuing all accidents to counter-checke his pretences; he tooke another courſe for the time, and returned to <hi>Antwarp,</hi> doing no great matter about <hi>Sluice,</hi> but raiſing a Fort a little neerer, which they ſay hee could not effect without the loſſe of 800. men.</p>
            <p>When my Lords the States vnderſtoode of this retreat, and that <hi>Caſſant</hi> and other Polders of land round about, were free from this threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning perill and diſpleaſure, they aduiſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for the beſt, and by a premeditated ſetled Councell, reſolued not to looſe <hi>Sluice,</hi> nor haue her hedges trodden downe round about her, that is, her Bulwarkes and Trenches demoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, or poſſeſſed by Strangers: whereupon they concluded to cut all the ditches, and let in the Sea, which they did in the end of February, and in which worke the Contributory Boores were imployed: and although it turned much to their preiudice, as looſing both land, and dwelling by this courſe: yet when they ſaw, it was for the ſeruice of the States, and the preſeruation of the Towne, they quickly accorded, and played the Pyoners in the buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>They began behinde the Fort of St. <hi>Cateline,</hi> and ſo diſpierced themſelues to <hi>Crines,</hi> Saint
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19613:5"/>
               <hi>Margarite,</hi> Saint <hi>Hieronimo,</hi> Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> the <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage,</hi> and many <hi>Polaers</hi> of land, with the other Forts and Holds round about, but when the tide came in a pace: they made ſure <hi>Rowfellares, Hollands dike,</hi> and many Fortifications on the other ſide, which might be preiudiciall to the maine buſineſſe, ſo that at laſt the Sea ſwelled almoſt as farre as <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and the Enemy was glad to ſecure themſelues by returning, and ſo the coaſt was in a manner cleared at this time: For <hi>Monſieur de Hautin</hi> the Gouernour of <hi>Sluice,</hi> made a ſalley with fifteene hundred, amongſt whom were ſufficient Commaunders, and well experienced Trenchers and Engineeres, who performed this worke in ſuch a manner, that the principall Fortreſſes, which ſerued for the defence of <hi>Sluice,</hi> were all ſecured and kept vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; and although the Sea ſwelled as farre as <hi>Vedo</hi> and <hi>Buſcams Vell,</hi> yet was the land not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the liues of ſo many braue Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who muſt needes periſh, if this had not beene done, and the ſiege of <hi>Sluice</hi> once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted throughly.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Spinola</hi> vnderſtood, what was done, hee retired in his perſon to <hi>Bruſsels,</hi> from the clamours of the Army, who began to want their pay, and murmur for lacke of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſatisfaction: whereupon hee gaue the Commaunders leaue to promiſe them faire, and threaten once againe the ſurpriſing of <hi>Sluice,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19613:6"/>
Breda,</hi> and <hi>Bergen,</hi> as though they would haue three Armies on foote at once, and meant to make an end of the Warre in one Summer, to which they were the rather animated, becauſe they heard of new ſupplies out of <hi>England,</hi> to fill vp the Regiments of the Earles of <hi>Tyrone</hi> and <hi>Argile,</hi> who were both heere entertained as Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels vnder the Archdutches ſeruice.</p>
            <p>But when this threatning paſſed ouer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attempting any thing worthy of moment, the Prince of <hi>Orenges</hi> brother, <hi>Graue Henry,</hi> with fiue thouſand foot, and ſixe hundred horſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into <hi>Brabant,</hi> burning Villages, ſpoyling Townes, and forraging all the Countrey, in ſo much that the fires were ſeene at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and the Inhabitants ranne into their walled Townes for their preſeruation: yea, when <hi>Spinola</hi> feaſted the Ambaſſadours, and attended the determination of the truce, was this braue Souldier reading his Subiects a leſſon of Warre and Slaughter, and tyed them to harder conditions then euer they learned in their liues; by which occaſion hee mightily enriched himſelfe, and returned to the <hi>Hage</hi> with great booty, ſpoile, treaſure, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
            <p>Whereby the Enemy grewe enraged, and thought vpon nothing but reuenge, which at laſt they effected vpon the ſurprizing of <hi>Bergen vp Zome,</hi> wherein failing, they fell into the courſe of

beſieging it, whereat they remaine at this houre; but becauſe many remarkeable thinges chanced in this preparation, I thinke it not amiſſe to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Diſcourſe in this manner.</p>
            <p>The Towne of <hi>Bergen</hi> is of as great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the States in Brabant, as <hi>Sluice</hi> in Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: For as this watcheth <hi>Oſtend, Newport, Dumkirke,</hi> and other maritine Townes, yea ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a doore to <hi>Ipers, Gaunt</hi> and all the land Countrey, that keepeth the Riuers, and is the Key of the continent letting you in to the fieldes of <hi>Antwerpe, Thurmount, Auſchiroten,</hi> and all the great Townes of <hi>Brabant</hi>: It ſtandeth on the Eaſt ſide of the Riuer of <hi>Some,</hi> comming from <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe,</hi> &amp; <hi>Antwerpe</hi> is ſcituated within 15. <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile, and was one of the famous Marte Townes of the world: and as this Bergen is the very Gate or entrance into the Countrey, ſo is it in a manner the barre and hinderance of the Enemy into Zealand and Holland: The States haue likewiſe diuers Sconces in the Iland of <hi>Tole</hi> or <hi>Tertoll</hi> of great reſpect and neceſſity, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Fiue mile of Bergen, they poſſeſſe a Towne called <hi>Steen Bergen,</hi> on the Weſt banke of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Riuer comming out of the Countrey, at the mouth whereof, they haue another Sconce and other Fortes.</p>
            <p>I will not ſpeake of <hi>Breda,</hi> and ſome places in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19613:7"/>
the States iuriſdiction, nor how the Townes are diuided, though the whole Countrey in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is in the Arch-Dutcheſſe poſſeſſion: but the truth is, that the Gouernour of <hi>Antwerpe</hi> taking aduantage of certaine Companies, which mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out of <hi>Bergen</hi> toward <hi>Breda,</hi> and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the Gouernour of <hi>Bergen</hi> was alſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſent <hi>Spinola</hi> word of the ſame, who preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proiected to make vſe thereof, and take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of their abſence: and the truth is, that the Gouernour being called as they ſay <hi>Rehonen,</hi> perceiuing his Commiſſion growing to an end, and vnderſtanding that the Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> was comming with his Army toward <hi>Breda,</hi> tooke a Conuoy of 2000. and went thither with intent and purpoſe to renue his Patents, but ere hee came there, a Meſſenger was ſent vnto him to returne in all haſt to his Gouernment, for the Enemy was on foot and had ſome proiect in hand, which ſomewhat amazed him, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as he thought hee had not full Authority to commaund the Garriſons: notwithſtanding this meditation, the neceſſity of the time ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwayed all nicety and exceptions, and hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes very opportunely with all his Company to the Towne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spinola</hi> followes his firſt purpoſe, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points 3000. from <hi>Antwerpe</hi> to giue the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: among whom they will haue the Earle
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19613:7"/>
of <hi>Argiles</hi> Regiment to bee thruſt: the charge and rule of this Company is committed into the hands of two Spaniards, the one called <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> the other <hi>Velaſco,</hi> ſome ſay <hi>Lewis de Velaſco</hi> Gouernour of <hi>Weſell,</hi> who vnderſtanding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Armies to quarter about <hi>Brabant,</hi> found occaſion to bee diſpenced withall, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſeruice nearer home.</p>
            <p>Well, let the Names paſſe, the Company march downe apace, and with all expedition take the ſame ſide of the Riuer where <hi>Bergen</hi> ſtands, but it ſhould ſeeme they came ſhort halfe a day at leaſt: For before they had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched 7. Engliſh mile, they vnderſtand how <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> was ſupplyed (as you haue heard) yet they goe forward, and come at laſt to their Rendey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, where they grewe ſo angry and exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they would needs giue an attempt in a rage both on the Wall, and at the Ports, where the Cannon from the Towne played ſo violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the Musket at reſt ſhot ſo effectually, that they loſt 600. men at the firſt aſſault, the moſt of them Iriſh and Engliſh newly come out of their Countries.</p>
            <p>This began on Wedneſday as I take it the Tenth of Iuly: the next day they attempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and proffered another Aſſault, but heere
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19613:8"/>
they were repulſed with a Salley, in which a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Colonell Scotchman loſt his life in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the Towne, but it was a deare loſſe to the Enemy: For before the skirmiſh ended, there lay 200. on the ground, and they were enforced to retire, ſome will haue them fight the third day likewiſe, but I thinke that was imployed in another buſines, for the Enemy finding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of this ſtrong Towne, tooke another courſe and marched to a weaker, I meane <hi>Steen-Bergen,</hi> which not able to endure either battery or aſſault, they eaſily tooke by compoſition, as alſo a Sconce by it, which they obtained with finall repulſe.</p>
            <p>I haue yet ſaid little of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who thought as little of this attempt or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, but onely ſuppoſed that Breda or Sluice might bee the obiect of his Sommers imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo the Warre to continue either in Brabant or Flaunders, whereupon hee brought downe moſt of his Forces, and ſetled himſelfe a while about <hi>Schetogen Boſch,</hi> and was (as they ſaid) himſelfe gone toward <hi>Rees,</hi> where hee ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed the Townes in the States poſſeſſion, and tooke order, that all the Garriſons ſhould bee ready to come into the Field at his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for which purpoſe hee alſo ſent to the Commaunders and Captaines that were in England, to come ouer with expedition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:19613:8"/>In the meane while this was done, as you haue heard, the Gouernour <hi>Reehouen</hi> returned to his charge, and ordred <hi>Bergen</hi> againſt the Obſeſſion and expugnation, if <hi>Spinola</hi> ſo determined the matter.</p>
            <p>Now they will haue 2000. foote, and 300. horſe all ready in the towne, amongſt whom they haue named the companies of Sir <hi>Th. Winn,</hi> Sir <hi>Michaell Eueret,</hi> Captaine <hi>Appleton,</hi> who had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a Dutch woman and dwelt in the ſame place, with diuers others attending the ſeruice, and the iſſue of theſe troubles: the greateſt part of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my lying, as I ſayd, about <hi>Breda,</hi> a towne of their owne, and <hi>Schetogen Boſch</hi> belonging to the Arch-Dukes, which peraduenture they determined to beſiege, howeuer they may now be diſappointed, either in raiſing the enemy from <hi>Bergen,</hi> or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying themſelues to ouer-looke their actions, if they continue there this Sommer.</p>
            <p>By this time <hi>Spinola</hi> vnderſtands what is done on both ſides, and how his forces haue beene diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, which made him alter his purpoſe for a Rendez-vous at <hi>Maeſtrich,</hi> and draw all his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons toward <hi>Antwarp</hi> out of <hi>Mechlin, Arſchot, Huſſet, Biſſell,</hi> and other townes and villages, where they had wintred: ſo that though he lay himſelfe ſtill in perſon at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> vpon greater matters of importance: yet he diſpoſed of his buſines, that the country was reſolued, he determined an abſolute ſiege: for 15. peeces of Ordnance were ſent out of <hi>Antwarp</hi> downe the Riuer, and 10000. more men marched by land to the new begun Campe. Hee
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19613:9"/>
alſo ſent ſupplyes to the Gouernour of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> with a ſpeciall command to haue an eye vpon <hi>Sluiſe,</hi> and make ſome attempt that way, as occaſion ſhall ſerue. It is alſo ſayd that the Gouernours of <hi>Ipren</hi> and <hi>Liſſe</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> who had loſt a ſonne in a skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> deſired to bee at this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</p>
            <p>All this while the ſiege is but preparing, for the army was not quite come downe, nor the prouiſion for the expugnation brought together, as Hurdles, Gabions, Cariages, Munition, Traces for horſes, Carts, Wagons, and ſuch like: yet was ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary matter accompliſhed: for the Poſt of <hi>Antwarp</hi> reports, and the letters certifie as much that they heard the Cannon play thither: ſo that by all likelihood it is fully reſolued, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſettle themſelues to the enterpriſe, although they want men to fill vp their companies, as hauing loſt this winter by caſualty at leaſt 6000.</p>
            <p>They ſay, that in the firſt attempt there were ſo many dead bodyes, that thirty Wagons at once haue come with them into <hi>Antwarp,</hi> and in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enterpriſes the towne was ſo ſtrong and well prouided, that they made diuers ſallies ere their enemies could be ſetled to their much preiudice, and retired themſelues to their faſtneſſe at pleaſure</p>
            <p>Other letters aſſure vs, that the country ſending in three hundred Wagons with prouiſion to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the wants of the army, which began already to feele ſome inconueniences: they were ſet vpon by ſome of his <hi>Excellencies</hi> troopes and companyes lying about <hi>Breda,</hi> as they were going ouer the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19613:9"/>
Heathes, wide of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and ſo after a skirmiſh ſurpriſed: for the Conuoy lagging behinde, and not keeping together with the reſt, ſmarted for the diſorder, and were compelled to ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
            <p>When the States of <hi>Holland</hi> vnderſtood of all theſe proceedings, they beſtirred themſelues and ſent diuers men of warre to attend about <hi>Zealand,</hi> of which ſome of them ſtept into the riuer, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept ſuch boates, as ſhould come from <hi>Antwerp</hi> to the army: the reſt that kept the Sea behaued themſelues ſo well, that the Letters ſay, they tooke a ſhip full of Souldiers going to <hi>Dunckirke,</hi> whom they examined and finding that the Souldiers knew no other, but that they went into the Low Countries, they hanged vp the Lieutenant and carried all the reſt priſoners to <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to watch for thoſe companies which are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of <hi>England</hi> to ſerue the Archduches. For rumor cannot be ſo ſparing but that they know by name the Captaines of euery Countrey and the manner of raiſing their men.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other things the Marchants aſſure vs, that at this inſtant there lie fiftie or ſixtie ſayle of <hi>Hollanders</hi> and Pirates of <hi>Argier</hi> before <hi>Lisbone,</hi> who not onely watch the harbours and townes but the Sea it ſelfe, as hauing made a contract with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Tunis</hi> alſo to aſſociate and defend one anothers, both againſt <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugals,</hi> whom they reſolue to empoueriſh and damnifie all they can, as men reſolued to haue neither peace nor truce any longer with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:19613:10"/>But to returne to the ſiege at <hi>Bergen,</hi> for all theſe attempts it is ſuppoſed that the ſiege will not lye long before it, nor the enemy continue with ſuch reſolution, as to make it a worke of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, but euen doe as the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> did in the beginning of this relation leaue it, and take ſome other enterpriſe in hand, and that for diuers reaſons at this inſtant.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe they cannot command the Riuer, but the towne will be relieued at all times by Sea, which they cannot auoyde.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe the ſeate of the warre is now as it were in their owne countrey, and the Prince of <hi>Orenges</hi> army muſt both be releeued and ſet on worke in <hi>Brabant,</hi> euen to the terrifying of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe rumor hath played a womans part, and told them that ſome of Count <hi>Mansfields</hi> forces are come out of <hi>Alſatia,</hi> as farre as <hi>Loraine</hi> and <hi>Luizenberg</hi>: and either meane to bee their owne caruers of the bleſſings of theſe Prouinces, or vnite themſelues to the Prince of <hi>Orenge,</hi> if occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſerue to increaſe his army, and remoue the ſiege.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, becauſe they are afraide to want mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money, conſidering their treaſure is ſo many waies exhauſted, and the Emperor muſt not be neglected in his deſignes.</p>
            <p>And laſt of all, becauſe there are many hollow hearts in <hi>Antwarp,</hi> and what know they whether (beſides the treaſon that may bee wrought) the Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> if the peace of the <hi>Palatinate</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:19613:10"/>
thriue, will ſend for the Duke of <hi>Brunſwicke,</hi> and ſet him on worke on theſe good townes: ſo that whether <hi>Tilley</hi> follow or no, or that <hi>Gonzales</hi> come to <hi>Spinola</hi> againe, yet muſt a bloody warre enſue, and the 17. Prouinces in the end ſmart for all.</p>
