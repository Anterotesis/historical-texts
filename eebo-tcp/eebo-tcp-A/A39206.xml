            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <lg>
                  <l>Shut up your Doors; hang Mourning on your Walls:</l>
                  <l>When Death does ſtrike, the greateſt Heroe falls;</l>
                  <l>All muſt obey, when the Commander calls.</l>

                  <l>The Juſt and Good Death's Warrant muſt obey;</l>

                  <l>None can withſtand, when ſummon'd hence away.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>Go mourn! go mourn! and, as your ſtrength grows ſtronger,</l>
               <l>Th' more mournful be, 'cauſe SHORTER liv'd no LONGER.</l>
               <l>Let his Praetorian Duſt not ever lie</l>
               <l>I'th' Grave forgot without an Elegy;</l>
               <l>For HE, who was ſo Juſt, and ſo well given,</l>
               <l>Without all doubt He's ſoared up to Heaven:</l>
               <l>His Deeds will make him ever be Renown'd,</l>
               <l>Whenas His Body's laid within the Ground,</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>And lift His Soul above the reach of Hate,</l>
                  <l>And place 't in ſuch an ever-happy State,</l>
                  <l>That never will be ſubject unto Fate.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>Tho' Death has ſtruck Him, and has made him yield,</l>
               <l>Yet He has conquer'd, and has won the Field.</l>
               <l>Death could not hurt His Soul, That's too ſublime:</l>
               <l>His <hi>Heart</hi> did always with his <hi>Tongue</hi> keep time.</l>
               <l>If ought could h' ſav'd Him, ſure He had not dy'd,</l>
               <l>For all good means to ſave His Life was try'd.</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>And, Oh! He's gone! He is no more! the Skill</l>
                  <l>Of all Phyſicians could not help His Ill,</l>
                  <l>Becauſe it was the Great <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s Will.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>His Life was <hi>Shorter</hi> than we did deſire:</l>
                  <l>Yet let's be patient, for He's mounted higher,</l>
                  <l>To ſing Praiſes in the Bleſſed Quire</l>
               </lg>
               <l>Of holy Angels; and we may ſee plain,</l>
               <l>What was <hi>Our Loſs,</hi> prov'd <hi>His Eternal Gain:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>His Earthly Pains they now do end therefore,</l>
               <l>And He will live in Bliſs for evermore.</l>
               <l>His Charity was great, the Poor He loved;</l>
               <l>Whenas <hi>They</hi> cry'd, <hi>He</hi> was with Pity moved.</l>
               <l>He was a Friend to all, He hated none:</l>
               <l>(Ah! now, alas! I weep to think He's gone)</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>His Enemies he lov'd, and thoſe that ſought</l>
                  <l>To ruin him, and bring him unto nought,</l>
                  <l>He never for them had an evil thought.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>He always took the Scripture for his Guide;</l>
               <l>He ſerv'd his GOD, his Countrey too befide:</l>
               <l>Loyal to's Prince, and true unto his Truſt,</l>
               <l>In nothing ever was he found unjuſt:</l>
               <l>He lov'd his <hi>Neighbor</hi> as <hi>Himſelf,</hi> and none</l>
               <l>Of ſuch as needed but he look'd upon.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Fatherleſs</hi> he gave to, and <hi>their Cauſe</hi>
               </l>
               <l>He did maintain by the Almighty's Laws:</l>
               <l>The <hi>Widow</hi> he Defended, and Reliev'd,</l>
               <l>And in his ſight the <hi>Orphan</hi> never griev'd.</l>
               <l>The Cauſe he knew not he pitied, and</l>
               <l>Unto the Poor he never ſhut his hand.</l>
               <l>And, to give brave SHORTER but his due,</l>
               <l>He ſerved GOD, and was to all Men true:</l>
               <l>He's now in Heaven, gone for to receive</l>
               <l>The Juſt Reward for them which do believe.</l>
