            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>manded by the <hi>Knights,</hi> and <hi>Burgesses,</hi> to present unto your <hi>Lordships</hi> their answer to what was proposed yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
            <p n="1">1 They take notice of your <hi>Lordships</hi> desire, that a true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence may bee kept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Houses, for so your Lordships did expresse it</p>
            <p>In this they do with all cheerfulnesse concurre with your Lordships, as knowing that this sweet <hi>conjunction</hi> between your <hi>Lordships</hi> and <hi>them</hi> is the <hi>golden Chain</hi> which bindes up in one <hi>Gordian knot</hi> the <hi>strength,</hi> the <hi>beauty,</hi> the <hi>happinesse</hi> of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which so knit together is not to be broken in sunder by the fiercest violence.</p>
            <p>

Therefore, who desires to unlinke this <hi>Chaine,</hi> and dissolve this <hi>knot,</hi> or fails of his part, to the preserving and continuing it <hi>fast,</hi> and <hi>firme,</hi> and <hi>entire,</hi> let the sin of it lie at his doore, nay, let it come into the midst of his house, and consume it let <hi>him</hi> perish, and his <hi>posterity</hi> inherit onely his shame.</p>
            <p>So carefull will the House of Commons be to <hi>cherish,</hi> and <hi>maintain,</hi> this good correspondencie with your <hi>Lordships</hi> in all things.</p>
            <p>Then for the businesse about which your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships</hi> were then pleased to conferre with them, which was a <hi>printed paper</hi> you had met with all, as you said, in your house, setting forth some <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions</hi> of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> concerning which you put unto us these two Interrogatories, <hi>videlicet,</hi> The first, and second Votes which were read.</p>

And not finding this paper attested by their Clerke under his <hi>hand,</hi> they could not judge of it, till they had resorted to his <hi>booke</hi> where their <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and their <hi>votes</hi> are entred: where they found their <hi>votes</hi> concerning their late <hi>Protestation</hi> taken both by your <hi>Lordships</hi> and <hi>them,</hi> and they found the contents of this paper to agree <hi>in terminis</hi> with what is entred in their <hi>Clerks</hi> book.</p>
            <p>Then they called to minde what had passed in the <hi>House</hi> upon that <hi>occasion</hi> when those <hi>resolutions</hi> of theirs were voted; How they had considered of that <hi>Protestation</hi> that it bound all men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the <hi>Religion</hi> here established, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This they conceived to be a true <hi>test</hi> of every good <hi>Subject,</hi> a <hi>Shibboleth</hi> to distinguish the <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits</hi> from the <hi>Gileadites,</hi> that whosoever was wel affected in <hi>Religion,</hi> and to the good of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth</hi> would make this Protestation: and on the other side who would not make it was not well affected.</p>
            <p>And such a man, they held it their <hi>duties,</hi> in discharge of the <hi>trust</hi> reposed in them by the whole <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> all the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> who have set them out as so many <hi>Sentinels</hi> to watch for them, to give them notice of the <hi>good</hi> or the <hi>evill,</hi> friends or enemies, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towards them, they held it I say their duties to declare their <hi>opinions,</hi> that such a man was not their <hi>friend,</hi> was unfit to beare any office in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> and therefore they passed this <hi>Vote,</hi> that it is a thing <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> to be done by them; and for such they do avow it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:105506:4"/>
And besides they thought it fit to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to those who had employed <hi>them,</hi> the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Counties</hi> and <hi>Burroughs</hi> that sent them, to give them a <hi>Marke,</hi> by which they might know who were <hi>goodmen,</hi> lovers of their <hi>Countrey,</hi> fit to be entrusted with <hi>Offices,</hi> with the <hi>over-sight</hi> of any part of <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State:</hi> and therefore they gave <hi>order</hi> this <hi>Vote</hi> should be sent downe unto all the parts of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>And lastly, that it might be done <hi>speedily,</hi> and not stay the writing out of so many Copies, they gave order it should be <hi>printed,</hi> and be <hi>attested</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Clerks</hi> hand, with order &amp;c.</p>
