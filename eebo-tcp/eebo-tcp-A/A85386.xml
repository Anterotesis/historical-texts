         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

fancies and imaginations of ſome men, many times work
them into very uncouth, violent, unſeemly, and unchriſtian
diſtempers, which makes them out of meaſure forgetfull of
themſelves, and of all rules of reaſon, equitie, and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
in their repreſentations of, and conteſtations againſt
both the one and the other. Eſpecially when the ſpeciall and
particular points of difference between them and others, are
of a difficult eviction and clearing on their parts, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
hereof is a ſore temptation upon them to make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a voyage beyond the line of Truth, to fetch Apes and Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks,
and I know not what monſters both of practiſes and
opinions to beſtow upon them; that ſo the uncontroverted
diſparagement which they hope to derive upon their oppoſites
by ſuch imputations as theſe, may help to mediate the like
diſparagement of their judgements in thoſe other matters of
difference, in the thoughts and minds of men. Nor doth an
Accuſer (ordinarily) open his mouth to that wideneſſe, or
lift up his voyce to that ſtrength and ſtraine of clamour,
when he can come by any thing that is reall and matter of
truth, to make his accuſation, as when he is conſtrained to
ſerve his diſpoſition in that kinde, with that which is ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and pretended onely. The <hi>Jews</hi> that ſought the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion

any thing of reall demerit againſt him (for <hi>Pilate</hi> himſelf
<hi>knew well that they had delivered him out of envie</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 27. 18.</note>)
thought to fill up the emptineſſe of their cauſe or accuſation,
with the abundant loudneſſe and importunitie of their cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and cry: <hi>But they CRYED, AWAY WITH

And in another place, becauſe they could not <hi>with truth</hi>

againſt <hi>M. S.</hi> and ſome others of the ſame engagement,
that I could name, would ever have ſought protection for

or collaterall impeachment of thoſe who are
of oppoſite judgement to us therein, it is a ſore teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

of the royall line and race of Truth; who is able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
all her legitimate off-ſpring, with her owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>means,

            <p>Till the Sons of Difference in matters controverſiall,
give over all wreſting (at leaſt, all wilfull wreſting) and
perverting of the ſayings, doings, and opinions of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites,

            <p>This briefe advertiſement I thought needfull to impart
unto thee; and if thou haſt the taſte and reliſh of it in thy

God on thy behalf, that the peruſall of the little piece enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

of his credit and reputation before lay ſomewhat heavy upon the
ſhoulder of <hi>Independencie,</hi> and oppreſſed it; by the unchriſtian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancie
and impertinencie of this Diſcourſe, he hath ſo farre
eas'd and reduced the burthenſomneſſe of it, that it may now be
endured and borne without much detriment or diſadvantage.
And doubtleſſe, Divine providence was above him in drawing this

weight, his method had been to have laid the foundation of ſuch
credence, by ſpeaking Truth in thoſe things, which are every mans
inquirie and cognizance, and wherein the miſcarriage of his pen
is obvious unto all. For he that hath not ſo much policie as <hi>in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis

            <p>I ſhall not (for the preſent) inſiſt upon the refutation of thoſe
twelve imputations in his Epiſtle to the Reader,<note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> wherewith he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to render the <hi>Independents</hi> odious; all and every of which,
(except the fift) are every whit as appliable (as I am able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
in the ſight of the Sunne) to his partie, as to the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents,</hi>
and ſome of them with farre more truth to the former,
then to the latter. And for that inference which he deduceth from
the fift particular there charged upon the <hi>Independents</hi> (which is
the ſting of the charge) as <hi>viz.</hi> that denying <hi>there is any Nationall

to neglect, or anſwer, as God ſhall direct him.</p>
            <p>But fourthly, (and laſtly) I ſhall briefly acquaint the Reader,
how unworthily my Antagoniſt hath dealt by me, (that I ſay not
by himſelf, and his own Reputation) firſt, by aſſertion of untruths;
ſecondly, by cruell and unreaſonable wreſtings and torturing of
my words, to make them ſpeak what they never meant; thirdly,
(and laſtly) by ſlight and empty replies to things aſſerted and laid
down by me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the firſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> 
               <hi>he cites my two Sermons (intituled</hi> Theomachia)
<hi>and my</hi> Innocencies Triumph, <hi>as</hi> denying (<hi>hee means diſſwading</hi>) all
oppoſition in word, deed, or thought againſt the Way of Independency,
as a direct fighting againſt God<note n="b" place="margin">Epiſt. Ded. p 3. paulò ab initio.</note>; <hi>which is a moſt notorious untruth;
all that I drive at in theſe Diſcourſes, is to diſſwade men from</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
this Way with an high hand, <hi>leſt in ſo doing, men ſhould</hi>
fight againſt God: <hi>there is no ſuch aſſertion as this which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               </hi> Pryn
<hi>chargeth upon me, nor any neer it, or like unto it, in either of thoſe
Tracts. I no where affirm,</hi> all oppoſition to this Way, <hi>whether</hi> in
word, deed, or thought, to be a direct fighting againſt God. <hi>Nay,</hi> p. 12.
<hi>of my</hi> Theomachia, <hi>I affirm the quite contrary,</hi> viz. that it is not
every degree or kinde of oppoſing a Way or Doctrine which is from God,
which either the Text or the Doctrine calleth a fighting againſt God; but
only ſuch an oppoſing which is peremptory, and carried on with an high
hand, &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:111442:7"/>
            <p>2. He cites my Sermon,<note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> preached <hi>Febr.</hi> 25. 1643. My <hi>Theomachia</hi>
and <hi>Innocencies Triumph,</hi> as holding forth this Poſition, <hi>That every
particular Congregation of viſible Saints, and Independent Church, is
under the Government of Chriſt alone, as the</hi> ONLY <hi>Head, King,
Governour, Law-giver of it; and ſubject to</hi> NO OTHER JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RISDICTION,
<hi>then that of Chriſt, his Word and Spirit, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Ibidem.</note>
Which concluſion, though generally held and maintained by
Proteſtants againſt Papiſts; and in that reſpect I need neither
be afraid, nor aſhamed to own it; yet if hee can find, or make out
with any tolerable conſtruction of words and ſaying, of any, or
all of thoſe pieces of mine which he chargeth with it, let Mr <hi>Pryn</hi>
be true, and me the lier. But if otherwiſe, <hi>currat lex,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. He chargeth me with affirming (in the fore-mentioned Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon)
<hi>that it would be more eaſie for me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> 
               <hi>and I ſhould rather yeeld to be
torn in pieces by wild horſes, then ſubmit to ſuch a Government which
proceeded from a Parliament choſen by the Riffe-raffe of the world,</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> &amp;c.
Never was there an innocent and harmleſſe expreſſion more cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and deſpitefully handled, ſince the world was firſt haunted with
a ſpirit of unrighteouſneſſe and untruth. The paſſage of mine,
repreſented by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Prynne,</hi> as you have heard, was only this (I ſhall
go as neer the very words as my beſt memory will lead mee; but
the effect and ſubſtance of the ſaying I perfectly remember) <hi>It were
as eaſie for mee to be torn in pieces by wild horſes, as to ſubmit to any
Church-government whatſoever, which is not agreeable to the Scriptures,
and minde of Chriſt.</hi> But to deny ſubjection unto a Government
which ſhould <hi>proceed from a Parliament, becauſe choſen by the Riffe-raffe
of the world</hi> (which terms I mean <hi>the Riffe-raffe of the world,</hi> are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitious
too, and none of mine) was ſo far from my thoughts
in that Sermon, that I expreſly declared, and ſaid (as ſeverall of
thoſe that were examined about the Sermon before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
there teſtified, and I nothing doubt, but to this day, do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
remember the ſaying) that <hi>as a Church-government was not
therefore to be received or ſubmitted unto, becauſe it is injoyn'd by men;
ſo neither is it therefore to be rejected, becauſe it is commanded by men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. He cites the fore-mentioned Sermons (called <hi>Theomachia</hi>) as
holding forth this aſſertion,<note place="margin">Sect. 6.</note> 
               <hi>p. 48, 49, 50. that perchance all, or the
greateſt part of the Parliament and Aſſembly are not indued with the
ſanctifying Spirit of God,</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Pag. 156.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If there be ſo much as the leaſt hint
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111442:7"/>
or inſinuation of any ſuch matter in any, in all of thoſe <hi>pages,</hi> I
ſhall miſtruſt either my eyes, or my <hi>ſenſus communis</hi> for ever. But if
it be otherwiſe, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynnes</hi> tongue and pen (as well they deſerve)
are like to beare the burthen of this my diffidence.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Hee cites the prementioned,</hi> Theomachia, <hi>with my</hi> two books
ſince, <hi>for</hi> crying up the Independent Way, as the very Government, Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
Kingdome and Ordinance and Chriſt himſelf,<note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 134.</note> &amp;c. <hi>whereas,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, ſince the coming out of my <hi>Theomachia,</hi> I had put forth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one book (and that a very ſmall one too, and which the violent
and mercileſſe proceedings of himſelf againſt mee, extorted from
me,) when this was affirmed and printed by him.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, there is no ſuch <hi>cry,</hi> as that w<hi rend="sup">c</hi>h his fancie is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with, to be heard throughout either the one of thoſe books,
or the other. So that here is a double notorious untruth in this quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
1. <hi>that I had ſet forth two books, ſince my Theomachia: 2. that
in theſe two, as alſo in my Theomachia, I cryed up the Independent Way,
as the very Government, Diſcipline, Kingdome and Ordinance of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Whereas hee avers,<note place="margin">Sect. 7.</note> that <hi>pending the complaint againſt me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Committee for plundered Miniſters, for ſome Antiparliamentary
paſſages</hi> (ſo called by him) <hi>with other particulars, I juſtified the ſaid
paſſages again very unſeaſonably in the Pulpit on a ſolemn firſt day, and
likewiſe in two printed books, to the one whereof I prefixed my name</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 106.</note>; the
truth is, firſt, that (if my memory ſerves me not as ill as Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi>
confidence ſerveth him) I never <hi>juſtified,</hi> nor medled with thoſe <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages</hi>
he ſpeaks of <hi>in the Pulpit,</hi> either <hi>on any ſolemn faſt day,</hi> or any
other, within that compaſſe he ſpeaks of: nor ſecondly, had I ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
them in two books, when M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Pryns</hi> pen avouched it, though
by this time it may be interpreted that I have; nor thirdly, have I
put forth any book ſince, to which I have <hi>not prefixed my name;</hi> or
at leaſt ſuffixed it to an Epiſtle, if not at large, yet by the initiall
letters of it. Therefore if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Pryn</hi> implies, that I have publiſhed any
book within the time hee ſpeaks of, which I do not publikely own,
he is implicated with a further untruth in ſuch his implication.</p>
            <p>7. Whereas he affirms (with no want of confidence) <hi>that hee
hath elſewhere anſwered, and fully refuted</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Pag. 106.</note> 
               <hi>the paſſagers aforeſaid;</hi> what
truth there is in this affirmation, let my laſt Diſcourſe<note n="d" place="margin">Innocency and Truth tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note> teſtifie.
He hath anſwered thoſe paſſages of mine he ſpeaks of, much in
ſuch a ſenſe, and after ſuch a manner, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Walker</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burrough,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:111442:8"/>
have anſwered my <hi>Socinian</hi> errors: which <hi>Anſwers</hi> hee
adviſeth his Reader to ſee (<hi>p.</hi> 109. in the margent) but tells him
not where they are to be <hi>ſeen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. Whereas he chargeth me in my <hi>Innocencies Triumph</hi> (quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with the very title,<note place="margin">Sect. 8.</note> as if it were unfit, and he unwilling that
<hi>Innocency</hi> ſhould <hi>triumph</hi>) with <hi>denying thoſe very matters of fact which
I voluntarily confeſſed in his hearing before the Committee</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 107. paulo ante me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</note>, <hi>for which
I was ſequeſtred;</hi> the truth is, that there is no truth at all in this
his allegation or charge. For, firſt, I am certain, that Jeſus Chriſt
was preſent at the Committee, as well as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynne;</hi> and certain I
am that in his hearing (which is every whit as good as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Pryns</hi>)
I confeſſed nothing there, which is denyed by me in my <hi>Innocencies
Triumph.</hi> I neither <hi>confeſſed</hi> that <hi>I neglected my pariſhioners,</hi> nor that
<hi>I ſeldome preached unto them,</hi> nor <hi>that I preſcribe a Covenant to my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
Congregation, with in ſtead of my pariſhioners I have gathered
to my ſelf, before they be admitted;</hi> nor that <hi>I receive tithes of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners</hi>
in any other way, or after any other manner, then as I
declare and expreſſe in my ſaid book. If I had <hi>confeſſed any of theſe
things, either before the Committee,</hi> or any others, I had been of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Prynnes</hi> confederacie againſt mine own innocencie, and the truth.
But what I did <hi>confeſſe before the Committee,</hi> I confeſſe as plainly in
my <hi>Innocencies Triumph;</hi> as <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, <hi>that I had refuſed to baptize ſome
children of my pariſhioners</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Innocencies Triumph. <hi>p.</hi> 18. 19.</note>. Secondly, <hi>that I had not adminiſtred the
Sacrament to my Pariſh for ſome moneths</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Ibidem.</note>. Again, ſecondly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he ſaith that <hi>I was ſequeſtred</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> by the Committee, for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
before mentioned, and <hi>denyed by mee in my Innocencies Triumph,</hi>
in this hee aſperſeth the honourable Committee every whit as
much (if not more) then mee. For (doubtleſſe) it no way ſtands
with their honour to <hi>ſequeſter</hi> a man for that which was never
done by him. Nor thirdly, do I know whether I may take Mr.
<hi>Prynnes</hi> word (it is now grown ſo unſtable) that I am <hi>ſuſpended,
cenſured,</hi> or <hi>ſequeſtred</hi> by the Committee, either for the one thing, or
the other; and beſides, a friend of mine, inquiring of ſome that are
Members of the ſaid Committee concerning that ſuſpenſion or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration
which Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> ſpeaks of, received this anſwer from
them, that they knew no ſuch thing. I ſuppoſe it is not ordinary,
that a ſentence or cenſure ſhould paſſe in a Court of Juſtice againſt
any man, and hee not to have any knowledge of it for ſeverall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:111442:8"/>
moneths together: but if it be ſo, Gods will, and Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> wiſh,
(<hi>Fiat Juſtitia</hi>) in Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> ſenſe, are fulfilled together.</p>
            <p>9. He is not aſhamed to avouch,<note place="margin">Sect. 9.</note> that <hi>I publiſh my brain-ſick jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies
and ſuſpicions of the Parliament behind their backs in open Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
and then to the whole world in print</hi> (a ſtrange miſdemeanor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and more monſtrous and incredible, then ever committed
by the <hi>VERY Pope or Turk himſelf, or the great Antichriſt, or the
Arch-Prelate, or Oxford Aulicus, or the moſt venemous Malignant,</hi> that
a man ſhould doe that <hi>behind mens back,</hi> which he doth <hi>in print to

them, as men who invaded the very incommunicable royalties and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges

               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 108. Circà medium.</note>: Whereas the God of Heaven, who knows my
<hi>purpoſe</hi> and intent in thoſe paſſages (as in all my actions beſides)
much better then Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> knows the contrary; and that my
purpoſe therein was ſingly and ſimply, and with all faithfulneſſe,
as becomes a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, to caution thoſe worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of honor and truſt, againſt that ſnare of ſinning againſt God,
into which great places of power and intereſt in the world are apt
to lead men before they are aware.</p>
            <p>10. He chargeth my <hi>late Sermons and Pamphlets to have kindled
ſuch unhappie flames of contention in our Church and State,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 10.</note> 
               <hi>as all the
teares of Repentance which I may ſhed, will not be ſufficient to quench.</hi>
For my part I know of no ſuch, I heare of no ſuch, I know no
cauſe why I ſhould imagine that any ſuch <hi>unhappie flames</hi> as he
ſpeaks of, ſhould be <hi>kindled</hi> by any of my <hi>Sermons</hi> or writings.
I have much more reaſon to conceive and think, that Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi>
writings charge mine with <hi>kindling flames of contention,</hi> much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ſame manner, and upon the ſame terms, that one charged
<hi>Eliah</hi> with being the <hi>troubler of Iſrael</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">1 King. 18. 17.</note>: and that mine may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
his, as the Prophet did that King<note n="c" place="margin">1 King. 18. 18.</note>.</p>
            <p>11. Whereas he further chargeth me,<note place="margin">Sect. 11.</note> that in my <hi>Innocencies
Triumph, I ſlander the Parliament more then before, and ſhew my ſelf a
man deſpiſing Government (at leaſt any Church-Government the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 110. Circà medium.</note>; The truth is, that there is far more <hi>ſlander</hi>
in the charge, then in the crime: the beſt is, that that book is open
before the world, to ſee and judge whether therebe, I doe not ſay
any aſperſion of <hi>ſlander,</hi> but ſo much as the leaſt touch or tincture
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:111442:9"/>
of any thing diſhonourable to the Parliament, or to any <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

            </p>

ſeriouſly and ſolemnly profeſſe in the preſence of this God (my conſcience
bearing me witneſs in the Holy Ghoſt that I lie not) that I did it out of a
loving, tender and affectionate jealouſie over the Parliament, leſt poſſibly
they might daſh their foote againſt that ſtone, by which all Rule and all
Authoritie and power will one day be broken in pieces. So that if either

was hurtfull to their friends, out of good affection towards them?
<hi>Seneca</hi> (I am certain) ſpeaks of ſuch. And God himſelf is ſaid to

Cannot a rationall man conceive that theſe things might proceed

<hi>If this proceeded from ſuch affectionate jealouſie over the Parliament, I

Onely this I deſire you would candidly account unto me, why you

did) by denying his Maſter, (as they had reaſon enough to have
done, in reſpect of that humane frailtie whereof the beſt men are

of his ſcruple, whether he ſhould call it <hi>malignant,</hi> or no. But <hi>jacta

thus.</p>
            <p>Did the Parliament ever give you the leaſt colour or occaſion of ſuch
uncharitable,<note place="margin">Sect. 16.</note> unchriſtian, that I ſay not deteſtable, jealouſie? Could you
have harder or more jealous thoughts then theſe of the very Pope or Turk
himſelf, or of that Great Antichriſt, who exalts himſelf above all that is
called God? Can ſuch jealouſies as theſe iſſue from any, but from a ranco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
or diſ-affected heart towards the Parliament? or did ever ſuch exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
jealouſies as theſe proceed from the heart, tongue, much leſſe the pen
of any Oxford Aulicus, or moſt venomous Malignant to our Parliament?
<hi>The ſtraine of eloquence in theſe paſſages, may be thought above
the line of Mr.</hi> Prynnes <hi>Rhetorique;</hi> nor can I beleeve but that he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:111442:11"/>
had ſome ſupernaturall aſſiſtance in the raiſing and compoſure of
them. And therefore whereas others (it's like) will be apt to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
him more for a few ſuch lines as theſe, then for many others
of a ſofter temper, and more plauſible allay; I on the contrary,
can better beare with him in theſe, and be content to paſſe by and
ſpare him, as our Saviour ſpared <hi>Peter,</hi> when he rebuked Satan in
his ſtead<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 16. 23.</note>. But did I know that Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> would not accept of
this purgation, but when recovered out of that Tartarean Ecſtaſie,
wherein he ſpake this dialect of Dragons, would ſtill ſtand by and
owne thoſe ebullitions of bloud, as the naturall and genuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
and fruit of his pen; I ſhould hardly refraine from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a ſolemne vow and proteſtation upon me in the ſight of God,
Angels, and men, never more to have to doe with him in word or
deed, at leaſt untill he repented, and turn'd Chriſtian. Well might
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> pray to be <hi>delivered from unreaſonable men</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">2 Theſ. 3. 2.</note>: They
that neither make uſe of their <hi>reaſon</hi> nor goodneſſe, (or charitie)

whole world in print, of purpoſe to make your Auditors, Readers, jealous of
them, as thoſe who invaded the incommunicable Royalties and Priviledges
of Heaven, &amp;c. —or to defame or draw an odium or contempt upon them,
and prepare the people beforehand to oppoſe or reject whatſoever Church-government

            <p>I anſwer, firſt, that howſoever by reaſon of my yeeres, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:111442:12"/>
thoſe to whom I preach'd, and the generalitie of men to whom
I printed, not the Parliament. That it is a terrible and moſt
dreadfull thing for men <hi>to be found fighters againſt God,</hi> that it
is better and more righteous to obey God then men; that men

few particulars more of like conſideration (which are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

are Doctrines of equall (if not of ſuperiour) concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the generalitie of the people, with the Parliament. As
for that paſſage in my <hi>Innocencies Triumph,</hi> wherein I mention my

ſo tenter'd, tortur'd and tormented by the evill ſpirit which ſo

by his own moſt unreaſonable, bloody, and importune
ſuggeſtions, clamours and inſtigations of authoritie againſt mee:
in regard of which I had no other courſe but to give a faire

whiſper thoſe things in the eares only of a few, the knowledge
whereof concernes ſo many thouſands, is not <hi>the duty,</hi> but an high
prevarication of the <hi>duty</hi> of a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt. Secondly,
neither doth he know whether the Doctrines ſo much queſtioned
and quarrelled by him, did, or do ſo particularly concern <hi>my
friends</hi> in Parliament (by <hi>my friends,</hi> I ſuppoſe hee means my
acquaintance: for otherwiſe I truſt the whole number of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Aſſembly are <hi>my friends;</hi> at leaſt I know no cauſe but
why they ſhould) as many other members of this Aſſembly. If ſo,
his ignorance in ſuch a circumſtance as this, plainly proves that he
hath here <hi>propheſied</hi> above <hi>the analogie or proportion of</hi> his <hi>Faith</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 12.</note>;
and conſequently, (even in his own notion of the word<note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 109. paulò ante me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</note>) hath
done it <hi>PRESVMPTVOVSLY.</hi> Yea, thirdly, how doth
he know but that I did prevent the admonition or reproof of his
pen, by doing the very <hi>duty,</hi> for the neglect whereof I am ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cenſured by him. I preſume that my acquaintance <hi>in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
have not communicated unto him all things that have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
between me and them; therefore his ignorance in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:111442:13"/>
alſo, proves him (according to the reſponſall of his own
Oracle, even now intimated) to have been ſomewhat <hi>PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVMPTVOVS</hi>
in his charge of neglect of <hi>Duty</hi> in mee.
Fourthly, and laſtly, there being nothing in the particulars ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
againſt, either <hi>preached or printed</hi> by mee, which in the
judgement of any indifferent or Chriſtian-ſpirited man, is of any
hard or diſparaging reflexion either upon any particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in the honourable Aſſembly of Parliament, or upon this
Aſſembly it ſelf, there could be nothing in the publiſhing of them,
whether by <hi>preaching</hi> or <hi>printing,</hi> any wayes repugnant to any <hi>duty</hi>
lying upon me.</p>
            <p>That which followes in the late tranſcribed paſſage,<note place="margin">Sect. 22.</note> as that
<hi>I publiſh my brain-ſick jealouſies and ſuſpicions againſt them behind
their backs, of purpoſe to make my Auditors, Readers jealous of them,
as men who invaded,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or to defame or draw an odium or contempt
upon them, to prepare the people before-hand to oppoſe or reject, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
&amp;c.</hi> theſe things (I ſay) with many others of like calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
both in this and many other of his writings, are but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonleſſe
<hi>preſumptions</hi> of his exaſperated, tranſported, unchriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
ſpirit, over-heat (it may be) with his <hi>nocturnall lucubrations,</hi>
and in part occaſioned by the fuliginous vapors breathing ſtill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him from his lamp; and in this regard, I judge them unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to have <hi>day-light</hi> beſtowed upon them for their refutation.
Hee talks of my <hi>brain-ſick jealouſies and ſuſpicions;</hi> but theſe are
more then <hi>brain-ſick,</hi> even <hi>brain-dead</hi> calumniations and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
ten degrees (to ſpeak in his own language) more <hi>unchriſtian,
uncharitable, deteſtable, execrable,</hi> then any (even the worſt of) <hi>jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies</hi>
or ſuſpicions whatſoever. If he would but authorize mee to
reaſon after the rate of his Logique in raiſing concluſions from his
premiſſes, I could prove (according to the tenor of ſuch authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie)
that Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> hath written againſt the Congregationall
Way, hath repreſented thoſe that walk in it as <hi>extremely deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory

               <note n="a" place="margin">Epiſt. Dedic. non longè ab mitio.</note>, <hi>as great diſturbers of our publique peace and unity</hi>

               <note n="b" place="margin">Ibidem.</note>, that <hi>it may paſſe as tolerable, that Chriſt is King

of like undue inſinuation; I could prove (I ſay) by the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
aforeſaid, that Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> hath done all theſe things <hi>on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to deſpite the Spirit of God,</hi> to defame the Goſpel, to make
the Wayes of godlineſſe and Religion hatefull unto the world, to
increaſe diviſions, to multiply diſtractions, to bring a ſnare and
evill day upon the Parliament, to expoſe the whole Kingdome
to utter ruine and deſtruction. Yea, the truth is, that there is a far
more rationall connexion between the premiſes laſt mentioned
from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. P<hi>ryn's</hi> pen, and ſuch collections and concluſions as theſe;
then there is between thoſe premiſes of mine tranſcribed by him,
and the inferences which he extracts and deduceth from them.</p>
            <p>A man might think that the Gentleman had by this time laid
out himſelf to a ſufficient proportion, in depraving both the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
and intentions of him, that never (to his beſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
did him the leaſt wrong, nor ever adminiſtred the leaſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of provocation; —<hi>Sed audi facinus majoris abollae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your laſt clauſe (<hi>ſaith he, yet further,</hi> p. 108.) And if continued, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
intimates and ſpeaks, aloud without any ſtraining that the Parliament
for the preſent are guilty of daſhing their foot againſt Chriſt the Rock:
of claiming the moſt ſacred incommunicable royalties and priviledges of
heaven, and making themſelves equall with God: and that if they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere
in the courſe they have begun (to Reforme our Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) it is
ſuch an high provocation againſt the moſt High, as will kindle a fire in
the breſt of him whoſe name is Jehovah; <hi>he ſhould have ſaid</hi> jealous,
(<hi>but that his pen hath contracted an ill habit of ſtumbling</hi>) which
will conſume and devoure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Could all the malignant and Prelaticall
party in England lay a greater, wickeder, or more unjuſt ſcandall in our
Parliament then this, or more defame them then by ſuch a falſe report?
enough to fire the whole Kingdome againſt them, as well as Gods
wrath, <hi>&amp;c. as it followeth in his moſt unjuſt and ignoble ſtrain of</hi>
Calumny. <hi>But for anſwer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Doth a <hi>wicked</hi> or <hi>unjuſt ſcandall</hi> uſe <hi>to fire Gods wrath againſt</hi>
thoſe upon whom it is caſt, and who are the ſufferers. Though
the ſin committed be <hi>enough to kindle a fire in the breſt of him whoſe
name is jealous,</hi> againſt thoſe, whoſoever they be, that lie under the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:111442:14"/>
guilt of ſuch a Commiſſion; yet is there not the leaſt colour to
imagine, that the falſe or ſcandalous imputation of it unto any,
ſhould have the like operation, in reſpect of thoſe that are ſo
ſcandaliz'd.</p>
            <p>He tells me of my <hi>being a meer Divine,</hi> p. 109. <hi>and a man altogether
ignorant in the ancient Rights and Privileges of our Parliament,</hi> (with
how little pertinencie or advantage to his cauſe, ſhall be taken into
conſideration in due place.) And by ſuch paſſages as this, it ſeems
he is every whit as <hi>meer a Lawyer</hi> as I a <hi>Divine</hi> (and conſequently of
no ſuch ſuper-tranſcendent abilities neither, to diſcerne and judge
of the <hi>Rights and Privileges of Parliament,</hi> as will be manifeſted in
due time.) For he that knowes not, that God is no wayes offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with men for having <hi>wicked &amp; unjuſt ſcandals</hi> caſt upon them,
ſurely had <hi>need to be taught what are the firſt principles of the Oracles
of God</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 5. 12.</note>. And</p>
            <p>2. Whereas in the beginning of the laſt tranſcribed paſſage, he
ſpeakes thus, <hi>Your laſt clauſe, And if continued, &amp;c. intimates and
ſpeakes loud without any ſtrayning, that, &amp;c.</hi> doth hee not ſeem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
as if now he had met with a full feaſt, and had onely ſcram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for all he had gotten and ſatisfied his hunger with till now?
And doth he not without any <hi>ſtrayning,</hi> ſeem to imply, that all my
former <hi>clauſes without ſtraining,</hi> would have ſpake none of thoſe
things, which now by his rackes, ſcrews, and engines, he hath made
them to ſpeak? So that here we have <hi>confitentem rerum:</hi> oh that we
had but the Participle as well match'd as the Adjective, that is (by
interpretation) <hi>emendantem confitentem,</hi> and then let both our
<hi>bookes to the fire</hi> together, <hi>to purge out the droſſe of them</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">What ever cenſure you deſerve, I fear your book de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits the fire to purge out this droſs. p. 109.</note>. But</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The grand unhappineſſe of the man is, that what I ſpeake
onely in</hi> theſi, <hi>or in the generall throughout the whole period or
paſſage, wherein this clauſe,</hi> And if contemned, &amp;c. <hi>ſtands, hee here
repreſents upon the Stage of his paſſion, as if it had been ſpoken</hi>
in hypotheſi, <hi>with particular and preciſe application to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The whole period, though it be ſomewhat long, yet that the
Reader may not be denied any part of his due in point of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
I ſhall tranſcribe,</hi> ab ovo uſque ad mala, <hi>as it begins at the
bottome of page</hi> 2. <hi>of my</hi> Innocencies Triumph. I confeſſe I am in the
habituall and ſtanding frame of my heart and ſpirit, tender and jealous
over all the world, and much more over thoſe who are deare unto me, but
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:111442:14"/>
moſt of all over thoſe who being deere unto me, are likewiſe more expoſed
then others unto the tentation and danger of the ſinne; extreamly jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and tender (I ſay) I am over ſuch, leſt they ſhould touch with any
title, or claim the moſt ſacred and incommunicable royalties and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
of heaven, and ſo count it no robbery to make themſelves equall
to God; knowing moſt aſſuredly, that this is a high provocation in the
eyes of the moſt High, and if continued in, will kindle a fire in the breaſt of
him whoſe name is Jealous, and will conſume and devoure.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe I ſpake in ſome paſſages before this, of the Parliament
by name; nor doe I deny all relation between this and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
but all the relation that can reaſonably be imagined between
the one and the other, will not amount ſo much as to a colourable
juſtification of this high-handed and full-mouth'd charge, that the
latter <hi>ſpeaks aloud without any ſtrayning, that the Parliament is guilty
of daſhing, &amp;c. of claiming, &amp;c. And that if, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe are every
whit as pure and clean ſtraines of that diſpoſition which acted in
the former part of this expoſition, as any of thoſe other which
have playd before us already. And</p>
            <p>4. Suppoſe the period had been perfectly Hypotheticall, and
the contents of it applied to the Parliament by name, yet it is farre
from ſpeaking the dialect that Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> would fain force into
the mouth of it. He that ſhall repreſent the great evill or danger
of a ſinne, as ſuppoſe of oppreſſion, drunkenneſſe, adultery, or the
like, unto a man, in theſe or the like terms, <hi>Know moſt aſsuredly,
that ſuch a ſinne is a moſt high provocation in the eyes of the moſt High:</hi>
and then ſhould adde, <hi>And if continued in, will kindle a fire in the
breaſt of him whoſe name is Jealous, &amp;c.</hi> doth no wayes ſuppoſe, that
the perſon to whom ſuch an addreſſe or repreſentation is made, is
under the preſent actuall guilt of the perpetration of ſuch a ſinne;
but onely demonſtrates the dangerous and deadly conſequence
of it unto him, in caſe he ſhall be intangled with the guilt, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue</hi>
in the perpetration of it without repentance. Therefore Mr.
<hi>Prynnes lucubration and collection,</hi> that this clauſe, <hi>And if continued,
&amp;c. ſpeaks aloud without any ſtrayning,</hi> any ſuch <hi>Parliamentary guilt</hi>
as he deciphers with his pen, is <hi>nocturnall,</hi> neither is there ſo much
as a beam of the <hi>light</hi> of truth in it.</p>
            <p>5. Whereas he chargeth that innocently-offending <hi>clauſe</hi> of
mine, <hi>And if continued, &amp;c.</hi> both <hi>to intimate and ſpeak aloud,</hi> and that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:111442:15"/>
               <hi>without any ſtraining,</hi> that high miſdemeanour lately mentioned,
(little leſſe then capitall to him that ſhall avouch it) I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any regular conſiſtence in the charge. For though one and
the ſame man, who hath a liberty and power both to alter his
tone and voyce, and tenour of expreſſion, may one while only <hi>inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi>
i. whiſper, or expreſſe a thing ſparingly: and otherwhile, <hi>ſpeake</hi>
it out <hi>aloud,</hi> with a full and ſtrong voyce, (though hardly thus <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ſtraining</hi> at all) yet how one and the ſame <hi>clauſe</hi> in writing,
which hath neither principle nor ſhadow of any variation or
change of expreſſion in it, but is ſtill uniforme and ſtanding both
in the matter <hi>which,</hi> and in the manner <hi>wherein,</hi> it ſpeaketh, ſhould
both <hi>intimate</hi> (or whiſper) and yet <hi>ſpeak aloud</hi> too, one and the
ſame thing, is a ſaying divided in it ſelfe, and which my underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
knoweth not how to make to ſtand. But thus, God many
times makes both tongues and pens which imagine evill againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

            <p>6. And laſtly, whereas he pretends the forementioned clauſe,
<hi>And if continued, &amp;c.</hi> guilty of <hi>ſpeaking aloud and without any ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
the prenamed enormitie, the truth is, that this charge <hi>ſpeaks
aloud and without any ſtraining,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Prynne loves all devouring
words</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 52. 4.</note>, whether they be words of <hi>ſoberneſſe and truth</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Act.</note>, or of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inſpiration. Is it not very ſtrange, and a miracles fellow (at

in the world, that he alone ſhould heare a <hi>loud ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eaking,</hi>
where all the world beſides could not heare the leaſt muttering or

in hand, I ſhall briefly ſpecifie, both what, in what degree I have
done, and continue yet doing from opportunitie to opportunitie,
to the utmoſt of my power, for the Parliament: and withall ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
profeſſe in the ſight of God and men, that if either Mr.
<hi>Prynne,</hi> or any other man, can direct or ſay unto me, how, or what,
when, or wherein I may yet doe more for them, or ſhew and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
more love or affectionateneſſe unto them, then I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
done, and ſtill doe (upon occaſion) daily; provided onely that
I may ſee and underſtand, that what ſhall be required of me in this
kind, doth really and indeed, not in ſhew and pretence onely, tend
to the benefit, honour and ſafetie of the Parliament; I am ready
and willing, and doe by theſe preſents obliege and bind my ſelf,
<hi>Teſtibus Coelo &amp; Terrâ,</hi> to performe. I have once<note n="b" place="margin">See my <hi>Anti-Cavalieriſme.</hi>

Print, with the utmoſt ingagement of my weak abilities in that
kind, aſſerted the Parliamentary cauſe againſt the Oxfordian; yea
(as far as I yet underſtand) I was the firſt amongſt all my Brethren
who ſerve at the Altar, that roſe up in this kind, for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
with what expoſall of my ſelf to danger, on the one hand,
and with what ſucceſſe and advantage to the cauſe undertaken
by me on the other, many there are that know, and (I make no
queſtion) are ready upon occaſion to declare and teſtifie. How
frequently, yea for many moneths together, when the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie
occaſions were moſt urging and preſſing, (almoſt) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interruptedly,
and with what fervency and conteſtation of ſpirit,
I laboured by preaching to advance the ſervice; yea with what ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critie
and importunity, I continually ſollicited and promoted all
Parliamentarie occaſions, ſuits, and motions recommended by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
or otherwiſe; was openly teſtified by a Member of that
Honourable Committee before which I was called, <hi>pending</hi> the
complaint againſt me there. How many young men and others,
as faithfull as uſefull in the Armie as any others of their rank and
imployment whatſoever, what by preaching, what by conference
and perſwaſion, were through the bleſſing of God, armed with
courage and reſolution by me for the warres, there are both in the
Citie, and in the Armie, more then a few that can informe. Nor
is it unknowne to thouſands, with what contention and ſtriving
of ſpirit, with what earneſtneſſe of prayer and ſupplication I have
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:111442:16"/>
without ceaſing in my publick prayers, commended the Parliament
with all their proceedings and affaires unto God; nor have my
later interceſſions for them, either in ſtrength of affection, or in
any other deſireable reſpect whatſoever, given place unto my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
Without any diſparagement to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynnes Oriſons</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Epiſt. Dedic. <hi>in ſine.</hi>

to be as <hi>fervent</hi> in <hi>commending</hi> that <hi>Honourable Aſſembly with all their

pecuniary expreſſions of my ſelf to and for the Parliament, my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
may (perhaps) ſuffer loſſe and diſadvantage in the thoughts
of ſome, who meaſure by the Arithmeticall, in ſtead of the Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall
proportion (by which our Saviour meaſured the poore wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
gift, caſt into the treaſury<note n="b" place="margin">Mar. 12. 43.</note>, and every mans expreſſions of
himſelf in this kind ſhould be meaſured) yet I make no queſtion
but I can produce ſpeaking papers, (yea and men too, if need be)
that will abundantly teſtifie, that I have not been behind many of
thoſe who are before me for matter of eſtate, and who are look'd
upon too as men ſound-hearted to the Parliament. There hath no
propoſition for advance of moneys, been at any time recommended
by the Parliament unto the Citie, that I know of, but hath been
entertained by me with a full proportion of my eſtate. And look
what I have been, and have appeared to be in publick, and in view
of many; the ſame have I bin alſo in all my more private intercour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and colloques with men; ſtrengthning the hands of ſome which
began to be feeble and to hang downe, looſing the bands, reſolving
the doubts of others, ſo ſetting them at libertie to ſerve the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who before were bound up, and could doe nothing. Nor
have I quitted my ſelf at this rate in the Parliamentary ſervice, in
or about the Citie onely: but have been as diligent and faithfull an
Agent for them in the Countrey alſo where I have become, and
that not without ſome conſiderable ſucceſſe. <hi>I am a foole</hi> (I confeſſe)
to ſpeak all this of my ſelf: but M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynne</hi> hath <hi>compelled</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 11.</note> me. If I be
yet defective and wanting in any thing that is my dutie to doe for
the Parliament, if there be any other ſervice or labour of love
wherein I may yet further expreſſe my ſelf to, and for them; all
the powers of my ſoule ſtand ready bent and preſt within me to
embrace the opportunitie, and to fall on upon the work. If for all
this I muſt be numbred amongſt men of <hi>rancorous and diſaffected
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:111442:16"/>
hearts</hi> againſt the Parliament, I ſhall congratulate the felicitie of
thoſe that are better thought of; and yet ſhall think mine own the
more Princely portion<note n="a" place="margin">Reglum eſt malè audire, cum bene fece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</note>. <hi>Mala opinio benè parta delectat.</hi> A good
conſcience is never at the full of her ſweetneſſe, light, and glorie,
but when uprightneſſe ſuffers and is eclipſed: the antiperiſtaſis of
outward ſufferings, intends the inward vigor and ſtrength of that
principle, out of which a good conſcience acteth, when ſhee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth.
If the affections of men to the Parliament, muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
to hold up their hand and be tryed at M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynnes</hi> barre,
and the Law ruling there be this, that whoſoever will not adore
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Prynnes</hi> notion of an Eccleſiaſticall Juriſdiction in the civill
Magiſtrate, and ſubmit the cleare and lightſome deciſions (at leaſt
in the eye of their judgement &amp; conſcience) of the Oracles of God
to the Spirit that ſpake in old Stories, Statutes and Records <hi>in the
darkeſt times of Popery,</hi> though they have given never ſo ſatisfactory
and abundant an account of the goodneſſe of their affection in this
kind otherwiſe, muſt be condemned and caſt as <hi>venemous Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
and underminers of the undoubted priviledges of Parliaments, &amp;c.</hi>
I confeſſe, that my affection will not abide the tryall of this fire.
Nevertheleſſe, this I ſolemnly promiſe and profeſſe, that if Mr.
<hi>Prynne</hi> or any other, ſhall reaſonably demonſtrate unto me truth
in either of theſe Poſitions; either 1. in this, that any thing is to be
eſteemed a Priviledge, which is not for the benefit, good, or ſafety
of thoſe that ſhall injoy it; or 2. in this, that ſuch an Eccleſiaſticall
Juriſdiction or power, as Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> in all or moſt of his diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
upon this ſubject portraictures and ſets out, tends in the nature
and conſtitution of it, to the benefit, ſafety or good of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
I ſhall ſoone be his convert, and cauſe my preſent appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
in the point to bowe downe at the feet of his. This for
the ſecond head propounded.</p>
            <p>For the third and laſt, the inſufficiencie, or (to ſpeak the dialect
of his own pen) the <hi>impotencie,</hi> of thoſe few exceptions which he
makes againſt ſome few particulars in my <hi>Innocencies Triumph,</hi> ſuch
as he conceives (it ſeems) to be more ſoft and tractable under his
exceptious pen. Firſt, to ſalve a ſore that will never be perfectly
healed, to juſtifie (I meane) his Indictment againſt me, that I did
not only or ſimply <hi>undermine the undoubted priviledges of Parliament
by the very roots,</hi> (this being not a charge, as it ſeems, worthy the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:111442:17"/>
indignation or diſcontent of Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> pen) but that I perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this high miſdemeanour <hi>PRESVMPTVOVSLY;</hi> he informes
us as matter of high concernment to his cauſe and honour, that
<hi>Grammarians, Lawyers, and Divines informe us, that the word,</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous,
<hi>comes from the verb,</hi> Praeſumo: which <hi>verb</hi> he <hi>preſumes</hi>
will accommodate him with one or other of thoſe various ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
which with great care and circumſpection that none be
wanting, he there muſters and enumerates. And becauſe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and validitie of this his purgation reſts altogether upon ſuch
ſignifications or acceptions of his <hi>verb,</hi> as are moſt mens myſteries;
therefore in his margent he calls in <hi>Thomas Aquinas, Calepine,</hi> with
ſome others, for his compurgators. But</p>
            <p>Good Sir; did you either expect or intend, that either the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
or your other readers, ſhould be ſo above meaſure tender
either of your reputation or of mine, as that meeting with the word
<hi>PRESVMPTVOVSLY</hi> in your indictment againſt me, they would
goe and ſearch <hi>Calepine, Thomas Aquinas, Holy-oake, Media-villa,</hi>
and I know not how many more, to informe themſelves in how
many ſenſes or ſignifications the word might be taken, leſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
they ſhould take you tardy with an unjuſt crimination, or me
with a foule crime? What you may conceive them likely to doe in
this kind out of tenderneſſe of reſpect to your reputation, I will
not prejudge: but to deale plainly with you, I expect no ſuch quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from any of your Readers, for the preſervation of mine. They
that have a mind to beleeve you in that point of your charge, (yea
and indeed any other, conſidering other expreſſions of yours of
the like importance) are like to take the word <hi>Preſumptuouſly,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the vulgar and moſt familiar ſignification of it <hi>in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
parlance,</hi> and that which is next at hand: in which ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it doth nothing leſſe then import all that varietie you ſpeak of,
but a <hi>plaine wilfull</hi> (as your word elſewhere is) <hi>perpetration of an
evill;</hi> and as for the three laſt ſignifications which you faſten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, as that it ſignifies, <hi>againſt Authoritie, or Lawes, or upon hopes
of impunitie;</hi> though I have not the Authors by me upon whom
you father the <hi>proprietie</hi> of theſe ſignifications, to examine the truth
of what in this you affirme; yet am I very ſtrong of Faith, that men
of learning and judgement (as moſt of the Authors you cite were)
never aſſigned any of theſe three ſenſes or importances, as the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:111442:17"/>
and legitimate acceptions or ſignifications of the word. When
<hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> told <hi>Herod</hi> (a man in great <hi>Authoritie</hi>) to his face,
that <hi>it was not lawfull for him to have Herodias his Brother Philips
wife</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 14. 4.</note>, was this done <hi>PRESVMPTVOVSLY,</hi> eſpecially in the
<hi>proper</hi> ſignification of the word? Againe, when <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach</hi>
and <hi>Abednego</hi> refus'd to ſubmit to that <hi>Decree</hi> or Law which <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar
and his Nobles</hi> had made, which commanded <hi>all to fall
downe and worſhip the golden image which the King had ſet up</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Dan. 3. 18.</note>; and
ſo when <hi>Daniel</hi> trangreſs'd that Law or Statute which <hi>Darius and
his Nobles</hi> had <hi>decreed and eſtabliſhed according to the Law of the
Medes and Perſians, which altereth not</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Dan. 6. 8. 10.</note>, by <hi>kneeling upon his knees
three times a day, praying unto, and praiſing God, with his chamber-window
open towards Jeruſalem;</hi> did either of theſe ſin, or doe any
thing (under the Interpretation aforeſaid) <hi>PRESVMPTVOVSLY?</hi>
Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> himſelf (I preſume) dedicated theſe his <hi>Lucubrations</hi> to
the Parliament, <hi>upon hopes,</hi> yea <hi>upon</hi> more <hi>then hopes of impunitie,</hi>
upon hopes of Grace and Acceptation: hath he therefore done
<hi>PRESVMPTVOVSLY?</hi> I am content in this ſenſe to own the
word <hi>PRESVMPTVOVSLY,</hi> in my prementioned charge; and
confeſſe that I did that, which he (calling it quite out of its name)
calls <hi>an undermining of the undoubted Priviledges of Parliament, &amp;c.
PRESVMPTVOVSLY. i.</hi> I did <hi>upon hopes,</hi> yea and ſomewhat more
<hi>then upon hopes of impunitie,</hi> upon hopes of acceptation both with
God and men. And if Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> would have pleas'd but to have
declar'd in his margent or otherwiſe, that in the aforeſaid indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he meant the word, <hi>PRESVMPTVOVSLY,</hi> in this ſenſe,
and no other; he had ſaved me a double, and himſelf a ſingle la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
(if not a double alſo) for I ſhould not have lift up ſo much
as a word of exception againſt it.</p>
            <p>But let us ſee a little, how like a man he quits himſelf in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
the truth and equitie of his ſo-dearly-beloved terme, <hi>PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVMPTVOVSLY,</hi>
as it ſtands, or lies, (which you will) in the
controverted indictment. His firſt ſignification of the <hi>verb PRAE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVMO,</hi>
is <hi>to foreſtall;</hi> and to prove that in this ſenſe of the word,
I committed the capitall crime objected <hi>PRESVMPTVOVSLY,</hi>
he reaſons, or rather talks, thus. <hi>Firſt you preached and printed thoſe
paſſages of purpoſe to foreſtall the Parliaments and Aſſemblies pious reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
&amp;c.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> there is a rule in the civill Law (and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:111442:18"/>
becauſe there is ſo much reaſon in it, I conceive your Common
Law complyes with it) which ſounds thus; <hi>Non eſſe, &amp; non appae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere,
aequiparantur in Jure.</hi> How will you doe for witneſſe, or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
competent in Law, to make it appeare that <hi>I printed and
preached the paſſages</hi> you ſpeak of, for ſuch a <hi>purpoſe</hi> as you pretend?
can you find the preſent thoughts or <hi>purpoſes</hi> of all particular men
in this age, in the ancient Records which beare date, from <hi>the
darkest times of Popery?</hi> Or hath the Omniſcient <hi>anointed</hi> your eyes
with any ſuch eye-ſalve, which makes you able to ſee into the
hearts and reins and ſpirits of men? or have I acknowledged either
in writing or otherwiſe, any ſuch intent or <hi>purpoſe</hi> as you ſpeak of,
in thoſe <hi>paſſages?</hi> or is it beyond the upper region of poſſibilities,
that I ſhould have any other <hi>purpoſe</hi> in them, then what you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme?
When you print, that <hi>I printed the paſſages</hi> you mention <hi>of
purpoſe to foreſtall the pious reſolutions of the Parliament;</hi> doe you
print this <hi>OF PVRPOSE to foreſtall the pious</hi> inclinations <hi>or reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of the Parliament, not to make more offenders by puniſhment,
then were made ſuch before by delinquencie? Or when you <hi>print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
that <hi>Chriſt hath delegated his Kingly Office unto Kings, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,

            <p>The ſecond ſignification of the auxiliarie verb, <hi>PRAESVMO,</hi> is
(as Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> from his Authors, or otherwiſe, informs us) <hi>to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
before-hand:</hi> and to prove that in this ſenſe I treſpaſſed the treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
of his complaint, <hi>PRESVMPTVOVSLY,</hi> he advanceth with
this demonſtration. 2. <hi>To eſtabliſh and ſupport that Independent way
which you had before-hand without any lawfull warrant conceived, ere
the Parliament had made choyce of, or ſetled any Church-Government for
them, &amp;c.</hi> But good Sir, hath no man a lawfull warrant to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
inquire after, (and conſequently, <hi>to conceive</hi>) what Chriſt hath
eſtabliſhed in point of Church-Government, untill <hi>the Parliament
hath made choyce of, or ſetled</hi> ſuch <hi>a Government?</hi> Every man hath
<hi>warrant enough,</hi> yea and that which is more then a <hi>warrant,</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
by way of dutie lying upon him; eſpecially <hi>Divines</hi> (as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:111442:18"/>
you call them) whoſe particular calling and profeſſion it is to
ſearch the Scriptures, and to diſcover the mind of Chriſt there,
<hi>to conceive before-hand,</hi> if they be able, what tenour or forme of
Church-Government is moſt agreeable to the mind of Chriſt; and
not to ſuſpend their ſtudies, inquiries, <hi>conceptions</hi> in that kinde, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
men have fram'd their conceptions or apprehenſions for them.
The Parliament had <hi>not made choyce of,</hi> nor <hi>ſetled</hi> any <hi>Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
for Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> when he compos'd and printed his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapologie?
Did he therefore <hi>PRESVMPTVOVSLY,</hi> to <hi>conceive it
before-hand,</hi> and ſo peremptorily conclude for it as he hath done?
Whether yet they have made <hi>choyce of any,</hi> or no, I cannot ſay; I
have no demonſtrative grounds to think they have: but certain I
am that they as yet have ſetled none, and ſo are ſtill at libertie to
chooſe another, in caſe they have choſen any. Hath not Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>
then done <hi>PRESVMPTVOVSLY,</hi> to <hi>conceive a Government before-hand,</hi>
and to <hi>print</hi> for it, the Parliament as yet having <hi>choſen none,</hi>
or however, <hi>ſetled none?</hi> If Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> being a Lawyer, had <hi>a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
warrant to, conceive a Church-Government before-hand,</hi> as he hath
done, Church-matters being eccentricall to his profeſſion; much
more hath he that is a <hi>Divine,</hi> and nevertheleſſe becauſe he is <hi>a
meere</hi> one. Neither can the five <hi>Apolog.</hi> be ſaid to have done this
firſt, becauſe they rather ſhew their own practiſe and deſire libertie
therin, then peremptorily, (as ſome others) preſcribe to others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the notion of <hi>ſchiſmatiques and troublers of the publick peace,</hi> if
they be not of their minds in all things, about what they practiſe
and profeſſe, as (in their judgements) moſt agreeable to the truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A third ſignification of the</hi> verb <hi>we wot of, is according to Mr.</hi>
Prynnes <hi>Lexicographie,</hi> to uſurp or take that upon a man which belongs
not to him. <hi>And to prove that in this ſenſe alſo I am a Son of</hi> PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVMPTION
<hi>in the tranſgreſſion voted by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Prynnes <hi>pen, upon
me, he riſeth up higher then yet in this inſulting ſtraine.</hi> It was no
leſſe then high PRESVMPTION in you, being a meere Divine, and a
man altogether ignorant of, or unskilfull in the ancient Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of our Parliament (as your writings demonſtrate, and your ſelf
intimate, <hi>p.</hi> 5.) to undertake and judge of them ſo peremptorily—When
as if you had knowne any thing concerning them, you might have
learned this among other things, that Divines are no competent Judges
of Parliaments priviledges: that the Priviledges, Rights and Cujiomes
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:111442:19"/>
of our Parliaments, are onely to be judged and determined by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it ſelfe, not in or by any other inferiour Court, &amp;c. <hi>In this paſſage
there are ſome things true, and ſome things falſe; and both the
the one and the other make</hi> aloud and without ſtraining, againſt the
Author, <hi>and neither of them againſt me at all. For,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. If I be a man <hi>altogether ignorant if the ancient rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
of Parliament,</hi> how come I to be charged, as <hi>a wilfull under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner
or violator of them</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Full Reply in the very laſt clauſe.</note>? Ignorance though it bee good for little,
but to cauſe men to ſtumble and doe amiſſe; yet it is (for the moſt
part) a preſerver of men from offending <hi>wilfully,</hi> how ever it ſelfe
may be a <hi>wilfull</hi> offence. <hi>Thoſe things</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle) appeare to bee

compulſion, or out of ignorance.</hi> If I judge Mr. <hi>Prynne ignorant</hi> of that
government which the Scriptures hold forth, I cannot reaſonably
judge him a wilfull oppoſer of it.</p>
            <p>2. If <hi>the Privileges, Rights and Cuſtomes of our Parliaments, be onely to
be judged and determined by the Parliament it ſelfe, and not in or by any
other inferior Court,</hi> how comes Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> by his authority or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to <hi>judge and determine,</hi> that I have <hi>wilfully violated, preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly
undermined the undoubted privileges of Parliament, by the very
roots?</hi> Surely he hath not the power which an <hi>inferiour Court</hi> of
Judicature hath, much leſſe is he <hi>the Parliament it ſelfe:</hi> and yet he
undertakes to <hi>judge and determine,</hi> &amp; that poſitively and negatively,
(which I doe not) not onely the <hi>privileges</hi> themſelves of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but <hi>the very roots</hi> alſo of theſe <hi>privileges.</hi> If according to his
own aſſertion, he hath <hi>no power or authority to judge or determine</hi> of
the <hi>privileges</hi> we ſpeak of, why doth he judge and cenſure me as a
PRESUMPTUOUS <hi>underminer and violator of theſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges?</hi>
Can any man reaſonably paſſe a ſentence againſt another
as a delinquent in ſuch and ſuch caſes, when as the caſes themſelves
are not of his cognizance, nor lawfull for him to judge of?</p>
            <p>3. If <hi>the Privileges and Rights of our Parliament bee onely to bee
judged by the Parliament it ſelfe,</hi> upon what Chriſtian or indeed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
foundation, ſhall we a vouch the taking of the late Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Vow and Covenant, wherein with <hi>our hands lifted up to the
moſt high God</hi> (among other things) we ſweare, <hi>that wee would ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely,
really, and conſtantly, in our ſeverall vocations, endevour with
our eſtates, and lives, mutually to preſerve the Rights and Privileges of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:111442:19"/>
Parliament, &amp;c.</hi> Did we ſweare in this moſt tremend and ſolemne
manner, to preſerve thoſe things, not onely that wee know not
what they are, but which it is not lawfull for us to enquire after, at
leaſt, not to judge and ſay what they are after our moſt diligent
and faithfull enquiry after them? If before the taking of this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
I had conceived, that whatſoever Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> ſhould pleaſe to
avouch for Privilege of Parliament, I ſhould have ſtood bound by
the covenant taken, <hi>to maintain with my eſtate and life,</hi> for ſuch; I
ſhould rather have expoſed both to the mercy and equity of the
Parliament by refuſing it, then both theſe and my ſelfe beſides, to
the diſpleaſure of God, by ſuch an unchriſtian, yea unreaſonable
and unmanlike action. Beſides, Parliament privileges are either
fundamentall, generall, and common Rights of all nationall Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
or elſe peculiar to this State; and ſo alſo they are either ſuch
as are by their conſtant practice commonly declared, or elſe more
reſerved for occaſional emergencies. The two former are obvious to
judge of; and the latter alſo apprehenſible upon their diſcovery of
them, eſpecially with their grounds, elſe how could they have been
aſſiſted in the defence of them all this time?</p>
            <p>4. Whereas he vilifies, or inſults over me as being <hi>a meere Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi>
I confeſſe I have not much to except againſt the diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
yet I deſire leave to ſpeak theſe three things. 1. That if
Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> himſelfe had been <hi>a meere Divine,</hi> he had choſen the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part: and if he yet knew how to tranforme the skill which hee
hath in the Law, into a like proportion of ſound <hi>Divinity,</hi> he and
the Church ſhould gain by it; ſo great plenty is there of good
Lawyers, and ſo few faithfull labourers in Gods harveſt.</p>
            <p>2. Though I pretend to no great knowledge in any other Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but to that which is the glory of all the reſt (<hi>Divinity</hi> I mean)
no nor yet to one halfe of that knowledge in this, which my years
and opportunities, had not I been a ſonne of folly and infirmities
above many, might well have furniſhed me with; yet can I not with
truth yeeld my ſelfe ſo <hi>meerly a Divine,</hi> as not to underſtand many
Principles and Maximes of reaſon, beſides thoſe which I have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from the Scriptures; As that every whole is more then any part
of it: That no effect can poſſibly exceed the vertue or efficacy of the
totall cauſe thereof: That one part of any contradiction is verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
of every thing: That the good of many other circumſtances
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:111442:20"/>
being alike, is to be preferred before the like good of one, or of a
few: with many others of affinity with theſe. By the authority
and aid of which alone, without the concurrence or aſſiſtance of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Principle at all, proper to the Science of Divinity, I know (God
aſſiſting) I am able to make good the ground which I have choſen
to ſtand upon in the controverſies depending between Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>
and me. Yea, I ſhould injure mine own ignorance and weakneſſe,
and cenſure them too deep, if I ſhould deny but that I know ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in other Arts and Sciences alſo.</p>
            <p>3. And laſtly, if I be <hi>a meer Divine,</hi> I remember I have read ſome
ſuch obſervation as this for my comfort, that when the ſtreame of
endevours is divided, the waters of knowledge run but ſhallow in
a plurality of channels, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But</p>
            <p>5. Whereas he lifts up this Iron mace on high, and thinkes to
<hi>break all in peeces like a potters veſſell,</hi> that I have either ſaid, or ever
ſhall be able to ſay, to eſcape the puſh of his pike, PRESUMP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUOUSLY,
wherewith he makes at me in the pre-recited
charge, that <hi>Divines are no competent Judges of Parliaments privileges;</hi>
and that therefore it was <hi>no leſſe then</hi> PRESUMPTION, nay
then PRESUMPTION upon PRESUMPTION, <hi>then
high</hi> PRESUMPTION <hi>for me being a meer Divine, and a man
altogether ignorant in the ancient Rights and Privileges of our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to undertake to determine and judge of them ſo peremptorily, &amp;c.</hi> I
anſwer.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>If I had been</hi> altogether ignorant of the Rights and Privileges
of Parliament, <hi>I was not ſo capable of ingaging my ſelfe by that
ſolemne vow, which is now upon me, for the</hi> maintaining <hi>of them</hi>
ſincerely, really, conſtantly, <hi>&amp;c. For though a man may indefinitely
ſwear to maintain the juſt rights of ſuch or ſuch a Body, though
he know them not all diſtinctly, yet that he may ſweare in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it is requiſite he be not altogether ignorant of them. So that
if Mr.</hi> Prynnes <hi>doctrine in this point be true, it is more then time
for me to flie from my Covenant, as from a Serpent, and to abhorre
my ſelfe in duſt and aſhes before the preſence of God, that ever I
took it. But bleſſed be God, my</hi> ignorance of the Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
of Parliaments, <hi>is not ſuch, but that I know many of them:
Theſe by name (queſtionleſſe) are ſome of them;</hi> To bee the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Tribunall, and ſupreme Judicatory in the Kingdome: To have a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:111442:20"/>
Legiſlative power in civill affaires in reſpect of the whole Kingdome: To
have a power of diſcharging or repealing all former Lawes and Statutes

            <p>2. Whereas Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> to make light of darkneſſe, and to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the ſhame of his darling (PRESUMPTUOUSLY) with
honor, thruſts <hi>Divines</hi> out of doors, as <hi>no competent judges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
privileges,</hi> he muſt know from a <hi>meer Divine</hi> (if there be any
place left in him for an addition in that kind, and <hi>intus apparens</hi>
doth not <hi>prohibere alienum,</hi> with too ſtrong an hand) that <hi>Divines</hi> in
one reſpect, &amp; that of ſoveraigne conſideration, are <hi>Judges</hi> of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
&amp; more regular <hi>competencie</hi> of ſuch things, then Lawyers are,
(without prejudice to that profeſſion be it ſpoken) yea &amp; the <hi>meerer
Divine</hi> (in M. <hi>Pryns</hi> ſenſe) the more competent Judge in this kind, as
the meere Phyſitian a more competent Judge of medicines then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
There is a double judgement or dijudication of Parliament
Privileges: the one poſitive or <hi>affirmative,</hi> the other privative or
<hi>negative.</hi> The poſitive or affirmative judgement wee ſpeake of,
conſiſts in a faculty or ability of diſcerning what really and indeed
are the Privileges of Parliament: the judgement which <hi>I</hi> call <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,</hi>
conſiſts in the like faculty or ability of diſcerning, what are
not. For this is a moſt certain and undoubted Maxime, That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is ſinfull, or contrary to the will and word of God, can
poſſibly be a privilege of Parliament. The reaſon whereof is plain:
Nothing that in the nature and direct tendencie of it, is diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
or deſtructive to a creature, can poſſibly bee any privilege
thereof. Now whatſoever is ſinfull, and diſpleaſing unto God, is
in the nature and direct tendencie of it, diſhonourable and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to the creature, as the whole tenour of the Scriptures (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt)
yea and the impreſſions of naturall light and conſcience in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:111442:21"/>
all men, doe abundantly confirme. <hi>Ergo.</hi> So then the Scriptures
or word of God being the Standard or ſupreme Rule whereby to
judge what is ſinfull, and conſequently deſtructive to the creature,
and what not; evident it is, that they who reaſonably may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
to have the beſt knowledge and ſoundeſt underſtanding in
theſe, are the moſt competent Judges (from amongſt men) in all
caſes and queſtions, about what is ſinfull, and what not. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>meere</hi> Lawyers, or <hi>meere Divines,</hi> may with more reaſon be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
to be men of this intereſt, let either Lawyers themſelves, or
Divines, or who ever will, judge. <hi>I had not known ſinne</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 7. 7.</note>) <hi>but by the Law:</hi> He ſpeaks of the Law of God, not of any
law of men. And another Apoſtle to like purpoſe: <hi>Whoſoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
ſinne, tranſgreſſeth alſo the Law: for ſinne is the tranſgreſſion
of the Law</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 4.</note>; ſpeaking as the other did, onely of the Law of God.
Now howſoever Mr. <hi>Prynnes meer Divines</hi> cannot reaſonably bee
ſuppoſed to have ſpent ſo much of their time in traverſing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
over the ancient Records of Parliamentary tranſactions, as
Lawyers have, nor conſequently to be ſo able or ready as they, to
tell Stories in this kind, of what Parliaments formerly have done;
yet when any caſe of conſcience, or queſtion ariſeth, about ſuch
and ſuch cuſtomes or paſſages in Parliaments, (call them <hi>Rights,
Privileges,</hi> or what you will) whether they were lawfull in point of
conſcience, and juſtifiable in the ſight of God, or no, the meere
Lawyer with his bookes and records, muſt ſtand by, as having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>part nor fellowſhip</hi> in this Judicature; the <hi>meere Divine</hi> is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>competent Judge</hi> in the caſe; yea, and this is confirmed by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
themſelves, who have decreed that in ſome Courts and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
Clergy-men, as ſome call them, ſhould fit, and was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
till very lately in <hi>London</hi> it ſelfe, the Biſhop uſually and by
right ſitting at the Seſſions of life and death; yea, and in caſe of life,
if the Clergyman ſaith, <hi>Legit ut Clericus,</hi> the Law ſaves the man.
And if Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> conceives, that all cuſtomes or Preſidents of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
will make <hi>Privileges</hi> of Parliament, I conceive the preſent
Parliament will abhorre his conception; many of them being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
matter of ſorrow, ſhame and caution, not of <hi>Privilege</hi> or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
So then to deale clearly and unpartially between Lawyers
and Divines, touching their reſpective abilities and intereſts for
diſcerning and <hi>judging</hi> of the <hi>Cuſtomes, Rights and Privileges</hi> (ſo
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:111442:21"/>
called) of <hi>Parliaments;</hi> The Lawyers intereſt and facultie (if he be
a Maſter in his profeſſion) as ſuch (I mean as a <hi>meere Lawyer</hi>) is
to collect, draw together, and preſent to view, all, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Parliamentary tranſactions, paſſages, ſtatutes, cuſtomes,
preſidents, &amp;c. good and bad, one with another, without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
out of their reſpective Records: but the intereſt and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Divine</hi> (if he be a man worthy his profeſſion) is to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
this collection preſented unto him, to conſider whether there
be nothing in them contrary to the will and mind of God decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in his Word: (which contrariety diſſolves the authority and
intereſt of any <hi>Statute, Cuſtome, Preſident, whatſoever</hi>) and ſo to <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
the vile from the pretious</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Ierem. 15. 19</note>, that which hath a conſiſtence
with the word of God, from that which oppoſeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth
it. The entrie ſeries or ſtory of Parliamentary paſſages,
is like the <hi>Polypus</hi> head, wherein there are obſerved to bee

manner of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>the manner of the houſe of Ahab,</hi>
are intermixed and wrapped up together there. Now alas, with
the <hi>meere Lawyer</hi> (I ſpeak of him, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> and not as Chriſtian or
godly) all is fiſh that comes to net, <hi>all this Congregation is holy, even
every one of them</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Numb. 16. 3.</note>; every Statute without exception, if unrepeal'd
on earth, though nullified in heaven before it was made, is ſtill va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
and good in Law; every cuſtome, without difference, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
<hi>privilege</hi> of Parliament: every paſſage a ſufficient preſident
for after-imitation, <hi>the Statutes of Omri</hi> as good for his turn, and
in his eye, as the Statutes of <hi>Moſes: the manner of the houſe of
Ahab,</hi> as laudable as the manner of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> or of the
houſe of God himſelfe: <hi>as is the good, ſo is the bad,</hi> (to him) the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
that curſeth, as that which bleſſeth a Land. All this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from that voluminous coacervation of old matters, paſſages,
preſidents, &amp;c. by Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> himſelfe in the former part of this
diſcourſe, many of them (as himſelfe intimates<note n="c" place="margin">Pag. 106. l. 9. 10.</note>) fetch'd out <hi>of the
darkeſt times of Popery, and higheſt ruff of Pope, of Prelates:</hi> and yet
thinkes that theſe are <hi>enough to evict and convince me and all the world
beſides, that I have not only violated, but denied, oppugned the privileges
of Parliament in Eccleſiaſticall affairs</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 110. in fine.</note>. In the caſe laſt preſented, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

that <hi>enmity unto God,</hi> and that unrighteouſneſſe which cleaveth, and
is like to cleave (notwithſtanding all that the <hi>meere Lawyer</hi> is able
to doe by way of reliefe) unto many the Lawes and Statutes of a
State or Kingdome, is like to be firſt an heavie ſcourge, and rods of
Scorpions, for the puniſhment of the State; and in fine, the utter
ruine and deſtruction of it. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Apoſtle<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 8. 6.</note>) i. <hi>the wiſdome of the fleſh is death:</hi> The reaſon whereof he
gives in the next verſe, which is this, <hi>becauſe the wiſdome of the fleſh is
enmity againſt God.</hi> So that whereſoever there is any <hi>enmity againſt
God,</hi> eſpecially if it utters it ſelfe in any the conſultations, acts, or
reſults of <hi>the wiſdom of the fleſh,</hi> it diſpoſeth the ſubject wherein it is
ſound, whether it be Perſon, Family, State, or Kingdome, unto
<hi>death.</hi> And whether this <hi>enmity againſt God</hi> which wee ſpeake of,
ſound in ſome of our lawes &amp; ſtatutes yet unrepeal'd (if not in more
then is generally obſerved and knowne) hath not made God an
enemy unto us, and ſtrengthened the arm of his diſpleaſure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
againſt us, I leave to Divines of ſound judgement and
conſcience, to conſider: yea and to ſuch Lawyers who have ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
their profeſſion with the ſound knowledge of <hi>the word of God
and prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By what hath been argued in this laſt paſſage, evident it is, that
the skill, faculty, and intereſt of the Divine, (yea of the <hi>meere Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>)
to diſcerne and judge of the <hi>cuſtomes, rights, privileges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
is farre more uſefull and neceſſary, then that of the <hi>meere
Lawyer.</hi> The reaſon is plaine; becauſe there is no manner of doubt
or queſtion to be made, but that whatſoever is not ſinfull &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
by the word of God for them to doe, is an undoubted
<hi>privilege of Parliament,</hi> without the authority or contribution of
former paſſages or records: and on the contrary, whatſoever is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and diſpleaſing unto God, can never make <hi>Privilege,</hi> as hath
been already argued and proved. Now then the faculty or skill of
the Lawyer, as ſuch, excending it ſelf only to the conquiſition and
muſtering together former tranſactions, paſſages and records of
Parliament, or at moſt to aſſiſt in the literall explanation or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of them; but matter of ſin, and what is lawfull by the law
of God, belonging properly to the cogniance of the Divine, it is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:111442:22"/>
as evident as evidence it ſelf in her higheſt exaltation can make is,
that <hi>Divines</hi> are more uſefull, neceſſary, yea and <hi>competent Judges</hi>
(in the ſaenſe declared) of Parliamentary Priviledges, then Lawyers
are: Notwithſtanding</p>
            <p>To the laſt recited paſſage I anſwer 3. and laſtly; that whereas
my Adverſary chargeth me, to have <hi>determined and judged of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Rights and Privileges of our Parliaments ſo peremptorily, &amp;c.</hi>
that this charge is like all or moſt of the reſt, undue untrue; I doe
not meddle with any <hi>ancient Right or Priviledge of Parliament;</hi> I one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
argue and work upon the Principles of mine own Profeſſion, the
<hi>Scriptures and Word of God:</hi> if theſe in their naturall and proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
ducture, and tendencie, lead me to any ſuch poſition or
concluſion, which enterfeers with ſomething which Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>
will needs call <hi>an ancient Right or Priviledge of Parliament,</hi> it is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accidentall, and which I cannot with my Allegeance to Heaven,
nor otherwiſe then at the utmoſt perill of my ſoule, no nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a ſinfull prevarication with that dutie which I owe to the State
I live in, decline. And therefore whereas</p>
            <p>The 4<hi rend="sup">t</hi>h ſignification which the Gentleman finds of the verb
<hi>Praeſumo</hi> (to ſalve the miſcarriage of his pen, in the word, <hi>PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVMPTVOVSLY)
is to doe a thing before a man be lawfully called to
it,</hi> and hereupon tells me that <hi>I had no lawfull calling or warrant
from Gods Word or our Lawes to handle the Juriſdictions and rights of
Parliament in my Pulpit,</hi> &amp;c. and concludes againſt me without
bayle or mainprize, that <hi>in this I was PRESVMPTVOVS by the
Scriptures owne definition,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 10. I anſwer,</p>
            <p>1. That the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in the place cited, gives no definition
at all, of the word, <hi>Preſumptuous,</hi> but onely ſpeaks of a wicked ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of men, <hi>who walk after the fleſh in the luſt of uncleanneſſe, and
deſpiſe Government, preſumptuous, ſelf-willed, and they are not afraid to
ſpeak evill of dignities.</hi> Can a man gather any definition of <hi>Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or of <hi>a Preſumptuous man,</hi> from hence? When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>
confeſſeth himſelf to <hi>have been a Blaſphemer, Perſecutor</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 13.</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth he
give any <hi>definition</hi> of either? I had rather Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> ſhould call
me a <hi>Preſumptuous</hi> man a thouſand times over, then that he ſhould
be able once to prove it out of any <hi>definition</hi> of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
which Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> ſtill citeth, are acknowledged to be very
good; but he imployeth them againſt their wills; and ſo their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:111442:23"/>
goodneſſe and his purpoſe, doe not greet or kiſſe each other. But</p>
            <p>2. Whereas he tells me <hi>I had no warrant from Gods Word, or our
Lawes to handle the Juriſdictions or rights of Parliament in my Pulpit,
&amp;c.</hi> I firſt demand what <hi>warrant from Gods Word or our Lawes</hi> hath
he, thus to calumniate a Miniſter of the Goſpel, onely for his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
to God and men; to wring, wreſt, and wier-draw his
words and ſayings, as he hath done theſe ten times (at leaſt) in
this and his other writings? I ſhall have my warrant, and that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique
enough, to ſhew for what I have done, when his will be
to ſeek for what he hath done, and (that which is worſe) will no
where be found. As for his charge, that I <hi>handle the Juriſdictions
and rights of Parliament in my Pulpit, &amp;c.</hi> it is but a dead corps of
an accuſation, without any life or ſoule of Truth in it at all; and
may well be reputed free of the company of his other not more
foule then falſe criminations. I never handled any ſuch theame or
ſubject in my Pulpit as he talks of, except it were in pleading the
juſtneſſe of their cauſe in the preſent warres, againſt the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of the <hi>Oxford</hi> Schooles. I truſt Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> will forgive me
this offence. But</p>
            <p>3. If by <hi>handling the rights and Juriſdictions of Parliaments,</hi> he
means thoſe paſſages wherein I argued againſt the lawfulneſſe of
ſubmitting unto any Government from men, except it be agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
alſo to the Word of God, and mind of Chriſt; or againſt any
lawfulneſſe of power in any civill Magiſtrate or Magiſtracie what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
to make any ſuch Lawes or Statutes in matters of Religion,
and which concerne the worſhip of God, whereunto the ſervants
of God ſhall ſtand bound under mulcts and penalties to ſubmit,
whether they can <hi>with a good conſcience</hi> ſubmit unto them, or no;
if this be the tenor of my charge, I anſwer, that <hi>I have warrant</hi> both
<hi>from the Law of God,</hi> and <hi>from the Laws of the Land</hi> alſo, as farre as
I underſtand them, (and I hope I underſtand them ſufficiently in
this) to doe whatſoever I have herein done. The warrant of a
Law, (whether we ſpeak of the Law of God, or of the Law of men)
for an action, doth not ſtand onely in a poſitive or expreſſe injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or declaration in the Law, that ſuch or ſuch an action, either
muſt, or may be done: but alſo in the totall ſilence of the Law,
(directly and by evident conſequence) as touching any reſtraint or
prohibition of the action. It is true, the totall ſilence of humane
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:111442:23"/>
Lawes concerning many actions, doth not ſimply and abſolutely
warrant them for lawfull or good, (though this be true concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Divine Law) but it warrants them ſufficiently againſt any
crime imputable, againſt any cenſure or puniſhment infligible by
the Authoritie of ſuch Lawes. <hi>Where no Law is</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 4. 15</note>)
<hi>there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi> So then, if amongſt all the Laws and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of the Land, there be no one Law or Statute to be found,
which prohibiteth or reſtraineth a Miniſter of the Goſpel from
declaring and making known <hi>the whole counſell of God</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 20. 27.</note> unto men,
(of which wretched import I know none, yea I am ſecurely confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that there is none) then have I warrant ſufficient, in reſpect
of <hi>our Laws,</hi> both to <hi>preach</hi> and <hi>print</hi> whatſoever I have done either
in the one or in the other, in the paſſages aforeſaid: becauſe in them
I have neither <hi>preached</hi> nor <hi>printed</hi> any thing, but what is part of
the <hi>counſell of God,</hi> as I have abundantly manifeſted &amp; made good,
in ſeverall tracts, eſpecially in that which was laſt publiſhed<note n="c" place="margin">Innocencie and Truth tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note>,
againſt all oppoſition and counter-reaſonings whatſoever.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>the word of God,</hi> I have not onely <hi>a warrant</hi> from thence,
to doe all that I did in the premiſes, but (that which is more then
a warrant, in the ſenſe ſpecified) precept upon precept, injunction
upon injunction, command upon command: yea I ſtand here moſt
deeply and dreadfully charged, as I will anſwer it at the great and
terrible day, <hi>when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be revealed from Heaven,
with his mightie Angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that
know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">2 Theſ. 1. 7, 8.</note>,
to doe that which I did in <hi>the paſſages</hi> excepted againſt. <hi>I charge
thee therefore</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to <hi>Timothy, a Miniſter of the Goſpel)
before God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the quick and dead
at his appearing and his Kingdome: Preach the Word: be inſtant, in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
out of ſeaſon; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-ſuffering and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.

obſerve</hi> 1. <hi>That the ſignification here inſiſted upon is, lower then the
charge;</hi> it ſignifies to doe boldly, <hi>&amp;c. but his charge is, that I did it
preſumptuouſly.</hi> 2. <hi>In</hi> this great Muſter-roll <hi>of the ſeverall ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his verb</hi> Praeſumo, <hi>he paſſes over, and forgets to liſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
or generall acceptation of the word, as it is uſually taken
amongſt us, and as any Author that writes Engliſh uſes to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood;</hi>
viz. <hi>for a wilfull and high-handed commiſſion of ſome
wicked thing. But for anſwer;</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:111442:24"/>
            <p>1. What Logick is there in all this Rhetorick to prove, that
what I did in the paſſages under conteſt, I did <hi>raſhly or without good
grounds?</hi> Here is nothing ſo much as in pretence (in reality no
where elſe) to diſable thoſe grounds upon which thoſe paſſages
ſtand.</p>
            <p>2. How unkindly he deales with the truth, in affirming, 1. <hi>That
I preached over the ſame again for ſubſtance or a ſolemne Faſt day.</hi> 2. <hi>That
I publiſhed them with additions in no leſſe then two printed books, whilſt
I was under examination;</hi> hath been already preſented to view
towards the beginning of this Diſcourſe. And here wee have yet
more (beſides theſe) <hi>ejuſdem farinae, (ſeu potius, furfaris</hi>) as 1. <hi>That
the paſſages in my firſt Sermon were exceeding ſcandalous, and derogatory
to the members and privileges of Parliament:</hi> There hath been nothing
yet proved, nor (I beleeve) ever will or can be proved, that there
was any thing in this Sermon, not only <hi>not exceeding ſcandalous and
derogatory, &amp;c.</hi> but not <hi>ſcandalous or derogatory</hi> in the leaſt or lighteſt
manner or degree either to any <hi>member,</hi> or <hi>any privilege of Parliament</hi>
whatſoever. 2. <hi>That ſince my very cenſure by the Committee for them, I
have gone on to juſtifie them in an</hi> HIGHER STRAIN <hi>then
ever, in my Innocencies Triumph.</hi> Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> I ſee is no Aſtronomer,
to take the altitude or elevation of a <hi>ſtrain</hi> in Rhetorick; if hee
were, he would be aſhamed of this calculation, that <hi>in my Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
Triumph I juſtifie my paſſages in a</hi> HIGHER STRAINE
<hi>then ever.</hi> Whoſoever reads this little peece, cannot lightly but ſee
and confeſſe, that all along I creep as neere the ground as any man
(lightly) can goe. 3. <hi>That in my</hi> ſaid <hi>Innocencies Triumph I ſlander
the Parliament more then before.</hi> Here wee have untruth upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth,
poſition upon ſuppoſition, and both vanity. For this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
1. ſuppoſeth, that I had <hi>ſlandered the Parliament</hi> before,
(wherein I am certain Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> ſlanders me:) And 2. i affirmeth,
that <hi>I ſlander it a ſecond</hi> time <hi>more then I did before.</hi> If he had conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himſelf only to have ſaid, that <hi>in my Innocencies Triumph I ſlander
the Parliament</hi> as much <hi>as I did before,</hi> he had ſpoke a kind of truth,
though of very ſlender importance. 4. <hi>That I was cenſured by the
Committee for the paſſages in my Sermon.</hi> If by <hi>cenſured</hi> he means <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred</hi>
(as by the tenor of all he writes concerning me in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
it ſhould ſeem he doth) granting the truth of the act or
<hi>cenſure it ſelfe</hi> (which yet to me is very queſtionable, upon the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:111442:25"/>
formerly mentioned) yet I cannot beleeve but that Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi>
pen faulters in aſſigning the grounds or reaſons of the cenſure. It
will not enter into me, to conceive a thought ſo diſhonorable to
that honorable Committee, as that they ſhould <hi>ſuſpend</hi> or <hi>ſequeſter</hi>
a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, who hath in all things from the firſt to
the laſt, approved himſelfe faithfull unto them, and to that hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
cauſe wherein they are ingaged, for preaching his judgement
and conſcience in a point of doctrine, having ſuch ſubſtantiall and
weighty grounds both from the Scriptures themſelves, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
(which I then in part accounted unto them, and am ſtill rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to perfect the account, if called to it) to conceive and judge is
none other but the very truth of God.</p>
            <p>3. And laſtly, whereas he brands me for <hi>an incorrigible Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,</hi>
and elſwhere for one <hi>impenitent after cenſure</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 107. circa medium.</note>. I anſwer and
confeſſe, 1. That I am <hi>incorrigible</hi> indeed, by a crooked rule, as the
Apoſtles themſelves were, when being charged and <hi>commanded</hi> by
a whole Councell, <hi>not to ſpeak at all, or teach in the Name of Jeſus,</hi>
they notwithſtanding profeſſed, that <hi>they could not but ſpeak the
things which they had ſeen and heard</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 4. 18. 20.</note>. Rectitude is alwayes unrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable,
i. <hi>incorrigible:</hi> And 2. I anſwer and confeſſe yet further, that
I am <hi>impenitent</hi> alſo in reſpect of that wherein I know no unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes,
or ſin. The truth is, I am conſcious to my ſelf of too many
ſinnes and failings in my ſelfe, to caſt away <hi>my Repentance</hi> upon
ſuch things as need it not If I can find repentance for all my
finnes, I ſhall leave all my other actions to be lamented and
mourned over by the world. If Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> will indict me for ſuch
<hi>incorrigibleneſſe and impenitency</hi> as theſe, ſo be it: I know the great
Judge of heaven and earth will acquit me. And thus you ſee that
Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> ſtill ſtands as a man convicted of an unrighteous charge
in the word PRESUMPTUOUSLY; <hi>haeret lateri lathalis
arundo:</hi> the arrow ſticks ſtill in his ſides, and all his wringling and
wreſting, and pulling, cannot get it out.</p>
            <p>His laſt charge and conteſt againſt me in this peece, is, that <hi>the
Authors which I cite to juſtifie my ſelfe, are miſerably wreſted and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
for the moſt part.</hi> The common ſaying is, That it's ill halting
before a creeple; The Proverb ſeems to import ſome dexterouſneſs
of faculty in him that halts continually, to take thoſe tardy who
onely counterfeit, and doe that by way of deſigne, which himſelfe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:111442:25"/>
doth out of neceſſitie. The truth is, though Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> may
reaſonably be conceived to have a more ſagacious facultie
then other men, of taking thoſe with the very manner, who
<hi>wreſt Authors and miſtake their meaning,</hi> as being a man ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
exerciſed in the practiſe himſelf (I ſpeak of his writings
againſt my ſelf) yet either his skill fails him, or his will ſtands
too faſt by him, in the ſentence pronounced againſt me in this
kind; as will appear preſently. In the mean while, I cannot
but take notice of that expreſſion, <hi>miſtaken for the moſt part,</hi> as an
expreſſion of the greateſt caution and care, that (to my beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance)
I have met with in all that he hath written
againſt me. It is very rare to find any of his uncharitable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions
concerning me, at all bridled or corrected with any
allay of any diminutive, lenitive, limitation or reſtraint: but
the ſaying (I remember) is, that he goes farre, that never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns.
But let us hearken unto his complaint of the behalf of
thoſe <hi>Authors,</hi> whom he ſo bewaileth, as being <hi>miſerably wreſted</hi>
by me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt is his Friend Mr.</hi> Edwards, <hi>from whoſe</hi> unaunſwerable
<hi>a piece of Presbyterie, I cite this paſſage,</hi> The Parliament inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
no Authority to determine, what Government ſhall be; <hi>and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon it thus;</hi> therefore his opinion APPEARS to be (<hi>not,
as Mr.</hi> Prynne, <hi>whoſe pen I ſee loves to play at ſmall game in
miſ-reports, rather then ſit out, recites it ſoon after;</hi> Therefore
his opinion is) either that the Parliament hath no Authoritie, or at leaſt
intends not to make uſe of it, it determining a Government. <hi>How</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably
<hi>this good well-meaning</hi> Author <hi>is by me</hi> wreſted, <hi>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
thus:</hi> It was written onely with reference to the preſent time, the
Parliament having at that time when he writ (during the Aſſemblies
debate and conſultation) interpoſed no Authority is determine what
Government ſhall be.</p>
            <p>But good Sir, though you (it may be) hit the meaning of
the Author better then I, having and the opportunity to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
with him about it, which I have not; yet I am ſure I hit the
meaning of his words better then you. If men and their words
will be of two different minds and meanings, I confeſſe <hi>their</hi>
meanings may very eaſily be miſtaken, not by me onely, but
by thoſe that are wiſer, and farre more able then I to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:111442:26"/>
ſtand the force and proper import of words. And yet now I
come upon this occaſion to review my expreſſion, I find it more
cautions and warie, then I can remember my ſelf to have been
in the calculation or inditing of it; and altogether free even
from that cavilling and ſhifting exception, which is here made
againſt it. For I do not abſolutely ſay or conclude, that his
opinion <hi>was</hi> or <hi>is</hi> either ſo or ſo, (as Mr. <hi>Prynne, pro more ſuo,</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
me to do) but onely that it <hi>appears to be</hi> either the one or
the other: and I think there is ſcarce any that underſtands
Engliſh, from the child that hath new learn'd his Primer, to the
greateſt Maſter in the language, but will acknowledge an <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi>
at leaſt of one or other of thoſe <hi>opinions</hi> in the words.
And how anomalous and ſharking that interpretation of the
words, which Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> would force upon them, is, will beſt
appear by comparing the words and interpretation with other
expreſſions of the ſame Grammaticall character and conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
both in the ſame Author, and in others. When (<hi>p.</hi> 170.
of his Antapologie) he cites this ſaying out of <hi>Zanchie; that
which doth not diſturbe the publique peace—the Magiſtrate PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CEEDETH
not againſt;</hi> doth he imagine that the meaning
of this Author was to confine that <hi>non-proceeding</hi> of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
he ſpeaks of, to the particular and preciſe time of his
writing; as if then indeed he did not ſo <hi>proceed,</hi> but at all other
times he did. So again when himſelf (p. 169. of the ſame
Tract) ſaith thus, <hi>the power of the Magiſtrate by which he puniſheth
ſin, doth not ſubſerve to the Kingdom of Chriſt the Mediator;</hi> can any
reaſonable man think that his meaning onely ſhould be, that
this <hi>power of the Magiſtrate</hi> which he ſpeaks of, <hi>doth not</hi> thus <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi>
whileſt he is in ſpeaking or writing it; but that afterwards
it may, or <hi>doth ſubſerve</hi> in ſuch a kind? <hi>Apagè nugas!</hi> when the
Evangeliſt <hi>John,</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith thus: <hi>This was the true
light that LIGHTETH every man that cometh into the world</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 1. 9.</note>;
is his meaning that Chriſt performed that act of grace he
ſpeaks of, <hi>enlightened men coming into the world,</hi> onely whileſt he
was writing his Goſpel, and that afterwards he ſuſpended it?
In ſuch conſtructions of ſpeech as this, the common Rule of
Divines (touching matter of Interpretation) is, that <hi>verbum
praeſentis notat actum continuum ſeu conſuetum: i.</hi> a verb of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:111442:26"/>
tenſe noteth a continued or ſtill accuſtomed act. So that
whileſt Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> goes about to prove, that <hi>I miſerably wreſt</hi> his
<hi>Author,</hi> how favourably ſoever he may deal with his <hi>Author</hi> in
compariſon of my dealing with him, certain I am that he <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably
wreſts his words,</hi> with which I deal as favourably, as their
genuine and native ſignification, according to all rules both
of Grammaticall and Rhetoricall conſtruction will bear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for that reaſon which Mr.</hi> Prynne <hi>alledgeth, to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
the ſenſe which he puts upon the words now conteſted
about, to the diſparagement of mine,</hi> viz. <hi>that</hi> be maintains
point-blank againſt me throughout his Treatiſe a legiſlative and coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
power in Parliaments; <hi>and</hi> that the inference which I draw from
the ſaid words is quite contrarie to the next enſuing words and pages;
<hi>I anſwer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. (To the former part of the Reaſon) that it is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true:
<hi>he doth</hi> not <hi>maintain point-blank againſt me throughout his
Treatiſe a legiſlative and coercive power in Parliaments and civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.</hi>
I every where acknowledge and aſſert a civill <hi>legiſlative</hi>
power in both; therefore Mr. <hi>Edwards maintaining</hi> ſuch a <hi>power</hi>
in them, <hi>maintains</hi> nothing <hi>point-blank againſt me.</hi> And whether
he maintains a ſpirituall or <hi>Eccleſiaſticall legiſlative power</hi> in
them, eſpecially <hi>throughout his Treatiſe,</hi> let this paſſage be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
between me and my Adverſarie: <hi>There is nothing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in the writings of the learned and orthodox, then to ſhew that the
civill power and Government of the Magiſtrate, and the Eccleſiaſticall
Government of the Church, are</hi> to to genere <hi>disjoyned: and thereupon the
power of the Magiſtrate by which he deals with the corrupt manners
and diſorders of his people, it in the nature and ſpecificall reaſon diſtinct
from Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Edwards Antap. p. 169.</note>. I know not what artificiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
and meaning Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> may poſſibly find out for
theſe words; but ſurely he that hath not affirm'd the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
as Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> very inconſiderately (that I ſay not PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUMPTUOUSLY)
hath done, will not affirm, that Mr. <hi>Edw.</hi>
in this paſſage <hi>maintains an Eccleſiaſticall legiſlative power in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
or civill Magiſtrates,</hi> but the contrary; yea and affirms
this to be the <hi>common</hi> judgement of men <hi>learned and orthodox.</hi> So
again when he affirms, <hi>p.</hi> 282. <hi>that it is their duty</hi> (ſpeaking of the
Parliament) <hi>by their power and Authority to bind men to the Decrees
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:111442:27"/>
of the Aſſembly,</hi> he doth not (doubtleſſe) maintain <hi>an Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
legiſlative power in the Parliament:</hi> for they that have ſuch
a power, cannot be bound in <hi>dutie</hi> to own the Laws or <hi>Decrees</hi>
of others, much leſſe to <hi>bind others</hi> to ſubjection to them. I omit
many other paſſages in this book of like importance. The
truth is, that Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> opinion concerning an Eccleſiaſticall
ſpirituall Juriſdiction in the Civill Magiſtrate, which yet is his
grand notion in all that he hath written upon the ſubject of
Presbyterie, overthrows the main grounds and principall
foundations upon which the Doctrine of Presbyterie is built
by all her ableſt and moſt skilfull workmen. Inſomuch that I
wonder not a little, that the Maſters of that way and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
have not appeared at another manner of rate then yet
they have done, for the vindication of their principles againſt
him that hath made ſo ſore a breach upon them, and laid their
honour in the duſt. Somewhat I know ſome of them have done
in this kind: but the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> reproved the King of Iſrael,
for <hi>ſmiting thrice</hi> onely <hi>upon the ground,</hi> and then ceaſing, telling
him that he <hi>ſhould have ſmitten five or ſix times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. To the latter part of the Reaſon, I anſwer and confeſſe,
that <hi>the inference I draw from the words</hi> mentioned, may very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be <hi>quite contrarie to the next enſuing words and pages,</hi> and yet
the ſenſe of them no wayes <hi>wreſted,</hi> nor <hi>miſtaken</hi> by me; becauſe
it is familiar in the Diſcourſe, for the Author to contradict
himſelf, as well as other men; according to one of the ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
in that moſt true and happie character of the Diſcourſe,
given by a woman, who deſcribes it to be <hi>wrangling-inſinuating-contradictory-revengefull
ſtorie</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Katharine Chidley</hi> New-yeers gift. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt.</hi> to the Reader.</note>. And the truth is, that in the eye
of an unpartiall and diſengaged Reader, there is ſcarce any
paſſage or period throughout the whole Diſcourſe but may be
commodiouſly enough reduced under one of theſe 4. heads.
And therefore whereas Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> gives this <hi>elogium</hi> of it, that
it is <hi>in truth unanſwerable</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Epiſt. Dedic. non longe à finè</note>; I confeſſe that <hi>unanſwerable</hi> it is in
ſeverall reſpects and ſundrie wayes. Firſt, it is <hi>unanſwerable</hi> to
that eſteeme which my ſelf with many others had of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
formerly. Secondly, <hi>unanſwerable</hi> it is to that opinion,
which he would have the world conceive of his parts and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and in ſpeciall manner of his abilities to deal in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:111442:27"/>
controverſie. Thirdly, it is <hi>unanſwerable</hi> to his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
as he is a Chriſtian. Fourthly, much more <hi>unanſwerable</hi> is it
to his calling, as he is a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt and of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel:
And fifthly (and laſtly) moſt <hi>unanſwerable</hi> it is to thoſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
ſolemn and large profeſſions which he makes both in
his Epiſtle and elſewhere, of his love to the Apologiſts, and
candor and fairneſſe in writing. But for any ſuch <hi>unanſwerable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
as Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> intends, the one part of it will not indure
that ſuch a thing ſhould be ſpoken of the other; there being
enough in the Diſcourſe it ſelf to anſwer whatſoever is to be
found in it, of any materiall conſideration againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall
way; as will in time convenient be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
in the ſight of the Sun, God not preventing, by more then
an ordinarie (or at leaſt expected) hand. And whereas Mr.
<hi>Prynne</hi> glorieth (and that twice over at leaſt, for failing) that
it hath not <hi>been hitherto anſwered by the Independents</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Epiſt. Dedic. non longe à fine. <hi>And again,</hi> p. 111. non longè à fine.</note>; I anſwer
three things: Firſt, that neither hath Mris <hi>Katharine Chidleys</hi>
Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> his Reaſons againſt Independencie and
Toleration, been yet replyed unto or anſwered, either by Mr.
<hi>Edwards</hi> himſelf, or any other of his partie; notwithſtanding
the ſaid Anſwer be but a ſmall piece in compariſon of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapologie:
and beſides hath been ſome yeers longer abroad,
then this. Beſides this, there are many other Tractates and
Diſcourſes extant (and ſo have been a long time) in defence of
the Congregationall way, which as yet have not been ſo much
as attempted by any Claſſique Author whatſoever. A particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of ſome of theſe you may ſee, <hi>p.</hi> 65. of my <hi>Innocencie and Truth
triumphing together,</hi> in the Margent. As for that which <hi>A. S.</hi> or
(in words at large) <hi>Adam Steuart</hi> hath lift up his pen to do
againſt <hi>M. S.</hi> if men will needs vote it for an <hi>Anſwer,</hi> an Anſwer
(ſo called) let it be:<note n="*" place="margin">Whereas <hi>M.

himſelf, the ſmallneſſe of the content of the Apologeticall Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
conſidered, took not a whit leſſe time to give anſwer to
it, then hath yet been taken by the Independents to anſwer the
Antapologie. But thirdly (and laſtly) if Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> knew and
conſidered, who it was that hath hindered the Independents,
and that once and again from anſwering it as yet, <hi>viz.</hi> he that
ſometimes <hi>hindred Pauls</hi> coming to the Theſſalonians<note n="e" place="margin">1 Theſ. 2. 18</note>, though

no other <hi>Authority, power in Parliaments, Civill Magiſtrates,</hi> but
onely that which is <hi>enforcing of mens conſciences in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
Whereas he promiſeth or undertakes that <hi>he ſhall in due
place anſwer</hi> theſe words of theirs, which (as he ſaith) <hi>ſeem to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:111442:28"/>
the coercive power of Magiſtrates in matters of Religion,</hi> and
<hi>manifeſt how I abuſe the Authors herein as well as Mr. Edwards;</hi> My
anſwer onely is, that he may indeed ſoon <hi>anſwer</hi> them after
that rate of <hi>anſwering,</hi> at which he hath <hi>anſwered</hi> any thing of
mine hitherto, and he may <hi>ſhew how (i.</hi> ſay that) <hi>I abuſe them;</hi>
and without writing or ſpeaking, as well as by either, <hi>manifeſt
that I abuſe their Authors herein, as well</hi> as I do <hi>Mr. Edwards.</hi> But
for this laſt particular, I am willing to ſave him the labour and
pains of writing for the <hi>manifeſtation</hi> of it. For I here freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
that I have <hi>abuſed theſe Authors</hi> in what he ſpeaks of, juſt as
I have <hi>abuſed Mr. Edwards:</hi> and both of them juſt as much as
amounts to no abuſe at all. I wonder by what art or way the
Gentleman means to go to work, to prove that I have <hi>miſerably
wreſted,</hi> or <hi>abuſed</hi> the Authors he here ſpeaks of, or their words,
when as I have put no conſtruction at all or interpretation
upon their words, nor drawn any inference or deduction
from them, but onely tranſcribed them with as much dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and faithfulneſſe as I could, and preſented them cleerly
as they <hi>ſtand</hi> in their reſpective Authors. If his meaning be,
that I have <hi>miſerably wreſted and abuſed them</hi> by my quotation of
them, as ſubſervient to my cauſe or purpoſe, (a deed of folly
which himſelf commits with the holy Scriptures themſelves
many a time and often) my anſwer is, that were this aſſertion
true, that they are not ſubſervient to my cauſe or purpoſe, yet
my recourſe unto them, for aid to my purpoſe, were no <hi>miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wreſting or abuſing of them.</hi> Our Saviour being an hungry, did
not abuſe the fig-tree by repairing to it, though there prov'd
nothing upon it for his <hi>purpoſe.</hi> Nor ſhould Mr. <hi>Prynne abuſe</hi> a
Tavern by going into it to drink a cup of wine that pleaſeth
him, though he ſhold be diſappointed in his expectation when
he comes there. Nay in this caſe would he not rather think
(and that much more reaſonably of the two) that the Taverne
had abuſed him, then he it. In like manner, if thoſe Authors
and ſayings which I have produced, and which Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>
ſpeaks of, <hi>have no affinity with my paſſages</hi> and purpoſe, I may
much more truly and reaſonably ſay that they have <hi>abuſed</hi> me,
then Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> can either ſay or ever prove, that I have <hi>abuſed</hi>
them. For the truth is, if they do fall me, or refuſe to ſtand by
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:111442:29"/>
me in the defence of <hi>thoſe paſſages</hi> ſpoken of when Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>
hath done his worſt to them, they are the greateſt diſſemblers
that ever wore the livery of paper and inke. Never were there
ſentences or ſayings that more fully and freely complied with
any mans notions whatſoever in terms and words, then farre
the greateſt part of theſe do with my paſſages and purpoſe. If
Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> can diſſolve or abrogate the Authoritie of Grammar
rules, and deſtroy the naturall and proper ſignification of
words, then may I have ſome cauſe to fear, that he may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
evict me to be a <hi>miſerable wreſter and abuſer</hi> of Authors and
their ſayings. But if words be able to defend themſelves, and
make good the poſſeſſion of their known ſignifications and
rules of conſtruction, their both ancient and moderne intereſt
in the underſtandings of men, againſt the Authority or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> pen; I defie all his interminations and
threatnings of <hi>manifeſting</hi> me either <hi>a miſerable wreſter or abuſer</hi>
of my Authors.</p>
            <p>The laſt parcell of his high conteſt againſt me in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
is, that <hi>I pervert the meaning of the Divines of Scotland,</hi> in
one, or more, or I know not, he knows not, how many or how
few, of thoſe paſſages which I cite from them; whereas I med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
not little or much with any ſenſe or meaning of any of
them; but onely barely tender them unto the Reader, leaving
it free unto him to judge of the ſenſe and meaning of them,
and whether they conſort with my apprehenſions, or no. And
though he be doubtfull of that interpretation or meaning
which himſelf (however) adventures to put upon them (as
there is reaſon more then enough, why he ſhould) delivering
himſelf with this ſub-modeſt caution, <hi>If I miſtake not;</hi> yet am I
rated and chidden at no lower rate, then this: <hi>you may THERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORE
bluſh at this</hi> (I wonder, which) <hi>your perverting of their
meaning, as if they held, that the Parliaments of England or Scotland
had no power to make Eccleſtaſticall Laws for Religion and Church
Government. THEREFORE may I bluſh:</hi> wherefore? what? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> hath put ſuch a ſenſe and interpretation upon
the paſſages in hand, of which he knows not (it ſeems) what
to make, but ſuſpects a <hi>miſtake</hi> in it? <hi>Bluſh</hi> in this reſpect I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<hi>I may:</hi> but what cauſe have <hi>I to bluſh,</hi> at <hi>my perverting of their
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:111442:29"/>
meaning,</hi> when as 1. I do not interpoſe to put any meaning (I
mean any particular or ſpeciall meaning) upon any of them.
2. Why ſhould I bluſh upon Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> injunction, at any <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
which I put upon them, when as that very meaning which
himſelf puts upon them, by way of confutation and diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that which he pretends to be mine, is by himſelf little
leſſe then ſuſpected for a <hi>miſtake?</hi> The tax of <hi>bluſhing</hi> which Mr.
<hi>Prynne</hi> impoſeth upon me, ſhould in reaſon be rather levied upon
the eſtate of his own modeſtie, who by his own confeſſion runs the
hazard of <hi>perverting the meaning</hi> of thoſe paſſages under debate,
whereas I never came ſo neere the crime of ſuch a perverſion, as to
ingage my ſelf in any Interpretation of them at all. But if you will
pleaſe to heare his Interpretation, and compare it diligently with
his Text (the paſſages cited by me from <hi>the Divines of Scotland</hi>)
you may very fairly tranſlate Mr. <hi>Prynnes, If I miſtake not,</hi> into,
certainly, <hi>Mr. Prynne miſtakes. I Anſwer,</hi> (ſaith he) 1. <hi>That
their onely meaning</hi> (if I miſtake not) <hi>in theſe paſſages, is, that
the Prince or chiefe Civill Magiſtrate of himſelfe, without a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or without the aſſiſtance and conſent of his Nobles, Commons, Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
cannot legally make any Eccleſiaſticall Lawes to oblige his people.</hi>
Mark this ſaying well; and ſee how like it looks to the genuine
Interpretation, ſenſe or import of theſe (and the like) enſuing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.
<hi>All men, as well Magiſtrates, as inferiors, ought to be ſubject to
the judgement of the Nationall Aſſembly in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes without
any reclamation or appellation to any Judge, Civill or Eccleſiaſticall,
within the Realme.</hi> Againe; <hi>It belongeth to the Synod (the Clergie ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the chiefe place therein to give Direction and advice) not to receive
and approve the definition of the Prince in things which concerne the
worſhip of God, but it ſelf to define and determine what Orders and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
are fitteſt to be obſerved, &amp;c.</hi> We ſee here in the Text, that the
<hi>chiefe place,</hi> yea the ſole power (for what other ſenſe can be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe words, <hi>It belongeth to the Synod it ſelf to define and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>)
of <hi>defining and determining Orders and Cuſtomes in things which
concerne the worſhip of God,</hi> is aſcribed unto the <hi>Synod,</hi> (wherein alſo
the Direction of the Clergie ought to be predominant) not onely
without the <hi>definition of the Prince, or chiefe Civill Magiſtrate,</hi> but
with rejection of his <hi>definition:</hi> NOT TO RECEIVE OR
APPROVE THE DEFINITION OF THE PRINCE
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:111442:30"/>
(ſaith this text.) Whereas in Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> Interpretation, the <hi>Prince
or chiefe Civill Magiſtrate</hi> (as we heard) hath the preheminence and
precedencie in all ſuch <hi>definitions and determinations</hi> aſſigned unto
him; and next to him, the <hi>Nobles,</hi> and next to them the <hi>Commons,</hi>
(of neither of which <hi>ne</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>quidem</hi> in the Text) are intereſſed in
the ſame; and the Clergie, or <hi>Synod,</hi> which are made the head, and
have <hi>the chiefe place,</hi> if not the ſole power, about ſuch <hi>definitions
and determinations</hi> in the text, are in the Interpretation made the
taile, and compelled to come behind all the reſt, as a partie borne
out of due time, or at leaſt in the loweſt influence of power, for any
ſuch Intereſt. If Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> be not (at the ſofteſt) <hi>miſtaken</hi> in this
Interpretation, the ſenſe and meaning of thoſe words, <hi>Abraham be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
Iſaac</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 1. 2.</note>, may very poſſibly be this, that <hi>Judas went and hung

               <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 27. 5.</note>. Judge, Reader, between me and my Adverſary, who hath
more cauſe <hi>to bluſh,</hi> and who is the more <hi>miſerable wreſter</hi> of words,
and <hi>perverter of meanings.</hi> And whether there be not an ayre or
gentle breathing of a contradiction in this period which he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes,
within it ſelf, and in one part of it to the premiſed Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
I deſire the Reader attentively to conſider. <hi>But that the
King</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>or ſupreame temporall Magiſtrates, aſſiſted by a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
and Orthodox Divines, may not make binding Eccleſiaſticall
Lawes, or, that their or our Parliaments have not a reall Legiſlative
power in any matter Eccleſtiaſtique (the onely point controverſed) is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrary both to the conſtant Doctrine and Practiſe of our Brethren
and their Church, &amp;c.</hi> I beleeve that neither <hi>our Brethren, nor their
Church,</hi> will conne Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> thanks for this his vindication and
plea for them: but however, I ſhall not ſpeak in his caſt, nor fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall
his market. Onely I deſire to know of him, <hi>if their, and our
Parliaments have a reall Legiſlative Power in matters Eccleſiaſtique</hi>
(as he affirms in the latter part of the ſentence) why he requires an
<hi>aſſiſtance of Orthodox Divines</hi> in the former part of it, <hi>to make binding
Eccleſiaſticall Lawes.</hi> They that have a <hi>reall Legiſlative power</hi> in, or
within themſelves; need no <hi>forinſecall aſſiſtance</hi> of others, to make
their <hi>Laws binding,</hi> though they may need forinſecal advice for the
better conſtitution of them, as in Laws about any particular trade;
yea he had given this judgement in the caſe a little before (as we
heard) that <hi>the Prince or chiefe civill Magiſtrate cannot legally make
any Eccleſiaſticall Lawes to oblige his people,</hi> not onely not <hi>without a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:111442:30"/>
Parliament,</hi> but not without <hi>his Clergie</hi> alſo. Doth he not here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſe
<hi>the Clergie</hi> every whit as farre, and as deep in the very eſſence
or ſubſtance of the <hi>Legiſlative power to make binding Eccleſiaſticall
Lawes for the people,</hi> as he doth the <hi>Parliament</hi> it ſelf? And whereas
in the paſſage laſt recited, he affirms the <hi>onely point in controverſie to
be,</hi> whether <hi>our Parliaments</hi> have not <hi>a reall legiſlative power in any
matters Eccleſiaſtique;</hi> I wonder why he ſtorms me and my writings
with ſo much indignation, <hi>pag.</hi> 106, 107. &amp;c. for <hi>printing paſſages</hi>
onely charged by him as being <hi>againſt the Eccleſiaſticall Juriſdiction
of Parliaments</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 106. ante medium.</note>; which likewiſe is his uſuall expreſſion elſewhere.
Doth he apprehend no difference at all, between an <hi>Eccleſiaſticall
Juriſdiction, power, Authoritie;</hi> and a <hi>legiſlative power in or about Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſtiaſticall
matters,</hi> or things? Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> if he will vouchſafe to
learne of him, will teach him a wide difference; who in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
gives and grants unto the Magiſtrate a power and Authoritie
about Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, and buſineſſes<note n="b" place="margin">Antapol <hi>pag.</hi> 159, 160, 163, &amp;c.</note> of many kinds, (though
not of <hi>any</hi>

                  <hi>pag</hi> 166. 169. 170, &amp;c.</note>, as Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> bountie extendeth) but no where (to
my remembrance) grants any <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Juriſdiction</hi> or <hi>power</hi> to
him: yea <hi>p.</hi> 163. of his Antapologie, he interrogates his Apologiſts,
<hi>Whether there doth not reſide in the Church all Eccleſiaſticall power ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
neceſſary to the building up of the Kingdome of Chriſt, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of men, even when the Magiſtrate is not of the Church?</hi> The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of which interrogation agrees well with that aſſertion of the
ſame Author; and tract <hi>p.</hi> 169. that <hi>the civill power and Government
of the Magiſtrate, and the Eccleſiaſticall Government of the Church, are</hi>
toto genere <hi>disjoyned; and thereupon the power of the Civill Magiſtrate,
by which he deales with the corrupt manners and diſorders of his people,
is in the nature and ſpecificall reaſon diſtinct from Eccleſiaſticall Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</hi>
If there be an <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Juriſdiction or Legiſlative power
in civill Magiſtrates, Parliaments, to make Eccleſiaſticall binding Laws;</hi>
why may not the exerciſe of this power in the adminiſtration or
execution of theſe Lawes, be called <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline</hi> or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment?
yea, why not rather <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> then civill? So that
Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> confounding an <hi>Eccleſiaſticall power,</hi> with <hi>a power about
Eccleſiaſticall things,</hi> plainly ſhews that he is not perfectly initiated
in the myſterie of <hi>Presbyterie:</hi> and did not his writings more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
that cauſe and partie by the weight of their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and height of language, and confidence, together with unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleld

bitterneſſe againſt his oppoſites, then by their worth in

to be numbred amongſt their Benefactors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But notwithſtanding all that Mr.</hi> Prynne <hi>hath done or ſaid to,
or againſt me, or my</hi> Innocencies Triumph, <hi>in particular; in the</hi> 106,
107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112 pages <hi>of this his Diſcourſe, yet his</hi>
ſpes gregis, <hi>the ſtrength of his hope that he hath done ſufficient exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
upon me, reſts onely upon his</hi> former ſections; <hi>however the
Queſtion of many concerning them, is,</hi> Cui bono? <hi>He tells me, that</hi>
my own conſcience and judgement cannot but informe me, that he hath
written enough in the former Sections to convince me and all the world
beſides, that I have not onely violated, but denyed, oppugned thoſe Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of Parliament in Eccleſiaſticall affaires, which our own Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in all ages, and Parliamentary Aſſemblies in all other Kingdomes
have unqueſtionably exerciſed, &amp;c. <hi>I anſwer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. I confeſſe that <hi>in the former ſections</hi> he hath <hi>written enough,</hi>
quantitativè, <hi>to convince</hi> any reaſonable man (if not <hi>all the world</hi>) of
any errour or miſtake whatſoever: but much too little <hi>qualitativè,</hi>
to convince either me, or any reaſonable man, that I have <hi>violated,</hi>
or <hi>oppugned</hi> any <hi>Priviledge of Parliament;</hi> I have farre more reaſon
to conceive and hope, that in this and my laſt-publiſhed Diſcourſe,
<hi>I have written enough</hi> both wayes to <hi>convince both him and all the
world,</hi> that I have NOT <hi>violated or oppugned</hi> any <hi>Priviledge of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
truly, or with the conſent of Heaven, ſo called. If he intends
to conclude, that therefore I have <hi>violated, oppugned the Privileges
of Parliament,</hi> becauſe I have argued againſt ſome poſitions or opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
which Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> with ſome others, are pleaſed to call <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of Parliament;</hi> the Logician, who is a man of reaſon, will
anſwer for me, that <hi>à terminis diminuentibus non ſequitur argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio.</hi>
It doth not follow, that a piece of metall or coyne is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
gold, becauſe it is counterfeit gold; nor that Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> Great
Grandfather is a man, becauſe he is a dead man. If he can, or ſhall
fairly demonſtrate unto me (though in a far leſſe content of words,
then his three former ſections amount unto) that any act, practiſe,
or exerciſe, either by continuance or ſucceſſion of time, or by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencie
of repetition, or cuſtomarineſſe of reiteration, by conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vencie
or want of oppoſition from men, muſt needs change the
nature and kind of it, and of ſinfull become lawfull, he ſhall by
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:111442:31"/>
ſuch a demonſtration as this, put life into his <hi>former ſections,</hi> and
render them potent for that <hi>conviction</hi> which he expects from them;
but till this be done, that great bulk and body of things done in
the dark, and time out of minde, will partake of that infirmitie
which the Author himſelf acknowledgeth as cleaving to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,

               </note>; and can with no tolerable pretence
of reaſon or equitie, demand that intereſt in the judgements, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
underſtandings of men, which he <hi>challengeth</hi> (it ſeems) on
their behalfe. It is as poore and low a deſigne, onely by alledging
the examples, opinions, or judgements of men, to attempt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of him that builds his opinion upon the Scriptures &amp; word
of God, yea though he builds beſides his foundation; as it would
be in a man to carry a ſack of chaffe to the market, hoping to bring
home a like quantitie of wheat for it, without giving any other
price. Yea to alledge and cite the Scriptures themſelves, though in
never ſuch an abundance, without cloſe arguing and binding them
to our cauſe; is a means of very ſmall hope, whereby to prevaile
or doe good upon ſuch a man who holds his opinion, not barely
or ſimply upon a ſuppoſall of Scripture-Authoritie for it, but upon
Scripture thoroughly debated, and by principles of ſound reaſon
and naturall deductions, brought home unto his judgement and
cauſe.</p>
            <p>Againe, 2. in all that great body of <hi>premiſſes</hi> contained in all the
<hi>former Sections</hi> he ſpeaks of, there is not one word, ſyllable, letter,
or tittle to prove that maine ingredient in his <hi>Concluſion, unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
exerciſed.</hi> Logicians juſtly reject and exauthorize all ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions,
which ſwell above the line of their premiſſes. By all the
tables and donaries preſented unto <hi>Neptune</hi> by thoſe that in Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks
eſcaped with their lives, it could not be knowne, who, or
how many they were, that were drowned.</p>
            <p>3. Nor is there any whit more in any, in all the ſaid <hi>Sections</hi> or
premiſſes, that reacheth home, or indeed comes neere, to that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialtie
in the Concluſion, <hi>in all ages. Evanders</hi> mother lived many
<hi>ages</hi> agone; yet the mother of <hi>Abel</hi> had the precedencie of her by
many generations. Therefore ſurely all the world will never accept
of the Concluſion ſo inſufficiently and lamely prov'd.</p>
            <p>4. And laſtly, Whereas Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> tells me, that <hi>if I now make
not good my promiſe, few or none will ever credit me hereafter;</hi> I ſhould
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:111442:32"/>
be very glad to meet with my condition, that ſo I might performe
my obligation. But in the meane time, whether any or none <hi>will
credit me hereafter;</hi> I know not well how I, or any other ſhould
<hi>credit</hi> him for the <hi>preſent,</hi> as touching the authentiqueneſs and truth
of thoſe citations and tranſcriptions, upon which the principall
weight of that Concluſion depends, whereof he expects conviction
both from <hi>me,</hi> and <hi>all the world</hi> to boote. Is it lightly poſſible for
any man to refraine jealouſie in this kind, that doth but conſider
how oft his pen hath daſh'd againſt the rock of truth, in repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me, my opinions and ſayings, (yea, I can ſay further, affections,
intentions) upon the open theatre of the world, where any man
that will, may ſee his nakedneſſe in this kinde? Is <hi>boldneſſe</hi> in the
Sun, like to prove <hi>modeſtie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> in the ſhade? As for ſatisfaction by exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of all particulars, it is not every mans, indeed very few
mens, opportunitie. The reſpective Authors and records, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
particularities muſt be inquired after, and found, for ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in that kind, are in few mens hands; and not of all mens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings.
So that Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> by dealing ſo unfaithfully and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianly
by me and my ſayings, as he hath done, hath not onely
obſtructed the courſe and paſſages of his own reputation and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit;
but hath further alſo injur'd the world round about him, by
rendring thoſe good parts and abilities wherewith God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
him for publick accommodation, if not wholly unſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
yet of very meane uſefulneſſe and concernment, in compariſon
of what their line and tenour would well have borne. It is a ſaying
in the Civill Law, that <hi>he that hath injur'd one, hath threatened
many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I end, with a word of Chriſtian admonition and advice, both
to the Gentleman my Antagoniſt, and my ſelfe. Sir, the Great and
Glorious God that made us, in mercy remembers both our frames,
and conſiders <hi>that we are duſt</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 103. 14.</note>. This gracious remembrance of his

laying hold on that which is to come. Our duſt which abaſeth us,
in this reſpect, yet relieveth us, and becomes a Mediator for us
with the bountifulneſſe of God: were wee creatures of a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
line, thoſe ſins and infirmities would (in all likelihood)
were they found upon us, be our ruine, which now doe not ſo much
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:111442:32"/>
as ſhake the leaſt haire of our heads. If wee would but remember
and conſider one the other, as God doth us both, that common
principle of frailtie, out of which wee act to a reciprocall diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
and offence, would be of ſoveraigne uſe to mollifie and
ſupple, if not perfectly to heale, both our wounds. Not to think
any thing that befalleth us ſtrange, is almoſt (being interpreted) not
to think it evill. We ſhall not quit our ſelves like men, if we make
any great matter of it, to be evill intreated by men. Mutuall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentments
now and then are a known tribute which men muſt
look to pay for the commoditie of living &amp; converſing together in
the world. If we have offended one the other, happie ſhall we be in
forgiving one the other, and circumvent him whoſe deſigne was to
have circumvented us, and made hatred (a kind of upper hell) of
our conteſtation. If I have offended you otherwiſe then by ſpeaking
the truth, and ſo as the defence of it, all circumſtances duly poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
required, you ſhall not need long to complaine of want of
Chriſtian ſatisfaction, as far as I am able either to doe or to ſpeak
any thing that may accommodate you, if you pleaſe, but to ſignifie
your aggrievance, and make your demands in a Chriſtian and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
way. And if your heart will but anſwer mine in theſe inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the ſtorms and tempeſts of our conteſtations, ſhall yet end in
a ſweet calme; and men ſhall look upon us, as if wee had never been
they: If you reject the motion of a Chriſtian compliance by the
way, I can very patiently, and with comfort enough, awaite the
Deciſions of that Great Tribunall, whoſe awards will ſhortly ſeale
all the righteouſneſſes and unrighteouſneſſes of men, againſt all
further diſputes or inquiries to the dayes of Eternitie.</p>
