            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:54864:12"/>3. Thirdly, and moſt dreadfull of all, the conviction of that villany of hypocriſie, under a formality of profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>After all, it being the good pleaſure of my God, in a time of love, by the Miniſtry of the Word, and convoy of the Spirit, to clear mine eyes, and open mine ears, unto a right uptaking of mine own by-paſt madneſſe and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and of His marvelous long-ſufferings and mercy, ſo as (by grace) might have both humbled me, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me.</p>
                  <p>And now again, for the ſpace of other 36. years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the name of a ſtanding (but more properly ſtammering) Profeſſor, I have found by better (althogh bitter) experience, that the way of Gods Children through the wilderneſſe is ſtrawed with innumerable piercing thorns of divers afflictions and variety of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And that the moſt ſearching tryals and ſharpeſt afflictions are ſo unſeparably conjoined, as fire and heat, under the exerciſe of deſertion, being unto the ſpirituall man and renewed party a preſent (but temporary) hell, and yet carrying a heaven in the heart of it: Whereas the Fools paradice of ſinfull pleaſures produces in a ſhort time an everlaſting hell. And finding that out of the moſt terrifying and tormenting troubles, ſongs of joyful delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance were injoyed, like ſweet out of the ſtrong, and meat out of the eater, although it ſhould ſeem to the naturall man a Paradox: Yet I ſhall ſpeak a word to ſuch as are inclining to better clearneſſe then as yet they have attained unto. That they would make it their ſtudy to know that the Child of God after regeneration, in whom the ſeed of Grace is graciouſly infuſed, by the effectuall operation of the Holy Ghoſt, in the miniſtry of the word,

whereby the new Creature is formed in the ſoul, where the old man of the fleſh or corrupt nature, formerly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſway without controle, that theſe two parties now in one perſon, being of as different qualities as fire and water; diſpoſitions, deſigns, deſires &amp; delights, as God, the Author of the one, and Belial of the other: the one being a young and new Intrant, &amp; the other an old poſſeſſor ſtrongly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified: they enter an inteſtine war with as great hoſtility, as is betwixt <hi>Michael</hi> and the Dragon: Where the new man endures daily incurſions by the violence and ſubtile wranglings of the adverſary, the advantage of the one proving the prejudice of the other: Which conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continued in the Beliver, there is prepared for beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the old works of the Devil, and purging out the pollutions of the fleſh, potions and antidots anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to all the poyſon vented upon our nature by the old ſerpent, and whereby we are naturally infected, untill the vice, vanity and villany of the firſt generation be fully mortified, and the work of grace, vertue and verity be implanted, and promoved unto maturity and perfection: And in the evidence whereof the ſoul is inwardly overjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under all the outward and temporary annoyances that ſhe ſuffers, humbly ſubmitting unto all ſuch diſpenſations, finding them prove her ſenſible advantages, and the means of her advancement unto preſent growth in Grace, and hope of glory. But this being the ſecret work of God in His own Children, unſeen and not diſcernable by the carnall man, in whoſe eyes they be but abject and deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons who can pretend ſuch principles, or preſume upon ſo unſenſible grounds, not able to conceive, far leſſe to give credit that ſuch daily ſeen and ſad ſufferings, as the Believer is ſubject unto, could produce ſuch ſweet

man, that he cannot conceive, nor will he be taught to underſtand, that there is any more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent happineſſe attainable, than that whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they have attained, or may naturally come by: Whereas the Believer, after many calls, wakenings, warnings, purpoſes, promiſes, ſhifts and debates, being, in the peremptory time of Gods appointment, (the time of love) effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wrought upon, by the Spirit, and word of grace and truth, unto a gracious wakning, quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened and illuminate to ſee themſelves under darkneſſe, and ſpiritually dead without God in the world, and poſting on in the way of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and ſo deſervedly, wondring that he is not long ago ſwallowed up in the gulf of irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable wrath; Seeing alſo the Vail rent, and the entry made by the New and Living Way, for a gracious relief: and hereby beholding, as in a glaſſe, the glory of the Lord, is tranſlated from that naturall darkneſſe to his marvelous light; And lanching forth into this Ocean of eternall &amp; unconceivable love, where the deluge of unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ſelf-deſtroying miſery meets with the incomprehenſible deeps of infinite mercy: where plunged as in the extreams of contrary Tides, ſwelling to ſuch heights, being heaved (as it were) to the Region of the Air, and hurled, as if they ſhould be inſtantly ſunk in theſe death-deſtroying

And now reflecting upon the by-paſt and naturall loſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: firſt in the guilt of the moſt baſe and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationall revolt of Originall defection, and then in the ſtain and ſtintleſſe ſuperfluities of naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, daily ſprouting out in actuall provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, grieving Gods Spirit, and now vexing the New Man.</p>
                  <p>Obſerving alſo, and recenting the long-ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring patience, rich mercy, free grace, eternall and unchangeable love that hes followed them in that miſerable condition, melted and made them up in a new mould, ſo as the old things are paſt, and all things are become new to them.</p>

this being the vaſt difference betwixt the man in his naturall eſtate, and in the ſtate of grace, and that no man hes ground of boaſting, of any thing, in themſelves more then another, and that there is no warrant to any man to deſpair, but for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, in following the means appointed, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely; And the matter being of greateſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, I have been taking the more particular notice, by way of compariſon, betwixt the firſt and ſecond BIRTH, and growth in a moſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar way, how any under the leaſt degree of grace, may moſt eaſily diſcern what progreſſe they have made: And have annexed hereto the portraict, both of the new and old man, the better to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the affections to the love of the one, and loathing of the other:</p>
                  <p>Not that it is poſſible by any compariſon ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, whether real or ſuppoſed, to decipher the unſearchable myſterious way of the ſpirit in the ſoul of the elect, in the Ordinances of converſion, or that either Ordinances or inſtruments can make effectuall the work of God, begetting and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the new creature unto life, without the enliving power of the ſpirit, of the new life, in the Ordinances: Nevertheleſs, ſeeing the Lord hes appointed, and bleſſed means, wherein he will ſhine, and whereby he diſpenſeth His grace; very reaſon is convinc'd that the means are to be followed.</p>

And in the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate part, what a filthy fume flows daily out of that ſtinking pudle, where the dregs and ſpawn of all the devilry of hell is engroſſed: and but in part purged, or rather born down and kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from out-breaking in palpable enormities: And yet the Devil knows well what coal to blow at, and how to quicken more damnable and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Vipers, to ſuck out our ſpirituall life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unſeen or adverted unto, as, ſpirituall pride, carnall ſecurity under the exerciſe of our beſt actions, taking growth with our gifts: whereby Gods Spirit is grieved, deſertion procured, croſſes, afflictions and corrections inflicted, for humbling, reclaiming, keeping under, and in order, the light and facile heart, which would miſcarry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ruine, if not prevented. But, for this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of ſelf-deceiving deceit, and deſperate wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of the heart, the many inventions it finds out (being prompted thereunto by the old Serpent) to undo it ſelf: and how far the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of this corruption may prevail, even in the Regenerate, it is better ſeen then guarded againſt by too many, as much fearfull and bitter experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence can witneſſe.</p>

                     <p>But naturally every man being ſo conceited of himſelf, ſcarce any man will believe, that ſuch things, as both Scripture and experience make clear to be in the heart of man, can be in his heart, but will be ready to ſay, <hi>Am I a dog, that I ſhould be tempted to do ſuch things?</hi> Till under the triall we become taught, by wofull proof, the folly of our faithleſneſſe in our defections.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:54864:28"/>
as the ſubtile ſerpent can well inſinuate: It might be too juſtly feared that he ſhould be in ſo great perill as ever our firſt Parents were in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice, ſo as to conceive a poſſibility of ſtanding, but by immediate grace ſuſtaining, it were moſt palpable preſumption: and that the only way to preſerve and increaſe grace, is by converſing in Heaven, keeping a Communion with God, and the frequent uſe of Ordinances, to lead us out of our ſelves, unto a ſincere dependence upon God, and out of the world, ſo as to uſe it, as if we uſed it not, in a humble and chearfull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion unto all His gracious diſpenſations, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bitter or ſweet to the naturall part; which (I ſuppoſe) very hardly any man who is too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in the things of the world, and active a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them (further then a preſſing calling calls him to) can attain: the world being but the Pandor, or Cater to furniſh fewell for the Old Man, to feed the affections, and inflame the fiery luſts of the fleſh, the eye, and the pride of life: But it is poſſible with God to carry the cable through the eye of the needle, ſuppoſe the ſtrait way muſt be thruſt through, and the kingdome of grace and of glory taken with violence.</p>

                  <p n="10">10. The Believer knows by woefull proof, what it is to be ſpiritually dead, by the dead works wherein they have walked, before they knew themſelves under darkneſſe.</p>

                  <p n="12">12. As to the diſſolution of the body, albeit it be a beginning of the ſecond death to the wicked, as it is a preparation to the ſecond reſurrection of

the Godly, whoſe ſouls are then feaſting upon their Saviour His Face in Paradice: It may be more properly named a Sleep, as it is often in Scripture, eſpecially, ſeeing the ſoul hes had her night of partiall ſeparation in the body, ſuppoſe but ſhort in compariſon of time, yet under many ſufferings; whereas the bodies night in its element is free of trouble: and for the length of time, it is to reſt there under darkneſſe: It is not conſiderable, in reſpect of the ſplendor of that day of eternal glory which is at the out-breaking. And ſeeing it is with this temporall death of the bodie that the Believer hes only adoe, let us look a little more particularly upon it, and ſpecially as it concerns the Believer. It is appointed for all men to die, naturall death being the ſeparation of the ſoul from the body, is rightly named unto mere naturall man, the King of terrours: A metaphor from a King or Tyrant, who is unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable for power, unſatiable and unexorable for cruelty, undefatigable for perſiſtence, furniſht with all manner of forces, for execution, in all places, at all times, through all the Continent, where any of the ſons of men takes life: atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them conſtantly, till every one of them fall under the fatall and finall ſtroak. And there is nothing created in this Univerſe, whether from within us, or from without us, from the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt

remote of the Stars, to the leaſt pile of graſſe or pickle of duſt, which were all created for our good, but hath been, or may be the occaſion of this diſſolution. As alſo, by what means amongſt ſo many, and at what time, ſo uncertain unto any, that it is a wonder that the rationall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who knows themſelves ſubject to it, can think of it without terrour: and moſt terrible, that the moſt of men are over-turned before they think ſeriouſly of it: But here appears the greateſt wonder that ever any (of the blind-born, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly forſaken, and ſelf-loſt generation of apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate man) ſhould come to know any more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of then any other: but this being the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the regenerate by grace, to ſee themſelves by nature loſt, and ſaved by the Lord; This death is nothing terrible nor troubleſome to them, but pleaſant and comfortable, in what colours, by what knife, at what time, or in what place they commit their ſouls to the Father of ſpirits, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render their bodies to the Elements, whereof they were, and are to be preſerved unto the day that all things be reſtored; for they ſee and know that this diſſolution of the body is but the laying off, or ſuffering the old ſpotted and defiled garments to be rent from us till they be refined: and not that we may be uncloathed, but cloathed upon with glory and immortality, untill we receive

again theſe naturall, mortall, corruptible bodies, immortall, incorruptible receptacles, habilitate and fitted to imbrace and enjoy without interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption the glory that a glorified ſoul is admitted unto: So that unto the Believer, this naturall death is ſwallowed up of life, being no more death unto them then the pinching of the body of the Infant in coming through theſe ſtraits of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Child-birth, ſhould be to the Child, if it were capacitate to know the preſent caſe and place of its impriſonment, and the light and liberty it were to come to.</p>
                  <p>But here nature, even pure nature, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome moſt ſenſible and ſearching tryals for impugning my arguments and reſolutions, viz. <hi>Seeing this World was created for me, and I created immortall without ſeparation by death, if I had ſtood in my integrity, then ſhould I never have had any further deſire but of things preſent.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For anſwer:</hi> Let the ſuppoſition be ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with all the Arguments that may warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be alledged, they cannot weaken the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Believer, nor ballance his diſpoſition of

                  <p>Hereby the Believer, according to the growth of his faith and affection, is looking and longing for that day, when he may take poſſeſſion in that <hi>houſe, which is from heaven, and is eternall in heaven.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Shall the pangs of death reſtrain our deſires, or abate our reſolutions, in making through that ſtrait entry, unto ſuch certain and eternall feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities?</p>
                  <p>Would the Child in the mothers womb (if it were capable of ſenſe and reaſon) make choiſe to remain everlaſtingly in that dark Cell, rather then to hazard upon what pains there may be in preſſing out unto the light?</p>
                  <p>Would not the Priſoner, fettered in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and there held under moſt cruell ſlavery (if he ſhould be called out of that bondage) not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto liberty, but alſo, in ſtead of his rags, Princely Robes preſented to him: and of bands, the enjoyments of all deſirable delights that the moſt flouriſhing Nation under the Sun could render, crowned with many dayes and years in the ſociety of Princes and all Princely pleaſures: would not the change be moſt joyfully imbraced by any that were not more then brutiſh? Now then, how far above compariſon is this change, that the believing Chriſtian is called unto, from ſo many ſorrows and ſufferings as our ſin hath
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54864:113"/>
brought, and keeps us under, while we are in the body, unto a Crown of glory and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to be cloathed upon with the Robes of our Redeemer his Righteouſneſſe, and feaſted with the joyes that flouriſh in the Face of our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: being the fruits of that Land, where there is no leſſe then everlaſting life, light, love, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, reſulting in ſuperexcellent hymns and ſongs of eternall praiſe, in exalting the King and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of Saints?</p>
                  <p>Is it not from the weakneſſe of our faith, and not keeping our ſpirituall ſenſes in action, but ſluggiſhly ſuffering our affections to frieze: that we are not ſtill attending when we ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to come out of the body, to enjoy this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atitude?</p>
                  <p>And why ſhould we be ſo anxious of the maner, time or place of laying down our old cloaths? It becomes us well to intruſt all to Him, of whom we are, and for whom we are, without whom nothing can befall us: who is goodneſſe it ſelf, and of whom we had ſuch reall proof, that He makes <hi>all things work together for our good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſhall we diſtruſt Him for our Conduct through death unto that Life and Kingdom that He hath purchaſt for us at ſo dear a price? Or ſhall we not rather deſire to endure what we can

be able, for him, and to be with him who hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured for us ſo much, to have us with him, from under the power, and out of the reach of the ſting of death: which is now a vanquiſhed enemy, and not to be feared: but become a friend, to be eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially loved. And albeit the carnal part would keep us in exerciſe, under the apprehenſion of a ſwift and ſudden death, which were dreadfull: is not the ſpiritual part to be the more ſtudious <hi>to make our calling and election ſure</hi>: and to be the more vigilant, with the wiſe Virgins, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Bride-groom. And if a lingring diſeaſe be apprehended, it may prove a precious time for better preparation. If violent, and extreamly painfull, it is the more ſpeedily paſt; If inflicted by the Perſecutor of the Profeſſion, in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever maner, then it is accompanied with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of bleſſedneſſe: for <hi>the Spirit of God, and of glory, reſts upon you:</hi> and, <hi>great is their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in heaven who ſuffer for righteouſneſſe.</hi> And if by (that which the natural man calls) accident: ſeeing all things, in his eyes, <hi>fall out alike to the good and to the evil:</hi> Yet the Believer knows, that nothing falls out but by a well-ordered pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; <hi>not ſo much as a hair of their head,</hi> to their hurt, much leſſe ſhall they be forſaken, when they have moſt ado with preſent and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſupplie.</p>

                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:54864:114"/>And whereas ſome of Gods Children, who have been of a long continuance in the Profeſſion, ſingular in their converſation, and zealous in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, have been at a very low ebb, for mater of comfort, in the time of their departure. And others alſo kept under much wreſtling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, when as ſome, of leſſe note and eſteem, have had all their ſails filled with the ſenſe of that ſoul-ſaving ſweetneſſe that meets them from the Mediator, at the time of their removall.</p>
                  <p>As alſo, ſome very weak men have been won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully born out, under moſt fearfull torments inflicted upon them by the Perſecuter: and others of far greater expectation have fainted and fallen off, when the peril appeared: and yet have been reclaimed by repentance, and found mercy.</p>
                  <p>Some alſo we ſee, that have lived very civilly all their dayes, have died under much darkneſſe, and without any ſigns of a gracious wakening: while as others, that have been moſt abominable in their lives, have made a glorious end.</p>
                  <p>And now, in contemplation of all theſe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpenſations, may we not, and muſt we not ſee, and adore the glory of the Lord, both in Soveraignty and Wiſdom?

of their inward and ſpirituall conſolation? And the beholders, that are as yet making on to the way, helped unto incouragement and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>THe Reſurrection of the body, and the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Judgement, is univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54864:119"/>
where Chriſtianity is known, except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the brutiſhly ignorant, or the profeſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt. But if it were ſo known and believed, as it is condeſcended unto, it would put Believers to a more ſerious ſtudy to try their condition, then they be at as yet; for, who could indure to know believingly, that, living and dying in their naturall eſtate, (without the interpoſition of a Mediator, and Saviour for their reſtauration) they being raiſed up to join with their ſoul again, ſhould then be caſt down in utter darkneſſe final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and rejected of God totally, deprived of all further expectation of grace: the gnawing worm of conſcience wakened, the wrath of a ſin-reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging God upon the guilty perſon, where, in theſe everlaſting burnings, amongſt innumerable legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of devils, and numberleſs multitudes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned men, they be to indure eternal torment: Can it be imagined (ſay I) that any perſon, ſo believing, and that there were a poſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, could be in reſt, untill they had (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their utmoſt endeavour) uſed all imaginable means: not thinking any pains too great, if it were in compaſſing the Continent and the coaſts of the ſea, for timous relief.</p>
                  <p>If we, ſeeing one of our neighbours in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of a Gout, a Gravel-ſtone or Gangren: And that we were certainly perſwaded, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54864:120"/>
ſuch a ſhort ſpace we ſhould be in the very like condition, unleſſe we did apply our ſelves to ſuch a Perſon, who could aſſuredly prevent this ſo fearfull, terrible and horrible torment: would there be any delay made, or difficulty impede us in our journey, for finding out the Phyſitian? Much more, if he were at hand, making offer of our relief, and the removall of all our fears, could we make the refuſall?</p>
                  <p>Again, Is it not evident, that the moſt part of men do intangle themſelves in moſt dangerous travels and troubles, for gaining of a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain treaſure, pleaſure or preferment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto few attain? And where attained, is paſt before it be well poſſeſt.</p>
                  <p>Is it poſſible then, that if the Reſurrection of the body, and the General Judgment were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and the bleſſed condition of thoſe that have accepted of the offer of grace in time: and the utter ruine and eternall perdition of all ſuch as have contemned this <hi>Great-ſalvation,</hi> to ſieze upon them, in that day when <hi>they ſhall call to the mountains to fall upon them, and cover them from that fierce wrath,</hi> which undoubtedly they muſt underly for evermore? No certainly, it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther probable nor poſſible, but, if theſe Truths were believed, there would be little reſt amongſt the Believers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> untill they attained to that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54864:120"/>
of relief that might give them ſolide reſt: And yet every man is ſo convinced, that none (that is worthy to have the name of a man) dar be ſo ſhamleſſe as to deny ſuch unqueſtionable truths: ſeeing, that thereby, they ſhould be found to deny the Scriptures of God, dyted by His own Spirit, and the power of God, ſeen in the creation, and conſervation of all things, the Son of God and the Saviour of the World, who in our own fleſh hath died and riſen again; who hath teſtified all theſe truths, and recorded them in His Teſtament to us, according as He had Himſelf experimentally tryed the unutterable joyes of the one, and the unſuperable dolors of the other to have been wreſtled with, ſuſtained and fred of; but by Himſelf alone, who was God to ſuſtain, as He was man to ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>And yet for all this conviction and formall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, what is the greateſt part of all ranks do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but deceiving themſelves, ſatisfied with a brain-light, without any heart-change; a lip-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, without any life-reformation? So rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonleſſe is the rationall creature become, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Him reaſonable ſervice, who is the Author of their reaſon in believing Him, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves with Him for their good. But to proceed: According to the difference betwixt the Believer and the unbeliever in life and death,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54864:121"/>
ſo is it after death when the Righteous Judge of all men ſhall give the finall ſentence: Then ſhall the carnall man, who refuſed that great Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is now obtained by believing in the only Son of God, for the remiſſion of ſin, being laid down in the grave, bathed in the abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of His apoſtaſie, and impenitencie, be raiſed up again at the Latter-day, ſoul and body joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to receive the irrecoverable ſentence of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall condemnation, and rejection from the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence of God, unto the place appointed for them: And for the further manifeſtation hereof, the Lord hath been pleaſed to ſuffer ſome, being ſpiritually dead, and refuſing to come to the Phyſitian of ſouls for life: and being thereby ſelf-condemned, to ly under deſperation and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of conſcience, even in this life: So that both word and example may joyn to the convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſuch as will not be converted.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the true Believer, who in their life had been dying unto ſin, and attained unto the firſt Reſurrection in living unto righteouſneſſe, laid down the body under hope, ſhal at the ſecond Reſurrection, both ſoul and body being joyned again in that ſpiritual and incorruptible conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, agreeable unto immortality, lift up the head with joy in coming before the Judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> knowing that all judgment is committed to the Son of God,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54864:121"/>
who is their Kinſ-man, Mediator and Redeemer, who knows well for whoſe tranſgreſſions He hes made Himſelf an offering, for ſatisfying the juſtice of God, that He may ſee His ſeed, the travell of His Soul, and be ſatisfied: That the pleaſure of the Lord, in juſtifying many, does proſper in His Hand, and in congregating, and uniting to Himſelf, who is the glorious Head, and making up all the Members in one Body, to become the fulneſſe of Him who fills all in all, that the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-day may be ſolemnized, and the marriage ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompliſhed before God and all the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy of Angels, Arch-Angels, Throns, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, Powers, Seraphims and Cherubins, with Hoſannas and Hallelujahs, ſhouting for joy and ſympathiſing in all cordiall harmony, the praiſes of their King, the Author and Finiſher of their Salvation, with ſongs ſutable and acceptable to that all-glorious Auditory, and the glorified aſſociats and aſſiſtants in that unlimited circumference, whereof the All-bleſſed and infinite Eſſence of God is the incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Center, and that from minutly renewed and revealed matter, without intermiſſion for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
                  <p>And for the further eſtabliſhment of which truth, ſome of Gods Children, even in this life, have attained the fore-taſtes of the firſt Fruits of theſe

eternall Conſolations, that they are to feaſt upon after this life everlaſtingly.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing it is ſo, and known to be ſo by the Believer, where ſhould the furtheſt extent of his deepeſt apprehenſions and greateſt fervencie of his affections be fixed, but upon Him alone, by whom he ſhall injoy all this bleſſe, ſalvation and conſolation.</p>
                  <p>And to this end, that as they know, they may commend, and as they prove, they may love and praiſe Him, according as they can attain to ſee and conceive Him, by the mirror wherein He ſhines, making Himſelf and His excellencies the matter of our ſongs, in the houſe of our pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, untill we come up to ſee Him as He is, and enjoy Him in the fulneſſe of that bleſſe, by the earneſt whereof we are ſuſtained under Hope.</p>
                  <p>And for this end, let our ſtudy be to take Him up more particularly.</p>
