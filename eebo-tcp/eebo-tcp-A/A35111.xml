            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SIR, the kindneſſe offered to the Miniſters with you, was done with inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitie, thinking it might have met with the like; but I am ſatisfied to tell thoſe with you, That if their Maſters ſervice (as they call it) were chiefly in their eye, imagination of ſuffering would not have cauſed ſuch a return, much leſſe the practice by our Party (as they are pleaſed to ſay) upon the Miniſters of Chriſt in <hi>England,</hi> have been an argument of Perſonall perſecution. The Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> are ſupported, and have liberty to preach the Goſpel, though not to rail, nor under pretence thereof to overtop the Civill Power, or debaſe it as they pleaſe. No man hath been troubled in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> for preaching the Goſpel, nor has any Miniſter been moleſted in <hi>Scotland</hi> ſince the comming of the Army hither: the ſpeaking the Truth becomes the Miniſters of

Chriſt, when Miniſters pretend to a glorious Reformation, and lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof in getting to themſelves worldly Power, and can make worldly mixtures to accompliſh the ſame, ſuch as their late agreement with their King, and hopes by him to carry on their Deſign, may know, that the Sion promiſed and hoped for, will not be built with ſuch untempered Morter; As for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Invaſion they mention, time was when an Army of <hi>Scotland</hi> came into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> not called by the Supream Authoritie. We have ſaid in our Papers with what hearts, and upon what accompt we came, and the Lord hath heard us, though you would not, upon as ſolemn an Appeal as any experience can paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell. And although they ſeem to comfort themſelves with being the ſonnes of <hi>Jacob,</hi> from whom (they ſay) God hath hid his face for a time, yet its no wonder when the Lord hath lifted up his hand ſo eminently againſt a Family, as he hath done ſo often againſt this, and men will not ſee his hand: if the Lord hide his face from ſuch, putting them to ſhame, both for it, and their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred at his People, as it is this day.

            </head>
            <p>MY Lord yours I have communicated to theſe with me whom it concerned, who deſire me to return this anſwer, That their ingenuity in proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ends of the Covenant, according to their vocation and place, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to their firſt Principles, is well known; and one of their greateſt regreats is, that they have not been met with the like: when Miniſters of the Goſpel have been impriſoned, deprived of their Benefices, ſequeſtrate, forced to flee from their dwellings, and bitterly threatned for their faithfull declaring the Will of God againſt the godleſſe, and wicked proceedings of men, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accounted an imaginary fear of ſuffering in ſuch as are reſolved to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the like freedom and faithfulneſſe, in diſcharge of their Maſters Meſſage: That it ſavours not of ingenuitie to promiſe libertie of preaching the Goſpel, and to limit the Preachers thereof, that they muſt not ſpeak againſt the ſinnes and enormities of Civill Powers, ſince their Commiſſion carryeth them to ſpeak the Word of the Lord unto, and to reprove the ſinnes of Perſons of all ranks, from the higheſt to the loweſt: That to impoſe the name of railing upon ſuch
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41420:3"/>
faithfull freedom, was the old practice of Malignants againſt the Miniſters of the Goſpel, who laid open to people the wickedneſſe of their wayes, that they ſhould not be inſnared thereby: That their conſciences bear them record, and all their hearers do know, that they meddle not with Civill affairs further then to hold forth the rule of Gods Word, by which the ſtraightnes and crookednes of mens actions are made evident. But they are ſorry that they have juſt cauſe to regreat, that men of meer Civill place and employment, ſhould uſurpe the Calling and Employment of the Miniſtery, to the ſcandall of the Reformed Kirks, and particularly in <hi>Scotland,</hi> contrary to the Government and Diſcipline therein eſtabliſhed; to the maintenance whereof you are bound by the Solemn League and Covenant. Thus farre they have thought fit to vindicate the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the offer in Col. <hi>Whalleys</hi> latter letter.

            <p>SIR, Becauſe I am at reaſonable good leaſure, I cannot let ſuch a groſſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and inconſequentiall reaſonings paſſe, without ſome notice taken of them. And firſt their Ingenuity in relation to the Covenant, for which they commend themſelves, doth no more juſtifie their want of ingenuitie in anſwer to Col. <hi>Whaleys</hi> Chriſtian offer, concerning which my letter charged them with guiltineſſe, deficiencie, then their bearing witneſſe to themſelves of their adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their firſt Principles &amp; ingenuity in proſecuting the ends of the Covenant, juſtifies them ſo to have done, meerly becauſe they ſay ſo. They muſt give more leave henceforwards, for Chriſt will have it ſo, will they nill they, and they muſt have patience to have the truth of their doctrines and ſayings tryed by the ſure touchſtone of the word of Gods and if there be a liberty and duty of tryall, there is a liberty of judgment alſo, for them that may and ought to try<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which if ſo, they muſt give others leave to ſay and think, that they can appeale to equal judges, who have been the trueſt fulfillers of the moſt reall and equitable ends of the Covenant; but if theſe Gentlemen which do aſſume to themſelves to be the infallible expoſitors of the Covenant, as they do too much to their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of the Scriptures, counting a different ſenſe and judgment from theirs breach of Covenant &amp; Hereſie; no marvel they judge of others ſo authoritatively and ſeverely: but we have not ſo learned Chriſt. We look at Miniſters as helper
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41420:3"/>
of, not Lords over the faith of Gods people. I appeal to their conſciences, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any trying their doctrines and diſſenting, ſhall not incurre the cenſure of Sectary, and what is this but to deny Chriſtians their liberty, and aſſume the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Chair? What doth he, whom we would not be likened unto, do more then this? In the ſecond place it is affirmed that the miniſters of the Goſpel have been impriſoned, deprived of their Benefices, ſequeſtred, forced to flie from their dwellings, and bitterly threatned for their faithfull declaring the will of God, &amp;c. And that they have been limited that they might not ſpeak againſt the ſins &amp; enormities of the Civill powers, that to impoſe the name of rayling upon ſuch faithfull freedome, was the old practice of malignants againſt the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Goſpel, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If the Civill authority, or that part of it, which continued faithfull to their truſt, true to the ends of the Covenant, did in anſwer to their conſciences turne out a Tyrant in a way which the Chriſtians in after times will mention with honour, and all Tyrants in the world look at with feare, and many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Saints in <hi>England</hi> rejoyce to think of it, and have received from the hand of God a liberty from the fear of like uſurpations, and have caſt off him, who trod in his Fathers ſteps, doing miſchiefe as farre as he was able, whom you have received like fire into your boſome, of which God will I truſt in time make you ſenſible; if Miniſters rayling at the Civill Power, calling them murtherers, and the like, for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doing this, have been dealt with as you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; will this be found a perſonall perſecution? or is ſin ſo becauſe they ſay ſo? They that acted this great buſineſſe, have given a reaſon of their faith in this action, &amp; ſome here are further ready to do it againſt all gainſayers. But it will be found that theſe reprovers do not only make themſelves the Judges and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miners of ſin, that ſo they may reprove; but they alſo took liberty to ſtirr up the people to blood and armes, and would have brought a Warre upon <hi>England,</hi> as hath been upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> had not God prevented it; and if ſuch ſeverity as hath been expreſſed towards them be worthy the name of perſonall perſecution, let all unintereſted men judge, whether the calling of this practice, rayling, be to be paralleld with the Malignants imputation upon the Miniſters, for ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Popiſh Innovations in the Prelates times, and the Tyrannicall &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked practice then on foot, let your own conſciences minde you. The Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours in Chriſts and his Apoſtles times were uſurpers and intruders upon the Jewiſh State, yet what foot-ſtep have ye either of our bleſſed Saviours ſo much as willingneſſe to the dividing of an inheritance, or their medling in that kind; This was not practiced by the Church ſince our Saviours time, till Antichriſt aſſuming the infallible Chair, and all that he called the Church to be under him, practiſed this authoritatively over civill Governours.</p>

            <p>Are you troubled that Chriſt is preached? Is preaching ſo incluſive in your function? Doth it ſcandalize the reformed Kirks, and <hi>Scotland</hi> in particular? Is it againſt the Covenant? Away with the Covenant if this be ſo; I thought the Covenant and theſe could have been willing that any ſhould ſpeak good of the name of Chriſt; if not it is no Covenant of Gods approving, nor the Kirks you mention, in ſo much the ſpouſe of Chriſt. Where do you find in the Scripture a ground to warrant ſuch an aſſertion, That preaching is included in your function, though an approbation from men hath order in it, and may do well, yet he that hath not a better warrant then that, hath none at all. I hope he that aſcended up on high may give his gifts to whom he pleaſe, and if thoſe gifts be the Seale of miſſion, be not envious though <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, you know who bids us cover earneſtly the beſt gifts, but chiefly that we may propheſie, which the Apoſtle explains there to be a ſpeaking to inſtruction, and edification and comfort, which the inſtructed, edified, and comſorted, can beſt tell the Energie and effect of; if ſuch evidence be, I ſay again ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
