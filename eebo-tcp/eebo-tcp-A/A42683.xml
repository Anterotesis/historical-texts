         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OR,
The Author of the Diſ-ingenuous

Brought to the Whipping-Poſt, to prevent his coming

            <opener>
               <salute>Mr. <hi>Care</hi> (not <hi>Carre,</hi> it ſeems)</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Think I had great Reaſon to take Notice of it, to be ſo abuſed in Print as I was, by the
Author of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Packet, whom I had never irritated. But be the Author who he will,
you have abuſed me worſe than he, diſ-ingenuouſly to Expoſe my Letter in Print, and not
have given me a Civil Account of my miſ-information, which had made me your Debtor,
and which you might have done by any of thoſe you call <hi>Small Intelligencers</hi> (of whom anon)
any, I ſay, which had lived neareſt you (as for my ſelf I Live out of Town, further than I
thought you were willing to come.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, the Aſſe, you know, having put on the Lions Skin, was acknowledged by his
Ears; and your Style betrays your Guilt to every one, as <hi>Peter</hi>'s Voice diſcovered him to the
Maid: I'le aſſure you I can bring the Perſon that aſſured me you are the Author. But that you
are a Pamphleteer, your Title bewrays you; (<hi>A Touch of the Times</hi>) had you not had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
Scabby Genius that way, you could not have hit on't: And beſides, the Gentleman that
gave me firſt Notice of it, uttered this, <hi>The Fellow, I warrant you, had an Angel for doing
on't,</hi> the Letter has been kind to him: I'le aſſure you, Sir, he was one of His Majeſties Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
at Arms, and alſo other ways well Qualified.</p>
            <p>Sir, the Second part of the Title hints to me, that your Wit was at that time intercepted,
for where's any interception of a Letter? when 'tis plainly down-right Directed, and he to
whom 'twas ſent, confeſſes he Received it <hi>September</hi> 16. the ſame day 'twas left—You blame
me for good Husbandry, and flout me for bringing the Letter my ſelf: The Truth is, I ſent
it by a Friend to the Queens Head Tavern, but they told him you had left the Houſe, but Lived
in ſuch a place: He was loath to go out of his way, ſo I went my ſelf, and did indeed deliver
it at your Being, Scituate in a little <hi>Ruelle (pas plus grande que celle du lict</hi>) and no ways agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Greatneſs of your Mind and Spirit, that will not brook or digeſt the Pope; nay, a
Man ſo Excellently Qualified, that through all <hi>England</hi> none ſo fit to Diſcover the Cheats and
Legerdemains of the Man of Sin; nay that for many Moneths hath laid Siege to his City, and
no doubt in the end will Ruine his Government. <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Fly is now upon the Wheel with his
<hi>Quantam vim pulveris excito.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Care,</hi> 'tis good to have a care of the Main Chance; and Frugality is a Virtue approvable
and laudable in a King (if you will believe <hi>Tully</hi> in his Orations, <hi>Pro Rege Deiotaro</hi>) and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly
ſcoffed at by you, that have lately left the Tavern, and ſneak into an Ale-houſe.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, if the Deniers will hold out, drink Wine ſtill, to Refreſh the Pamphletick Facu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ty,
the Poet tells you,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Nulla placere diù neque vivere Pamphleta poſſunt,</l>
               <l>Quae Scribuntur aquae potoribus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>Why talk I of <hi>Deniers</hi> holding out, when as the <hi>peccant Preſs</hi> (for the moſt part) En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
the Caitiff Pamphleteer with the Juice of the Grape at the foreſaid Tavern, Omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly
Seated a little without <hi>Newgate,</hi> even in the very way of Death, by which the Seditious
Dolorouſly, but deſervedly, paſſed to the <hi>Trinacrian</hi> Tree.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Pettifogger,</hi> for Trades ſake, be not Angry with <hi>Pamphleta,</hi> being <hi>Ignoramus</hi> his Latine.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Wizzardiſme</hi> tells me not what three Caps a piece is, ſurely ſome <hi>Cerberus,</hi> or <hi>Aſinine</hi> (not
<hi>Cabaliſtical</hi>) Triumvirate.</p>
            <p>Sir, it cannot be, but you muſt needs be a Pamphleteer, and Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> (during his
Reign, as you call it) I doubt me, would not permit your <hi>Quiſquiliae</hi> to paſs abroad, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you are Angry with him too: He Reigned well and wiſely, and had not his Reign been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
your Letter, beginning <hi>Moſt Illuſtrious,</hi> and pour Terrible prefixt to <hi>Reges ac ipſis
ortos,</hi> &amp;c. had not bewrayed your Anti-monarchical, Anti-ducal, Fanatical Spirit, by giving
Scommatical Epithets.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:47408:2"/>
Sir, becauſe I ſay moſt-Juſt things of his moſt Royal H. (and quote others that alſo do) and
Affirm, he ſhall yet be other ways <hi>Moſt Illuſtrious,</hi> you give that Title to me—You caſt Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Bread to Dogs—Remember <hi>Collingborne,</hi> (2 <hi>Richard</hi> III.) whoſe Diſtick was a good
piece of alluſive wit, in reſpect of King <hi>Richard</hi>'s Badge, which was the Porc-Sanglier, or
Wild Boar (as <hi>R. Brook</hi> and others Affirm) yet the Compoſer died under the Umbrage.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Of the Mortiferous Gallow-Tree,</l>
               <l>Which you deſerve far more than he.</l>
            </q>
            <q>
               <l>Juſtà mente <hi>Cares,</hi> non Juſtâ fune <hi>Carebis,</hi>

               <l>Objicere injuſtè qui ſcommata Regibus anſus.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Sir, <hi>Erra Pater</hi> is a Book I am too Old to Read now; you may call him <hi>Errans Pater</hi> if you
pleaſe: But give me leave to tell you, The Obſerver of <hi>Childermas-day</hi> (that you ſpeak of
with ſo much ſcorn) though you think him not ſo wiſe as your ſelf, yet he was a King (<hi>Reges
Reverentèr habe</hi>) and not the verieſt Benoict of his Age.</p>
            <p>If you are not the Author of the Packet, you may (for ought I know) not be ſo knowing
as he: Therefore, not to trouble you with <hi>Platina</hi>'s <hi>Latine,</hi> I refer you to the Meditations of
<hi>Camerarius</hi> in <hi>Engliſh</hi> (p. 246.) He tells you, Popes are not Immortal, and can die broken-hearted,
and inſtances <hi>John</hi> 24.</p>
            <p>You have a very unkind Expreſſion (Mr. <hi>Care</hi>) as I hinted before: You cannot cordially
brook the Popes Subjects as ſuch—<hi>Jove</hi> be Merciful to the poor Souls of <hi>Campania di Roma,
Patrimonio di Santo pedro; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbria, Ancona,</hi> and other Provinces, over whom the Pope is Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Prince: why, alas, alack a-day, Mr. <hi>Care</hi> hath left them to themſelves, he diſowns them
quite; and no doubt hath thereby given his Holineſs a deadly <hi>Creve-coeur. Haeret lateri laethalis
Arundo,</hi> he hath prick'd him to the Heart—This Care is an Ominous Name: Care will
kill a Cat—<hi>Cura facit Canos,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Cura animum nunc huc nunc dividit illuc,</l>
               <l>Et rapit in partes varias.</l>
            </q>
            <p>VVhen the Pope hears of your Unkindneſs, He will be at his wits end; he will not know
which way in the VVorld to turn himſelf, and all long of <hi>Care—O Curas hominum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I Omitted one thing (which ſhould have come in before) you are pleaſed to mention the
breaking of an Act of Parliament; there was no need of that, nor intended any ſuch thing: I
tell you, I offered it, <hi>Gratis,</hi> to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Mr. <hi>S.</hi> and Mr. <hi>F.</hi> (the Intelligencers, as you call them)
and to others: They were to get it Licenſed, but they would not run the hazard, doubting the
event, it being a difficult time, ſuch as we read of, <hi>Judges</hi> 9. a ſtrange kind of Spirit Operated
in the mind of moſt Men with a vehemence againſt his R. H. rejoycing at his Receſs, wiſhing
he might never Return; nay, I have heard very many affirm with great Animoſity, that he had
taken his final leave, and that he neither would be permitted, or durſt return any more.

            <p>But again, what can any moderate Man (not Spirited as aforeſaid) ſay againſt the <hi>Fatality?</hi> At
the beginning of it there's Collections out of many worthy Authors (only from them) recited
by me; and at the latter end there is a compoſition of mine own, <hi>Talis Qualis,</hi> part of an Ode
of Sir <hi>Thomas Higgins,</hi> and the Remarkable Predicted Circumſtances concerning the Duke,
Printed with his Effigies, <hi>Anno</hi> 1641. and ſome freaks or Ridiculous flim flams (as you call

            <p>Mr. <hi>Care,</hi> Kings were Terrible in thoſe days (and are ſtill, what ere you think.</p>
            <p>As to Inundation of <hi>Latine,</hi> I know none (nor no body ever Objected that but your Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentinent

Air of Curioſity and Antiquity (and are totally void of Hypocritical Fanaticiſme, Approve
of them.) You love not <hi>Latine,</hi> no more than you do the Popes Subjects <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe of
the Provinces—afore-mentioned (for ſo your Expreſſions ſignifie.) But give me leave to
tell you, Mr. <hi>Chiquaneur a maizon,</hi> (that like a good Husband, had always ſhit at home) that
<hi>Latine</hi> is of ſome Eſteem abroad; and that the Golden Bull enjoyned, That the Sons of the

<hi>Virgils—Haud equidem Invideo,</hi> Engliſhed; In Faith, I envy not thy luck, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You are
pleaſed to tell me, <hi>I Faith</hi> is not ſo <hi>Jantee</hi> in writing, as by word of mouth: I confeſs you
are an Egregious Maſter of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, but not ſo of the <hi>French:</hi> Though I never
drank <hi>French</hi> Wine at the Queens Head (a place heretofore dignified by your Acceſs) yet I
have drank Wine in <hi>France,</hi> and never taſted this word before.</p>
            <p>Sir, I meant nothing of <hi>Al-a-mode de Godfrey</hi> towards your Eminent Active ſelf, only I
hinted ſomething to you, what you might Incur by your bold and ſawcy Temerity—I would
Adviſe you to go to the end of <hi>Coleman-ſtreet</hi> or <hi>Billingſgate,</hi> and other places, and near the
Stocks there, ſtand Hieroglyphic Remarkable Columns, whereupon are Elegantly Carved
the Puniſhments due to your ſeveral Demerits: Me-thinks I ſee you <hi>Care</hi>-fully beholding the
ſame, and eſpecially that of the Diſmal Tripple Tree, and that I hear a Voice as of a Pytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Spirit, ſuſurrouſly uttering, <hi>Son</hi> Care, <hi>have Regard to thy Latter end, and Remember the
Indulgence of the Scarlet Robe, that hath once already unbound you from the Poſt of Correction,
ſparing your Back, and only given your ſcurrilous pen ſuſpenſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, you ſay, you will never Read any more of my Volumns: A Pox take you, why did you
put your ſelf to ſo much unneceſſary trouble about the laſt? Now, Sir, I will promiſe you, and

Laſtly, Sir, you are pleaſed to Name Mr. <hi>Philip Foxcroft</hi> (alias) <hi>Foxall,</hi> to gybe him too:
I'le tell you what he is; he is an Honeſt Man, well Qualified, he doth nothing to deny, or be
aſhamed of: He was not Born in <hi>England,</hi> but ſpeaks as good <hi>Engliſh</hi> as you or I: His Native
Tongue is <hi>French,</hi> and he is a very good <hi>Latiniſt.</hi> Uſe my Name to him, when ever you are
to Scribble <hi>French,</hi> and he will Inſtruct you how to ſpell: You do ſuppoſe him to be my God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
(here I am to ſeek where the <hi>Sal</hi> is) he is not ſo; but I'le be yours (if you pleaſe)
and I Name my Adopted Son, <hi>Mercurius Ignoramus</hi> (in reſpect of his Calling, and Memorial

quaint way (as he thought) to quip them of St. <hi>Omers</hi> and the Popes Vaſſals (that laugh him
to ſcorn.)</p>
            <p>God-Son, if any thing I have written hath ſtirred up Choler in you, 'tis your own fault, for
you dealt very ingentilely in Publiſhing my Letter, and my Friends Names.</p>
