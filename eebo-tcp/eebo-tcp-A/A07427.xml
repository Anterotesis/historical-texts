            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>For sundry things wherwith my soule was grieued,</l>
               <l>My griefe increased, and grewe more and more:</l>
               <l>I comfort fled, &amp; could not be relieued,</l>
               <l>With heauinesse my heart was so mischieued:</l>
               <l>I loath'd my life, I could not eate nor drinke:</l>
               <l>I might not speake, nor looke to none that liued,</l>
               <l>But mus'd alone, and diuers things did thinke.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This wretched world did so molest my minde,</l>
               <l>I thought vpon this false and Yron age:</l>
               <l>And how our heartes were so to vice inclinde,</l>
               <l>That Sathan séemde most fearfullie to rage,</l>
               <l>Nothing on earth my sorrow could asswadge:</l>
               <l>I felt my sinne most stronglie to increase,</l>
               <l>I grieued the Spirit, that wont to be my pledge,</l>
               <l>My soule was plung'd into most déepe distresse.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>All merrinesse did aggrauate my paine,</l>
               <l>And earthly ioyes did still increase my woe:</l>
               <l>In companie I could no wise remaine,</l>
               <l>But fled resort, and so alone did goe.</l>

My sillie soule was tossed to and fro</l>
               <l>With sundrie thoughts, which troubled me full sorè:</l>
               <l>I preas'd to pray, but sighes our set me so,</l>
               <l>I could doe nought, but groane, and say no more.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The trickling teares aboundantlie ran downe:</l>
               <l>Mine heart was eas'd when I had mourn'd my fill.</l>
               <l>Then I beganne my Lamentation,</l>
               <l>And said, O Lord, how long is it thy will,</l>
               <l>That thy poore Sainctes shall be afflicted still?</l>
               <l>Alas! How long shall subtile Sathan rage?</l>
               <l>Make haste, O Lord, thy promise to fulfill:</l>

               <l>Thy sillie Sainctes are tossed to and fro:</l>
               <l>Awake, O Lord, why sléepest thou so long?</l>
               <l>We haue no strength against our cruell fo,</l>
               <l>In sighes and sobbes now changed is our song.</l>
               <l>The World preuailes, our enemies are strong.</l>
               <l>The Wicked rage, but we are poore and weake.</l>

               <l>Make short these daies, euen for thy Chosens sake.</l>

               <l>Our loues growes cold, our zeale is worne away:</l>

               <l>Now Uice aboundes, and Charitie growes cold:</l>
               <l>And euen thine owne most stronglie do offend:</l>

               <l>Through great Desarts, throgh water, &amp; throgh fire?</l>

               <l>What sayest thou now? Thy feeble flesh will tire.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Alas, said I, although my flesh be weake,</l>

               <l>O leaue me not, but for thy mercies sake</l>
               <l>Performe thy word, or els for doole I die.</l>
               <l>I feare no paine, since I should walke with thée:</l>

               <l>Through great Desartes we wandred on our way.</l>
               <l>When I was weake, and had no strength to stand,</l>

               <l>Forward wee past, on narrow brigs of trée,</l>
               <l>Ouer waters great, which hiddeoustie did roare.</l>
               <l>There lay below that fearefull was to see,</l>
               <l>Most vglie Beastes, which gaped to deuoure.</l>
               <l>Mine head grew light, and troubled verie sore:</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Wearie I was, and thought to sit at rest:</l>

               <l>Hold on thy course, and thou shalt finde it best,</l>
               <l>If thou destrst to sée that pleasant land.</l>
               <l>Though I was weake, I rose at his command,</l>

               <l>That pleasant place, that seemde to be at hand,</l>

            </lg>

               <l>I looked vp into that Castle faire,</l>

               <l>The statelie Towre did mount aboue the aire:</l>

               <l>Mine heart was glad to sée that joyfull sight.</l>
               <l>My voyage then I thought was not in vaine:</l>
               <l>I him besought to guide me there aright,</l>

               <l>That haue none heart to goe their voyage out.</l>
               <l>Pluck vp thine heart, and gripe me fast about,</l>
               <l>Out through this trance together we must go:</l>
               <l>The way is low, remember for to lout,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>I held him fast, as hée did giue command,</l>
               <l>And through the trance together then wée went:</l>
               <l>Where in the mides great prickes of Yron did stand:</l>

               <l>I answerd not but ranne incontinent</l>
               <l>Out ouer the fire, and so the paine was past.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When this was done, mine heart did dance for joy,</l>
               <l>I was so neare, I thought my voyage ended:</l>
               <l>I ranne before, and sought not his conuoy.</l>
               <l>Nor askt the way, because I thought I knew it.</l>
               <l>On stately stepps, most stoutly I ascended.</l>
               <l>Without his help I thought to enter there.</l>
               <l>Hée followed fast, and was right sore offended,</l>
               <l>And hastily did draw me downe the staire.</l>

               <l>Without mine help thinkest thou to climbe to hie?</l>
               <l>Come downe againe, thou yet must suffer more,</l>

This statelie staire, it was not made for thée:</l>

               <l>Alas, said I, long wandring wearied mée,</l>

               <l>Then he began to comfort me againe,</l>
               <l>And said, My friend, thou must not enter there:</l>
               <l>Lift vp thine heart, thou yet must suffer paine,</l>

               <l>I looked downe, and saw a pit most black,</l>

               <l>Where they affirme, that sillie soules do dwell,</l>
               <l>To purge their sinnes, before they rest in peace.</l>
