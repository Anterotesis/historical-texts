         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

BY THE
TRANSLATOR,
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>FOR the better understanding of
these five Letters, it seems necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in a few words to explain the
Occasion and Subject of them. They
are not, in French, one distinct Volume,
as they are here made in English; but a
part of two larger Volumes written in
an Epistolary Form. The First entituled,
<note n="1" place="margin">Sentiments de quelques The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologiens de Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande sur l' Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie Critique du vieux Testament, Composée par le <hi>P. Richard Simon.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>The Thoughts or Reflections of
some Divines in</hi> Holland, <hi>upon Father</hi>
Simon's <hi>Critical History of the</hi> Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Second,<note n="2" place="margin">Defense des Sentimens, &amp;c. contre la Response du Prieur de <hi>Bolleville.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>A Defence of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63500:3"/>
those Thoughts, in Answer to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
of</hi> Bolleville; who is supposed to be also
the same Mr. <hi>Simon,</hi> disguised under a
borrowed Name.</p>
            <p>The general Design that Mr. <hi>Simon</hi>
drives at in the Critical History of the
<hi>Old Testament,</hi> as well as in that of the
<hi>New</hi> (which are now both of them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
in English) is to represent the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Difficulties that are amongst the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
concerning the Text of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and thereby to infer the necessity
of receiving the Roman Doctrine of <hi>Oral
Tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Design raised him many Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists
amongst the Protestants beyond the
Seas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who have opposed him in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
each according to his different Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
or Principles. The Book first above
mentioned was one of the earliest of that
kind; and it's Anonymous Author appears
second to none, either in Critical Learning,
or Solid Iudgment. But it is not necessary
to my purpose in this place to insist upon his
particular differences with Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> in
Points of Criticism. This only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
is needful to be observed; That
though on the one side he sufficiently o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrows
the pretended necessity of <hi>Oral
Tradition;</hi> and on the other side, inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63500:3"/>
acknowledges all the Difficulties
that are amongst the Learned about the
Text of the Scriptures; yet he does not
thereupon leave the Iudgment of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in suspence about so weighty a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
but propounds a middle way, which
he conceives proper to settle in Mens Minds
a just esteem of the Scriptures, upon a
solid Foundation.</p>
            <p>The Scheme or System of this middle
way, he says, he received from his Friend
Mr. <hi>N.</hi> and therefore he gives it not in his
own, but in his Friend's words. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
in the Eleventh and Twelfth Letters
of his foresaid Book. And because That is
a distinct Subject of it self, and of more
consequence to the generality of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
than those nice Disputes of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism,
with which he is obliged, in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mr. <hi>Simon,</hi> to fill up the rest of that
Volume, I have therefore thought fit to
translate those two Letters into English.
They are the two First of these Five;
and are the Ground and Occasion of the
rest.</p>
            <p>The publishing of that Volume of Letters
produced an Answer from Mr. <hi>Simon,</hi> or
the Prior of <hi>Bolleville,</hi> as he calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and further gave opportunity to the
Author to learn from several hands, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63500:4"/>
was objected most materially by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
against the fore-mentioned Scheme,
which he had published in his Friend's
words. This afforded him occasion, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
to the Prior of <hi>Bolleville,</hi> to insert
a further explanation and defence of that
Scheme, from the hand of the Author;
as also to justifie himself for having pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
it; and in the last place to remove
the great Popular Objection arising from
a Iealousy, lest that System of Mr. <hi>N'</hi>s
should prejudice the Foundation of the
Christian Religion. I say, it prompted
him to answer that Objection, by giving
a solid Demonstration of the Truth of
our Religion, without interessing it in this
Controversy. This is done in the Ninth,
Tenth, and Eleventh Letters of his Second
Book, Entituled, <hi>A Defence,</hi> &amp;c. And
they are the three last of these following
Five.</p>
            <p>I have translated them all, that the
Reader may at once have a full view, both
of Mr. <hi>N'</hi>s Opinions concerning the Holy
Scriptures, in the fore-mentioned System;
of the Objections that have been made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it; of the Answers he gives to
those Objections; and of the Vse that
may be made of all, in setling the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion upon a Basis not to be shaken
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63500:4"/>
by the Difficulties about the Scripture,
which the Learned are forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
to be insuperable.</p>
            <p>This is all that I think needful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
the Reader upon this Subject. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if in the perusal of the two first of these
Letters, any one should be apt to condemn
me for publishing things of this nice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
in our Language, I intreat him
to suspend his Censare, till he have read
the rest; and as he goes along, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
unto me the Author's Apology. Our
Case is the same, and I think, he has
said all that is needful upon it. In a
word, We live in an Age of so much
Light, that it is not only now (as at
all times) unbecoming the Dignity of
such Sacred Truths, as the Christian
Religion teaches us, to build them upon
unsound Principles, or defend them by
Sophistical Arguments; but it is also
vain to attempt it, because impossible to
execute. The Doctrine of Implicit Faith
has lost its Vogue. Every Man will
judg for himself, in matters that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
himself so nearly as these do. And
nothing is now admitted for Truth, that
is not built upon the Foundation of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
Reason. Let not therefore any sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-hearted
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63500:5"/>
pious Persons be scandalized
at these Disquisitions. They are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
for their Vse. But they are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
needful for many others, who are
more Curious, and less Religious. And
that they may be in some measure use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the Propagation and Advancement
of True Religion amongst such, is the
strong Hope, and hearty Desire of the
Translator.</p>

            <head>THE
FIRST LETTER.</head>
            <p>YOU are desirous, Sir, that I
should inform you more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
about the thoughts
of Mr. <hi>N.</hi> concerning the
Inspiration of the <hi>Sacred Writers;</hi> and
you ask me if our Friends do not suspect
him to be tainted with <hi>Deism?</hi> He
that gave me the Essay, which I send
you, told me nothing of his other Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
nor of his Manner of Life: And
for his Thoughts concerning that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Inspiration, which the Sacred Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
received from God, it is conceived
that from thence he cannot be conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be a <hi>Deist.</hi> It is presumed on the
contrary, without entring into the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of what he says, that he
believes by this Method he better an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
the Objections, which the <hi>Deists</hi>
and <hi>Atheists</hi> have used to make against
the Stile of Holy Scriptures: And it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63500:6"/>
appears by this Essay, that he is far
from being of their Opinions.</p>
            <p>We ought not always to measure, or
judg of the extent of any Man's
Thoughts, in reference to Religion, by
the manner of his explaining or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
them; as if all those who do not
defend well their Religion, were Men of
ill Design, that only seemingly defend, in
order to destroy it. 'Tis said that the
impious <hi>Vannini</hi> designed to shew there
is no God, in making as if he would
prove there is one. But it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
from thence, that all others do the
same, who defend, or oppose, weakly
any Opinion. Otherwise we must believe
many Writers both <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi>
who injudiciously oppose the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of their Adversaries, and as ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their own, to be guilty of ill Design.
If a Man would make an exact Catalogue
of all the Catholick Authors, who have
made impertinent Answers to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
and have used as impertinent
Objections against them, it would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to several Volumes in Folio;
and the number of Protestant Authors,
who have succeeded no better, would
be little less. Nevertheless, I do not
believe there is any Body so unjust, as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63500:6"/>
to pretend, That the generality of
those Authors, on both sides, have
been Cheats, who maintained what
they did not Believe, or opposed what
they did.</p>
            <p>You Sir, have too much knowledg
of the Frame and Constitution of Man's
Mind, to be ignorant, that it is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of believing in good earnest the
most ridiculous things in the World;
and, which is yet more astonishing, of
giving its Assent at the same time to
two things directly opposite. If you
should, on purpose, invent the most ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
Religion imaginable, there
would be People found in <hi>Asia,</hi> whose
Opinions would not appear more rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal.
You have read Mr. <hi>Bernier</hi>'s
Travels, and the History of the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins.</hi>
What do you think of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
of the great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Country, and
of those famous <hi>Indian</hi> Philosophers?
Do you think there is none among
them, that believes the monstrous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of their <hi>Theology?</hi> For my part
I am perswaded there are very few that
see the absurdity of it. You will say per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
That those Nations are under a
blindness, which is next to down-right.
Foolishness; and that the <hi>Europeans</hi> are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63500:7"/>
not to be judged of by <hi>Indians.</hi> But are
there not, in your Opinion, some even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Christians, who believe things
absurd, and against all sort of appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance?
The Protestants at least do pass
that censure upon many of the Roman
Catholic Doctrines, as <hi>Transubstantiation,
the Infallibility of the Pope, or Council, &amp;c.</hi>
And the Catholicks are not wanting to
make like reproaches to Protestants.</p>
            <p>The Catholicks believe, That many
Units make more than a single one;
and do so much believe it, that he would
pass for a Fool amongst them, as well
as amongst other Christians, that would
undertake to deny it; and nevertheless
they believe that a Million of Humane
Bodies, separate from one another,
make but One. This is a visible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction:
Yet you know this is their
Opinion concerning the Body of Christ.
There are some that assuredly believe,
That <hi>God is not the Author of Sin,</hi> &amp;c.
Who at the same time assert, That
he created Man with a Design to let
him fall into Sin; as a means to make
his Justice Eminent, in punishing the
greatest part; and his Mercy, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
some few. It is evident, that
to say God ordered Sin should be, on
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63500:7"/>
purpose to accomplish thereby his Ends,
is to make him the Author of it.
But this is the frailty of Man's Mind;
he sees not these Contradictions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he has been so long accustomed
to shut his Eyes, when they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to him.</p>
            <p>A Man may then not only defend an ill
Opinion that he believes, but also believe
things absurd, and even contrary to
one another, without being aware. And
that's the Reason our Friends suspect
not Mr. <hi>N.</hi> to be a <hi>Deist,</hi> though some
may think his Opinions favour those
that are so called. But that you may
be able to judg, I send you here an
abridgment of what he says; which
one of my Friends imparted to me a
while ago.</p>
            <p>There are, says Mr. <hi>N.</hi> three sorts
of things in Holy Writ, <hi>Prophecies, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,
and Doctrines,</hi> which are not
ascribed to particular Revelation.</p>
            <p>To begin with the First; God made
himself known to the Prophets after
several manners; but it seems as if they
might be reduced to these three. They
<hi>had Visions</hi> by Day or by Night; they
<hi>heard Voices;</hi> or they were <hi>inwardly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired.</hi>
It is not our business here to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63500:8"/>
examine these things in themselves. We
only enquire after what manner they
have written that which they learnt by
these Visions, bythese Voices, or by these
Inspirations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prophecies</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies.</note> have been written by God's
express Command; by the Prophets
themselves, or by others. For we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell whether the Prophets them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
have always Written, or Dictated
them; or whether their Disciples have
Collected and Written them as exactly
as their memory would serve. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be, we cannot doubt but God
made known to the Prophets that which
we find in their Books, and that we
ought to believe St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 21.</note> when he
says, <hi>Prophecy came not in old time by the
Will of Man, but holy Men of God spake
as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To tell us that which appeared to
them in <hi>Visions,</hi> whether it be they
themselves that writ it, or others
that heard them tell it; there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nothing but a good memory. A
Man has no need of inspiration to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
faithfully what he has seen, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
when the impression it made
upon him was strong; as commonly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63500:8"/>
happen'd to those to whom God sent any
Vision. Hence it is observed, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Prophet has his particular Stile; by
which it appears that they related what
they had seen, as they used to relate
other things. Their Stile was the same
when they spake by the Order of God,
with that which they us'd in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Discourse.</p>
            <p>The same Judgment is to be made
concerning the recital of the words
they heard. There needed no more
but a good Memory to retain them.
But we cannot be Assured that they
have always recited exactly the very
words they heard, and not sometimes
thought it sufficient only to tell us
the sense. When God told them the
Name of some Person, it was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
they should retain the Syllables of
that Name; as when God ordered <hi>Isai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
to foretel that <hi>Cyrus</hi> should give the
Jews liberty to return into <hi>Palestine,</hi> it
behoved <hi>Isaiah</hi> to remember those two
Syllables, <hi>Co-res.</hi> But there is no likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
that in the rest of his Discourse
<hi>Isaiah</hi> has related word for word what
he heard. The diversity of Stile does
moreover prove, that the Prophets ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
after their own manner the sense
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63500:9"/>
of what they heard. There is, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
much difference between the
Stiles of <hi>Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Amos. Isaiah</hi>'s man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of writing is high and lofty. On
the contrary, that of <hi>Amos</hi> is low
and vulgar; and we find in it divers
popular Expressions, and many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs,
which sufficiently testify that
this Prophet, who was a Shepherd, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
after his own way what God
had said to him. This is the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> in the Preface
of his Commentary on this Prophet.
<note n="*" place="margin">Amos Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta fuit imperitus Sermone, sed non Scientia: Idem enim qui per om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Prophetas in eo Spiritus San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus loquebatur.</note> 
               <hi>The Prophet</hi> Amos, saith he, <hi>was skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in Knowledg, not in Language; for
the same Holy Spirit spoke in him that
spoke by all the Prophets.</hi> This Doctrine
attributes clearly the expression to the
Prophets, and the thing it self to the
Holy Spirit; which appears also by the
Remark he makes on Chap. III. saying,
<note n="†" place="margin">Diximus illum artis suae usum Sermonibus: &amp; quia Pastor gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum nibil terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilius Leone cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noverat, iram Domini Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus comparat.</note> 
               <hi>We told you that he uses the Terms of his
own Profession; and because a Shepherd
knows nothing more terrible than a Lion;
he compares the Anger of God to Lions.</hi>
St. <hi>Ierom</hi> should have said, according
to the common Opinion, that God
made use, in speaking to <hi>Amos,</hi> of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
terms, and suitable to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
whereas he attributes plainly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63500:9"/>
to the Prophet the choice of the Terms
in which the Prophecy is expressed.
<note n="*" place="margin">Vt verba ae Deo Prophetis dictata sint, sicuti interum evenisse non est negandum, ita non videtur per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuum. Atque hinc factum est ut pro temporum atque loquentium varietate etiam Sermo Propheta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum differret.</note> 
               <hi>That words were dictated by God to the
Prophets,</hi> (says a late Learned Critick) <hi>as
it cannot be denied to have been done some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
so it does not seem to have been done
always: And hence it is, that according to
the variety of the Times, and the Speakers,
the Phrase of the Prophets is also different.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is commonly alledged, that
the Prophets recite the same words
they heard; Because they introduce
God himself, speaking, <hi>Thus saith the
Lord,</hi> &amp;c. That is no Proof. For
it is the custom, both of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi>
and <hi>Greeks,</hi> to bring in always
those, whose Sense they relate, as
speaking in their own Persons; though
in doing so, they tye not themselves to
their words. I will give you a plain
Example thereof. It is the different
manner in which the Decalogue is set
down in <hi>Exodus</hi> and in <hi>Deuteronomy;</hi>
although God is said to speak personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in both places. God says in <hi>Exodus,
Remember the Sabbath day,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
Keep the Sabbath-day,</hi> &amp;c. It is in
<hi>Exodus, To keep it holy. Six days shalt thou
labour,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>Deuteronomy, To keep it holy,
as the Lord thy God commanded thee. Six
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63500:10"/>
days shalt thou labour,</hi> &amp;c. It is in <hi>Exodus, Nor
thy Cattel</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>Deuteronomy, Nor thine
Ox, nor thine Ass, nor any of thy Cattel,</hi> &amp;c.
And this Commandment ends thus, <hi>That
thy Man-Servant, and thy Maid-Servant,
may rest as well as thou; And remember
that thou wast a Servant in the Land of</hi>
Egypt, <hi>and that the Lord thy God brought
thee out thence, thrô a mighty Hand, and a
stretched-out-Arm; therefore the Lord thy
God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath
Day.</hi> In <hi>Exodus,</hi> the reason of keeping
the Sabbath, is taken from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World in Six Days, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any mention of Slaves, or of the
slavery of <hi>Egypt.</hi> There are some other
Differences in that which follows, but not
considerable. However it appears by this,
that either <hi>Moses</hi> in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> or the
Author of the Book of <hi>Exodus,</hi> did not
tie themselves scrupulously to exact
words, as the Jews now a-days do;
altho both these Authors bring in God
speaking personally. <hi>Grotius</hi> has hereupon
made this judicious Remark.<note n="*" place="margin">Sciendum est autem quae in Exodo hoc loco habentur verba per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelum Dei nomine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata, quae vero sunt Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

               <hi>It is to be observed,</hi> says he,
<hi>that the Words set down in this
place in</hi> Exodus, <hi>were pronounced
by an Angel in the Name of God;
but those which are in</hi> Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63500:10"/>
               <hi>are the words of</hi> Moses
<hi>repeating the same things; and
that with so great liberty, that
sometimes he transposes words;
changes some for others of the
same signification; omits some as
sufficiently known by those gone
before; and adds others by way of
Interpretation. The like liberty
of changing words is obvious to a
careful Reader in other places of
Sacred Writ, as</hi> Gen. XVII. 4.
<hi>compared with</hi> 7. Gen. XXIV. 17.
<hi>compar'd with</hi> 43 Exod. XI. 4.
<hi>compar'd with</hi> XII. 28. Exod.
XXXII. 11, <hi>&amp;c. compar'd with</hi>
Deut. IX. 27, <hi>&amp;c. Now this
shews, That we should not catch
at words in Holy Writ, as some
of the Iews do, who fancy that
those words in</hi> Exodus, <hi>and
those in</hi> Deuteronomy <hi>were
pronounc'd in one and the same
moment of time. They fancy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that where there is transposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and changing the order of
what was said first, what last;
that the last importing the
same sense were also said first.
There are in the Holy Histories
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63500:11"/>
so many Miracles, that we ought not to
invent new ones without necessity, and such
as are of no use.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you require yet another convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Proof, that this manner of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
personally, does not denote that
they are the proper Words of him that
is introduc'd speaking after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
you have no more to do but to
look into the Gospels, where the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists
always make our Saviour to speak
personally, and yet recite not the same
words that he made use of. For, beside
that Christ spoke <hi>Syriac</hi> or <hi>Chaldee,</hi>
there is oft great difference between
their Recitals. The Holy Spirit never
tied it self up to words, as many of
our Divines do now a-days. He only
prompted the Holy Pen-men to give us
the true sense of the Words that God
made use of to make the Prophets un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
his Will; and it is only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the sense, and to the things, that
the Apostles assure us that they were
inspired from God.</p>
            <p>The third sort of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
by which God made known his
Will, was by inward Inspiration, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Vision, and without Voice. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63500:11"/>
two different sorts may be conceiv'd.
For either God might inspire <hi>Prophecies</hi>
or <hi>Predictions</hi> word for word, as the
Prophets should pronounce them: As
when there was occasion to tell some
Name, unknown before to the Prophet:
Or he might inspire only the sense,
which they might express afterwards in
their own way: As most commonly it
happen'd: the first Occasion being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rare. It seems to me, that when any
one does apprehend a sense distinctly,
it is not difficult for him to express it
faithfully. And we ought to suppose,
that the Prophets full of the thoughts
wherewith God inspir'd them, had a
very clear and distinct <hi>Idea</hi> thereof:
Which will be easily understood, if we
consider, that the things wherewith God
inspir'd them were easy to be conceiv'd,
and proportion'd to the understanding
of all the World; at least as to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
sense. It happened also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
that without inspiring either
Words or Sense, God drew from the
Mouth of some Persons, Prophecies
which those who spoke them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
otherwise, and did not think
them to be Prophecies. He cast them
into certain Circumstances, and involv'd
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63500:12"/>
them in certain Events, which made
them say things that were true Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
without their knowing them
to be so. Such was <hi>Caiaphas</hi>'s Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
when he says, <hi>That it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that one Man should die for the People,
than that the whole Nation should perish.
Now he said not that of himself,</hi> says
St. <hi>Iohn, but being High Priest that
Year, he prophesied.</hi> To speak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
God inspir'd him not those
words, but the Nature of the Business
they were about in the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> drew
them from him. They were afraid that
Jesus would draw all the People to him,
and enterprise something against the
Roman Authority, which would not
then fail to send a puissant Army into
<hi>Palestine,</hi> and totally waste it. <hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi>
thereupon urges a very common
Politic Maxim, <hi>That is were better to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
one Man, though he were innocent,
than to expose the whole State to utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation.</hi>
In <hi>Caiaphas</hi>'s sense there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Prophetic or Inspir'd. But
in the Gospel-sense, that which <hi>Caiaphas</hi>
said, signifi'd more than he intended, and
contained a true Prophecy. It's very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that more Predictions of this nature
may be found in the Old Testament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:63500:12"/>
For Example: <hi>David</hi> says of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and of his Enemies divers things,
without thinking of prophesying,
which contain nevertheless Predictions
of that which ought to happen to Christ
and his Enemies. He says <hi>Psal.</hi> XLI. 10.
<hi>He that ate of my Bread hath lift up his
Heel against me:</hi> He meant surely some
of those who were risen against him in
<hi>Asolom</hi>'s Conspiracy, as <hi>Achitophel</hi> or
some other, and he speaks plainly of a
thing happened to himself. It is this
very thing that inspires him, if one
may so say, these words; which betoken
what should befal Jesus Christ by the
Treachery of one of his Disciples, as
appears by <hi>Iohn</hi> XIII. 18. The Author
of the LXIX<hi>th,</hi> and CIX<hi>th Psalms,</hi> whether
it were <hi>David,</hi> or some other, did not
probably think of fore-telling what
should one day befal a Disciple of the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> when he curs'd his Enemies:
And yet St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>Acts</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts i. 20.</note> applies some
words of these Psalms to <hi>Iudas.</hi> There
needs no great sharpsightedness to see
that the Author pretended not to speak
of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and that he was not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
inspir'd by the good and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
Spirit of God, when he said, <hi>Set
thou a wicked Man over him, and let Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63500:13"/>
stand at his Right-hand: When he shall
be judged let him be condemned, and let his
Prayer become Sin: Let his days be few,
and let another take his Office: Let his
Children be Fatherless, and his Wife a
Widow: Let his Children continually be
Vagabonds and beg; let them seek their
Bread also out of their desolate places: Let
the Extortioner catch all that he hath, and
let the Stranger spoil his Labour: Let
there be none to extend Mercy unto him;
neither let there be any to favour his Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Children: Let his Posterity be cut off,
and in the Generation following let their
Name be blotted out: Let the Iniquity of
his Fathers be remembred with the Lord;
and let not the Sin of his Mother be blotted
out,</hi> &amp;c. It is plain that these are the
words of a Man full of excessive Choler,
and of an extream desire to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
Now the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not, any more than the Gospel, to
with ill, or do it, to Children, in revenge
of the Injury received from their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
Yet some famous Divines have
put in the Title of this Psalm, <hi>That</hi>
David, AS A TYPE OF JESUS CHRIST,
<hi>being driven on by a singular Zeal, prays that
Vengeance may be executed on his Enemies.</hi>
And where do they find that Jesus
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63500:13"/>
Christ does curse his Enemies at that
rate? Have they forgotten the words
that proceeded from his dying Mouth,
in favour of the wickedest Race that
ever was? Those that crucified him,
were they not the greatest Enemies he
had, and the most obstinate Adversaries
of the Gospel? And, far from making
the Imprecations against them that they
deserved, did not he pray to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to forgive them? Has he not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
us to imitate him, and to pray
for those that persecute us? I cannot
understand how it can be said, that
<hi>David,</hi> as a <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> made
such horrible Imprecations against his
Enemies.</p>
            <p>I confess, I understand not Christian
Religion, if it permit the pronouncing
such Curses, and the wishing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
after so cruel a manner, as does
the Author of this Psalm, and those of
divers others, in which we find such like
Imprecations; As that of <hi>Psal.</hi> cxxxvii.
<hi>O Daughter of</hi> Babylon, <hi>who art to be
destroyed, happy shall he be that rewardeth
thee as thou hast served us: Happy shall
he be that taketh and dasheth thy little Ones
against the Stones!</hi> God forbid that we
should desire to dash out the Brains of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63500:14"/>
Infidel's Children! Yet nevertheless we
see that all these Psalms are indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sung in Protestant Churches, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
taking notice that they are not all
equally inspir'd. And I remember that
asking a Divine, how we could sing
Psalms full of such Imprecations? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
me slightly, that it was lawful
to use them against the Enemies of the
Church, and that for his part he made
that Application to them, when he sung
these Psalms. Thus you see what the
Jewish Opinion of the Inspiration of
words, and of the Divinity of each
Verse of the Scripture produces.</p>
            <p>We may conceive another sort of
<hi>Prophecies,</hi> which consisted not in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling
things to come, but in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scripture, and in composing
readily Hymns to the Honour of God.
There are some Examples of these
Hymns in the New Testament, as that of
the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and some others.
It seems as if there went only Piety
and Zeal to the composing them. At
least it is very conceivable, that a pious,
zealous Man may easily now a days praise
God in that manner, without any Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
A good part of the Psalms seems
to have been thus compos'd, as also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63500:14"/>
other Songs which are in the Old
Testament. The Psalms where the
Verses, or the Pauses, begin with the
Letters of the Hebrew Alphabet, seem
to have been compos'd at more leisure.
For this Regularity shews that there was
Meditation and Pains used, as is in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crosticks.
See <hi>Psal.</hi> cxix. and the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations</hi>
of <hi>Ieremy.</hi> So we see too,
that in this sort of Works, the Holy
Writers do not speak in the Name of
God, nor begin their Discourse with,
<hi>Thus saith the Lord.</hi> Yet we may say
that the Authors of these pious Songs
were full of the Holy Spirit, when they
compos'd them; that is to say, it was
a Spirit of Piety that carry'd them to
take pains in those Compositions; and
in that sense we may say that they were
inspir'd by God, though not so imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
as Predictions. The Spirit of
God is often taken for the Spirit of
Holiness, that is to say, for a disposition
of Spirit conformable to the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God; as many Learned Men
have observed.</p>
            <p>I will now remark briefly in what
manner the Sacred Histories have
been written: And then, in treating of
Doctrines, I will speak of that sort of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63500:15"/>
               <hi>Prophecy</hi> that consists in explaining the
Holy Scripture.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> Of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is certain that those who took
pains in the Histories of the Old and
New Testament, were pious Persons; who
had not writ those Histories, but out
of a Principle of Piety. It was not to
satisfy our Curiosity that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
those Works; but to show us the
Care that the Providence of God hath
always taken of good People, and the
Punishments it inflicts upon the wicked;
to give us Examples of Piety and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
and lastly, to inform us of certain
matters of Fact, upon which our Faith
is founded, and of the Precepts which
God had given to Jews and Christians,
by the Ministry of his Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
Angels themselves, and even of his
own Son. We ought also to believe
that they have given us the Truth of
the History to the best of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
without adding or substracting
any thing out of design to deceive us.
And as they were very well informed
of the principal matters of Fact which
they relate, having themselves seen
them, or taken them out of good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
we may be consident that for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63500:15"/>
the main of the History they tell us
nothing that is not exactly true. These
Qualifications alone are sufficient to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
us to give Credit to them. An Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian
that is honest, and well inform'd
of that which he relates, is worthy of
Credit: And if you add thereto, that
he has also suffer'd Death in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Truth of his History, as
the Apostles did, who were put to
death for maintaining that they had
seen and heard, that which the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
tells us of Jesus Christ; then not
only that History will be worthy of
Credit, but they who shall refuse to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, can pass for no other than Fools
or obstinate Persons. In this manner
we may be fully assur'd of the Truth
of the History of the New Testament;
that is to say, That there was a Jesus
who did divers Miracles, who was rais'd
from the Dead, &amp; ascended up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and who taught the Doctrine which
we find in the Gospels. And this Jesus
having born witness to the History of
the Jews, we cannot doubt its truth,
at least as to the principal Matters.</p>
            <p>This can not be call'd in question,
without absolutely renouncing Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
But People believe commonly two
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63500:16"/>
things which seem to me groundless;
unless they ground them upon Jewish
Tradition, a Principle, as is well known,
extreamly uncertain. They believe, first,
that the sacred Historians were inspir'd
with the Things themselves: And next,
that they were inspir'd also with the
Terms in which they have express'd
them. In a word, that the holy Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was dictated word for word by the
holy Spirit, and that the Authors, whose
Names it bears, were no other than
Secretaries of that Spirit, who writ
exactly as it dictated.</p>
            <p>As to what concerns the Inspiration
of Historical Matters of Fact, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
First, That they suppose it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
bringing any positive Proof, and that
consequently a Man may with good
reason reject their Supposition. They
say only that if it were not so, we
could not be perfectly certain of the
truth of the History. But, beside that
a Consequence cannot undeniably prove
a Fact; and that it may happen that
one cannot disprove a Consequence, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that which is pretended to be
prov'd thereby be not true; I affirm
that it is false, that we cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
certain of the main substance of a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63500:16"/>
History unless we suppose it inspir'd.
We are, for Example, perfectly certain
that <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> was kill'd in the Senate
by a Conspiracy, whereof <hi>Brutus</hi> and
<hi>Cassius</hi> were the Chiefs; without believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they who have inform'd us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
were inspir'd. There are such like
matters in the Histories of all Nations,
which we cannot doubt of, without
being guilty of Folly and Opiniatrety;
and yet without supposing that these
Histories were writ by Divine Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>In the second place, this Opinion
supposes without necessity a Miracle, of
which the Scripture it self says no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
To relate faithfully a matter
of Fact, which a Man has seen and
well observed, requires no Inspiration.
The Apostles had no need of Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to tell what they had seen, and
what they had heard Christ say. There
needs nothing for that but Memory and
Honesty. Neither had those Authors
who writ only the things that came to
pass before their time, as the Author of
the Books of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> any more need
of Inspiration for copying of good
Records. And as for those who made
the Records, there was no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63500:17"/>
than that they should be well
inform'd of what they set down, either
by their Eyes, or by their Ears, or by
faithful Witnesses. It will be said, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
that according to this Opinion,
the Faith which we build upon the
Scripture will be no other than a Faith
purely <hi>human,</hi> because it will be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
only upon Human Testimonies.
To this I answer, That neither do we
know, any more than by a <hi>Human
Faith,</hi> that the Book which we call the
Gospel of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> is truly his. It
is nothing but the uniform Consent of
Christians, since the beginning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
to this day, that makes us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it; which in truth is no more than
a Testimony purely <hi>Human.</hi> We do
not believe it because we are assur'd of
it by an Oracle from Heaven, which
has told us that this Book is truly that
Apostle's; but on the same account that
we believe that the <hi>Eneid</hi> is truly <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>'s,
and the <hi>Iliad Homer</hi>'s. But that
which they here call <hi>Human Faith</hi> is of
as great certainty, as the Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Geometry. And even <hi>Divine
Faith</hi> it self, as they call it, is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Certainty. For, in truth, we
do not believe in Jesus Christ, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63500:17"/>
we are perswaded that the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
we have of him is true. And how
do we know that this History is true?
Because Eye-witnesses have written it,
and have suffer'd Death to maintain
the truth of their Testimonies. And
how are we certain that these were
Eye-witnesses, and that they suffer'd
Death rather than deny what they
said? By History; that is to say, by
the Testimony of Men, who affirm it
to us constantly from the time of the
Establishment of the Christian Religion
to the Age we live in. So that <hi>Human
Faith</hi> is found to be the ground of
<hi>Divine Faith.</hi> But we need not fear
that this Foundation is not solid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
For without ceasing to be a
Man, and reasoning no more than a
Brute, it cannot be disputed; as has
been made appear by many Learned
Men, who have written of the Truth
of Christian Religion.</p>
            <p>In the third place; The common
Opinion is contrary to the Testimony
even of the Sacred Writers. St. <hi>Luke</hi>
begins his Gospel after this manner.
<hi>For asmuch as many have taken in hand to
set forth in Order a Declaration of those
things, which are most surely believed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63500:18"/>
among us, even as they delivered them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, who from the beginning were Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witnesses,
and Ministers of the Word: It
seemed good to me also, having had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Vnderstanding of all things from
the very first, to write unto thee in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
most excellent</hi> Theophilus, <hi>that thou
mightest know the certainty of those things
wherein thou hast been instructed.</hi> You
may observe in these words a Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of what I have been saying,
and a full Proof that St. <hi>Luke</hi> learn'd not
that which he told us by Inspiration,
but by Information from those who
knew it exactly. Now if you allow
St. <hi>Luke</hi> to have so faithfully related to
us the Life and Discourses of Jesus (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having been particularly inspir'd)
that we ought to receive what he tells
us with an entire belief in his Fidelity;
you ought not to make any difficulty to
grant the same concerning the other
Historians of the Scripture. If any of
them ought to be inspir'd, certainly
they were the Evangelists. And if you
will have another Example of a Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory
written without Inspiration, you
have but to read the Books of <hi>Kings,</hi> and
of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> being Extracts out of
publick Registers, and out of particular
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63500:18"/>
Writings of divers Prophets, to whom
the Authors at every turn refer the
Reader.</p>
            <p>Lastly, It is very plain that the Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
of the Scripture were not inspir'd;
by the Contradictions that are found in
several Circumstances of their Histories.
The Evangelists agree perfectly among
themselves in what concerns the main
of the History of Jesus Christ, but there
are some Circumstances wherein they
disagree; a clear proof that every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
was not inspir'd. For although
the Circumstances wherein they differ
are things of small Consequence, yet if
the holy Spirit had dictated all to
them, as is pretended, they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
agree in every thing; these Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
being as well known to God
as the main of the History. For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
St. <hi>Matthew</hi> says, <hi>That</hi> Judas, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
that he had delivered our Lord to
the Iews, threw the Mony into the Temple;
that going away he hang'd himself; and
that the Priests, having gathered up the
Mony, bought therewith a Field.</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi>
in the <hi>Acts</hi> brings in <hi>Peter</hi> saying,
<hi>That</hi> Judas, <hi>after having purchased a
Field with the Reward of Iniquity, falling
headlong, burst asunder in the midst, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63500:19"/>
that his Bowels gushed out.</hi> Here
is a manifest Contradiction, which the
Learned in vain endeavour to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile.
And there are many other such
like</p>
            <p>But this, you will say, lessens very
much the Authority of the <hi>Evangelists.</hi>
For if they could be deceiv'd in any
thing, who will secure us that they were
not deceiv'd in every thing? I answer
to that in the words of <hi>Grotius;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Imo hoc ipsum Scriptores illos ab om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni doli suspicione Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare debet; com sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant illi qui falsa testantur, de compacto omnia ita narrare, ut ne in spciem quidem quicquam diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum, appareat: Quod si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ex levi aliquâ discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pantiâ, etiam quae conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liari nequiret, totis libris fides decederct, jam nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li libro, praesertim Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storiarum, credendum esset; cum tamen Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bio &amp; Halicarnassensi, &amp; Livio &amp; Plutarcho, in quibus talia deprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duntur, sua apud nos de rerum summa constet autoritas.</note> 
               <hi>Even this it self ought to free
these Writers from all Suspicion
of Deceit, For those who testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
Falshoods, use so to agree
their Stories, that there may
not so much as seem to be any
difference. But if because of any
small Disagreement, although it
could not be reconcil'd, whole
Books should lose their Credit,
then no Book, especially of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
would deserve to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved;
whereas the Authority of</hi>
Polibius, <hi>and</hi> Halicarnassensis,
<hi>and</hi> Livy, <hi>and</hi> Plutarch, <hi>in
whom such things are found, as
to the main stands firm among us.</hi>
St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> also in his first
Homily on St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> very
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63500:19"/>
plainly assures us, that God permitted
the Apostles to fall into these little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties;
that we might see that they
were not agreed to feign a History at
Pleasure; and that we might more readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe them in the main of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.
When a Man has seen most of
the Things which he relates, in those
he can hardly be deceiv'd. But he
may be easily deceiv'd in some Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of Things which he has not
seen</p>
            <p>We might yet add a fifth Proof, which
<hi>Grotius</hi> affords us, in his Notes on that
part of his Treatise of the <hi>Verity of the
Christian Religion,</hi> which I lately cited.
It is, that the Evangelists, in setting
down a certain time, do not determine
it exactly; because they did not know
it so precisely that they could set down
the number of Days or Months. See
<hi>Luke</hi> I. 56. III. 23. <hi>Iohn</hi> II. 6. VI. 10,
19. XIX. 14. You find in those places,
<hi>About a certain Time;</hi> or, <hi>About a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Number:</hi> Which shews evidently,
that the History was not dictated im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
by the Holy Spirit, who knew
exactly the Number and the Time that
was in question.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:63500:20"/>
It is clear then, in my Judgment,
that the Things were not Inspir'd; nor
by consequence the Words; which are
less considerable than the Things. It
is not certain Terms that are the Rule
of our Faith; but a certain Sense. And
it is little matter what words we make
use of, provided we go not astray from
the Doctrine which God has reveal'd.
Those who read the Originals, are in
no better way of being sav'd, than
those that can read only the Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
For there is no Translation
so false, but that taken in gross, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
clearly enough that which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Salvation. Otherwise it
would be necessary that all Christians
had learn'd <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> which is
altogether impossible; and we should
exclude from Salvation, almost all those
who have made profession of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion in our Western Parts,
from the Time of the Apostles, to the
Age we live in</p>
            <p>That providence also which has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
us these Holy Books, to lead us
in the way to Salvation, so many
Ages after the death of those that writ
them, has preserv'd inviolably nothing
but the Sense. It has suffer'd Men to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63500:20"/>
put in Synonimous Words one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and not hinder'd the slipping in
of a great many Varieties, little consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
as to the Sense, but remarkable
as to the Words and Order. There is
in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> for Example, more
than a thousand divers Readings in less
than eleven hundred Verses; but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
there is not perhaps fifty, that can
make any change in the Sense; and that
change too is but in things of little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to piety. If God had thought
it necessary, for the Good of his Church,
to inspire into the Sacred Historians the
terms which they ought to use, he would
undoubtedly have taken more care to
preserve them. It is plain therefore
that he design'd principally to preserve
the Sense.</p>
            <p>Thus then neither the Words, nor the
things, have been inspir'd into those who
have given us the Sacred History; altho in
the main that History is very true in the
principal Facts. It may be, that in certain
Circumstances, little considerable, there
may be some Fault; as appears suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
by the contradictory Passages. It is
ture, that some have strain'd themselves
to reconcile those Passages, as I have
already observ'd; but it is after so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63500:21"/>
and constrain'd a fashion; and
there are such divers Opinions about
these Reconciliations; that if we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the thing never so little, without
prejudice, we shall find that the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
trouble themselves to no purpose;
and that they would do much better to
confess ingenuously, that there are some
Contradictions in things of small im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
            <p>Nay further, I know some that
believe we ought not to receive all
the Jewish Histories, without distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
for true Histories. They Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
we ought to except the Book of
<hi>Esther.</hi> And it is true, that if <hi>Assuerus,</hi>
of whom the Book of <hi>Esther</hi> speaks, be
<hi>Ochus</hi> that raign'd after <hi>Artaxerxes
Mnemon,</hi> this Book would have been
written at such a time as there was no
Prophet in <hi>Israel.</hi> But altho Mr. <hi>Cappel</hi>
pretend that <hi>Achasueros</hi> is the same
with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, his conjecture is not unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable.
They pretend also, that this
History has all the Characters of a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
made at pleasure. I shall not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
that at present. But however it
be, it is no Heresy to reject a Book of
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Canon; as neither is it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
one of our own. At least, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63500:21"/>
have not call'd a <hi>Lutheran</hi> an
<hi>Heretick,</hi> for having said that the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
of St. <hi>Iames</hi> is an<note n="*" place="margin">Straminea Epistola.</note> 
               <hi>Epistle of Straw;</hi>
no more than they have many of the

The <hi>Iewish Sanhedrim</hi> may easily have

            <p>To come now to the Doctrines which
are in the Holy Scriptures,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> Of the Doct. of the Scriptures, and Inspiration of the Apostles.</note> and not
there attributed to a partcular Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
I will begin with examining those
which are in the Writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
after which I will pass to those of
the Old Testament.</p>
            <p>It is commonly believed, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
as well as the Prophets, were
inspir'd both as to Words and Things.
Yet with this difference, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
were not always inspir'd, but only
when God gave them order to speak to
the People in his Name. Whereas the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
were always inspir'd, without being
ravisht into Extasies, as the Prophets
were before their prophesying. This
Opinion is founded upon the Promise
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63500:22"/>
that Christ made his Apostles to send
them the holy Spirit, which he performed
on the Day of <hi>Pentecost.</hi> The words of
Christ are, <hi>Iohn</hi> XVI. 13. <hi>When he, the
Spirit of Truth, shall come, he will guide
you into all Truth.</hi> He says also else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
to his Apostles; <hi>When they bring
you into the Synagogues, and unto Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
and Powers, take ye no thought
how or what thing ye shall answer, or what
ye shall say, for the Holy Ghost shall teach
you in the same hour what ye ought to say,</hi>
Luk. XII. 11. These are two the most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Passages that can be quoted in this
Matter. It is requisite that we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them with some attention, to see
if they prove that which they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
for; <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That the Apostles
were honour'd with a continual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Holy Ghost, who dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them all that they said in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Religion; insomuch that all
their words ought to be considered as
Oracles.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To begin with the latter; I observe
first, That he does not promise a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Inspiration, but only upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Occasions; <hi>viz.</hi> when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
should be brought before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals
of Judges. So that if there were
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63500:22"/>
nothing else in it, this Passage would
not at all favour the common Opinion.
But there is more in it: for it wholly
destroys it. If Jesus Christ had resolv'd
to give his Apostles the Holy Spirit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
them perpetually, he would not have
told them singly, that they should not tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
themselves for what they had to say
before the Judges, because then the Spirit
should speak in them. But he would have
said that they need not fear that at any
time they should want words, because the
holy Spirit should accompany them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ceasing, as well before the Powers
of the World, as when they should
speak to the People. If a Man had a
Design to supply another with Mony for
all his Expences; Would he say to him,
Do not trouble your self to get Mony
for the Journies you are to take, for
you shall then be supplied? He
would rather say to him, doubtless,
that he should not fear to want Mony,
because he should be suppli'd constantly
for all his Occasions. A Man promises
not for a particular Occasion, that which
he intends to give alike at all Times.
And when a Man makes a particular
Promise, it is a plain sign that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to perform it but upon certain
Occasions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:63500:23"/>
In the second place; As I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
that the Apostles may have had
Prophetick Inspirations on certain Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
and that in effect they have had
them; so I confess that I find my self
tempted to believe, that by these words,
<hi>The Holy Ghost shall teach you in that hour
what ye ought to say:</hi> Or as St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
has expressed it, <hi>It is not ye that
speak, it is the Spirit of your Heavenly
Father that speaks in you;</hi> I am, I say,
tempted to believe, that by these words
Christ meant only to say this; <hi>viz.</hi> The
Spirit of Courage and Holiness, which
the Gospel produces in your Hearts,
will teach ye what ye ought to say.
That is to say, That the Apostles had
no more to do, but to believe in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
to be assur'd that the Disposition
of Spirit which that Heavenly Doctrine
would give them, would never let them
want words; not even when they were
to defend themselves before the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
of the greatest Powers. That
which inclines me to this Explication of
Christ's words, is, that in comparing
this Promise with the Event, it seems
not to have been performed in any other
sense than that which I have now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd;
and that neither ought it to be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63500:23"/>
interpreted so strictly, as if on these
Occasions a Word might not slip
from the Apostles, that were not
conformable to the Spirit of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Luke</hi> tell us, <hi>Acts</hi> XXIII. that
St. <hi>Paul</hi> having been brought before
the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> began to speak after this
manner; <hi>Men and Brethren, I have liv'd
in all good Conscience before God until this
day.</hi> Here is nothing yet that one might
not say without Inspiration; as neither
is there any thing but what is confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to the Gospel. But what follows
is a sign of Passion, wherewith neither
the Spirit of Prophecy, nor the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Spirit of the Gospel inspired St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
At that words, says St. <hi>Luke,</hi> Ananias
<hi>the High Priest commanded them that stood
by, to smite him on the Mouth.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
provok'd by this Unjustice, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
him angrily, <hi>God shall smite thee,
thou whited Wall. For sittest thou to judg
me according to the Law, and commandest
thou me to be smitten contrary to the Law?
And they that stood by,</hi> says St. <hi>Luke, said
to</hi> Paul, <hi>Revilest thou God's High Priest?
Then said</hi> Paul, <hi>I wist not Brethren that
he was the High Priest: For it is written,
Thou shalt not speak Evil of the Ruler of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63500:24"/>
thy People.</hi> It is plain, me-thinks, that
if the Spirit of Prophecy had inspir'd
St. <hi>Paul</hi> with the beginning of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
it did not so neither with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
he made the <hi>High Priest;</hi> nor with the
Excuse he made use of afterward when
they told him he was the High Priest that
he spoke to. He gave Sentence against
himself by his Answer, supposing that
he had known him who order'd him to
be smitten. And as for the Excuse, it is
plain it is not very good; because the
Gospel allows not to revile any Man;
whether he be a Magistrate, or a private
Man. <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> says St. <hi>Peter, has
suffered for us, leaving us an Example that
we should follow his steps; who when he
was reviled, reviled not again; when he
suffered, threatned not, but committed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to him that judgeth righteously.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither do I believe that the Spirit of
Prophecy inspir'd St. <hi>Paul</hi> with what he
said afterward: At least there is no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
but could have said as much, without
Inspiration. <hi>Now St.</hi> Paul <hi>knowing,</hi> says
the Historian, <hi>that the one part were Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces,
and the other Pharisees, cried out
in the Council, Men and Brethren, I am a
Pharisee, the Son of a Pharisee: of the
Hope and Resurrection of the Dead, I am
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63500:24"/>
called in question.</hi> This expression also of
St. <hi>Luke, (Paul knowing)</hi> makes it evident
that his Speech was an Effect of his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
rather than of Prophetic Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>I am not the first that has
made such-like Observations.
St. <hi>Ierom</hi> in his Dialogue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> Lib. 3.
brings in <hi>Atticus,</hi> who bears the
part of an Orthodox Doctor,
speaking of St. <hi>Paul;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Putasne Apostolum eo tempore quo scribebat; <hi>Lacernam sive penulam, quam reliqui Troade veniens affer, ac libros &amp; maximè membranas;</hi> de coelestibus cogitasse misteriis &amp; non de his quae in usu com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munis vitae vel corpori necessaria sunt, &amp;c?

               <hi>Do
you think St.</hi> Paul, <hi>at that time
when he writ,</hi> (The Cloak which
I left at <hi>Troas,</hi> when thou
comest bring with thee, and
the Books, but especially the
Parchments) <hi>did think of the
Heavenly Mysteries, and not of
those things which are useful to
Humane Life, and necessary to
the Body,</hi> &amp;c? <hi>The Apostle is
struck by an Officer, and he falls
foul upon the High Priest that
commanded him to be smitten:</hi>
God shall smite thee thou whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

of our Saviour, who as a

               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:63500:25"/>
If I have spoken Ill, convince me of
the ill; but if Well, why do you strike
me? <hi>We do not detract from the Apostle,
but we declare the Glory of our Lord; who
suffering in the Flesh, overcame the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and weaknesses of the Flesh. Not
to mention what he says in another place.</hi>
Alexander <hi>the Copper-smith did me much
Evil; the Lord, the Righteous Iudg, will
reward him in that day.</hi> It is true, St. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>
elsewhere disapproves a part of that
which here he makes his Orthodox
Doctor speak; but it is plain, at least,
that one might speak it without being
guilty of Heresy.</p>
            <p>Lastly; When we examine the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
which we have of Christ's Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
before divers Judges, we may
easily perceive that they speak with
much Piety and Courage; but it seems
not that they say any thing which one
might not as well say without Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If we read the Histories of those
that have been put to death for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in the last Ages, we shall find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that were not Prophets, making ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.
Discourses at their Trials, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being prepar'd before-hand. St.
<hi>Stephen</hi> was full of the Gospel-Spirit,
when he made the Harangue we read
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63500:25"/>
               <hi>Acts</hi> VII. It seems nevertheless, that
he therein mix'd divers Circumstances
of History, which were nothing to the
purpose of the matter he spoke about;
and which neither can tolerably be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd
with the History of the Old
Testament. And indeed very learned
Men have been of Opinion, that St.
<hi>Stephen</hi>'s Memory fail'd him. Mr. <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi>
in his <hi>Spicilegium</hi> on <hi>Vers.</hi> 16. says:

               <hi>It is certain that in this place we should
read <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and understand <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
that it might not be said</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
<hi>but his Grandchild</hi> Jacob <hi>bought this
Monument. Or we may say, that</hi> Stephen,
<hi>by the fault of his Memory, confounded
two Facts that were somewhat alike, to
wit, the Purchase made by</hi> Abraham,
<hi>whereof</hi> Gen. XXIII. <hi>with that made by</hi>
Jacob, <hi>Gen.</hi> XXXIII. 19.</p>
            <p>However, it is no ways incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that by the Holy Spirit, or the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, we should understand the
Spirit of Holiness and Constancy, which
the Gospel gives; or such a disposition
of Mind, as is an Effect of our Faith.
We know it is a manner of speaking
common in the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call the
<hi>Spirit of Iealousy,</hi> the <hi>Spirit of Stupidity,</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:63500:26"/>
the <hi>Spirit of Fear,</hi> the <hi>Spirit of Courage,</hi>
the <hi>Spirit of Meekness,</hi> &amp;c. the different
dispositions of Mind, that render a Man
Jealous, Stupid, Fearful, Couragious,
Meek, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Criticks have observ'd
this long ago.</p>
            <p>But I must needs desire you once again
to take notice, that when I say the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Christ had not Prophetic In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations,
for answering before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
of Judges, to the Accusations
brought against them; I do not mean
thereby that it never so fell out; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that ordinarily they spoke without
particular Inspiration. I conceive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that if one of them had appeared
before a Judg, whose Language he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
understood not, it would have
been necessary that God should have
dictated to him the proper words he was
to make use of. And I doubt not but
God has often done even that, in favour
of such of the Apostles as have preach'd
the Gospel to barbarous Nations beyond
the Limits of the Roman Empire, and
perhaps too sometimes amongst the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
and <hi>Greeks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However it be, it seems to me that if
what I have been saying be consider'd,
it must be granted that the Passages of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63500:26"/>
St. <hi>Luke</hi> and St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> where Christ
promises his Spirit to his Disciples, are
not strong enough to render the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Opinion indisputable.</p>
            <p>This, Sir, is about half the Writing
which was given me concerning the
thoughts of Mr. <hi>N.</hi> on this Subject. It
is too long to make an end of transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
it at present. But you shall have
the rest by the next Post: upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
you will promise me to peruse it
carefully, and give me your sense of
it. It were extreamly to be wished,
that some able and judicious Person
would undertake to handle this Matter
thorowly, in opposition to our Author,
but without Heat and Passion. This Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is maintain'd by so many Proofs,
and Arguments that seem so strong;
that tho I know it may be render'd very
odious, and that very malicious Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
may be drawn from it; yet I must
confess I do not know by what Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
it can be overthrown. And that
which gives this Author yet more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
is, That this Matter has been
so little handled, that all the Writings
upon the Scripture to this day afford us
scarce any light therein. A Man must
fetch all out of his own Stock, to answer
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63500:27"/>
him. And it is no small trouble to
have one's Mind continually exercised
in clearing up the Difficulties of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
so little known, and giving clear
Principles in so obscure a Matter.</p>
            <p>I would be glad, Sir, that there were
any in your Province, or elsewhere, that
would undertake to clear it: for I know
none of my Friends here that will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in it. If you could prevail with
some learned and moderate Divine to
take that task in hand, without railing
as Divines too often do, when they know
not how to answer their Antagonist,
you would infinitely oblige those who
have read this little Writing.

            <head>THE
SECOND LETTER.</head>
            <p>I Am not surpriz'd, Sir, at your desire
to see the latter part of that Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
whereof I sent you the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
by last Post, before your are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to give me your Judgment on it.
A matter so important and so delicate
requires to be considered with much
Attentiveness. We must lay aside then
once again the Examination of the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
History, to resume it next Post.
For I cannot transcribe the rest of the
Writing of Mr. <hi>N.</hi> and entertain you
at the same time upon any other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
Mr. —whom you mention, is
well qualified to instruct his Flock in
matters of Piety, but has not, I doubt,
Learning sufficient, nor Parts strong
enough to master the Difficulties that
attend the answering directly, and by
positive Arguments, a Writing which
some other very able Divines dare not
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63500:28"/>
meddle with. It were better, in my
Judgment, not to answer at all than to
answer ill; and to seek only to defame
an Author whom one cannot confute.
I should be the more troubled to see
that done, by how much I understand
that the Author is a very pious Man,
and one who assuredly believes not
the evil Consequences, which some Men,
(too ready to judg of their Neighbours)
may draw from his Notions. I fear
that he you speak of would content
himself in gathering together a great
number of those odious Consequences,
and would think that he had thereby
sufficiently refuted the Opinion, without
considering, that tho a Man cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingage
a Doctrine from the absurd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
that by some may be link'd
to it, it does not therefore follow that
the Doctrine is false. It should first
be made appear that the Arguments
brought for an Opinion are not solid;
and after that one may come to the
Consequences. Otherwise while the
Arguments that prove an Opinion sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in full force, all the Consequences
that may be deriv'd from it cannot
overthrow it. Nevertheless if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him capable to acquit himself of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63500:28"/>
this undertaking, you may perswade
him to it when you think fit. But put
him in Mind at the same time, that it
is the part of an honest Man, and of one
that would bestow his Pains to some good
purpose, to do it with all the Moderation
and Meekness imaginable. St. <hi>Ierom</hi>
commends <hi>Nepotien,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Quod so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leret libenter audire, respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere verecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dè, recta susci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere, prava non acriter confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare, disputan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem contra se magis docere quam vincere.</note> 
               <hi>That he used to
hear willingly, answer modestly, allow Truth,
not sharply confute Error, and teach rather
than conquer whom he disputed with.</hi> And
it were to be wished that our Divines
now adays would make it their business
to deserve so good an Elogy; whereas it
seems that they strive only to attain to
the Name of great Railers, and value not
Peoples having an ill Opinion of their
Manners, provided that they pass for
Men of Parts. I speak not this as if I
suspected that Mr. — resembles one
of those Divines I find fault with; but
because I believe a Man cannot be too
much caution'd against so general a
Defect.</p>
            <p>But these Moralities would carry me
too far, if I should give my self the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to pursue them. It is better that
I keep my word with you, and give you
the following part of that Writing.
And here it is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:63500:29"/>
Let us now examine that Passage of
St. <hi>Iohn, When the Spirit of Truth shall come,
he will lead you into all Truth.</hi> Interpreters
observe that we must not understand by
<hi>All Truths,</hi> any others than those which
the Apostles<note place="margin">Continuation of the Writing of Mr. <hi>N.</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Apostles.</note> were ignorant of, and which
it was needful for them to know, that
they might be able to acquit themselves
as they ought to do of their Charge.
They receiv'd not the holy Spirit to
learn, for Example, that there was a God;
nor to be instructed in the Mathematicks.
They knew already this first Truth, and
of the other they had no need.</p>
            <p>The generality of Interpreters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that these words denote a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Assistance of the holy Spirit, that
made the Apostles absolutely infallible.
To know whether they are in the right
or no, we must examine the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of the Promise; and if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that it agrees not with this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation
of our Saviour's words, we
must seek another sense, and try to
discover wherein the Infallibility of the
Apostles consists.</p>
            <p>We find a Story <hi>Acts</hi> xv. whereby
it appears manifestly that the Apostles
did not pass in their own time for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
whose every word was an Oracle,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63500:29"/>
as they are now reputed to have done.
Some Jews converted to the Christian
Religion, not being able to shake off
their ancient Opinion concerning Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
would have had the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
circumcis'd. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and St. <hi>Barnabas</hi>
were against this: but their Authority
was not sufficient to put to silence the
Judaizing Christians. Altho St. <hi>Paul</hi> was
as much an Apostle, as those whom our
Lord had chosen while he was on
Earth, yet they would not believe him.
The Church at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted.</p>
            <p>Further also, the Apostles and Elders
of the Church, being assembl'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
and determine this Affair, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
a great while before they agree
upon it; and it was not till after they
had heard St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>has,</hi>
and St. <hi>Iames,</hi> that the Assembly
came to a Resolution. If they had been
fill'd with the Spirit of Infallibility,
such as is conceiv'd now adays, they
would have been all at first of one
Mind; and there would have needed no
more to be done, but to charge one of
them to give out the Oracle in the
Name of the whole Assembly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:63500:30"/>
There happen'd likewise, before that,
another thing related by St. <hi>Luke, Acts</hi> x.
which makes it also very evident, that
the Holy Ghost which the Apostles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> had not
taught them all they ought to know,
(so far was it from rendring them at first
dash infallible) and that they were not
then consider'd as Persons out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of falling into Error, as they have
been since accounted. St. <hi>Peter</hi> needed a
Vision, as appears by the Story of
<hi>Cornelius</hi> the <hi>Centurion,</hi> to learn that he
ought not to scruple preaching the
Gospel to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> although Christ
had order'd his Apostles before his
ascending into Heaven, <hi>to preach the
Gospel unto all Creatures;</hi> whereby he
clearly enough denoted the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as
well as the <hi>Iews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> after having obey'd the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Order which he receiv'd from
God, to preach the Gospel to <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
was no sooner returned to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
but the faithful Ones of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
not dreaming that his Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
render'd him infallible, dispute with
him; and tell him, after a manner that
shows that the Infallibility which we
now attribute to him, was to them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63500:30"/>
               <hi>Thou wentest unto Men uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd,
and didst eat with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many Years, as it seems after that,
<hi>Peter</hi> being at <hi>Antioch,</hi> had not the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to maintain openly that the Jews
might eat with the Gentiles without
scruple. <hi>For before that certain Persons
came from</hi> James, <hi>he did eat with the
Gentiles: but when they were come he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,
and separated himself, fearing them
which were of the Circumcision: And the
other Iews dissembled likewise with him,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that St. <hi>Paul</hi> observing, <hi>that they
walked not uprightly, was obliged to tell</hi>
Peter <hi>before them all, If thou being a Iew
livest after the manner of Gentiles, and
not as do the Iews, why compellest thou
the Gentiles to live as do the Iews?</hi> It is
said that St. <hi>Peter.</hi> was guilty of a fault
only in his Conduct, and not in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
that he believ'd and maintain'd
the same with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but that on this
occasion he dissembled his Opinion; and
that he did not otherways constrain
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to live as the <hi>Iews,</hi> but in
abstaining to eat with them. The <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
say they, seeing that St. <hi>Peter</hi> did
not eat with them because they were
uncircumcis'd, did, by reason of this
his Conduct, believe themselves oblig'd
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63500:31"/>
to be circumcis'd, and consequently
to observe the other Ceremonies of the
Law. They believ'd that it was a Sin
to continue uncircumcis'd, because St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
forbore to live familiarly with them
on that account; and on the contrary
that it was a Duty to observe the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision.
So that it was by his Conduct
only that St. <hi>Peter</hi> forc'd them to live as
<hi>Iews.</hi> And indeed it is true that by
efficaciously engaging one to do a thing,
after what manner soever it be, we are
said to force one to do it. See <hi>Gen.</hi> xix.
3. <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 19.</p>
            <p>I believe really that this is the best
Explanation. But it proves clearly that
the Metaphysical Infallibility which is
attributed to the Apostles is not of
Apostolick Tradition. For, in truth,
to dissemble a true Doctrine when they
ought to preach it, and to ingage Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in an Error by their Conduct, is
visibly a human Weakness, and which
becomes not those who are look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as the simple Instruments of the
holy Spirit speaking by their Mouths.
St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Conduct gave the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
to understand, as well as if he had
told it them, that they must observe
the Circumcision; and to give them
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63500:31"/>
to understand it by forbearing to eat
with them, was almost the same thing
as to tell it them by word of Mouth.
Nay more, it is not unlikely that
St. <hi>Peter</hi> believed that this Dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
was lawful, as well as St. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi>
and the other <hi>Iews</hi> who had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
his Example; otherwise it is not
credible that so pious Men, who were
the first Ministers of the Gospel, would
have done it. And so we must confess
that they were guilty of some weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
even in Doctrine, although they
recanted it soon, nor was it of great
importance.</p>
            <p>There is also a great difference ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
in the manner of Christ's
speaking <hi>(He that had received the Spirit
without measure)</hi> and that in which the
Apostles express themselves; whereas
according to the common Opinion it
ought to be the same. If the same
Spirit had render'd them infallible, they
had right to declare to the World the
Doctrine of Salvation with the same
Power, and to speak as authoritatively
as Jesus Christ. But we see the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in their Writings. Christ spoke
<hi>as one having Authority. You have heard
it was said of old,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But I say unto
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63500:32"/>
you,</hi> &amp;c. The Apostles, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
declare that they say nothing of
themselves, and refer all to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and to Jesus Christ: <hi>Acts</hi> xxvi.
22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 23.</p>
            <p>And that which is yet more conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
is, that they distinguish manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that which they say themselves from
that which Christ had said. <hi>And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Married, I command, yet not I, but
the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But to the rest speak I,
not the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
vii. 10, 12. which he would not have
done, had he been aware that his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
had believ'd his words as infallible
as the words of Christ.</p>
            <p>Methinks these are convincing Proofs
that the Apostles had not a perpetual
Inspiration, which might give their
words an indisputable Authority. I
do not deny but they had many imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Inspirations, and divers Heavenly
Visions; as appears by the <hi>Acts,</hi> by
the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and by divers other
places of Scripture; Nay, I am so fully
perswaded they had, that I think him
no good Christian who doubts of it.
But the Question here is concerning an
uniform, constant and ordinary Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63500:32"/>
as it is commonly explained in
the Divinity-Schools.</p>
            <p>It may be you will say there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Arguments for this sort of Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as strong as those I have brought
to shew the contrary. The Apostles
began their Letter <hi>Acts</hi> xv. after this
manner, <hi>It has seemed good to the Holy Ghost
and to us.</hi> By which it appears, say some,
that they were fill'd with the Spirit of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,
which dictated to them what
they ought to say, I desire first, that
those who say so, reconcile this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
with the Dispute that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Apostles, before they came
to this Conclusion. In the second place:
It is not likely that if the Holy Ghost
had possess'd them in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that they had been only simple
Instruments by which He express'd his
Will they should not have plac'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in equal Rank with the Him;
but should have said simply, It has
appear'd good to the Holy Ghost, who
speaks by us. What Prophet ever said,
it seem'd good to God and to me? In
the third place: Suppose there be here,
as the Critics say, a Figure by which is
express'd one and the same thing by
two words; and that this manner of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63500:33"/>
speaking amounts to no more but this, <hi>It
has seemed good to us who are full of the
Holy Ghost;</hi> The perpetual Inspiration
about which I am now arguing cannot
be hence concluded. The Apostles and
all the Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> were ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
by the Spirit of the Gospel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being continually full of the Spirit
of Prophecy. If it were otherwise, we
should be forced to say that the whole
Church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> not only the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
but also the Elders of the Church,
and all those who were assembled, were
perpetually accompanied with a Spirit of
Infallibility; which no body ever yet said,
nor is it at all likely. In the fourth place;
The Conclusion of the Letter they write,
seems extreamly weak for the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a positive Law. FROM WHICH
YOU SHALL DO WELL TO KEEP YOUR
SELVES. A Prophet under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
would have said, <hi>From which
keep your selves;</hi> for so saith the Lord,
whose Commandments you cannot slight
without your own Destruction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some may also here object the Spirit
of <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Tongues,</hi> which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
received the day of <hi>Pentecost.</hi>
But the Effusion of that miraculous Spirit
did not necessarily render all those that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63500:33"/>
receiv'd it infallible in Doctrine. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
all the Christians of that time had
been infallible. The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi>
had receiv'd the Holy Ghost, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the Epistles St. <hi>Paul</hi> directs
to it; and so should not have needed
that Apostle's Instructions, because it
had a great number of infallible Persons
within it self: But it appears, on the
contrary, that it needed his Instructions,
not only to correct its Vices, but also
to resolve its Doubts, and even to
rectify its Errors.</p>
            <p>Thus then the Spirit of Miracles not
being accompanied with Infallibility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it connot be concluded, because the
Apostles receiv'd that Spirit the day of
<hi>Pentecost,</hi> that they became as Gods,
and that they were out of all danger
of ever falling into the least Error. But
what signify then these words; <hi>When
the Spirit of Truth shall come, he will lead
you into all Truth?</hi> This Spirit of Truth
is it not the miraculous Spirit which the
Apostles receiv'd.</p>
            <p>I have already observ'd that these
words cannot be understood rigorously,
as if the Apostles had known all Sciences. I
must add further, that there is something
extreamly figurative in them; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63500:34"/>
by the following words; <hi>For he
shall not speak of himself, but what soever
he shall hear, that he shall speak; and
he shall shew ye things to come. He shall
glorify me, for he shall receive of mine,
and shall shew it unto you. All things
that the Father hath are mine; therefore
said I that he shall take of mine, and shew
it unto you.</hi> What Opinion soever a
Man may be of concerning the Holy
Spirit, it is plain that these words can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be taken properly, as if the Holy
Spirit had heard from God, or Jesus
Christ, that with which he ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
the Apostles.</p>
            <p>The most simple sense, and most
conformable to the accomplishment of
this Promise, which can be given to
these words, is, to my thinking, this.
I should explain many things to you
more clearly than I have done, but you
are not yet in condition to receive them
as you should. When you shall have
received the Spirit of Miracles, he will
teach you the rest that you ought to
know; either by Visions, or by making
you call to mind that which I have told
you; so that he will make you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the sense, and will teach you what
you ought to do afterwards. To speak
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63500:34"/>
properly, he will tell you nothing new;
he will but recal into your memory, to
make you better understand it, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of my Father; which is the same
that I have taught you; and which I
may also call my Doctrine, because my
Father has charg'd me to preach it, as
the only Doctor of his Church.</p>
            <p>The Holy Spirit <hi>led the Apostles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all Truths; and took that which was
Christ's, without ever speaking of himself;</hi>
in making them call to mind that which
they had forgotten; and in making
them understand on divers occasions, or
even by extraordinary Revelations, that
which Christ had said to them, but
which they then understood not. This
is plainly that which Christ teaches us
in these words; <hi>These things have I spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
unto you, being yet present with you.
But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost,
whom the Father will send in my Name,
he shall teach you</hi> ALL THINGS, AND
BRING ALL THINGS TO YOUR REMEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BRANCE,
WHATSOEVER I HAVE SAID UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TO
YOU, <hi>Iohn</hi> XIV. 25 These last
words apparently explain the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>He shall teach you all Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In effect, there is nothing in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Apostles, which Christ
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:63500:35"/>
had not told them; and in leaving
them, he gave them no other order for
the preaching of the Gospel, but <hi>to
teach all People to observe all those things
which he had commanded them.</hi> And the
Apostles observe in several places, that
it was not till after they had received the
Holy Spirit, that they remember'd, and
understood divers things which Christ
had told them when he was here below.
<hi>These things understood not the Disciples at
the first,</hi> says St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> XII. 16. <hi>but when Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
was enter'd into his Glory, then remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd
they that these things were written of
him.</hi> See the same Evangelist, II. 22.
and <hi>Acts</hi> XI. 16.</p>
            <p>This is, in my Opinion, the sense of
Christ's words; at least I find nothing
among the Interpreters, that answers
so well to the Event; which thorowly
convinces me that. Christ must have
meant some such thing. For when all's
done, whatsoever may be said, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
ought to be understood by its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency
with the Accomplishment,
and there is no better Interpreter of
Prophecies than their execution.</p>
            <p>This being so, the Infallibility of the
Apostles, according to my judgment,
consisted in this. They knew clearly
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63500:35"/>
the general Principles of the Jewish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which had been taught them
from their Cradle; they had heard
Christ often tell what the Gospel added
to Judaism; or if you will, Christ had
explain'd to them more clearly the Will
of God, and had shown them the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of the <hi>Pharisees;</hi> He had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
them concerning the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
and had made appear to them by many
Proofs, that himself was <hi>HE;</hi> God had
rais'd him from the Dead, and they had
convers'd with him after his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and in the last place, they had seen
him ascend into Heaven, from whence he
assur'd them he would come one Day to
judg the Quick and the Dead. They
preach'd faithfully that which they had
heard, that which they had seen with
their Eyes, that which they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
with attention, and that which
they had touch'd with their Hands.
They could declare, without any mistake,
what they had seen; they could preach
what they had heard. For the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Jesus Christ was compris'd in
a few Articles, plain enough to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
and consequently easy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered.
Thus they related infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
what they had seen and heard;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63500:36"/>
and therein it is that their Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
consisted. Perhaps also the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Miracles which Christ sent them,
strengthned their Memories, and open'd
their Minds after a manner we compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
not. But it is certain, as I have
made it appear, that this Spirit directed
them not in so miraculous a manner,
as to make it necessary for us to regard
all they said or writ with the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
as the words of Jesus Christ, the
only Master, and the only infallible Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
that ever was amongst Men. He
was the only Mystical Ark, in which
<hi>the Godhead dwelt bodily,</hi> from whence
proceeded nothing but Oracles.</p>
            <p>Some may ask, perhaps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whether it
might not so happen that the Apostles
might abandon the Truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
and preach a false Doctrine; and
if it might be so, how we can be assur'd
that they were not Deceivers? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that though it was very unlikely,
that after having receiv'd so many Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
and Graces, they should fall
into Apostacy; yet it was not absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impossible. But in that case God
would not have approv'd by Miracles
the Doctrine they taught; and thereby
it is that we may know they were no
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63500:36"/>
Seducers. There crept in, during their
Time, many false Prophets among the
Christians; but they were presently
discover'd because they could not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
by Miracles, a Doctrine contrary
to that of the Apostles, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by an infinity of Wonders. God
made appear, by those Prodigies, that
the Apostles declar'd nothing but what
was conformable to his Will, nor any
thing that could be hurtful to Piety;
for it is impossible that God would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
a Doctrine which should turn Men
from Holiness. But we must not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
neither, as I have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
that because God wrought Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
in favour of any Person, it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
follows that all things pronounced
by that Person, were immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd,
and ought to be receiv'd as the
infallible Decisions of him that never
errs. Provided that Person maintained
the Substance of the Gospel, and said
nothing but what conduced to Piety,
God would not cease to bear Witness
to his Doctrine, although all his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings
were not Demonstrations. God
would not that this Mark of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
should be interpreted, as if
he had thereby declared that he would
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63500:37"/>
have all the Words of those that had
miraculous Gifts receiv'd as Oracles.
To be fully convinc'd hereof we need
but read the first Epistle to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must nevertheless ingenuously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that there is mention made in
this Epistle of some miraculous Gifts,
which seem to have been pure Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;
and which ought to make the
Speakers attended unto, as if they were
the simple Interpreters of the Holy
Spirit. <hi>The Spirit,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor.
VII. 8. <hi>gives to one the word of Wisdom,
to another the word of Knowledg.</hi> It
seems as if he meant thereby the Gift
of prophesying; that is to say, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
others in Piety; of which he
says many things in the XIVth Chapter
of the same Epistle. This seems con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to what I have been saying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Inspiration of the Apostles,
and I confess I cannot see how, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to my Notion, this difficulty can be
clearly solv'd. I might say that this
Gift of Prophecy was perhaps no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a Disposition of Mind, which
God infus'd sometimes into those on
whom he bestow'd it, by which they
became fit to instruct; although he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63500:37"/>
them not extraordinarily with
that which they were to say; which is
so much the more likely, by how much
this Gift was preserv'd and increas'd
by Study and Reading; as appears by
those words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy.</hi> First
Epist. Chap. IV. 13, &amp;c. <hi>Vntil I come,
give thy self to Reading, to Exhortation,
to Instruction: Neglect not the Grace which
is in thee, which was given thee by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
through the Imposition of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery:
Meditate on these things, be always
imployed, to the end they Improvement may
be known of all Men.</hi> Now it is plain
that the Gifts which are owing to an
actual and immediate Inspiration of
the holy Spirit, such as curing Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> could not be increas'd by Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of Mind, as not depending
upon Man in any sort. The most assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous
Study cannot contribute any
thing to prophetick, or immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations.</p>
            <p>This Conjecture seems probable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
And indeed I see no other way
of explaining what St. <hi>Paul</hi> says to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy.</hi>
But without determining any
thing concerning the Gift of Prophecy,
it appears plainly by what St. <hi>Paul</hi> says,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XIV. that it consisted not in an
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63500:38"/>
immediate Revelation of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that forced the Prophets to speak.
He there gives them this Advice; <hi>Let the
Prophets speak two or three, and let another
judg; but if any thing be revealed to one
of those that sits by, let the first hold his
Peace: for ye may all prophesy one by one,
to the end that all may learn, and all may be
comforted: And the Spirits of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
are subject to the Prophets.</hi> The
Prophets whom the holy Spirit had
inspir'd immediately with what they
ought to say, had no need of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
Nay it had even been ridiculous.
Because the holy Spirit inspiring them
with what they had to say, would have
inspired them likewise as to the occasion
and the place, and would not have put
many Persons on speaking at one time
in the same place, nor so as to interrupt
others who spake by his Inspiration.
Moreover St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
judg one another, and that the Spirits
of the Prophets be subject to the Prophets;</hi>
which cannot be understood of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
immediately inspir'd, who are
subject to none but God, and who are
to give account to none but him. The
Prophets of the Old Testament spoke
as long as God inspir'd them; after
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:63500:38"/>
which they held their Peace, without
needing any Advertisement; because
they easily perceiv'd when the Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
ceas'd.</p>
            <p>It seems to me that we may now
conclude, that there never was any
body but our Saviour, who had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and perpetual Inspiration, and all
whose words we ought to receive as
Oracles. As he alone amongst Men
was incapable of sinning, so it was
he alone whom God indow'd with an
absolute Infallibility. The same Light
which perpetually inlighten'd his Mind,
regulated also the Motions of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections:
otherwise it would be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to conceive how he could chuse but
be subject to Error, if he had been sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Sin. There is so great a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
between the Mind and the
Affections, that it is not almost possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
there should be any Irregularity
in the one, without a disorder in the
other.</p>
            <p>But that you may not believe I am the
first Author of this Opinion, and that it
is a desire to appear singular, or an Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Novelty that has ingag'd me in
this Notion, I must also let you see that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63500:39"/>
some great Men have been of the same
Mind before me. St. <hi>Ierom</hi> makes this
Observation upon the fifth Chapter of
the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> in speaking of this
Passage; <hi>And thou</hi> Bethlehem Ephratah,
<hi>though thou be little among the thousands
of</hi> Judah, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which St. <hi>Matthew</hi> cites
otherwise than it is either in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
or Septuagint.<note n="*" place="margin">Sunt qui asserunt in om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus poenè te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimoniis, quae de veteri Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stamento su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muntur, istius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi esse er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorem; ut aut ordo mutetur, aut verba, &amp; interdum sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus quo<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> ipse diversus sit; vel Apostolis vel Evangelistis non ex libro carpentibus Testimonia, sed memoriae cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentibus, quae nonnunquam fallitur.</note> 
               <hi>There are,</hi> says
he, <hi>that affirm there is the like Error in
almost all the Testimonies that are taken
out of the Old Testament; that either the
Order is chang'd, or the Words, and that
sometimes the Sense it self differs; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
or Evangelists not transcribing the
Testimonies out of the Book, but trusting to
their Memory which sometimes fail'd them.</hi>
It is true, St. <hi>Ierom</hi> says not that he
approves this Opinion, but he makes it
appear elsewhere that he is not very
far from it. In his Letter to <hi>Pammachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
(de optimo genere interpretandi)</hi> of the
best way of interpreting; He gathers
together many Examples of the New
Testament, by which he shews that
the Apostles tie themselves more to the
Sense than to the Words; and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
with good reason, that we should
not play the Criticks on them for it,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63500:39"/>
nor even for the places where they have
mistaken Names. After having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
the Quotation <hi>Matth.</hi> XXVII. 9.
with the Original, he adds;<note n="†" place="margin">Accusent Apostolum fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitatis quod nec cum He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braico, nec cum Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginta congrauat Translatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, &amp; quod his majus est, ERRET IN NOMINE, pro Zacharia quippe Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miam posuit.</note> 
               <hi>One may
accuse the Apostle of falsity in that he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
neither with the Hebrew nor with the
Septuagint; and which is more, that he is
mistaken in the Name, putting</hi> Jeremy
<hi>for</hi> Zachary. He seems indeed else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
to disapprove that Opinion;
but it is usual with him to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
himself to the common Opinion,
and yet not omit to give his own;
without being concern'd whether he
contradicted himself or no. When he
speaks as others do, you must not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
presently that he is of the same
Opinion with them, because it may
be he speaks so by way of Condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
whereas when he says the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
it seems rather that he speaks
his own Thoughts. You need but read
what he says of the Dissimulation
which he attributes to St. <hi>Peter</hi> and
St. <hi>Paul</hi> (in his Commentary upon the
second Chapter of the Epistle to the
<hi>Galatians,</hi> and in his Answer to St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin)</hi>
to see that he believ'd that St. <hi>Paul</hi>
by a Prudence purely human (which he
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63500:40"/>
calls a <hi>Dispensation</hi>) made shew of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was in the wrong;
insomuch that when St. <hi>Paul</hi> says <hi>that
St. Peter was to be reprov'd, because he
walked not uprightly according to the Truth
of the Gospel;</hi> It was not that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
so, but only to hinder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<hi>Gentiles</hi> from imitating that
Apostle. I say not that St. <hi>Ierom</hi> was
herein in the right; but at least it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
appears that he believ'd not that
the Apostles were mov'd by a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Inspiration to write what they
did. We may joyn with St. <hi>Ierom,
Origen,</hi> (from whom he had this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
concerning the Dispensation
that he attributes to these two Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles)
and divers <hi>Greek Fathers,</hi> who
also followed <hi>Origen;</hi> as St. <hi>Ierom</hi>
writing to St. <hi>Austin</hi> observes, in the
Apology he makes for this part of his
Commentary.</p>
            <p>Thus you see that the most able In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
of Scripture, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Antiquity has had, have been
of the same Opinion with me. I
may also say that the most Learned
Criticks of these last Ages have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
the same thing, since <hi>Erasmus</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:63500:40"/>
and <hi>Grotius</hi> have publickly maintain'd
it; those two great Men, who are
beyond dispute in the first Rank a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Moderns that have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
themselves in writing on the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

Nor is the Authority of the
Scripture forthwith questionable
because they differ in Words or
Sense, as long as the main of the
Matter treated of, and that
whereon our Salvation depends,
is clear. For as that Divine
Spirit, that govern'd the Mind
of the Apostles, suffered them
to be ignorant of some things,
to make Mistakes, and to err
(either in Iudgment or Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
without any damage to the
Gospel; nay it improves that
failing to the help of our Faith; so
it is not unlikely that it so influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
the Faculty of their Memory
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63500:41"/>
that though something after the
manner of Men might scape
them, yet that should not only not
derogate from the Credit of the
Holy Scripture, but might even
gain Credit to it, with those who
otherwise might be apt to slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it as written by Confederacy.

               <hi>It is better, and would perhaps
cause less Scandal, to acknowledg
freely and willingly a light fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Memory (that so we may
not seem to favour things wrested

use of absurd Interpretations in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
of lighter failings. Otherwise
the suspicion of a failing is not
only not avoided, but it is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
and because the Fault is not
acknowledged, it seems as if Truth
were not in good earnest sought by
us, but that Obstinacy were for
some reason or other made use of;
which ought to be look'd upon
as the greatest Reproach ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable

the Apostles might be deceived in
things of small importance, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could fall into any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Error for want of Memory. And
the principal Reason he gives is, For
that the Fundamental Doctrines de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
not on a Circumstance, which
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63500:43"/>
they could forget; nor have they any
thing in them obscure, or hard to be
retain'd; <hi>Which is so true,</hi> says he,
<hi>that I make no difficulty to affirm, That
if any one says there is a Sense in the
Scripture necessary to Salvation, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
at first contrary to Reason, we ought
thereby to judg he attributes to the Scripture
a Sense it has not. And this is what I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and am convinc'd of by reading the
sacred Books.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confess that the most part of Divines
now a days are of a contrary Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But as I pretend not to oblige any
body to approve my Judgment by the
Authority of those I have quoted, so
neither do I hold my self obliged to
submit to the Authority of a crowd of
Learned Men, who do but say the same
thing one after another, without ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
or bringing Reasons for it.</p>
            <p>We must however observe here two
things of very great importance, which
are not ordinarily reflected on: The
first is, That in one Controversy which
we have with the Roman Church, our
Divines do all agree, that we ought
not to have so much regard to Words
as Things; for, upon supposition that
in the Apocryphal Books there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63500:43"/>
contrary to Piety, they say that
the Controversy about them is not
considerable. Now if there be no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in believing Expressions to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
that have nothing in them but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
when the Doctrines therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
are not contrary to the reveal'd
Truth; What danger can there be in
believing that any Truths which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
to be Divine, are express'd in
Terms not divinely inspir'd? The same
reason that makes us believe there is no
danger in the one, perswades us also
there is none in the other. It is because
we are not sav'd by the Words, but by
the Things.</p>
            <p>The other thing observable is, that
we receive amongst the Canonical Books
of the New Testament, Writings whose
Authors are not well known; which
we could not do, if we thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
in receiving a Book as Canonical,
to be assur'd that every Word was
inspir'd; since to be assur'd thereof
we sought to have evident Proofs that
it was a Man inspir'd by God who
was the Author of that Book. For
Example, it is not known who writ
the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> whether
it were an Apostle, or some Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Apostles; so that we cannot
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63500:44"/>
know whether the words of that Epistle
were inspir'd or not. But for all that,
it is receiv'd; because it is certain it was
written in the Apostles time, and because
it contains nothing that is not perfectly
conformable to their Doctrine. Thus
it is generally thought of little impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
whether the words be divinely
inspir'd or no, provided the things they
express be true. So that one may say,
that in truth Divines are generally very
favourable to the Opinion I maintain,
although themselves are not aware of it.</p>
            <p>I do not think it necessary to insist
much in proving that God has not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
dictated to the Apostles the very
words that they used; since it is evident
that he did not always dictate to them
the things. Not that I make any doubt
but he has often reveal'd to them the
things, and even inspir'd them with the
very words, as in the Prophecies where
there was need to remember divers
Names, and when they spoke strange
Languages. Tho it may nevertheless be
suppos'd, that (as to what concerns the
Gift of Tongues) God dispos'd at once
the Brains of them that receiv'd it, in
such a manner that they could without
trouble joyn certain Sounds to certain I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas;
just as they would have done if they
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63500:44"/>
had been us'd to it from their Infancy;
and that afterwards he left them at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to make use of those new Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
according as they should think
fit. And thus those that learn'd, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration
the Language of the <hi>Medes,</hi>
for Example, had their Brains dispos'd
in the same manner as they would have
had if they had learn'd that Language
from their Infancy, and could make use
of it as easily as their Mother-Tongue.
At least it is evident that some who had
receiv'd this miraculous Gift did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
abuse it; which they would not
have done, if they never had spoken
those Languages but by present imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Inspiration. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XIV.</p>
            <p>But without determining that Point,
I believe, with <hi>Erasmus,</hi> that the
Apostles learn'd not the Greek they
us'd by Inspiration; because if it were
so, they would have spoke it like the
Native Grecians; whereas they mix'd
with it a world of Hebraisms, as the
<hi>French</hi> that speak Latin do Gallicisms.
See <hi>Erasmus</hi> upon <hi>Acts</hi> X.</p>
            <p>Not that I believe, neither, that they
had learn'd the Greek Language by the
Commerce they had with the Greeks
during the Functions of their Charge, as
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63500:45"/>
               <hi>Erasmus</hi> thought probable: it is more
likely they had learn'd it from their
Infancy. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> who was born
in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> where they spoke nothing
but Greek, undoubtedly had learn'd
it young; but he corrupted it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by his long dwelling in <hi>Iudaea;</hi>
where besides the Greek, they spake
a broken Chaldee, whose Dialect mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Greek render'd it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
and difficult, such as is the Stile
of that Apostle.</p>
            <p>The others that were born in <hi>Iudaea</hi>
had learn'd it also from their Infancy,
as it was commonly there spoken; that
is to say, extreamly corrupted by the
ancient Language of the Country, which
was still spoken there, as appears by
divers places of the New Testament.
This the same <hi>Erasmus</hi> has well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd

almost all the East, as</hi> Jerom <hi>says, spoke
Greek. And I cannot think that the holy
Spirit made them to forget what they had
formerly learn'd.</hi> The Greek Language
then was spoken in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> together
with the ancient Language which the
Jews brought from <hi>Babylon,</hi> that is to
say the <hi>Chaldean;</hi> but corrupted in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of time, as the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Flemish</hi>
are spoke together now adays in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
And as the <hi>French</hi> they now speak
in <hi>Flanders</hi> is full of the <hi>Flemish</hi> Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
and of Terms unknown in <hi>France,</hi>
so the Greek of <hi>Iudaea</hi> vvas heretofore
full of Chaldaisms, and of barbarous
ways of speaking, which undoubtedly
grated the Grecian's Ears.</p>
            <p>The History of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
that tells us in several places
that Hebrew or Chaldean was spoken
in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> tells us also that they us'd
another Language, which could be no
other than Greek. St. <hi>Luke</hi> observes
<hi>Acts</hi> XXII. that St. <hi>Paul</hi> haranguing the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63500:46"/>
Jews, began to speak to them in Hebrew,
and that <hi>when they understood him speak
to them in the Hebrew Language, they
hearken'd to him with the greater silence;</hi>
which gives us to understand that he
might have spoke to the People in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Language; for otherwise there
had been no ground to observe that
they listn'd more attentively, when
they perceiv'd he spake Hebrew; seeing
that in speaking any other Language
but Hebrew they could not have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
him. It appears then that Greek
was spoken in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> and it is likely
<hi>Pilat</hi> spoke Greek to our Lord, and that
our Lord answer'd him in the same. The
People only preferr'd the Language of
the Country before the Greek; which
was not so ancient, and which they
had not learn'd but by force, because of
the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> that tyranniz'd over
them; and so they spoke it not exactly.</p>
            <p>It is true, there were <hi>Iews</hi> that spoke
Greek very purely; but they were such
as were born in Countries where only
Greek was spoken, as <hi>Philo;</hi> or they had
acquir'd a habit of speaking good Greek
by reading or studying, as <hi>Iosephus.</hi>
So at this day there are <hi>Walloons</hi> that
speak French very well, (altho the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:63500:46"/>
of that People speak it extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ill) because they have taken much
pains to correct in themselves the Faults
which others commit, they have apply'd
themselves to reading, or they have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
in <hi>France.</hi> These Jews born in the
Countries where nothing but Greek was
spoken, understood not the ancient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
nor the Hebrew then spoken in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea.</hi>
They made use in their Synagogues
of the Version of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and
because they spoke nothing but Greek,
they were call'd the <hi>Hellenist Iews. Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
in his Book of the <hi>Hellenist Tongue,</hi>
against <hi>Heinsius,</hi> shows that these Jews
spoke very good Greek; and that it is
very absurd in some Learned Men to
imagine there was an <hi>Hellenish Tongue;</hi>
as if the Hebrews that knew not their
own Language, had a particular one
different from that of the places where
they dwelt; and that this Language was
that of the <hi>Septuagint</hi> and of the New
Testament. If a Name were to be
given to this corrupted Greek, it should
rather be call'd <hi>Hebraistic;</hi> because it is
full of Hebraisms, or Chaldaisms. But
as the Language of the <hi>Walloons,</hi> or of
some of the Provinces of <hi>France,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pass for a particular Language,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63500:47"/>
being nothing but a corrupted <hi>French,</hi>
so neither ought the barbarous Greek
of <hi>Iudaea</hi> to pass for a Language by
it self, different from the Greek Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
            <p>It is no wonder then if the Apostles,
who had liv'd a good part of their
Lives in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> or who were born there,
and had not apply'd themselves to learn
perfectly the Greek Tongue, nor to
speak it in purity, use it so improperly
in their Writings. St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself,
born in a Town that spoke nothing but
Greek, had so corrupted his Speech by
his long dwelling in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses,
<hi>he was ignorant in the Language,</hi>
2 Cor. XI. 6. as sufficiently appears by all
his Epistles, the Greek whereof is very
different from that of <hi>Iosephus.</hi> And
therefore the Greek Fathers have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
of the obscurity of his Stile, of
the barbarous Phrases that are therein,
and of apparent Confusion in the order
of his Discourses; and those who very
readily understood <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Demosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
were oblig'd, as <hi>Erasums</hi> judiciously
observes, to take great pains to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
St. <hi>Paul.</hi> We need but compare
his Stile with that of some Greek
Author, to find that this Apostle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63500:47"/>
himself not much to the Greek
Eloquence.</p>
            <p>It is plain then that the holy Spirit
inspir'd not the Apostles with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
they were to use. If it had
been so, St. <hi>Paul</hi> could not have said,
<hi>he was ignorant in the Language.</hi> He should
have said, that the holy Spirit inspir'd
him with a Language such as was that
of the People. And all the Greek Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
would have blasphemed against
the holy Spirit, when they observ'd the
little Eloquence of St. <hi>Paul:</hi> for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this Supposition, that would not
have proceeded from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but from
the holy Spirit. If any one doubt of this,
he need but read <hi>Erasmus,</hi> in the places
I have cited. It is true, that a famous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Divine has undertaken to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
him, in his Annotations upon the
10<hi>th</hi> Chapter of the <hi>Acts;</hi> but he does
nothing but declame, as he is us'd to do,
against an Author more learned and
more judicious than himself, without
bringing any solid Reason.</p>
            <p>We must now speak a word of some
Books of the Old Testament, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
neither History nor Prophecy; such
are the Books of <hi>Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,</hi>
the Song of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Iob;</hi> which last
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63500:48"/>
is apparently a Dramatic Piece, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
nothing but the Subject is true; as
are the Tragedies of the Greek Poets.</p>
            <p>There is no Proof that what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> was inspir'd
to <hi>Solomon</hi> by God, after a Prophetic
manner. They are Moral Sentences,
which a good Man might well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce,
without Inspiration; as are
those contain'd in <hi>Ecclesiastious.</hi> There
are very many of them that are but
vulgar Proverbs, which carry indeed a
good Sense, but have nothing in them
of Divine. There are a great many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
about Oeconomy, which Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Country-People every-where
know without Revelation. See Chap.
XXIV. 27. and XXVII. 23. and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of a vertuous Woman at the
latter end of the Book. The Name of
Prophet is very liberally bestow'd on
<hi>Agur</hi> the Son of <hi>Iakeh,</hi> for some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities
that are found under his Name:
<hi>Prov.</hi> XXX. Whereas I dare be bold
to say better things might have been
said without the Spirit of Prophecy.
<hi>Three things,</hi> says he, for Example, <hi>are
too marvellouss for me, and even four
which I know not; The way of an Eagle
in the Air, The way of a Serpent on a Rock,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:63500:48"/>
The way of a Ship in the midst of the
Sea, and the way of a Man with a Maid.</hi>
One must have a mean Opinion of the
Spirit of Prophecy, to believe that it
dictated such things as these. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
neither does the Author pretend
to that Eminency; but says modestly
concerning himself, That <hi>he is more bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
than any Man, and has not the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of a Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is particularly one Precept
of good Husbandry, that is often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
which our Merchants now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
know, as well as the <hi>Israelites</hi> that
liv'd in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time. It is that which
expresly forbids them to be Surety for
any body, Chap. VI. 1. XVII. 18. XX. 16.
XXII. 26. XXVII. 13. It is true by the
Rules of good Husbandry a Man should
never be Surety, but there happens
oftentimes Cases wherein Charity ought
to be preferr'd before good Husbandry;
as appears by the Parable of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan,</hi>
who became Surety for the
Expence of the Jew, that was found
hurt on the Road. There is, methinks,
no great need that God should send
Prophets to teach Men good Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry;
on the contrary it was very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that Christ should preach Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:63500:49"/>
Some Learned Men have believ'd that
<hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> is a Dialogue; where a pious
Man disputes with an impious one who
is of the Opinion of the <hi>Sadduces.</hi> And
in effect there are things directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
one to another, which it cannot
be suppos'd the same Person speaks.
The <hi>Epicurean</hi> Conclusion (<hi>To eat, drink
and be merry, because a Man has nothing
else</hi>) which is up and down in many
places of this Book, is altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that Conclusion at the end of
the Work; <hi>Fear God, and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi>
&amp;c. But it is extreamly
difficult to distinguish the Persons, or to
find out exactly in the Name of what
Person the Author speaks in every
Passage. However it be, there appears
in it nothing of Prophetic; and there
is little likelihood that the Spirit of
God would set out, with so great
strength, the Arguments of <hi>Sadduces,</hi> or
perhaps of worse Men, to answer them
but in two or three words. Read the
beginning of the ninth Chapter, and
make Reflection on these words: <hi>The
living know that they shall die; but the dead
know not any thing, neither have they any
more a Reward; for the Memory of them
is forgotten. Also their Love and their
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63500:49"/>
Hatred, and their Envy is now perish'd;
neither have they any more a Portion for
ever in any thing that is done under the
Sun. Go thy way, eat thy Bread with Ioy,
and drink thy Wine with a merry Heart;
for God now accepteth thy Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grotius</hi> is of Opinion that this Book
was not writ by <hi>Solomon</hi> himself, but
that it is a Work compos'd under his
Name, by one that had been in <hi>Caldea;</hi>
because there are divers <hi>Caldean</hi> words
in it. If this Conjecture be true, as is not
impossible, then this Book will be nothing
but a Piece of Wit and Fancy, compos'd
by some of those that had been in the
Captivity. And I know one who has
studied much the Criticks of the holy
Scripture, that suspects the Author of
this Book to have been of the Opinion
that the <hi>Sadduces</hi> were of afterwards,
about the Immortality of the Soul and
the World to come. It seems to him
that this Author says nothing which a
true <hi>Sadduce</hi> might not say. But for my
part, I think it best to determine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
herein.</p>
            <p>It is commonly believ'd that the
Song of <hi>Solomon</hi> is a Mysterious Book,
describing the mutual Love between
Christ and his Church. But there is
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:63500:50"/>
no proof of it neither in the Old nor
New Testament, nor in the Book it
self. All that can be said is, that the
Jews explain this Book allegorically of
God, of <hi>Moses,</hi> and of the Jewish Church.
But a Man need but read their Allegories,
to see that they are the Visions of <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,</hi>
having no Foundation but in the
fanciful Extravagance of their Brains;
which frame of Mind our Divines have
so much inherited from them, that they
give themselves wholly up to find Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in every thing. Nay it must be
confess'd that some of them have in
that out-done the <hi>Rabbins;</hi> and that
there is nothing so Chimerical in the
Chaldee Paraphrast, as in the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
of those who pretend this Book
ought to be explained by <hi>Revelations;</hi>
and that in it are to be found all the
Wars about Religion of this past Age,
in <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Interim,</hi> the League of
<hi>Smalcald,</hi> the Peace of <hi>Passau,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>There being then no Proof of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
that are pretended to be in this
Book; if we judg by the Book it self,
we shall find it to be an Idyle, or Eglogue,
where <hi>Solomon</hi> brings himself in as a
Shepherd, and one of his Wives (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter, as the Learned
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:63500:50"/>
think) as a Shepherdess; That the Stile
is the same with that of the Pastoral
Poems of the Greeks and Latins, saving
that it is more rough and dithyrambic,
acccording to the Genius of the Hebrew
Poetry. You may compare the Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
<hi>Solomon</hi> makes use of in the fourth
Chapter with those <hi>Ovid</hi> uses in the
Pastoral Song he makes <hi>Polyphemus</hi> sing,
in the XIIIth Book of his <hi>Metamorphosis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Book of <hi>Iob</hi> is also a piece that
has nothing in it of Prophetic. The
Critics, who have any thing of a nice
Judgment, agree that it is a sort of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi-Comedy.
It is likely there was such
an one as <hi>Iob</hi> (since the Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi>
speaks of him) and that he met
with great Afflictions, which afforded
Subject to some Jew of the Captivity
to exercise his Wit upon. There are
in this Book, as well as in <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi>
many Chaldean words, which show
that it was compos'd either in <hi>Chaldea,</hi>
or after the return from the Captivity.
Divines agree that God inspir'd not
<hi>Iob</hi>'s Friends with what the Author
makes them say; and this Book being
written in Verse, seems to be a Work
of Meditation, wherein the Author
would make his Parts appear. Neither
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63500:51"/>
               <hi>Iob,</hi> nor his Friends could talk in that
manner, <hi>extempore.</hi> The design of the
work is to show, that Providence oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
afflicts good People, not to punish
them for any particular Sin, as if they
had deserv'd those Afflictions more than
others, but simply to try them, and
give them occasion to exercise their
Vertue. This is without doubt a Truth,
but there is no need of being a Prophet
to know it. And on the other side there
is one very remarkable Fault in this
Book. The Author brings in <hi>Iob</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
Chap. III. with Bitterness, and
extream Impatience, unworthy, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of a pious Man, who had the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of the true God, but even of a
Pagan that had any Wisdom. <hi>Let
the day perish in which I was born, and
the night wherein it was said, a Man-Child
in born,</hi> &amp;c. This manner of cursing
the day of his Birth with so much Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
becomes not a pious Man, such as
<hi>Iob,</hi> to what extremity soever he might
be reduc'd. It is to be guilty of great
<hi>Indecorum,</hi> to put into a good Man's
Mouth so passionate words; as well as
those that are in Chap. X. <hi>I will say unto
God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore
thou contendest with me. Becomes it thee to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63500:51"/>
oppress?</hi> &amp;c. After such Expressions as
these, which are very like Blasphemies,
God finds, says the Author, <hi>that his
Servant</hi> Job <hi>has spoke the thing that is
right before him,</hi> and is angry with his
Friends for believing that <hi>Iob</hi> was
afflicted for his Sins.</p>
            <p>It appears, methinks, hereby clearly
enough, that there was no Inspiration
in this Book, no more than in the three
foregoing. Not but that these Books
are useful, and may be read with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and Edification, as well as Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
read those which we at present call
<hi>Apochrypha.</hi> Nay it may be allow'd that
they which compos'd them had the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God; that is to say, were full of
Piety; and that they writ them with a
prospect of leading those that should
read them into the ways of Piety.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected, that these
Books being in the Jews Canon ought
to be acknowledg'd for divinely inspir'd,
rather than the <hi>Apocryphas</hi> that never
were in it. I answer to that; First, That
no clear Reason is brought to convince
us, that those who made the Canon, or
Catalogue of their Books, were infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or had any Inspiration, whereby
to distinguish inspir'd Books from those
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63500:52"/>
which were not. This Collection is
commonly attributed to <hi>Esdras</hi> and the
great <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> of his Time, amongst
whom they say were <hi>Zacchary, Haggai</hi>
and <hi>Malachy.</hi> But many learned Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not this Story, because no proof is
brought for it, except a very uncertain
Jewish Tradition. There is much more
likelihood that this Collection which
we have is the remainder of the ancient
Books of the Jews, which divers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Men at first gathered together,
and of which afterwards public use was
made in the Synagogues; whereas in
the time of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> (as appears by
the Book that bears his Name) they
read publickly only the Book of the
Law.</p>
            <p>In the second place, if you will stand
to the Jews Canon, it is plainly on my
side. They divide the Scripture into
three parts; of which the first contains
the Books of the Law; the second the
Books they call the Prophets; and the
third contain others which they call <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toubim,</hi>
or simply <hi>Writings;</hi> that is to say,
the <hi>Psalms,</hi> the <hi>Proverbs, Iob, Daniel, Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras,
Nehemiah,</hi> the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> and those
which they call the five little Books,
the Song of <hi>Solomon, Ruth,</hi> the <hi>Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63500:52"/>
Ecclesiastes,</hi> and <hi>Esther.</hi> They
believ'd that these Books (which they
call'd <hi>Chetoubim</hi>) were not inspir'd as
the other; and therefore they made
them a separate part of Scripture, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from the two former which they
believed to be inspir'd. This Division is
very ancient, having been in use in the
time of our Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> XXIV. 44. and
<hi>Iosephus</hi> owns it in his first Book against
<hi>Appion;</hi> which makes me believe that this
Opinion of the Jews is grounded upon
the Judgment, that those who collected
the Books of their Canon made of them.
It is certain <hi>Daniel</hi> is truly a Prophet,
as well as <hi>Isaiah;</hi> but it is likely they
have rank'd his Book among the <hi>Chetou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bim,</hi>
only because it was brought out
of <hi>Caldea</hi> after the Collection was made;
and perhaps because, being written in
<hi>Chaldean,</hi> it was in part translated into
Hebrew by some others, as some of the
Learned have conjectur'd. For the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Writings which make up this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
of the Scripture, being but Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,
or Books of Morality, or Songs,
they had reason to determine that there
was nothing of Prophetic in them; at
least not of the same kind of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
with that of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and others who
are properly call'd Prophets. It is true
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63500:53"/>
indeed there are some Predictions in the
Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> but they are not of
that sort of Predictions that proceed
from Inspiration or Revelation, as were
those of <hi>Isaiah. David</hi> never says, <hi>Thus
saith the Lord;</hi> nor is it said in his History
that in his time he passed for a Prophet.
It only happen'd that in speaking of his
own Person, he spoke things that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
not so much to himself as to the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> of whom he was (unknown to
himself) the Type. But I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
handl'd this sort of Prophecy.</p>
            <p>It may be said perhaps, that Christ
has acknowledg'd for divinely inspir'd
all the Books of the Old Testament,
and that for that reason alone, all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
ought to be of that belief. But
there is not any Passage in the Gospel,
where Christ tells us that all the Books
of the Old Testament were inspir'd by
God, both as to the Words and Things.
He approves them only in gross, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
descending to particulars, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
every Book by it self. It was
sufficient that there were divers Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in the Old Testament, the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
whereof was receiv'd among the
Jews, that pointed at him. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
never undertook to make a Critical
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63500:53"/>
Treatise upon the sacred Books, nor to
clear the Historical Differences in them.
His design was not to make us able Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics,
but good Men; and to bring us to
render to God the Obedience due to
him. He omitted nothing that might
instruct us in our Duty, but he never
trouble himself to correct certain Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of small importance, which might
be among the Jews.</p>
            <p>And if we must take all the words
of Christ, when he speaks of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in a strict sense; as if he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
the Books he cites to be
all inspir'd even to the least sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and the others on the contrary to
be excluded out of the number of the
sacred Books; we must reject many of
those that are commonly reputed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd.
Neither he nor his Apostles e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
cite the Works of <hi>Solomon,</hi> or the
Book of <hi>Iob;</hi> except that St. <hi>Iames</hi>
praises the Patience of <hi>Iob,</hi> which, to
speak properly, is not to cite the Book
but the History. And if we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from thence that all these Books
have been wrongfully put into the Jews
Canon, the common Opinion would be
found contrary to the Authority of
Christ and of his Apostles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:63500:54"/>
These Books then that we have spoken
of are not necessarily to be accounted
Divine for being in the Canon, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
of the Books of the Jews; which
Jesus Christ never call'd in question:
And there is no reason to interpret the
word Canonical as if it signified inspir'd
of God. The Jews put in their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
all the Fragments they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
of their ancient Books; they
left out none, because they had no
others. It was all their Library, the
rest having been lost in the Captivity, or
before, or after; for the Story sets not
down the time of that fatal loss. They
pretended not at first that this Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
consisted of no other but what was
divinely inspir'd. But in process of
time as there were therein many Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
that were truly Prophetic, and as
these were the only Books that had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scap'd
the general Loss which had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd
the rest, they began to be look'd
on with more respect than they had
been at first; and at length it came to be
believ'd that all these Books, that were
in the ancient Catalogue, were truly
divine. And whereas before that time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Men apply'd themselves to the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of what was most considerable
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63500:54"/>
in the Law, without making many
Commentaries; from thence forwards
they grew nice about the words; would
take every thing in a strict-sense; and by
seeking for Mysteries where there were
none, they abandon'd the most essential
part of the Jewish Religion. They made
the knowledg of Religion to consist
in the study of a thousand vain Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Piety to consist in the scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
Observations of Ceremonial
Laws, according as the Doctors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
them. This the <hi>Pharisees</hi> did
in our Lord's Time, and it is also that
which the Divines among the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
both Ancient and Modern, have
imitated since the Death of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
In their time Men apply'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to learn their Doctrine, without
subtilizing about their Expressions; and
this they did upon the assurance they
had that those holy Men taught faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
what they had learn'd from Christ.
Since then, it has been the practice to
dispute about their Words, and to
strain to the utmost divers of their
Expressions, which were not over ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act;
from whence many Factions have
been begot amongst Christians, who
have fall'n foul one upon another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63500:55"/>
the meaning of some such parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Expressions of the Apostles, and
have neglected at the same time to
obey the Precepts of Jesus Christ; that
is to say, they have abandon'd the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Substance of Religion, to busy
themselves about the Outside. Men
have thought it an Honour to be stil'd
that which they call zealous Orthodox,
to be firmly link'd to a certain Party,
to load others with Calumnies, and to
damn by an absolute Authority the rest
of Mankind; but have taken no care
to demonstrate the sincertity and fervor
of their Piety, by an exact Observation
of the Gospel Morals; which has come
to pass by reason that Orthodoxy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
very well with our Passions,
whereas the severe Morals of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
are incompatible with our way of
living.</p>
            <p>Thus much by the by, to let you see
that this great Zeal which Men have
for the Letter of the Scripture, is but
a Cloak they make use of, to hide the
little esteem they have for the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it self of Jesus Christ; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
not in Criticisms, or Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
but in keeping God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:63500:55"/>
But it will be ask'd then, What Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
we allow the Holy Scripture,
and what use is to be made of it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to these Principles? To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
hereto, I begin with the New
Testament, which is the principal Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of our Faith. In the first place
then, Jesus Christ in whom were hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
all the Treasures of Wisdom and
Knowledg, and whom God had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
commanded us <hi>To hear,</hi> was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
infallible. We must believe
without questioning it whatever he says;
because he says it, and because God
hath testified that he speaks nothing but
Truth.</p>
            <p>In the second place, since we have
nothing writ by Christ himself, we
ought to believe what his Apostles have
said concerning his Life and Doctrine;
because God has given Testimony to
them by the Miracles he inabl'd them to
do; and because they seal'd the Truth
of their Deposition with their Blood.
They tell us what they had seen and
heard, so that it was impossible they
should be deceiv'd in the substance of
the History and Doctrine. It may be
that in some Circumstance of small im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
they do not relate things exactly
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:63500:56"/>
as they happen'd, and that therein
they do not agree together. But they
all agree in the Historical Facts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Faith we have in Jesus Christ,
is grounded; his Birth of a Virgin,
his Miracles, his Death, his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and his Ascension into Heaven;
though there may be some difference
among them in some Circumstance,
which is nothing to the substance of
the History. It is not necessary for the
Foundation of our Faith, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
observ'd, that they should agree
exactly in all things to the least tittle;
and the trouble the Learned have given
themselves to reconcile these sort of
Contradictions is of no use. It were
better to own ingenuously that there
are some, than to strain the sense of
their Writings, to make them agree
one with another; which instead of
converting Libertins, does but excite
their Railery and confirms them in
their Impiety. As to what concerns
the Doctrine of Jesus Christ, there is
not the least Contradiction among the
Evangelists; although it be express'd
in different Terms, and they relate
it on divers occasions. We must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:63500:56"/>
therefore that they relate only the
Sense, and keep not exactly the same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that Christ kept in preaching it; so
neither ought we to insist rigorously
upon their Expressions, as if they made
use of some words rather than others,
to insinuate certain Niceties which are
ordinarily attributed to them, without
any probable ground; nor ought we
to lay such stress upon the order they
make use of in their Writings, as to
colour thereby certain Inferences, which
are not otherwise obvious in the Sense
of our Saviour's words. If a Man
observe never so little, he will find
that they use every where popular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions;
that they have not aim'd at
any Elegancy in their Stile; and that
they have been very far from speaking
with such Exactness, as Philosophers
or Geometricians use in their Writings.
We ought not then to insist too much,
as commonly Men do, upon the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of their expressing the Doctrine of
Christ. We should only indeavour to
understand the Genius of the Language
they use, and to stick to the substance
of things essential; which are express'd
in so many places, and after so many
ways, that it is not difficult to frame
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63500:57"/>
to our selves an Idea thereof, clear
enough to instruct us perfectly in our
Duty.</p>
            <p>In the third place, as for the Epistles
of the New Testament, they do not
only afford us the same Considerations
with those we have last mention'd, in
respect of their Stile, but there are also
two things further to be observ'd and
distinguish'd in them. We find there the
same Doctrines we have in the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,
and those the Apostles assure us
often they learn'd from Christ. But there
are others things, which the Apostles
speak of their own heads, or which they
draw by divers Consequences from the
Old. Testament. The first of these
are to be believ'd on the same account
as the Gospels; that is to say, because
of the Authority of Jesus Christ, who
preach'd them to the Jews. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
are to be receiv'd, because they
contain nothing but what is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the Doctrine of Christ, or
what is founded upon right Reason.
The Apostles will not have us believe
them upon their own word. They di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
in that their Authority from
the Authority of Christ. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> VII.
10, 12, 25. But as they apply'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63500:57"/>
cerefully to mind Doctrines tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Edification (which are few in
number) and never ingag'd in too nice
inquiries; they have told us nothing
that is not conformable to the Spirit
of the Gospel (with which they were
fill'd) and which right Reason will not
easily admit. It is to be observ'd, that
having no extraordinary Inspiration for
writing their Epistles, they insert in
them divers things that concern their
Designs, or their particular Affairs;
where we ought by no means to seek
for or expect any thing mysterious. Such
are the Salutations found at the end of
their Epistles; the Order St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives
<hi>Timothy</hi> to take <hi>Mark</hi> along with him
in his return, to bring the Cloak he had
left at <hi>Troas</hi> with <hi>Carpus,</hi> the Books,
and above all the Parchments; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
he gives him to drink a little Wine
for his Stomachs sake, and because of
his Weaknesses; and other such like
things. See St. <hi>Ierom</hi>'s Preface to his
Commentary upon the Epistle to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fourth place, there are divers
Prophecies scatter'd in these Epistles;
and the <hi>Apocalipse</hi> is wholly Prophetic.
Now we ought to give Credit to these <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations;</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:63500:58"/>
because it is God that impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them immediately to the Apostles.
And it is easy to distinguish them
from other things, which the Apostles
give out only as their own Conjectures;
of which you have some Examples in
the words of <hi>Grotius,</hi> which I cited con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Inspiration of the Pen-Men
of the New Testament.</p>
            <p>Thus then, according to my <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,</hi>
the Authority of the Scripture
continues in full force. For you see
I maintain that we are oblig'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the substance of the History of
the New Testament; and generally all
the Doctrines of Jesus Christ; all that
was inspir'd to the Apostles; and also
whatsoever they have said of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
so far as it is conformable to our
Saviour's Doctrine, and to right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
It is plain that nothing farther
is necessarily to be believ'd, in order
to our Salvation. And it seems also e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
to me that those new Opinions,
brought into the Christian Religion
since the Death of the Apostles, which
I have here refuted, being altogether
imaginary and ungrounded, instead of
bringing any advantage to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion, are really very prejudicial
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63500:58"/>
to it. An Inspiration is attributed to
the Apostles to which they never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and whereof there is not the
least mark left in their Writings. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it happens that very many Persons
who have strength enough of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to deny Assent to a thing for
which there is no good proof brought
(though preach'd with never so much
Gravity); It happens, I say, that these
Persons reject all the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
because they do not distinguish
true Christianity from those Dreams
of fanciful Divines.</p>
            <p>It is easy to guess, after this, what
we ought to think of the Authority
of the Books of the Old Testament.
The Prophecies that are in it ought to
be believ'd, because Christ has autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd
them. The substance of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
ought also to be believed for the
same reason; notwithstanding any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
there may be in some inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Circumstances; as it appears
there is still some uncertainty, by divers
Contradictions which the Divines with
all their Subtilty have not been able to
reconcile, after puzling about it above
three thousand Years. The Doctrines
that are in it ought also to be receiv'd, so
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63500:59"/>
far as they are conformable to those of
the Gospel; or, if you will, let us say
that the true meaning of the Law is to
be learn'd from Christ. No Conclusion
is to be drawn from those Books that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be only pieces of Wit and Fancy,
or wherein nothing but Human is to be
found, such as the Song of <hi>Solomon, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastes,</hi>
&amp;c. Lastly, we ought not to
strain too far the Sense of particular
Expressions, as do the Jews; Because,
if we except a very few places, the
Expressions are the same with those
which the sacred Writers were wont
to make use of in explaining their other
Thoughts; that is to say, they have
worded both the Jewish History, and
the Revelations they had from Heaven,
after their own ordinary manner of
expressing themselves.</p>
            <p>These, Sir, are the Thoughts of
Mr. <hi>N.</hi> concerning the Inspiration of the
sacred Pen-Men. I am told he draws
from these Principles three Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.
The first is, That by admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> we may terminate
many great Disputes among Christians,
which have risen from the false Subtilty
of Divines interpreting too mysteriously
the Expressions of the holy Scripture,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63500:59"/>
as if every syllable had been dictated by
God. The second is, that whereas by
sticking too close to the Letter of the
Scripture, the Essence of Religion comes
to be neglected; as if God required no
more of us at present but to believe
that the holy Scripture is divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd;
instead, I say, of this Practice,
it will be found necessary to apply our
selves wholly to the obeying Christ's
Precepts, which is the only thing God
indispensably requires from us. The
third Consequence is, that hereby at
one blow will be solv'd an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Difficulties, which Libertines
are wont to alledg against the holy
Scripture, and which it is not possible
to solve by the ordinary Principles.
Their Mouths will be stopp'd, says
Mr. <hi>N.</hi> and it wil no longer avail them
to object against Christians the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
which are found in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
the lowness of the Stile of the
sacred Writers; the little Order ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
to be in many of their Discourses;
and whatsoever else they have been us'd
to say against our Divines, who have in
vain puzled themselves to answer them.
By imposing nothing upon these Men as
necessary to be believ'd, but the Truth
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63500:60"/>
of what is most essential in the Histories
of the Old and New Testament, and
the Divinity of our Saviour's Doctrine,
(in which there is nothing that is not
conformable to right Reason) they will
be brought (says he) to acknowledg
that Christian Religion is really descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from Heaven; and will be easily
inclin'd to embrace that which hitherto
they have obstinately rejected, because
it was grounded on Suppositions repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to that Light of Reason by which
they are guided.</p>
            <p>I shall not undertake, Sir, to examine
these Consequences, nor the Principles
from whence they are drawn. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
you only a bare account of the
Thoughts of Mr. <hi>N.</hi> And I hope you
will use means that some Divine, verss'd
in these matters, may satisfy us both
upon this Subject, better than I my
self am able to do. I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
         </div>
         <div n="3" type="letter">
            <pb n="119" facs="tcp:63500:60"/>
            <head>THE
THIRD LETTER.</head>
            <p>YOU have seen, Sir, to how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
purpose it is that Mr. <hi>Simon</hi>
indeavours to defend his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Opinions, as well as those which
are common to him with all other Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Catholic
Doctors. You shall see
now that he is no happier in going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to play the Critic on two Letters,
in which he was not concern'd. It
appears evidently that nothing but
the itch he hath of carping at other
Mens Writings has made him undertake
to examine those Letters. For he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
the greatest part of the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which the Author there maintains.
And I doubt not but those who have
judg'd the Opinions of Mr. <hi>N.</hi> too
bold, will be as much scandaliz'd at
those of the pious <hi>Prior of Bolleville.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That incomparable Critic maintains
at first dash, as boldly as if he were
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:63500:61"/>
assur'd of it by Revelation, that he that
is call'd Mr. <hi>N.</hi> is <hi>Noel Aubert de Versé;</hi>
which I have told you already is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a Dream of Mr. <hi>Simon;</hi>'s who
thinks he may lawfully say any thing
that comes in his Head, and believes
that by boldly affirming it he shall
make his Reader be of his Mind. That
is a Secret of his Rhetoric, which he
puts in practice as soon as ever he finds
himself puzl'd, or when he imagines
he may thereby worst his Antagonist.
But by ill fortune he has us'd it so long,
that his Art being plainly discover'd, can
no more deceive any body. By saying
whatever came in his Mind, although in
truth he did not believe it, he has so
grosly contradicted himself, that he has
now lost all Credit with Men of Worth.
I need therefore return no other answer
to the beginning of our Author's XIIth
Chap. than by saying, that I am sorry
his Choler does so much blind him, as
to make him affirm a Falshood as boldly
as the clearest Truth. I pray God, as
I have often done, to cure him of a
Passion that discomposes him in so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
a manner; and which may in
time render him incapable of serving the
Public, as he might do, if he considered
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:63500:61"/>
a little more on what he thinks fit to
publish.</p>
            <p>I will not spend my Labour singly
upon his Remarks; for I write not
this to satisfy him. In the ill Humour
he is, nothing is so fit to settle his Mind
as Time. I will therefore but touch
on them as I go along, when the nature
of what I have to say leads me to it.</p>
            <p>Neither is it my design to defend the
Opinions of Mr. <hi>N.</hi> concerning the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration
of the sacred Writers. Tho
I said it was hard to answer his Proofs
fully, I said not that I was convinc'd.
On the contrary, I propos'd them to
the Learned, that I might provoke
them to examine the matter carefully,
and might draw from their Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
some further Light than my own
Meditations could furnish me with.</p>
            <p>But as Mens Intentions are not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
always so favourably as they
ought to be, I find my self oblig'd (that
I may satisfy the Scruples of some pious
Persons, and repel the Calumnies of
some Divines who have more Zeal than
Knowledg) to answer four sorts of
Reflections that are made upon the
Treatise concerning Inspiration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:63500:62"/>
I. Some Learned Men, who approve
the Opinions of Mr. <hi>N.</hi> conceive never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
that they ought not to have been
publish'd; because in their Judgments
it is not fit that all Truths should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
be communicated to all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
There are, say they, certain things,
which though good in themselves, may
easily be apply'd to ill uses; and it is
better that the Public should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
of the advantage it might draw
from the knowledg of such Truths,
than be visibly expos'd to the danger
of abusing them so lamentably as it
would be apt to do.</p>
            <p>II. Others, who are of the same
Mind, in approving the Opinions of
Mr. <hi>N.</hi> believe that since he was willing
those his Thoughts should be publish'd,
he ought to have express'd them more
distinctly; and above all to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
in the first place, the State of the
Question between him and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Divines. These Gentlemen
think that if he had done as they say,
he had prevented a great many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
which are grounded upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Obscurity that is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
to be in some places of his
Writing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:63500:62"/>
III. Some of those who look upon
the Opinion of Mr. <hi>N.</hi> as false Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
cannot indure that I should have
said, <hi>It appears not by what Principle it
can be overthrown.</hi> They say that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more easy. And to let you see
they are in the right, they make divers
Answers to the Arguments of Mr. <hi>N.</hi>
and propose some Objections, which
they believe sufficient to refute all he
has said.</p>
            <p>IV. Lastly, the most hot, and the
least reasonable of these Objectors
affirm, that the Opinions of our Friend
lead directly to Deism; and stick not
to accuse him of favouring that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Opinion.</p>
            <p>You see, Sir, to what Heads I am
oblig'd to make Answer, being of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
(as I am) that it was convenient
to publish that Writing concerning
Inspiration. To begin with the first:
I acknowledg, Sir, that what they say
is true. I grant that all sorts of Truths
are not fit to be spoken at all times,
and on all occasions. It is undoubtedly a
very ill thing to publish any Truth not
necessary to be known, how certain
soever it may be, when we are assur'd,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:63500:63"/>
that those who shall read or understand
it will infallibly be so scandaliz'd at it,
that the knowledg thereof will produce
more hurt than good. On such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
Christian Prudence indispensably
obliges us to the contrary. The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is not then, Whether the Maxim
of these Gentlemen be true or not. In
that we are agreed. But my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was, that this Writing of Mr. <hi>N.</hi>
would do infinitely more good than
hurt; and I dare yet maintain, that
in the Times wherin we live, it is very
fit that such Matters as these be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
examin'd, without concealing from
the Public any of the Difficulties that
attend them.</p>
            <p>You know, Sir, that most of the
Sciences being arriv'd in this our Age
to a greater degree of Perfection than
formerly; though from thence it might
be expected, that such Improvements
should have render'd Christians so much
the more wise and more judicious; yet on
the contrary, Libertinism and Impiety
have prevail'd more scandalously than
ever. The Libertines of former Ages
profess'd their Opinions only in some
extravagant Sallies of Wit, or Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery;
and oppos'd the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:63500:63"/>
only by some insipid Railleries,
which could have no weight with any
Persons of sound Judgment and unbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ass'd
Affections. But the Libertines of
our Times make use of their Philosophy
and Criticism, to overthrow the most
sacred and most solid Doctrines of our
Religion. Divers impious Books have
been publish'd not only in <hi>Latin,</hi> but
also in <hi>French,</hi> in <hi>English,</hi> and in <hi>Dutch;</hi>
which many unlearned Persons read
with much greediness. Abundance of
People are fond of <hi>Spinoza</hi>'s Opinions;
because they have read his Books in
<hi>French,</hi> in <hi>English,</hi> and in <hi>Dutch,</hi> though
they never study'd Philosophy nor Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism.
We are in Times wherein eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
body pretends to depth of Learning,
freedom of Thought, and strength of
Judgment; and this Reputation is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acquir'd by reading those Books.
But that which renders this yet more
deplorable, is that it is not a Disease
of Youth, that Men grow out of as
they advance in Years. They whose
Minds are once tainted with these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Opinions do very seldom get
quit of them.</p>
            <p>This is undoubtedly a great Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
and to which those who are any
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63500:64"/>
ways able to bring Remedy are oblig'd
to do it. It has been endeavoured to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the Authority of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
by making appear that the Stile of
the sacred Writers was not inspir'd, and
that they did not receive every thing
they said from immediate Inspiration.
And in effect it has happen'd that many
People have hereupon believ'd, that the
Authority of the Scripture was intirely
ruin'd; And imagining that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
brought by <hi>Spinoza</hi> to prove this
Opinion were unanswerable, they have
fall'n into Deism or into Atheism.</p>
            <p>What Remedy, Sir, for this? For
my part, I confess, I see but one of
these three. Either a way must be found
to burn all the Copies of these impious
Books, that have corrupted so many
Men, and to blot out of Mens Memory
the Arguments of these Libertines; or
else there must solid Demonstration be
made of the Falsity of the Arguments
they make use of to maintain their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
Or, lastly, in granting to them
that the sacred Pen-Men were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd,
neither as to the Stile, nor as to
those things which they might know o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
than by Revelation, it must be
yet demonstrated that the Authority of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:63500:64"/>
the Scriptures ought not for all that
to be esteemed less considerable.</p>
            <p>It is plain that the first of these three
is absolutely impossible; and that, tho
an Inquisition should now be settl'd in
<hi>France,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and in <hi>Holland,</hi> it
would already be too late. There is
then no other means left to cure this
Libertinism that is spread so wide, but
one of the two last propos'd Remedies.
For my part I could wish with all my
Heart that some body would try the
second; and would make it evident
that God has inspir'd the sacred Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
not only with the matter they
have spoken about, but also with the
very Expressions. But since no body
has yet done, nor that I know under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
to do it, why should it be ill
taken that Mr. <hi>N.</hi> has made use of the
third method, or that I have publish'd
his Writing?</p>
            <p>It is true, there are some who believe
that it were better to hold ones peace
in a matter so delicate, than to run the
hazard of giving scandal to others, by
contradicting the Opinions which they
think most reasonable. This indeed
would be very well, if Libertines also
forbore writing, or if no body read their
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63500:65"/>
Books. But since it is otherwise, such
silence is not at all seasonable. If any
weak Minds take Offence without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
at what is offer'd, there are an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
others that may be brought off
from their Inclination to Libertinism,
by the same Reasons which those are
offended at. If indeed we ought always
to be afraid of saying any thing that
is not generally approv'd, we should
quickly be oblig'd not only to keep si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
but also to suppress many things
which are both useful and necessary to
Salvation. There is no Doctrine in the
Gospel, how holy soever, which some
Sect of Christians has not perverted and
misused. Nay the same is yet done daily.</p>
            <p>All the difficulty then lies in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whether the treating concerning
this Question of the Inspiration of the
Authors of the Bible will occasion more
Good or Hurt? In it self the Thing is
good, even by the Concession of those
that argue against it; and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the weakness of some Mens
Minds that can render it dangerous.
Thus then the Good or Evil of this
Disquisition depends wholly upon the
Event; which therefore these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ought to suffer us to expect, before
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63500:65"/>
we acknowledg that we have done ill in
publishing this Writing of Mr. <hi>N.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We must add to this, that Mr. <hi>N.</hi> is
not the first that has spoken, as he does,
of the Inspiration of the sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
We see many Proofs of it in his
Dissertation. And besides the places
which he has cited out of some Books
of <hi>Grotius,</hi> there are others infinitely
more strong and more express in those
against <hi>Rivet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now after having thus answer'd those
that would have had this Writing sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd;
it is necessary to give some
satisfaction to those also who complain
that the Author has not express'd his
Opinion with sufficient clearness. I
have therefore desir'd Mr. <hi>N.</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
it to me himself, if it were possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in few words, and more distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
in order to remove those injurious
Suspicions that may have risen from any
Obscurity in his Writing, concerning
his Faith and his Piety. And these are
the Heads to which he has reduc'd
his Opinion, and wherein he agrees
with us.</p>
            <p>In the first place, says he, <q>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that no Prophet, either of the
Old or New Testament, has said any
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:63500:66"/>
thing in the Name of God, or as
by his order, which God had not
effectually order'd him to say; nor
has undertaken to foretel any thing,
which God had not indeed truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
to him; and that this cannot
be doubted of without great Impiety.
I have said it expresly in many places
of my Treatise.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the second place, <q>I believe, that
there is no matter of Fact, of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
related in the History of
the Old or New Testament, which
in effect is not true. And that tho
there may be some slight Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
wherein some of the Historians
were mistaken; yet we ought never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
to look upon that History in
general as the truest and most holy
History that ever was publish'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Men. I am perswaded that
those who writ it were very well
inform'd of all they relate, and that
they had not the least intention to
deceive us; insomuch that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
they should fall into any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Error; as neither can we
do, in believing what they have said.
And, that there may be no Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
By a matter of importance
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63500:66"/>
I mean all the Commandments that
the sacred Historians assure us were
given to the Jews by God; all the
Miracles that are found in the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Scripture; all the principal
Events in that History; and generally
all the matters of Fact on which our
Faith is grounded.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In the third place, I believe, with
all Christians, that all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
propos'd by the Authors of
the Scriptures to Jews and Christians
to be believ'd, are really and truly
Divine Doctrines, although it may
be suppos'd that they did not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
learn them from Heaven; I
am as much perswaded as any Man,
that there is no sort of reasoning
made use of in the dogmatical places
of the holy Scripture (where the
Prophets and Apostles instruct us
concerning the Promises or the Will
of God) that can lead us into Error,
or into the belief of any thing that
is false, or contrary to Piety.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I believe in the fourth place, That
Jesus Christ was absolutely infallible,
as well as free from all Sin, because
of the Godhead that was always u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
to him, and which perpetually
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63500:67"/>
inspir'd him: insomuch that all that
he taught is as certain as if God
himself had pronounc'd it. I have
explain'd this clearly in my Writing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In the last place, I believe that God
has often dictated to the Prophets
and to the Apostles the very words
which they should use. Of this I
have also given some Examples.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In these things I agree with all
Christian Divines. And I believe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as well as they, that these five
Heads of our Belief may be undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
prov'd against Libertines and
Atheists, by the Authority of Jesus
Christ and his Apostles; to whom
God has born Testimony by an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
number of Miracles, which are
more clearly demonstrable to have
been really done, than any Fact what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
of all ancient History. For
Example, it may be prov'd by posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Testimonies of Matters of Fact,
that Jesus Christ did really rise again
from the Dead, and that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
had the Gift of Miracles, more
clearly than it can be prov'd that
ever there was a Roman Emperor
call'd <hi>Trajan.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:63500:67"/>
               <q>If any one conceive that this kind
of Evidence is not sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us of the Truth of these Facts,
or that the Resurrection of Jesus
Christ, and the Miracles of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
do not sufficiently prove (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any thing further) that they were
not Deceivers; I confess I understand
not what further Proofs can be given
of these things; unless God should
raise in our days a Prophet that should
do the same Miracles over again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Eyes. It may be there are
some who believe that the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
gives them inward assurance of
the Truth of the Gospel, and who
imagine that this inward Testimony
is a more convincing Proof than all
those I have spoken of. But as there
are not many that have this Belief,
and as those that have it cannot
make use of that pretended inward
Testimony to convince another, who
does not himself feel it; we may,
without troubling our selves further
with them, leave them to enjoy that
Chimerical Satisfaction which their
meer Imagination affords them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Authority of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
being thus settl'd, I will now
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63500:68"/>
shew you wherein it seems to me that
the generality of Divines are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
and in what I am not of their
Opinion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>They affirm that all that is in
the sacred Books, Histories, Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> has been immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd
both as to the Matter and
Words: That all the Books in the
Jews Catalogue ought to be reckon'd
amongst the inspir'd Books: That
when the Apostles preach'd the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
they were so inspir'd that they
could not be deceiv'd, not even in a
thing of no consequence at all; and
that they knew at the very first,
without any exercise either of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or Memory, what they were to
say.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>On the contrary my Opinion is,
That it is only in Prophecies, and
some other places, as in the Sermons
of Jesus Christ, and where God
himself is introduc'd speaking, that
the Matter or Things have been
immediately reveal'd to those who
spoke them: That the Stile, for the
most part, was left to the liberty of
those who spoke or writ: That there
are some Books that are not inspir'd,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63500:68"/>
neither as to the Matter nor Words,
as <hi>Iob, Ecclesiastes,</hi> &amp;c. That there
are some Passages which Passion di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated
to those that writ them, as
many Curses in the <hi>Psalms:</hi> That
the sacred Historians might commit,
and have actually committed some
light Faults, which are of no moment:
That the Apostles in preaching the
Gospel, or in writing their Works,
were not ordinarily inspir'd, neither
as to the Matter, nor the Words; but
that they had recourse to their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
and Judgment, in declaring
what Jesus Christ had taught them,
or framing Arguments, or drawing
Consequences from thence: That
the Apostles while they liv'd were
only look'd upon as faithful Witnesses
of what they had seen and heard,
and as Persons well instructed in the
Christian Religion, whereof no part
was unknown to them, or conceal'd
by them from their Disciples; but not
as Men that preach'd and taught by
perpetual Inspiration. I believe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that they were not deceiv'd in
any Point of Doctrine, and that it
was very unlikely they should be so;
because Christian Religion is easy,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:63500:69"/>
and compris'd in a few Articles: That
they pretended not to enter into deep
Argumentations, and to draw Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qrences
remote from their Principles:
and that they never undertook to treat
of nice and controversial Matters, as is
plain by reading of their Writings: Or,
if it happen'd sometimes that they
were mistaken in any thing, as it
seems to have happen'd to St. <hi>Peter</hi> and
to St. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> it has been in things
of small consequence, and they soon
perceiv'd their Error, as did these
two Apostles. This sort of Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
is easy to be conceiv'd; if it
be consider'd that a Man of Sense and
Integrity, who is well instructed in
his Religion, and who does not much
enter into Argumentations and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Inferences, can hardly err, so
long as he continues in that Temper,
and observes that Conduct.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This is the Sum of what I have
said in my Writing concerning the
Inspiration of the sacred Pen-Men;
and it is herein precisely that I dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from the common Opinion of
Divines. You see how much these
Principles are contrary to those of
the Deists, who reject all sort of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63500:69"/>
and who look upon the
holy Scripture as a Work full of Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
and wherein there is nothing
but what is purely human. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
that have accus'd me of Deism
on account of this Writing, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
either never took the pains to
read it, or did not understand it;
for I cannot believe that they would
accuse me of so detestable an Opinion
out of pure Malice, and against their
own Consciences. They were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
in some measure mis-led by
a false Zeal, that render'd them little
attentive to what they read, or made
them suspect that the Author had not
discover'd all that he had in his Mind.
It is an ill Custom that some peevish
and ill-natur'd Persons have, to judg
of other Mens Opinions rather by
the Suspicions which their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd
Imaginations suggest to them,
than by those Mens Expressions and
Actions; which are the only Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that ought to be regarded on
these occasions. A Man ought to be
judged by what he says, and not by
what he says not, nor by what is
injuriously imputed to him without
any Proof. And if this ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63500:70"/>
to be the Rule of our Carriage
one towards another, there is more
particular Reason that it should be so
when a Man protests (as I do at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent)
that he is not of any other
Opinion than what he expresly sets
down; and that he disowns the ill
Consequences which are pretended
to be drawn from his Discourses, and
which to him seem not to be deduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By this Explanation of Mr. <hi>N'</hi>s Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
which I receiv'd from himself,
you may see, Sir, that he is very far
from those impious Opinions which
some too hot-headed Divines have
charg'd him with. Candid and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Readers had no need of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation,
in which I see nothing but
what is plainly enough set down in
his first Writing. But as Equity is a
Vertue seldom practis'd in Theological
Controversies, he thought it necessary
to give these further Explications, to
those who persisted still in suspecting
him to believe things which he abhors.
We shall see hereafter if any ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
can be drawn from his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:63500:70"/>
But before I come to that, I will
transcribe here what he further adds
to that which you have already seen.
<q>In reading, says he, the Prior of
<hi>Bolleville</hi>'s Answer to the Thoughts
of some <hi>Holland</hi> Divines, I observ'd
that Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> accuses me of having
taken part of what I have said out
<hi>Grotius</hi> his Book, call'd <hi>Votum pro Pace
Ecclesiasticâ.</hi> I should be well pleas'd
that my Reader believ'd it. I could
not then be accus'd, as I am by some,
of Innovation. It is true, I have
read that Book; but it being long ago,
that Passage of <hi>Grotius</hi> was not in my
Mind; otherwise I should not have
fail'd to have cited it, as I have cited
others of the same Author that are
less express. I think it therefore not
amiss to take advantage of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement,
and now to set down
that Passage, together with another
taken out of his Defence of the <hi>Vow
for Peace,</hi> titl'd, <hi>Discussio Apologetici
Rivetiani.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q> Grotius <hi>had said in a Work where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he defends his Observations upon
the Consultation of</hi> Cassander <hi>against</hi>
Rivet,<note place="margin">Animadv. in Animadv. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet. <hi>p.</hi> 647.</note> 
                  <hi>that this last Divine was very
much deceiv'd</hi> in believing that all the

Books of the Old Testament, that are in
the Hebrew Canon, were dictated by the
Holy Ghost; that <hi>Esdras</hi> in the Opinion
of all the Iews was not a Prophet, nor
had the holy Spirit; that his Books, and
the Collection he made of the more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Books, had been approv'd by the
great Synagogue, in which indeed there
were some Prophets; although the Iews
hold that there was a doubt concerning
the Book of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> &amp;c. Rivet
<hi>liked not this Opinion of</hi> Grotius, <hi>and
indeavoured to prove the contrary,
by Scripture, and by some Jewish Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</hi>

in the Hebrew Canon were not
all dictated by the holy Spirit;
But I do not deny that they
were written with a pious inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mind. And this was
the Determination of the great
Synagogue, whose Iudgment in
this matter the Iews submit to.
For there was no need that the
Histories should be dictated by
the holy Spirit. It was sufficient
that the Writer had a good
Memory, for the things he had
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:63500:71"/>
seen; or that he were careful in
transcribing the ancient Records.
The word <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is also
ambiguous; for either it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,
as I have taken it, a certain
divine Inspiration which both
the ordinary Prophets had, and
sometimes <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Daniel;</hi>
or it signifies a pious Motion

willingly acknowledges, that the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:63500:72"/>
Prophets, who were commanded
by God to write or speak, did
write and spoke by Inspiration
from him: His Opinion is also
the same as to the Apocalyse,
and the Predictions made by the
Apostles: He esteems it the
highest Impiety to make any
doubt that all that was said by
Iesus Christ was said by God
himself. Concerning the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical
Writings, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sentences of the Hebrews,
he is of another Opinion: He
thinks it sufficient to believe
that they were written out of a
pious Intention, and with great
Ingenuity, and concerning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of highest importance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Neither <hi>Esdras</hi> nor <hi>Luke</hi> were
Prophets; but grave and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Men, who neither were
minded to deceive, nor would
suffer themselves to be deceived.
Did Luke say, <hi>The Word of
the Lord came to</hi> Luke, <hi>and
the Lord said to him, write,</hi>
as the Prophets us'd to say?
Nothing like it. What then?
<hi>For as much as many have
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:63500:72"/>
taken in hand to set forth in order a
Declaration of those things which
are most surely believed among us:</hi>
(He says not that by Command, but by
the Example of others, he was induced
to write): <hi>Even as they delivered them
to us, who from the beginning were
Eye-witnesses, and Ministers of the
Word; (viz.</hi> Mary the Mother of our
Lord, other of his Kinsmen, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
the seventy Disciples, and the Saints
that had been rais'd again by Iesus, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Witnesses of his Resurrection:) <hi>It
seemed good to me also, having had
perfect understanding of all things
from the very first,</hi> &amp;c. Vnderstanding,
how acquir'd? From Eye-witnesses, not
by Revelation. To write, not things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated,
but in order. The Prophets then
had another sort of Impulse than Luke;
whose good Design nevertheless may be
ascrib'd to the Holy Spirit.</q>

wherein he strives to defend the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Opinion against his famous An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonist.
It appears plainly by the
manner of his answering, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
that the Holy Spirit had dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Scripture word for word;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:63500:73"/>
and this Opinion is known to be the
common Opinion of Protestants;
who on all occasions call the sacred
Writers, <hi>Amanuenses of the holy Spirit.</hi>
Nay even Catholick Authors, <hi>Gregory
de Valence, Bellarmin, Tolet,</hi> and <hi>Estius,</hi>
cited by <hi>Rivet,</hi> seem to have been of
the same Opinion. <hi>Cornelius à Lapide,</hi>
whom Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> cites, holds the same
concerning the Law and the Prophets;
though he confesses it was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that God should dictate the
words, when it was only matter of
History, or of Moral Precepts, which
might be known otherways. So that
it may be reasonably suppos'd that
the greatest part of Christian Divines
now adays are of the Opinion of
verbal Inspiration, if we may so call
it; since there are very few that say
the contrary; and those who do, say
it only of some Books, as <hi>Cornelius à
Lapide.</hi>

            <p>
               <q>Every body knows that not only
in Sermons, but also in Divinity-Lectures,
upon any part of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
some Men strangely wire-draw
the Words of the Scripture; and
seek after Reasons why the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
as they speak, makes use of one
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63500:73"/>
Expression rather than another. The
same thing they do also in Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
Which would be altogether ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
if my Supposition were admitted,
that the Stile of the Scriptures is for
the most part human and even careless
enough. But this is because they
commonly take the Opinion of the
Jews for granted; who have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb
or general Maxim concerning the
Books of the Law (in which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
all to be inspir'd, even to a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Letter) that <hi>there is not a Letter
in the Law, whereon there depends not
great Mountains.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am very glad, however, that
Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> declares himself openly of
the same Opinion with me, concerning
the Stile of the sacred Writers. I
wish all Protestants would do the
same. We should then soon be free
from many Disputes that are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon nothing but Grammatical
Subtilties. We should then perceive,
that we ought not rigorously to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon a great many Expressions in
the utmost extent of their Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as if the sacred Pen-Men had
spoken with the same Exactness, as
do Geometricians. We should then
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:63500:74"/>
understand that no Doctrines, which
we esteem important, ought to be
grounded barely upon certain manners
of speaking; which we cannot be sure
were exact; because the sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
not affecting exactness of Stile,
may have used that manner of Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
without any design. Such is the
Doctrine of the antecedent Imputation
of the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> which is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Comparison St. <hi>Paul</hi>
makes (Chap. V. of the Epistle to the
<hi>Romans</hi>) between the Grace that came
by Jesus Christ, and the Sin that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the World by <hi>Adam.</hi> Men
stretch this Comparison with too
much Rigor, not considering that
St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Stile is the Stile of one
that observes little Exactness in his
Expressions, although in the main his
Arguments are admirable; and that
the laying too great stress upon the
turn of his Phrases may expose us to
the hazard of falling into gross Error.
The general Design that he proposes
to himself ought only to be stuck to;
without insisting particularly upon
every term, and every distinct Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod;
which taken separately and
strictly, may oft-times prove contrary
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:63500:74"/>
to what he drives at. Those who
are a little conversant in the Disputes
amongst Protestants, will easily see
the importance of this Remark.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The ingenuous Acknowledgment
of what there is of Human in the
sacred Writings, would render the
Truth of our Religion more conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
to the Eyes of the incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;
whereas it is hid from them, by
clothing it in certain Notions which
common Sense makes them reject,
and from among which they are not
able to pick out the Heavenly Truths.
Men fancy that for the Establishment
of Religion it is requisite to maintain
every thing, or any thing, that (if
true) would be an invincible Proof
of it. they cast therefore about in
their own Minds for such Foundations
as they conceive would make it most
stable. With this their Brain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
so heated, that in the end
they rashly assert that these are the
real Foundations of Religion; and
that if these be taken away, Religion
will fall to the ground and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd.
Thus some Romish Doctors
have fancy'd that Men, for the most
part, not being capable to examine
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:63500:75"/>
Religion themselves, it was necessary
that God should settle a way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they might find it, without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination;
<hi>viz.</hi> by the way of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
And from thence they have
concluded, That to deny there is an
Authority in the World to which
People ought intirely to submit, is
to overthrow Religion. But to these
Gentlemen it is answer'd, That it is
absurd in them to fancy that God
will not preserve the true Religion
amongst Men, unless it be in the way
that they have imagin'd. The same
may be answer'd to our Protestant
Divines, who believe the Inspiration
of every word; <hi>viz.</hi> that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in believing that the Truth of
Christian Religion is founded upon
that Opinion. We ought not to
reckon every thing among the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of our Religion, that unto us
seems proper to strengthen it; nor to
trouble our selves in examining af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
what manner we would have esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
it, had the thing depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us; or in asserting how God ought
to have done it. But we ought to
consider things in themselves as they
really are, and learn what has been
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:63500:75"/>
the Will of God, by what he has
done; not conclude that he has
done this or the other thing, because
we fancy he ought to have will'd
it. Libertines who see that to
uphold the Truth of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
Men bring long Metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Arguments (which often prove
nothing, but that, according to the
Suppositions they have thought fit
to make, it ought to be so) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
presently that Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
has no better Foundation,
and so reject it; as much perhaps
through the fault of those Divines
who argue in that manner, as their
own. But if things were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to them as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
without going about to force
them to allow that which is not
prov'd, they would submit to our
Reasons; and we should not need to
teach them any thing but what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
injoins them, after having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
them of its Truth.</q>

it will be found sufficient to convince

            <p>I Believe, Sir, there is no Condition
in the World more deplorable,

in Print; if it be so that they are bound
to satisfy all those that censure them.
Some Persons have taken it ill that it
should be said, It was hard to confute
the Opinions of Mr. <hi>N.</hi> They hold it
very easy, and that there needs no
great Ability to do it. But they either
undertake it not; Or if they make any
Objection, they show that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
nothing of the matter; as the
Prior of <hi>Bolleville,</hi> who seems to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
neither what Mr. <hi>N.</hi> has said, nor
what himself objects. Others confess
that it is a very difficult matter; and
pretend that therefore a Man ought
not to trouble himself with it; nor
raise Scruples in weak Heads which
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:63500:77"/>
the strongest would find it a difficulty
to remove. To satisfy the first, it
would be requisite to show, that the
Objections propos'd are not strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to refute Mr. <hi>N'</hi>s Opinions: And
that is the very thing that will infallibly
offend the others, who would have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
said on that Subject. If the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of these last be taken, the first will
undoubtedly say that we were much in
the wrong, to say that it was very hard
to confute an Opinion, which they have
easily overthrown. They will be apt
even to say that it is not without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
that we have made use of weak
Arguments, and their crazy Fancies will
set no bounds to their Suspicions; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Custom of too many
Divines, who glory in a shew of diving
into other Mens Thoughts. What is
to be done in this case? One of the
two must unavoidably be displeas'd.</p>
            <p>I will not then be afraid, Sir, to
communicate to you the Answers of
Mr. <hi>N.</hi> to some Objections. Such as
have not read the Explanations which
I sent you a while ago, with sufficient
Attention, may perhaps by our Friend's

Objection 1.</p>
            <p>To say that the Prophets have often
express'd themselves in their Prophecies,<note place="margin">Page 15.</note>
after the same manner that they were
wont to do on other occasions, and that
they were not constantly inspir'd by
God with all their Expressions, is to
lessen the Authority of the Prophecies.</p>
            <p>Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>They that make this Objection
could not say any thing that can give
more advantage to the Profane. For
it is as clear as day, that the Stile of
the Prophets varies according to the
diversity of their Genius; as has been
observ'd, and as is agreed by the
most able Interpreters. Mr. <hi>Simon</hi>
proves it himself, <hi>Pag.</hi> 123. of his
Answer, and makes appear that what
the Prophets said was not the less
God's Word. But I cannot forbear
to observe that our Divines are even
more scrupulous than the Jews. For
these believe the Inspiration of Words
only in the <hi>Pentateuch;</hi> whereas they
believe it throughout all the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.

                  <hi>The Prophecy of Moses,</hi>
says <hi>Manasseth Ben. Israel,</hi> after many
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:63500:78"/>

more honourable, and more excellent, than

For to them, whensoever they receiv'd

of the matter to be foretold was
reveal'd; but they declar'd to the People
this Thing or Matter in their own words.
And for that Reason they made use of
this form of speaking; And the Lord said
unto me; As if they would say, these
things which we say to you, although we
express them in our words, contain the
Sense which we have receiv'd from
God,</hi> &amp;c. Many Christian Divines
have said the same things of all the
Prophets in general; as Mr. <hi>Huet in

<hi>that the things are to be attributed to

Objection 2.</p>
            <p>It has been said, that <hi>David</hi> says ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things of himself,<note place="margin">Page 23.</note> and of his Enemies,
not thinking to prophesy; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
notwithstanding Predictions of
what was to happen to Jesus Christ
and his Enemies; as what he says <hi>Psal.</hi>
XLI. 10. LXIX. 26. CIX. 8. places which
Christ and his Apostles apply to <hi>Iudas.</hi>
Nevertheless St. <hi>Peter,</hi> after citing some
words of <hi>Psal.</hi> XVI. where <hi>David</hi> speaks
of himself in the first Person, <hi>Thou
wilt not leave my Soul in Hell, nor suffer
thy Holy One to see Corruption,</hi> &amp;c. adds,
that this cannot be understood of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
since he was dead and rotten many
Years ago; but that <hi>as he was a Prophet,
and knew that God had sworn with an
Oath to him, that of the Fruit of his Loins
he would raise up Christ to sit upon his
Throne; he seeing this before-hand, spake of
the Resurrection of Christ, when he said,
that his Soul,</hi> &amp;c. by which it appears
that <hi>David,</hi> speaking in the first Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
knew nevertheless that he spoke
not concerning himself.</p>
            <p>Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I did not say, that <hi>David</hi> never
prophesy'd, in speaking of himself as
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:63500:79"/>
of a Type of the <hi>Messiah;</hi> or that
he understood not that in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perest
and highest sense of his Words
he spake concerning the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
though what he said had also some
relation to himself. I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
but there are in the <hi>Psalms</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Prophecies of this nature. It is
plain, <hi>David</hi> could not say of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
unless in a very Metaphorical
Sense, that <hi>God would not leave his
Soul in Hell, nor suffer his Holy One to
see Corruption,</hi> although the rest of
the <hi>Psalm</hi> may be suitable enough to
him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Objection 3.</p>
            <p>The Curses in the CIXth <hi>Psalm</hi> are
imputed to a human Passion; yet St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
teaches us, <hi>Acts</hi> I. 20. that it is a
Prophecy. It seems the better way
therefore to take all those Curses for
simple Predictions, and not for Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
and so to translate in the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Tense; <hi>Thou shalt set a wicked Man
over him, and his Adversary shall,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>This might be a Prophecy, of that
sort which we said were sometimes
pronounc'd without their being aware
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:63500:79"/>
who pronounc'd it; of which we
brought some Examples: which sort
of Prophecy is not inconsistent with a
violent Passion; as appears by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Caiaphas.</hi> But indeed these
Expressions cannot be translated in the
future Tense, without extream vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to the Text; and accordingly
the ancient Interpreters, as well as
modern, have made use of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative
or Optative Mood: Nor
ought it to seem strange that we think
there was in this an Excess of Passion,
since it is impossible to explain any
other way those words of <hi>Psalm</hi>
CXXXVII. <hi>Happy shall he be that taketh
and dasheth thy little ones against the
Stones,</hi> &amp;c. Let any one compare

In fine, if it were necessary to render
all these words in the future Tense,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:63500:80"/>
to avoid making the Psalmist pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
such Curses, there are a great
many other places where the Version
would need to be reform'd, and where
we should be oblig'd to strain the
Text; as may easily be perceiv'd in
turning over the Book of <hi>Psalms.</hi>

            <p>Objection 4.</p>
            <p>It has been said,<note place="margin">Page 26.</note> that Inspiration
seems not absolutely necessary to the
composing of pious Hymns; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from thence that it ought not to
be said that all such Hymns were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
inspir'd. The same sort of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
has been applied also after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to divers other places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But it no ways follows, because
Inspiration was not absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that therefore there was none.</p>
            <p>Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>My Argument proves not directly
that there was no Inspiration on these
occasions, but only that there was
nothing in the thing it self to induce
us to believe that there was any; and
consequently, that such Inspiration
is suppos'd without any necessity.
When a thing may be done by the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:63500:80"/>
ordinary course of Nature, we ought
not to have recourse to Miracles.
Hence I conclude, that there ought
to be no recourse to Inspiration,
when there is nothing in a Book to
make us believe it was inspir'd; and
when all that is in it might have been
said without Inspiration; unless we
have some positive Proof that he who
compos'd it was inspir'd. Now I
maintain that there is no Proof of
this nature, sufficient to perswade us
that all the Books of the Scripture
were inspir'd in the same manner
that they are commonly said to have
been.</q>

            <p>Objection 5.</p>
            <p>It has been inferr'd from the evident
marks of Meditation,<note place="margin">Page 27.</note> and Pains taking,
which appear in several places of the
Scripture (as those where the Verses
begin with all the Letters of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet
in order) that those places have
not been inspir'd. But it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that Inspiration excludes all sort
of Meditation and Pains-taking, as

            <p>
               <q>I acknowledg that it cannot from
thence be concluded that the matter
was not inspir'd; nor was this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made use of, but only against
those who hold the Inspiration of the
very words; that is to say, principally,
against the generality of Protestant
Divines. There is certainly little like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
that the Spirit of God would
inspire such things as those. But the
Consequence I have drawn from thence
is only this, that the Stile not being
inspir'd, we cannot be sure that the
things are; unless the Characters of
Inspiration appear in those things
themselves, or that we have other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
some positive Proof of it.</q>

            <p>Objection 6.</p>
            <p>What has been said concerning the
Inspiration of the sacred Historians is
not enough:<note place="margin">Pag. 28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> There ought to have
been added also, as Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> has it,
<hi>That God directed the Pen of the sacred
Historians in such a manner, that they
could not fall into Error. They were Men
that wrote; and the Spirit that directed
them depriv'd them not of their Reason,
nor their Memory, to inspire them with
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:63500:81"/>
matters of Fact, which they themselves
knew perfectly: but it determin'd them in
general to write of some matters, rather
than others, though they knew both alike
well.</hi> Resp. p. 128.</p>
            <p>Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>This may be granted; provided
that by <hi>directing the Pen of the sacred

them in general to write of
some matters rather than others, though
they knew both alike well.</hi> Mr. <hi>Simon</hi>
fights here with his own Shadow:
for no body deny'd that. On the
contrary, it was said that the sacred
Historians have writ of no matter,
whereof they were not well instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
And this in opposition to those
who pretend that the Historians of
the Bible were inspir'd with the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
in the same manner as if they
could not have known them any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way. But these People would
condemn Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> as well as me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Objection 7.</p>
            <p>It is suppos'd,<note place="margin">Page 35.</note> without any Reason,
that there are sometimes real Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
amongst the sacred Historians,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:63500:82"/>
whereas they are but seeming ones.
The Learned have reconcil'd them all,
not excepting that about the Death of
<hi>Iudas,</hi> which is cited as an Example of
a <hi>manifest Contradiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>To answer this Objection fully, it
would be requisite not only to quote
the places, where 'tis believ'd there
is some little Contradiction; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
all the Explications which many
learned Men have given of those
places, whereby to show that there
is not any of those Explications that
clears the Difficulty. But to do this
would require a Book for every place;
for there is so great variety of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
upon these Passages, that there
may be reckon'd up ten or twelve
Interpretations of one single place.
One Learned Man has made a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
in <hi>Quarto,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">J. Gronovius de pernicie &amp; casu Judae.</note> of an hundred and
ninety two Pages, upon that single
place concerning the Death of <hi>Iudas.</hi>
But if the most of these Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
be consider'd without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possession,
they will be found to be
very much strain'd. Words are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wanting. And it is no easy
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:63500:82"/>
matter to silence a Man of an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Capacity, who undertakes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
an Opinion that cannot be
demonstratively disprov'd. Let me
therefore, on this occasion, intreat
the Reader to examine some of those
places, that have given the Learned the
most trouble; and then let him ask him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
whether he would admit of those
Reconcilements that he finds in the
Commentators, if the Question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
other Authors than those of the
Bible. Assuredly he would reject them;
and would say that it were better to
confess that there is some Contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in small things, than to render the
whole History doubtful, by persist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obstinately in defence of things
of no consequence. If this were
done in what concerns the Death of
<hi>Iudas,</hi> which is brought for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
I am well assur'd there is no
Opinion would appear more reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than that of <hi>Salmasius,</hi> in his

            <p>Objection 8.</p>
            <p>Whereas it is doubted,<note place="margin">Page 40.</note> whether it
were well done to admit the History
of <hi>Esther</hi> in the Hebrew Canon, because
there are some Circumstances in it
which seem to be pure Invention;
Ought not those Circumstances to have
been cited? And supposing they were
such; may it not be said, with Mr. <hi>Simon
(Pag.</hi> 129. of his Answer) that the
Book might be a Parable, and not the

            <p>Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I might save my self the labour
of answering this objection, because
I have affirmed nothing in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
On the contrary, I said that I
would not examine the Opinion of
those who believe the History of
<hi>Esther</hi> to be a feigned History. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will I make my self at present
a Party in the Dispute. But since it

Reasons for which some reject this
Book.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:63500:83"/>
               <q>
                  <hi>In the, first place; Mordecai</hi> and <hi>Est<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her,</hi>
Whom the Author represents as
pious Persons, and particulaly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
by Heaven, agree to do a
thing forbidden by the Law. It is
where <hi>Mordecai</hi> counsels <hi>Esther</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to please <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> which
she consents to; though <hi>Moses</hi> had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
forbidden them to make Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with the Heathens.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>In the second place;</hi> All the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of this Story are very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable.
<hi>Esther</hi> pleases the King,
who proclaims her Queen of the
<hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> but does not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
her to tell him from what Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
she is sprung. <hi>Mordecai</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
a Conspiracy against <hi>Ahasue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
and advertises him of it by the
means of the Queen, without recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
nevertheless any Recompence;
only the Conspirators were hang'd,
and the whole matter recorded.
<hi>Haman</hi> grows in great favour at
Court, insomuch that all the World
bowed and reverenced him. <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai</hi>
thinks not fit to do it. <hi>Haman</hi>
cannot bear his Neglect; and having
learn'd that he is a Jew, resolves to
make the whole Jewish Nation perish
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:63500:84"/>
for his sake. He offers King <hi>Ahasue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
ten thousand Talents, if he will
consent to that Nation's Destruction.
The King presently consents (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
taking the Money) and gives
<hi>Haman</hi> his Ring; who makes use of
it in sealing the Letters, wherein it
is order'd to lay violent Hands on all
the Jews, not sparing Women nor
little Children. Messengers are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch'd
to carry theses Letters all
over the Kingdom, and the Edict is
publish'd at <hi>Shushan. Esther,</hi> who had
not yet told what Extraction she was
of, is inform'd that <hi>Mordecai</hi> was at
the King's Gate all in Sackcloath.
She sends him Raiment; which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses,
and expects a second Message
before he tells what makes him so
sad. <hi>Esther</hi> having learn'd the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is afraid to appear before the
King; because it was fobidden by
the Laws of the Kingdom, unless the
King by reaching out his Scepter of
Gold dispensed with it; but being
blam'd by <hi>Mordecai,</hi> she resolves to
run the hazerd, after a Fast of three
days observ'd by her self, her Ladies
of Honour, and all the Jews in <hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shan.
Esther</hi> appears before the King.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:63500:84"/>
He sees her, and reaches out his Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Gold that she might come
near him. She invites the King and
<hi>Haman</hi> to a Banquet in her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
They go, and the King at the
Banquet asks the Queen what she
would have him grant her. She invites
<hi>Ahasuerus</hi> and <hi>Haman</hi> again the next
day. <hi>Haman</hi> puff'd up with his good
Fortune, boasts of his Happiness to
his Wife and all his Friends; but
complains at the same time extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of <hi>Mordecai</hi> the Jew for not doing
him Reverence. His Wife advises him
to cause a Gibbet to be made fifty Foot
high, and to speak unto the King on
the Morrow that <hi>Mordecai</hi> might be
hanged thereon. <hi>Haman</hi> goes to Bed
thereupon, secure that the next day
he should be reveng'd of the Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Jew. But the King, who
could not sleep that Night, causes
the Records of State to be read to
him, where he finds the good Office
that Jew had done him; for which, on
Inquiry he was told that no Reward
had been given him. <hi>Haman</hi> comes
to Court early in the Morning, to
speak to the King that <hi>Mordecai</hi>
might be hang'd. But he is no sooner
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:63500:85"/>
in the Presence, than the King calls
to him, and asks him what should
be done to the Man whom the King
would extreamly honour. <hi>Haman,</hi>
who fancy'd it was himself that the
King was minded so to honour, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
in a way that tended to the
advantage of the Person that was to
be honoured. Immediately the King
commands him (what a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt
for an ambitious and revengeful
Person!) to go do it to <hi>Mordecai</hi>
the Jew. He retires home in Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to bewail his Misfortune with
his Friends; who tell him plainly that
the Jew will be too hard for him.
Presently the King's Chamberlains
come to call him to the Banquet in
the Queen's Apartment. At the
Banquet <hi>Esther</hi> tells the King there
was a Design to destroy her and her
People. The King in a Passion asks
who it was design'd it; and being
told it was <hi>Haman,</hi> he goes out in
Wrath into the Garden. <hi>Haman,</hi> on
the other side, stays with the Queen,
and throws himself upon her Bed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to pacify, her Wrath.
The King returns while he was in
that Rosture, and believes <hi>Haman</hi> was
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:63500:85"/>
about to force the Queen. <hi>Haman</hi> is
seiz'd upon to be put to Death, and
the Gibbet being found ready sitted
for <hi>Mordecai, Haman</hi> by the king's
order is hanged upon it. <hi>Mordecai</hi>
succeeds in the place of <hi>Haman;</hi> and
by <hi>Esther</hi>'s means obtains another
Edict, whereby the Jews are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to take Arms, and defend
themselves against those that should
fall upon them. The day mention'd
in the Edict being come, the Jews
kill all those that went about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them. They slay five hundred
in <hi>Shushan.</hi> And the like leave being
given them the next day, they kill
three hundred more, besides <hi>Haman</hi>'s
ten Sons who were hang'd by the
King's order. Now upon the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of all these Circumstances,
it is observ'd by some, that if <hi>Vnity
of Time and Place</hi> had been observ'd
in this Story, there would have
been nothing wanting to have made
it a good Tragi-Comedy. For my
part I determine nothing upon the
Point.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But this I can say, that in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> had not read of a
long time this Book, when he writ
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:63500:86"/>
the 129th <hi>Page</hi> of his Answer; where
he says, <hi>That though it should be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
that the Books of</hi> Esther, Judith,
<hi>and</hi> Tobit <hi>are not true Histories, yet
it does not follow therefore that they ought
to be left out of the Catalogue of Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Books: And that he has observ'd
in his Critical History, after St.</hi> Jerom,
<hi>that the Parabolical Stile has always been
in esteem amongst the Eastern People, and
that a Book whether it contain a true
History, or a plain Parable, or a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
mix'd with Parables, is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the less true or less Canonical.</hi> If
the Histories contain'd in these Books
are not true, they are certainly not
Parables, but Romances. The bare
reading them is sufficient to show that
those who writ them publish'd them
not for Books of Morality, but only
as surprizing and wonderful Stories.
To say nothing of <hi>Iudith</hi> and <hi>Tobit,</hi>
it is plain by the Original which the
Author of the Book of <hi>Esther</hi> gives
to the Feast of <hi>Purim,</hi> that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
that Book with design to make
it look like a true History. See the
IXth Chap. <hi>v.</hi> 27. to the end. The
Original of a Feast uses not to be
founded upon a Parable; and such a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:63500:86"/>
History as that of <hi>Esther</hi> is not wont
to be mix'd with Parables. Mr. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
says well, that there are Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
in the New Testament so well
circumstantiated, that one would take
them for true Histories. But we
must not have read either the Book
of <hi>Esther,</hi> or the New Testament, to
be perswaded that there is any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
betwixt the History of that
Book, and the Parables of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
The Parable most like to a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
is that of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
but there is nothing in it like the
History of <hi>Esther.</hi> See <hi>Ioseph. Antiq.
lib. 11. cap.</hi> 6.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Objection 9.</p>
            <p>The Prudence and Reason of the
Apostles is often spoken of,<note n="*" place="margin">Page 46.</note> as if the
use they made thereof were inconsistent
with the Inspiration attributed to them;
but these things may well agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> observes.</p>
            <p>Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> understood what he
would say, when he speaks of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
Human Prudence with Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
he believes undoubtedly the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:63500:87"/>
same thing that I do, concerning the
Inspiration of the Apostles. We a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
that the Terms were not inspir'd.
The question is only about the Things.
The Inspiration of the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists,
either in presenting to the Mind
general Principles, from whence they
that are inspir'd, according as they
have occasion afterward, draw Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences;
or in furnishing it with
Arguments ready fram'd. If God
furnish'd the Minds of the Apostles
with Arguments ready fram'd, they
made no use of their Reason, having
nothing to do but to declare what the
holy Spirit had inspir'd them with; as
the Prophets were only to express the
Sense of what God had said to them.
And this is that which every body calls
properly Inspiration. But if it be
suppos'd that God presented to the
Minds of the Apostles only general
Principles, of which by their own
reasoning they made necessary and
fit Application, upon emergent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
they were in that case no more
inspir'd than those, who having care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
read the holy Scripture, have
the Ideas thereof so present in their
Minds, that they never fail to make
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:63500:87"/>
use of it when it is necessary. In
this last Supposition Reason indeed
is made use of; but in the other it
is not. Now it appears that Mr. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
is not of the Opinion that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the use of Reason. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I say it is probable that he is of
the same Opinion with me, though he
know it not. For I deny not but
God might have presented to the
Minds of the Apostles, either by su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
or natural ways, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Ideas of which they should stand
in need, to defend themselves at their
Trials. I only deny that God always
inspir'd them with all the Arguments
they made use of on those occasions.
Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> adds, <hi>That to say that
the Spirit of Courage and Holiness,
which the Gospel produces in our Hearts,
dictated to the Apostles what they should
say, is to destroy intirely the inward
Grace which God did spread abroad in
the Hearts of his Apostles, and which he
yet daily spreads abroad in the Hearts
of the Faithful.</hi> But what does he
mean by this inward Grace, which
is common to the Apostles and the
Faithful? Is it not the Spirit of the
Gospel? At least the Faithful have
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:63500:88"/>
nothing else in common with the
Apostles. Now if the Apostles by
virtue of this Promise, <hi>It is not you
that speak, it is the Spirit of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that speaks in you,</hi> have receiv'd
(as Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> gives us to understand)
only <hi>the inward Grace which God spreads
abroad daily in the Hearts of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
the Inspirations of the Apostles
were not different from those of the
Faithful now a days.</q>

            <p>Objection 10.</p>
            <p>Whereas it is said,<note place="margin">Page 45, 48.</note> That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
spoke many things at their Trials
which might have been spoken without
Inspiration, and from thence is inferr'd
that it is not necessary to believe that
they were inspir'd with those things;
<hi>This way of arguing may be apply'd to the
Prophets, whom nevertheless we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
to have been truly inspir'd.</hi> Mr. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
Resp. 131.</p>
            <p>Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Mr. <hi>Simon,</hi> who sees nothing in
Books but what his Passion shows him,
might have taken notice that I said,
that the Prophets teach us they are
inspir'd, when they say <hi>Thus saith the
Lord,</hi> &amp;c. There are two ways to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:63500:88"/>
know if a thing be inspir'd. The
first consists in observing if those
who say this or that thing, maintain
that they had it from God by an
extraordinary Revelation, whereof
they give undeniable Proofs, as did
the Prophets. The second is when
the thing it self declar'd shows it to
be so. When the first way fails, we
must have recourse to the second; and
where they both fail, we have no
reason to believe there is any Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Now this is that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in many Discourses of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
where they do not say that God
has taught them by extraordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
that which they publish; And
where the matter it self shows that
there was no need of his doing it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It does not therefore follow, that
those who acknowledge the Inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Prophets are obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
the like of all other sacred
Writers; because there are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Reasons which oblige us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the Prophets speak Truth,
when they say <hi>Thus saith the Lord;</hi> &amp;c.
and no reason to believe that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
were extraordinarily inspir'd,
when they say it not; and when their
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:63500:89"/>
Discourses have in them no mark of
such like Inspiration.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If we reflect upon this difference
between Prophecies, and Discourses
which have nothing of Prophetic in
them, we shall take heed of applying
to this Subject a loose Maxim, and
which is good for nothing; <hi>viz.
That is happens most frequently that those
who distinguish and divide Matters, with
design to make use of part and reject the
other, do give great advantage to their
Adversaries.</hi> On the contrary, it
scarce ever happens, that in handling
a compounded Subject there can be
made such general Rules as may be
equally apply'd to all the parts of it.
Parts of different nature must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
be differently handled.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Objection 11.</p>
            <p>It has been said,<note place="margin">Page 49.</note> that by the holy
Spirit, or the Spirit of God, may be
understood the Spirit of Holiness and
of Constancy, which the Gospel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spires;
or such a Disposition of Mind
as is an Effect of our Faith. <hi>But the
general Reasons there made use of, which
are grounded only upon equivocal words,
can prove nothing but Generals: They must
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:63500:89"/>
be apply'd, and particular Enquiry made,
whether the holy Spirit has any other Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
in Scripture or no.</hi> Mr. <hi>Simon</hi>
Resp. <hi>Pag.</hi> 131.</p>
            <p>Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>When a Passage is to be answer'd
wherein there is an equivocal word,
upon which an Objection is founded,
it is sufficient to show that such
a word may be understood in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sense, than that in which it has
been taken. There is no need of
examining all the other Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that it may have. It suffices to
show that the Signification then given
it is agreeable to the ordinary use of
the Language, and suitable to the
Subject there treated of. It was
Mr. <hi>Simon</hi>'s part therefore to show
that where it is said of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi>
(on occasion of whom the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was made) <hi>That they could not
resist the Wisdom and Spirit by which
he spoke;</hi> I say it was his part to
show that by the word <hi>Sprit</hi> any
thing ought to be understood but the
Spirit of the Gospel; that is to say,
a Disposition of Mind conformable
to the Precepts of Jesus Christ. He
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:63500:90"/>
ought to have shown that this word
in this place ought necessarily to be
understood in another Sense. But
Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> seldom gives himself the
trouble to read the places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that are cited; as appears in the
same Page, where he says that St. <hi>Paul</hi>
told the High Priest <hi>with a just In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
God shall smite thee thou
whited Wall;</hi> and where he compares
the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to those of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, when he calls <hi>Herod Fox;</hi>
and to the Reproaches that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
make to the Kings of <hi>Israel.</hi>
But he should have shown us in what
place Jesus Christ and the Prophets
confess'd they were to blame in doing
so, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> confesses he was. God has
Power to censure Princes: But it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
not to Subjects to do it, when
they think sit. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> had no
right to abuse the High Priest, on his
own Head: though those who had
receiv'd express Order from God to
make such like Reproaches to Princes,
cannot be blam'd for it. But Mr. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
who probably never thought of
all this, is not aware of this difference;
and argues always on, without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
what he finds fault with.</q>

Obiection 12.</p>
            <p>The Promise which Jesus Christ made
his Apostles,<note place="margin">Page 42, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>that the holy Spirit should
teach them what they should say when
they came before the Iudges,</hi> seems to
have been explain'd as a general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
for all that they should say;
whereas it only relates to what they
should say for the defence of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
<hi>Luc.</hi> Chap. 12. ver. 11.</p>
            <p>Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The promise is express'd in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
terms, and must relate to that
which the Apostles should be oblig'd
to say as well for the defence of their
own Persons, as for that of the
Gospel. For it was of the greatest
importance that these first Ministers
of Jesus Christ should then say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
unworthy of the Doctrine of
which they were the Heraulds. But
if this Promise must not be taken
in so large a Sense, in relation to the
Discourses which the Apostles should
make before Judges; neither ought
it to be so taken in relation to their
preaching of the Gospel. My De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
was only to shew, that since the
words could not be taken in the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:63500:91"/>
whole extent of their Signification,
it could not from thence be necessarily
inferr'd that the Apostles had then
a Prophetic Inspiration,</q>
            </p>
            <p>Objection 13.</p>
            <p>The Promise (<hi>Iohn</hi> 16.)<note place="margin">Page 58.</note> that <hi>when
the Spirit of Truth shall come, it shall lead
you into all Truth,</hi> ought not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
so, as if it were intirely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd
the day of <hi>Pentecost;</hi> but as
a thing that should be accomplish'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the occasions and necessities
that the Apostles should be in, of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some further Truths. But it seems
as if Mr. <hi>N.</hi> suppos'd that this promise
is ordinarily understood, as if it ought
to have been accomplish'd all at once.</p>
            <p>Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The reason of my insisting upon
that was to make appear that this
Promise, though conceiv'd in so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
terms, ought necessarily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
some Qualification; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that it ought not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
like an Axiom of Geometry,
in the utmost Signification of its
Terms. Now that being once gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
it cannot be made appear that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:63500:91"/>
this Promise relates to a Prophetic
Inspiration. There is a Passage very
like this in the first Epistle of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
Chap. 2. ver. 27. <hi>But the anointing
which ye have received of him, abideth in
you: and ye need not that any Man
teach you: but, as the same anointing
teacheth you of all things, and is Truth,
and is no Lie: and even as it hath taught
you, ye shall abide in him.</hi> It is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
that this cannot be understood
strictly, since St. <hi>Iohn</hi> speaks to all
the Christians to whom he writ.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Objection 14.</p>
            <p>Whereas it has been affirmed that
the Apostles did not agree (<hi>Acts</hi> 15.)<note place="margin">Page 57.</note>
till after they had disputed a great
while; it is not said in that Chapter,
That the Apostles disputed; but only
that <hi>When there had been much disputing,</hi>
Peter <hi>rose up,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Two things were considered in this
History. The first is, The Opinion
that Men had of the Apostles, <hi>viz.</hi>
That they were not look'd upon as
Persons infallible, whensoever they
began to speak of the Gospel; since
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:63500:92"/>
they were not believ'd just at their
first speaking. The second is, The
Conduct of the Apostles on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
which is express'd in these
terms: <hi>The Apostles and Elders came
together for to consider of this matter.
And when there had been much disputing,</hi>
Peter <hi>rose up, and said,</hi> &amp;c. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Opinion is, that when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
was about Doctrinal Matters,
the Truth was immediately presented
to the Minds of the Apostles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any need of Meditation. This
is undoubtedly true as to the things
that Jesus Christ had taught them
clearly: And they needed no extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Inspiration to call them to mind.
But this Principle is extended by some
to all the Functions of their Charge.
Now ask if that were so, what need
was there that the Apostles should
not only meet, but also talk a long
while together? The first that had
spoke would have sound all the rest of
the same mind, and there would have
been no more to do but for him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
upon the Question, according
to their general, though tacit, Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
It cannot be said there was
no Conference amongst the Apostles
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:63500:92"/>
and Elders concerning this doctrine;
since St. <hi>Luke,</hi> after having said that the
<hi>Apostles and Elders came together,</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
adds, that <hi>there was much dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and that</hi> Peter <hi>rose up and said,</hi> &amp;c.
Neither can the Principle of Mr. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
be here made use of, who says
<hi>that the Apostles might not determine
any thing by their own Authority, but
by the common Consent of all the Church,</hi>
and that therefore it was that they
assembl'd, and expos'd in publick
their Reasons for not imposing Jewish
Ceremonies upon the Gentiles. If
the Apostles were as much inspir'd
as the Jewish Prophets of the Old
Testament, it is ridiculous to say
that they ought to determine nothing
by their own Authority, but by the
Consent of all the Church. They
had no more to do but to declare
what the holy Spirit had reveal'd to
them, as did the Prophets; who met
not together to confer about their
prophecies before the pronouncing
of them; but pronounc'd them as
soon as God had commanded them,
without staying for any body's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
And herein they acted not by
their private Authority, but by the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:63500:93"/>
Authority that God gave them, in
commanding them to speak to the
People. No more would the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
have acted by their own private
Authority, in following the Motions
of the holy Spirit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> has fancy'd a very
particular sort of Inspiration in the
Apostles.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> He says <hi>it was necessary they
should declare that they determin'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
which was not conformable to the
holy Scriptures, and to the Doctrine
which they had receiv'd from their
Master, and that for that Reason it was
necessary to deliberate thereupon in As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies;
in which their Opinions happen'd
to be sometimes divided.</hi> A Man must
be very acute, that can comprehend
how Men inspir'd after a Prophetic
manner could be of different Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> clears this Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
wonderfully in the following
words. <hi>We ought not</hi> (says he) <hi>to be
surpriz'd at this Diversity of Opinions,
since every one grounded his particular
one upon Inspiration.</hi> Now this is that
which should have hinder'd them
from being of different Opinions;
since assuredly God inspires not seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Opinions about one and the same
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:63500:93"/>
thing. It is all one as if one should
say that we ought not to be surpriz'd,
that of two Prophets, one should say
a thing shall happen, and the other
that it shall not happen, because they
both ground their Predictions <hi>upon
Inspiration.</hi> And indeed Mr. <hi>Simon</hi>
corrects himself, after a fashion, by
adding; <hi>Or rather upon the Authority
of the Scriptures, and the Light which
they had receiv'd from Religion.</hi> If he
understands by the Inspiration of the
Apostles, nothing <hi>but the Light which
they had receiv'd from Religion,</hi> why
does he make all this ado; since here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we agree with him? He ought to
tell us whether or no, when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
spoke by Inspiration, they did
any thing, but express, in their own
way, the Reasonings which God had
put ready fram'd into their Minds.
If that be so, how can we conceive
that their Opinions should not be
one and the same? And if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd
them not with the Reasonings
they used, then we cannot attribute
Prophetic Inspiration to them; since
it is therein that Prophetic Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
consists. It is very absurd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to believe, that all the Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:63500:94"/>
the Apostles us'd in preaching
the Gospel, and all those we read in
their Books, were inspir'd. For it
is therein that the Inspiration of the
Apostles is ordinarily conceiv'd to
consist. This is that uniform, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
and ordinary Inspiration which
Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> comprehends not, because
he never thought well upon it. Nor
indeed does he know what Opinion
he is of Sometimes he speaks like
the generality of Divines, sometimes
again he openly contradicts them, as
may be seen by the words I have cited.
He must study a little better this
matter, if he will have us answer him:
For it is very likely that for the most
part he understands not himself. I
will give but one Example more of it.
(It is that which he says concerning
the Author of <hi>Ecclesiastes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> p. 138.) For
we need but read his words, to find
that the Prior of <hi>Bolleville</hi> minds not
what he says. <hi>The Author,</hi> says he, <hi>of this
Work did not design ONLY to perswade
Men to pass their Time in Pleasure.—To
which may be added, that Declamation
being the proper Character of a Preacher,
it is no wonder to see him despise all the
ordinary Business and Imployments of the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:63500:94"/>
World, and to prefer an easy commodious
Life before all the Troubles that attend a
contrary Practice: For which he is not to
be censur'd as if he were an Epicure, after
the manner that Mr.</hi> N. <hi>here understands
the Opinions of the Epicureans.</hi> He would
have done well to have told us of
what sort of Epicurism the Author
of the <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> may be accus'd.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Objection 15.</p>
            <p>It is a great piece of Boldness to
judg four Books of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(three that bear the Name of
<hi>Solomon,</hi> and that of <hi>Iob</hi>) as unworthy
to be in the Hebrew Canon. That Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of censuring would weaken the
Principles of our Religion. For
every one by the same Rule may say
that such or such a Book is not Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,
according to his own fancy.</p>
            <p>Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Although we may reject some Books
of the Old Testament, it does not
follow that we may do the same by
all of them. Neither does it follow,
because many Ancient and Modern
Divines have thought it would have
been better not to have joined, with
the Writings of the Apostles, certain
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:63500:95"/>
Books that are now in the Canon of
the New Testament, that therefore
we may reject all the Books of the
Apostles. There are Books that are
indisputably of those Authors whose
Name they bear; and there are others
which have been questionable, and
are so still amongst the Learned; as
the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that of
St. <hi>Iames,</hi> the second of St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
the two last of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and that of
St. <hi>Iude.</hi> These Doubts hinder us
not from agreeing about the Gospels,
and St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles; nor from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
clearly that they are the Books
of those whose Name they bear. I
know not why we may not doubt of
some of the Books of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
as well as of some of those
of the New; and why ill Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
should be drawn from their
Opinions who doubt of some of the
former, when none is drawn from
theirs that reject the latter. The
Canon of the Books of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
ought to be of much greater
importance with us than that of the
Old. It is a mistake that we ought
to receive all or reject all. It is not
true that we ought to receive all. It
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:63500:95"/>
is less true that we ought to reject
all. But there is a mean betwixt
these two Extreams.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Objection 16.</p>
            <p>But what will be said to these words
of St. <hi>Paul, 2 Tim.</hi> III. 16. <hi>All Scripture
is of Divine Inspiration?</hi> For they ought
to be read in the vulgar Translation,
according to the Greek, and also accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the ancient vulgar, <hi>Omnis Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptura
divinitùs inspirata &amp; utilis;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Mr. <hi>N.</hi> reads them, <hi>Omnis Scriptura di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitùs
inspirata utilis est.</hi> The Verb <hi>est</hi> is
not in the Greek, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which signifies
<hi>Et,</hi> is before <hi>utilis.</hi> If this Verb be to be
supply'd (because it is often wanting in
the Hebrew and the Syriac, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in the Greek of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
it ought to be done in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>Omnis Scriptura divinitùs inspirata est
&amp; utilis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Mr. <hi>Simon</hi>'s Decrees are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Appeal. We maintain, against
him, that this Passage may very well
be thus translated; <hi>All Scripture that
is divinely inspir'd is also profitable for
Instruction, for Reproof,</hi> &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:63500:96"/>
So the vulgar translates it; which
Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> improperly corrects, and
which the Gentlemen of <hi>Port-Royal</hi>
have judiciously follow'd. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Design favours this Version. He tells
<hi>Timothy, that the holy Scriptures are
able to make him wise unto Salvation:</hi>
to which he adds, <hi>That all Scripture
given by Inspiration of God is profitable
for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Righteousness; that the Man of
God may be perfect,</hi> &amp;c. These words
are a sort of Explanation of those
foregoing, where St. <hi>Paul</hi> sets down
after what manner the holy Scriptures
may instruct to Salvation. There is
a tacit opposition here between Holy
Writ and certain prophane Studies;
As will easily appear, if we go back
a little higher to find the Thred of
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Discourse, and observe the
occasion of his saying, <hi>That all Writ
divinely inspir'd is profitable,</hi> &amp;c. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
describes in the<note n="*" place="margin">Ver. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> beginning of the
Chapter a sort of wicked People,
whom in the 5<hi>th</hi> Verse he orders
<hi>Timothy</hi> to avoid. The Characters
he marks them by suit very well
to the <hi>Gnostics.</hi> But it matters not
of whom He speaks. It suffices
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:63500:96"/>
that we observe that they were Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who boasted of teaching their
Hearers many things; witness those
<note n="*" place="margin">Ver. 6, 7.</note> Women they had seduc'd, <hi>which
were always learning, and never arriv'd
to the knowledg of the Truth.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Ver. 8, 9,</note> But
the Apostle foretels their Seducement
should not long continue.<note n="‖" place="margin">Ver. 10, 11.</note> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
to <hi>Timothy</hi> that he had fully
known his Doctrine, his manner of
Life, and the Persecutions he had
suffer'd; in order to strengthen him
by his Example.<note n="*" place="margin">Ver. 12, 13.</note> He declares that
the Good shall always be persecuted,
and that there shall still be Seducers,
and Persons seduced.<note n="†" place="margin">V. 14. &amp; fol.</note> 
                  <hi>But Thou,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues

thou hast learn'd, and hast been assured
of, knowing from whom thou hast learn'd
them, and that from a Child thou hast
known the holy Scriptures, which are able
to make thee wise unto Salvation through
Faith in Iesus Christ.</hi> He opposes
plainly the Study of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to the Study of fabulous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines;

<hi>Ch. 4. v.</hi> 4.) And as here he orders
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:63500:97"/>
his dear Disciple <hi>to continue firm in
those things he had learn'd, and which he
had been assur'd of;</hi> he likewise ends his
first Epistle with this Exhortation,
<hi>O</hi> Timothy, <hi>keep that which is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to thy Trust, avoiding profane and
vain bablings, and opposition of Science
falsly so called; which some professing,
have err'd concerning the Faith.</hi> And thus
when he adds, <hi>That all Scripture given
by Inspiration,</hi> &amp;c. It is as if he had
said to <hi>Timothy,</hi> That he ought to
keep close, as he had done hitherto,
to the study of the Old Testament;
which would instruct him sufficiently
in the way to Salvation, by joining
thereunto Faith in Jesus Christ: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all Scripture inspir'd by God,
as is a great part of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is profitable for Instruction:
Whereas if he apply'd himself to the
false Science that some Impostors then
boasted of, he would cultivate Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
that would be proper for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but to raise Disputes, instead of
edifying; as he had else-where told
him. By this it is evident, that all this
reasoning of St. <hi>Paul</hi> does in no wise
suppose that all the Scripture of the
Old Testament is inspir'd; and that
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:63500:97"/>
the Apostle pretends thereby only to
intimate that the inspir'd Writings
(without fixing the number of them)
are more profitable than those that
some Persons at that time boasted of.</q>

            <head>THE
FIFTH LETTER.</head>
            <p>I Am perswaded, Sir, that the two
last Letters I writ you, will have
fully satisfied those among your
Friends, who wish'd that the Writing
about Inspiration had been suppress'd,
or who desir'd some Explanation of the
Author's Opinion, or even who believ'd
they were in the wrong that said it was
hard to confute it. We must now try
to give some Satisfaction to those who
have said that this Opinion leads to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism,
and that our Friend was infected
with the detestable Opinions of the
Deists. Now I having openly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the contrary, he has impos'd
upon me the Task of justifying him in
this Particular. And I think I can
evidently demonstrate, that they who
have brought this Accusation against
our Friend, have therein violated that
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:63500:99"/>
which is most sacred in Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
and that while they endeavour
to maintain it by a Zeal, not only want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Knowledg, but also void of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
they have not sufficiently reflected
upon the true Proofs of the Divinity
of our Religion, and upon the Method
us'd by many of those who have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
to desend it against Atheists
and Infidels. But I confess to you I
dare not promise to my self ever to
satisfy intirely this sort of People;
because they are such as fancy they
know every thing. They have given o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all Study; they examine nothing;
and they think they should do a thing
unworthy of their Character, if they
should confess they had condemn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one wrongfully, and if they abated
never so little of the heat of their
Zeal. This Zeal, or rather blind Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is made up of Choler, and
animated by Superstition, Pride and
Envy, discomposes them so violently,
and with so little Intermission, that it
is very hard to find a moment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are fit to hear quietly the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifications
of those, whom they have
too rashly condemned. It is not amiss
however to tell them our Reasons.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:63500:99"/>
If they themselves will not hear them,
yet perhaps these Reasons may prevent
some other Persons of more ingenuous
Dispositions from forming such rash
Judgments, as the vehement Declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of these implacable Zealots would
otherwise move them to.</p>
            <p>Two things ought here to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd:
The Person, and the Opinions.
A Man may have Opinions, the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
whereof are very evil and very
dangerous, without being aware of
these Consequences, how necessarily
soever they may seem unto others to
follow from them. I have made this
plain in the beginning of my first Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
on this Subject. It ought not then
to be concluded, because a Man em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
a certain Opinion, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he admits all the Consequences.
This Truth is own'd by every one;
but little made use of by any, when
they pass Judgment upon those that
are opposite to their Party. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
none that are equitable can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to allow this Justification of our
Friend; I mean that protesting, as he
does, an utter abhorrence of those
impious Consequences, which in his
Judgment are unduly wrested from his
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:63500:100"/>
Opinions, he himself (at least) ought
to be absolv'd, although his Doctrine be
condemned.</p>
            <p>Natural Equity obliges us to believe
that a Man is perswaded of a thing
when he affirms it, and when we have
no evident signs of his design to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us. This also is a Rule in Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
generally agreed upon, but of which
as little use is made as of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
one. But let Men do what they
will; it must be acknowledg'd that
those who refuse to believe our Friend,
when he affirms that he is perfectly
convinc'd of the Truth of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, do violate the Charity,
and the Equity, which we ought to have
naturally one for another; seeing they
have no evident sign to convince them
that this Protestation of his is hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, these Zealots, who judg
amiss of his Piety, ground their rash
Judgment but upon very light Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions.
They believe that our Friend
has discover'd but part of his Opinions
concerning the Inspiration of the holy
Writers, for fear of too much thwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Public, and losing altogether
his Reputation. But he, on the other
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:63500:100"/>
side, protests that he has laid open the
very bottom of his Thoughts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Reserve; and without hiding
any thing, which he thought might
contribute to discover the whole Extent
of his Opinion in this matter. This
is all he can do to repel so unjust a
Suspicion. If they who frame a rash
Judgment upon so ill-grounded Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions,
met with the like Usage, none
of them would be found innocent. It
might always be said, when they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any thing from whence an ill
Consequence may be drawn (and from
what may not that be done?) that
they speak not all they think, for fear
of being cry'd down, and losing their
Pensions. The Zeal, for example, of
which they are so proud, might pass
for an Effect of an artificial Policy;
by which they endeavour to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
themselves Masters of the Peoples
Minds; in order to satisfy their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
and oppress their Enemies.
In a word, they should not make one
step, which might not be interpreted
maliciously, and made look odiously.
But it behoves us and them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that Precept of our Saviour,
founded upon the plain Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:63500:101"/>
               <hi>Do not to another that which
ye would not should be done to you.</hi> If
the Heat of an indiscreet Zeal keep
them from observing this Precept, yet
nothing shall make us trangress it.</p>
            <p>I conclude then that our Friend can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ill thought of, without wronging
the universal Rules of Equity and
Charity; and in this case those Rules
will be the more enormously broken,
by how much the Impiety which our
Friend is accus'd of is more detestable.
Rash Judgments and ill-grounded Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions
are always Crimes, although the
matter they relate to be of small im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance:
but when the Concern is not
only the Reputation of a Person, but
also his Life, and which is yet more,
his Salvation, they become still more
hainous. To affirm that a Man is of
an Opinion such as is that of the Deists,
without having evident Proofs of it,
is to say that a Man is an Enemy of
God and Men; that he is in a State
wherein he can expect nothing but the
Anger of Heaven; wherein he merits
even to be no longer suffer'd upon
Earth; and it argues that these Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniators,
after having made him lose
his good Name, would if they could
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:63500:101"/>
deprive him also of his Life. Let any
reasonable Man judg, if, without cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and convincing Proofs, a Man
may pronounce so terrible a Sentence
against his Neighbour, and not be
guilty of the greatest Injustice imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>It seems to me, Sir, that this is so
plain I need dwell no longer upon it.
The Person of our Friend then being
justified against these rash Suspicions;
we will now show that the Truth of
the Christian Religion may be undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
prov'd, without taking any side
about the Doctrine of Inspiration; and
consequently without supposing the
common Opinion. This I intend to
do; after I have first observ'd that seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
great Men, and who have pass'd for
good Christians, have held this Opinion
without losing the Reputation they had
of Piety. There is not a Man of
Worth and Honour among the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
who will dare to say that <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
and <hi>Grotius</hi> were Libertines; and
yet both of them defended openly this
same Opinion. But because there are
some Divines who esteem none but
those that have been of the Society
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:63500:102"/>
they live in, I will repeat some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remarkable
words of a Divine famous
amongst the Presbyterians in <hi>England,</hi>
and even amongst those on this side
the Water. It is Mr. <hi>Richard Baxter,</hi>
who speaks thus in an English Book
translated not long since into Dutch,
and intituled, <hi>The Saints everlasting Rest.</hi>
22.<note place="margin">In 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                  <hi>Lond.</hi> 1656. Edit. 6. par. 2. ch. 3. Sect. 2. pag. 210.</note> 
               <hi>Though all Scripture be of Divine
Authority: yet he who believeth but some
one Book, that containeth the Substance
of the Doctrine of Salvation, may be sav'd:
much more they that have doubted but of
some particular Books. 23. They that
take the Scripture to be but the Writings
of godly honest Men, and so to be only
a means of making known Christ, having
a gradual Precedency to the Writings of
other godly Men: and do believe in Christ
upon those strong Grounds which are drawn
from his Doctrine, Miracles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>rather
than upon the Testimony of the Writing,
it being purely infallible and divine, may
yet have a divine and saving Faith.
24. Much more those that believe the
whole Writing to be of Divine Inspiration
where it handleth the Substance, but doubt
whether God infallibly guided them in
every Circumstance.</hi> And in the next
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:63500:102"/>
Page. 32. <hi>The Circumstantials are many
of them divine, yet so as they have in them
something humane, as the bringing of
St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s Cloke and the Parchments,
and (as it seems) his Counsel about
Marriage,</hi> &amp;c. 33. <hi>Much more is there
something human in the Method and Phrase,
which is not so immediately divine as the
Doctrine. 34. Yet is there nothing sinfully
humane, and therefore nothing false in all.
35. But all innocent Imperfection here is
in the Method and Phrase, which of we
deny, we must renounce most of our Logick
and Rhetorick.</hi> Nothing can be more
expresly said for the Justification of
our Friend. Those who have a value
for Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> must forgo their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
of him, or else not condemn
so lightly those who in his Judgment
may have a saving Faith, together with
some Opinions different from those
commonly receiv'd.</p>
            <p>It may likewise be observ'd, that
many of those who have writ of the
Truth of the Christian Religion, have
prov'd it without supposing the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Inspiration of the Historians of
the New Testament to be such as it
is ordinarily taken to be; as <hi>Grotius,</hi>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:63500:103"/>
whose Book has been alike esteem'd by
all Parties. Which shows that our Belief
is not founded upon this Supposition;
and that consequently one may be a
good Christian without admitting it.
But it is better to represent this by
an Example, which will give you a
more lively Impression of what I aim
at.</p>
            <p>I will therefore now indeavour, in
as few words as is possible, to give
you the Idea of a Method that seems
to me very strong, and very proper to
convince a Libertine of the Truth of
our Religion, without once mentioning
any thing of particular Inspiration. I
do not pretend thereby to condemn all
other Methods that may be used to
the like purpose; but it seems to
me that this is the simplest of all,
and subject to the fewest Difficulties.
You will allow me, Sir, this small
Digression; which may perhaps not
be unuseful, in a time when there are
every where so many that doubt of
the Truth of the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>The first, and the greatest Objection
the Libertines make us is, That our
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:63500:103"/>
Judgments are pre-possess'd, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
us from being undeceiv'd. We
say the same of them; and maintain
that it is nothing but sensual Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
that raise those Difficulties in
their Minds, which would vanish if
they examin'd them without Passion.
It is not just that either they or we
should take for granted our Pre-possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as Principles demonstrated, or
which need not be demonstrated. Let
us then act on both sides as if we had
not yet espous'd any party, and let us
urge nothing that is not founded upon
Principles which both sides acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</p>
            <p>It is agreed that there are certain
Characters by which we may be assur'd
whether a thing has been done or no,
and by which we may distinguish the
Truth or Falshood of a History. If
we do not agree in that, we are
<hi>Pyrrhoniens;</hi> or, to give it a better
Name, altogether senseless: for none
but a Mad-Man can doubt of the Truth
of all the Histories in the World. But
farther, we must also agree in another
thing, which is no less certain. It is,
that there are certain Matters of Fact,
the Truth whereof is better conceiv'd
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:63500:104"/>
than it can be prov'd; and which are
of such a nature, that unless a Man be
in a proper Disposition of Mind he can
hardly be induc'd to believe them. For
Example, If any one should tell us here
that the Inquisition of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi>
has approv'd the Works of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and
allow'd the People to read them in
<hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Italian;</hi> although it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for us to believe it, and that
we are firmly perswaded of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
we should not be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
a Person who should be obstinate
in maintaining it, until we had given
him evident Proofs thereof. In like
manner, if there were false Witnesses
ready to swear that one of our Friends,
(whose Vertue had been well known
to us for divers Years, and who but
just then was gone out of our Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)
went then immediately in cold
Blood to assassinate a Person unknown
to him, for no other reason but only to
make an Anatomical Dissection of his
Body; it is certain we should not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, although it might not be
in our Power to prove judicially the
contrary.</p>
            <p>It is easy to imagine a thousand Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of such like Truths, which we
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:63500:104"/>
apprehend better than we can prove.
That being suppos'd, if we come to
the Christian Religion, there occurs at
the very first a difficulty in discerning
what are the Doctrines of this Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
for Christians have great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
among themselves about their
Belief. There would be no end of
going about to examine all these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies.
Let us therefore suspend
our Judgment thereupon, and see first
wherein all Christians are agreed. They
all agree, for Example, that most of
the Books of the New Testament are
the Writings of those Authors whose
Name they bear, and who writ them
more than sixteen hundred Years ago;
that the History therein is true, and
that we ought to obey the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
therein contain'd. This Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
may be reduc'd to these gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Heads; a rendering to God the
Service due to him; a trusting in his
Promises; and a keeping his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
in what concerns both our selves
and our Neighbour. But this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
a Belief of all those Scriptural
Truths without which a Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
perfom his Duty; as that there
is a God, absolutely perfect, who has
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:63500:105"/>
sent Jesus Christ into the World to
draw Men from their Sins, and guide
them to eternal Salvation; that this
Jesus has been rais'd from the Dead,
and that he now reigns in Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
All Christians agree in all this.</p>
            <p>Let us suspend still our Jugdment
concerning Doctrines, and speak yet
only of the practical Part of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
It cannot be deny'd but that if
all Men liv'd according to the Precepts
of the Gospel; and that, out of the
hope of another Life, they betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with Care to adore the Creator
of the Universe, to live always in
Temperance, and Sobriety, and to do
constantly to their Neighbour as they
desire their Neighbour should do to
them; It cannot be deny'd, I say, but
this manner of living would be very
agreeable and very advantagious to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Society. We should not then hear
any words spoken that could cause us
Trouble, or that would kindle Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in Religion. There would be no
Sickness through Intemperance, no
Vexation, nor any Quarrel occasion'd
by Debauchery. The doing Wrong
to ones Neighbour, and the suffering
any Inconvenience through the Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:63500:105"/>
or Malice of Men would be
things unknown: Men would help one
another in all their Needs, with all the
Fervency and Earnestness that could
be desir'd: If by mistake any of them
had been the occasion of Inconvenience
to one another, they would mutually
pardon one another, and repair that
Damage by all sorts of Services. The
love of Honours, or of Riches, would
trouble no Man's Mind, nor cause any
Envy or Discord. In a word, the Mind
being in a perfect Tranquillity, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
as healthful as feeble Nature will
admit, and both Mind and Body enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the innocent Pleasures which the
Gospel allows, this amiable Life would
not be quitted but for the enjoyment of
another, freed from all the inevitable
Inconveniences entail'd by Nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Inhabitants of this Earth.</p>
            <p>All that have any Idea of the Rules
of Morality taught by Jesus Christ,
must necessarily agree in this Truth;
that by generally observing them, Men
would be exceedingly happy. But it
may perhaps be ask'd, Where is there
in the World a Society in which, Men
live conformably to these Rules of
Morality? That is not the Question.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:63500:106"/>
It is sufficient for our present purpose
that there are at this time many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that make Profession of it, though
they live not up to the Practice. Let
us enquire whether these Nations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
those Rules, or receiv'd them
from their Predecessors? They all tell
us they are not the Inventers; and it
may well be judg'd, by their way of
living, that they say true: For it is not
probable they should have invented the
Precepts of the Gospel, and yet live so
contrary to them. Inventions always
savour something of the temper of the
Spirit of the Inventors.</p>
            <p>But we have no need of Arguments
to convince us of this: We may exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
from Age to Age the Authors
that are left us, beginning at our own,
and going backwards to that wherein
Christian Religion was first spoken of,
to see who they were that brought it
into the World. We shall readily
find, by reading those Authors, that it
is more than thirteen hundred Years
since the <hi>Roman Emperors</hi> being become
Christians, Christianity has flourish'd
in a great part of <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> and
<hi>Africa.</hi> Since that time we may be
convinced, by a very great number of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:63500:106"/>
Christian Authors, that Profession has
been constantly made of believing that
the Morality taught us in the Gospel
came from Heaven. If we go yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
backwards, we shall find that even
under the Pagan Emperors there was a
great multitude of Christians that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
the same Doctrine. We have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Christian Authors, of those times,
who assure us of it. But, without staying
to reckon up needlesly Authors sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known, let us examine in what Age
Christianity began first to be spoken of.
All Christians agree that it was under
the Reign of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> and if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
Heathen Authors, we shall see that
before that time it was altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.
<hi>Tacitus,</hi> who was born towards
the end of the Reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> or
about the beginning of that of <hi>Nero,</hi>
says that <hi>Nero,</hi> after having set <hi>Rome</hi>
on fire in divers places, and thereby
destroy'd the City, accus'd the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
of it, and made them suffer hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Punishments. Upon that occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he speaks of the beginning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
in these terms. <hi>The Author of
this Sect</hi> (says he) <hi>was Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>An.</hi> l. 15. c. 44.</note> 
               <hi>who in
the Reign of</hi> Tiberius <hi>was put to death
by</hi> Pontius Pilate <hi>Governour of</hi> Judaea.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:63500:107"/>
               <hi>This dangerous Superstition,</hi> continues he,
in speaking of the Christian Religion,
<hi>though nipp'd in the Bud, broke out a
fresh, and spread not only through</hi> Judaea,
<hi>where the Mischief first began, but came
even into</hi> Rome <hi>it self, where all things
shameful and abominable are brought, and
find Persons ready to join with and uphold
them. Presently as many as confess'd they
were Christians, were seiz'd on, and soon
after a great many more were discover'd,
but were not found guilty of the Fire,
though they were the Objects of the public
Hatred,</hi> &amp;c. You see here the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of a Heathen Author, who being
born in the beginning of Christianity,
and very well vers'd in the Passages
of his Time, assures us of two things
then publickly notorious. The one,
that the Authors of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
had liv'd in <hi>Iudaea</hi> in the Reign
of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and had been punish'd du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Government of <hi>Pontius Pilate.</hi>
The other, that after his Death, in
few Years, the Embracers of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
were extreamly multiply'd. <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi>
also tells us,<note place="margin">In Claud. <hi>c.</hi> 15.</note> that in the time of
the Emperor <hi>Claudius,</hi> the Christians
were banish'd out of <hi>Rome;</hi> which shows
that there were then a great number
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:63500:107"/>
of them in that Capital City.</p>
            <p>We find also by the Testimony of
another Author, contemporary to <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,</hi>
that the Christians at that time
made Profession of the same Morals
they teach now a-days. <hi>Pliny</hi> being
Proconsul of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> about threescore
and ten Years after <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> had
been Governour of <hi>Iudaea,</hi> by <hi>Trajan</hi>'s
Order sought out the Christians with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his Province, and inform'd himself
with all the care imaginable concerning
their Opinions: Hereupon he writes a
Letter to <hi>Trajan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 10. Ep. 97.</note> which Letter is still
preserv'd. <hi>I was inform'd,</hi> says he, <hi>that
all their Crime, or Error, consisted only in
that they us'd to assemble themselves upon
a certain Night, and to sing together a
Hymn to Christ, as to a God: That they
all oblig'd themselves by Oath not to any
Crime; but on the contrary, that they
would not commit Felony, Robbery, or Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;
and that they would deceive no Man,
nor break a Trust: This done, they dispers'd
and return'd again after sometime to eat
together, which they did in common, and
without any harm: But that they had given
over doing it upon my Proclamation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
according to your Orders, I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
all sorts of Conventicles. This
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:63500:108"/>
made me believe that I could not get out
the Truth better than by putting to the Rack
two Women Servants, whom they call Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conesses;
but I discover'd nothing but a
strange and excessive Superstition.</hi> They
that understand the Latin Tongue,
will not wonder that <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi>
make use of the word <hi>Superstition.</hi> The
Romans gave that Name to all sorts
of Religious Worship that were not
establish'd by public Authority.</p>
            <p>Two such Witnesses as these cannot
be excepted against; Seeing it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
they had no favour for Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and were perhaps the most able
Men of their time; but especially if
we consider that they treat of matters
of Fact, which they themselves had
either seen, or which were known by
all Men, as was the Death of Jesus
Christ under <hi>Pontius Pilate.</hi> The Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
that we have of Christians living
between the times of <hi>Pilate</hi> and those
of <hi>Tacitus</hi> or <hi>Trajan,</hi> attest the same
Truths: They date the beginning of
Christianity from the same Christ that
<hi>Pilate</hi> put to Death, and they preach
to us precisely the same Morals.</p>
            <p>We must then necessarily allow
that there was in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> during the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:63500:108"/>
Reign of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> a Person that laid
the Foundation of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and had many Disciples. Let
us now examine some of his first Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and see what sort of People they
were. Let us read the Epistle which
<hi>Clement,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> writ to the
Christians of <hi>Corinth,</hi> forty Years after
the Death of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and in the
beginning of the Raign of <hi>Vespasian.</hi>
There appears in this Epistle a Spirit
of Peace, of Charity, of Humility,
and many lively and pathetical Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
to the Observation of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Morals.
He reproves severely those
that had not observ'd them, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
those that had. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of that Epistle, he says among
other things, <hi>That the Christians of</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth
<hi>had labour'd day and night for their
Brethren (to the end that the number of
the Elect might be sav'd) in applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to Works of Mercy, and of a good
Conscience; That they had been sincere,
without Malice, and without remembring
the Ill that any of them might formerly
have done to one another; That all Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Schism was abhorr'd by them;
That they were afflicted for their Neighbour's
Failings; That they look'd upon his Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:63500:109"/>
as their own; That they never repented
them of well-doing, but were always ready
to do all sorts of good Works; That in their
Conversation, full of Vertue, and worthy of
Veneration, they did all things in the fear
of God, whose Commandments were writ in
their Hearts.</hi> He adds afterwards, <hi>That
he had known may Christians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 123. Ed. Ox. in 12<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.</note> 
               <hi>who, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
others out of Slavery, had put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in Chains; That many having sold
themselves for Slaves, had maintain'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
out of the price of their own Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Masters of this <hi>Clement</hi> were
the first Disciples of <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi>
who was the first Teacher of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
and he gives Testimony of their
great Piety. Indeed if we read their
Writings, we find nothing in them but
what speaks a profound Veneration of
the Deity, an extream Tenderness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
all Men, and an extraordinary
Strictness in all that concerns the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of a Man's Self. Let us
chuse which we will of them, we shall
find nothing in their Works but what
tends to Piety. If some of their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
have been question'd, let us take
those concerning which there never
was any Question; Or, without looking
further, the Gospel according to St. <hi>Luke,</hi>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:63500:109"/>
and the first Epistle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> which are cited by <hi>Clement,</hi>
and we shall perceive every where the
same Morals which they endeavour to
implant in the Hearts of their Disciples.</p>
            <p>I suppose all along that the Reader
has some knowledg of the Precepts of
the Gospel, and has given some attention
to what I said at the beginning; And
then I dare boldly say, that unless he
have lost all Sense, he will acknowledg
that there is nothing more reasonable
that the Morals of the Gospel; and
that it were to be wish'd that all the
World observ'd them. The Apostles
then in exhorting their Hearers to live
after a manner so reasonable, and so
profitable to human Society, requir'd
nothing of them contrary to Reason,
or to the true Interests of all Mankind.
And this puts me in mind of the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Person, that once had no great
Opinion of the Truth of our Religion.
When the Morals, which the Disciples of
Jesus Christ preach'd throughout the
World, were thus livelily describ'd to
him, he could not but fall into these
words, which the Evidence of the
thing drew from him, <hi>I wish all the World
had believ'd them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:63500:110"/>
This Doctrine of the Apostles ought
undoubtedly to make all those who
love human Society, and their own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
to listen to it. But it may
here be objected that perhaps the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
preach'd not this Doctrine, but in
design to insinuate themselves into the
Minds of the People; and afterwards,
upon pretext of Piety, to get from them
whatsoever they had a mind to. But
to answer that Objection, in the first
place I observe, and suppose it will
be granted me, that this Suspicion has
no Foundation in the Doctrine which
they preach'd. For that condemns the
love of Honours, of Riches, and of
Pleasures. There cannot so much as
one single Passage of their Works be
alledg'd that favours Ambition, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness,
or Concupiscence.</p>
            <p>This being so, this Suspicion can be
grounded but upon one of these two
things; Either that the Apostles could
hope to make some advantage of this
their Doctrine, when it should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd;
or that they actually made it,
when they preach'd it. I understand
here by Advantage A Good out-ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
all the Inconveniences that the
Apostles underwent in preaching the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:63500:110"/>
Gospel, or at least such a one as they
esteem'd in that degree. It is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
if they were Deceivers, but that
they propos'd an Advantage to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
greater than the Pains they took:
Otherwise they might justly be look'd
upon as Fools, which they cannot
(without great Impertinence) be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to have been by any that read
their Writings.</p>
            <p>Now the Apostles could not hope to
make any Advantage of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
unless it were receiv'd by the
generality of those amongst whom they
preach'd it. For without that, they
would have been expos'd to perpetual
Persecution. None but Fools could
expect to live quietly amongst People
vehemently prepossest with Opinions
directly contrary to those they resolv'd
to profess and teach; People that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
themselves oblig'd for the Interest
of the State, and of Religion, to take
away both the Estates and Lives of
those that oppos'd their Superstition.
Such were the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and
the <hi>Iews,</hi> in the times of the Apostles.
They must then have hoped that their
preaching would take such effect as
would draw after them the greatest
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:63500:111"/>
part of the World. But that was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be hop'd for, by any that
had never so little knowledg of the
Disposition of the Heart of Man. And
the Apostles, who had a great share of
this Knowledg, as appears by their
Writings, could less than others ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
such a thing. The <hi>Iews</hi> were so
passionately wedded to their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
that there was not the least likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of succeeding with them. The
<hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> were so over Head
and Ears in Pleasures, so covetous, so
ambitious, that the small number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them who had not lost all
thought of Vertue, speak of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of that Age with Horror and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation.
The Histories of both those
People (if we judg of them by the
Ideas of the Gospel) present us, in
the Events of those Times, with a
Picture of the most horrible Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that ever was. And can it then be
imagin'd that the Apostles should hope
to draw to their Opinions the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of those that liv'd in such times?
How could they promise themselves,
that People so blinded by their Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and so harden'd in their Crimes,
would ever relent? No, they tell us
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:63500:111"/>
plainly (after their Master) that they
hoped not to make the Gospel be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by any great number of Persons,
in comparison of those that would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in Unbelief.</p>
            <p>But if yet it be suppos'd that the
Simplicity of the Apostles might have
incourag'd them to hope for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of the greatest part of the
Roman Empire, Experience however
would at length have undeceiv'd them;
since after having preach'd many Years
they were forc'd to acknowledg they had
gain'd very few. History shows us
clearly, that for some Ages after the
beginning of Christianity there were
much fewer Christians in the Roman
Empire than Heathens. Thus then we
see that the Apostles were necessarily
exposed to cruel Persecutions all their
Lives; scorn'd, and hated alike by
Jews and Gentiles, they could have no
Recompence any way proportionable
to their Labours. And so they tell us
plainly, that they expected nothing
but Afflictions in this Life; and that it
was all they hoped for from Men of
this World, in Recompence of what
they undertook in preaching unto them
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:63500:112"/>
a Doctrine so reasonable as are the
Gospel-Morals. Nor were they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd;
for after having suffer'd great
Torments, they in the end lost their
Lives in an ignominious manner, by
the hands of Executioners, asserting to
the last the Truth of the Doctrine they
had preach'd. <hi>It was by great Injustice
and Malice,</hi> says <hi>Clement,</hi> whom we
cited before, <hi>that</hi> Peter <hi>underwent not
one or two, but many Pains; and after
having thereby born Testimony to the
Truth, went to the place of Glory that was
due to him. It was through the like Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of Men that</hi> Paul <hi>receiv'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of his Patience; having been seven
times put in Chains, whipp'd and ston'd;
Having been the Herauld of the Gospel
in the East and in the West, and having
render'd his Faith illustrious; Having
preach'd Iustice to all the Earth, and
being arriv'd at the utmost part of the
West, after having born Testimony to the
Truth before the principal Rulers there,
he departed out of this World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Event of the preaching of the
Apostles, absolutely overthrows the
second Ground whereon Men might
build suspicions of their Sincerity, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:63500:112"/>
that they had made an Advantage by
their preaching equivalent to the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and Dangers they were subject to.
If they were esteem'd by a small number
of Persons of mean Condition, that
hinder'd them not from being despis'd
by all the rest of Mankind, Jews and
Gentiles; from being ill treated and
persecuted; from suffering extream Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty;
and at last from dying upon
Scaffolds and Grosses; as we have seen
by what <hi>Clement</hi> says, and as all their
Disciples unanimously affirm. One
of the Apostles themselves also tells
us the same thing in one of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles:
<hi>Even to this present hour</hi> (says
he) <hi>we hunger and thirst,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. IV. 11.</note> 
               <hi>and are naked
and buffeted, and have no certain dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-place;
and labour, working with
our own Hands.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ib. XV. 19.</note> And again <hi>If in this
Life only we have hope in Christ, we are
of all Men most miserable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no body surely that has
common Sense, who to obtain the
Esteem of a small number of People,
without Power and without Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
would suffer so great Troubles,
become the Horror of Mankind, be
us'd as the worst of Men, and as those
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:63500:113"/>
that were condem'd to the Amphithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atres,
<hi>be made a Spectacle to the People.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ib. IV. 9.</note>
A Man may be tickl'd with the itch
of Glory, when he fancies to himself
that most of those among whom he
lives will applaud that which he is
doing: But it never came into the
Mind of any Man to expose himself
to long Sufferings, and at last to a
cruel and ignominious Death, to the
end only to be esteem'd by a very
few contemptible People, and in the
mean while to be look'd upon as a
wicked and as a mad Man, by the
greatest part of those with whom he
liv'd.</p>
            <p>The Truth of these Matters of Fact
cannot be deny'd: That they preach'd
the Doctrine which we read in their
Writings (and whereof the Christians
still make Profession) in the Reigns
of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and some of the following
Emperors: That they liv'd in great
Trouble, and under many Afflictions:
And that at last they dy'd miserably, in
maintaining the Doctrine they had for
divers Years publish'd. We have seen
these Truths attested by Heathens, as
well as by their own Disciples.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:63500:113"/>
If we would suppose that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
liv'd after a voluptuous manner,
and contrary to the Morals they
preach'd, we must be oblig'd to deny
their having undergone those Sufferings
which are attested by their Disciples;
the first whereof, in imitation of their
Masters, as they themselves say, offer'd
themselves couragiously to very many
Afflictions, without making any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
thereof in this Life. <hi>To these Men,</hi>
says <hi>Clement,</hi> speaking of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and
St. <hi>Paul, who liv'd after a divine manner,
there joyn'd themselves a great number of
the Elect, who having suffer'd many Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
and Torments, have left us a fair
Example.</hi> Nay, supposing their living
so voluptuously, we must also suppose
an Absurdity that is inconsistent even
with common Sense; <hi>viz.</hi> That they
preaching that Men ought to undergo
much Suffering for Religion, exhorting
the People to all sorts of Vertue, and
yet living themselves at their Ease
(without taking care to practise the
Precepts they gave to others, except
only so far as might serve to deceive
the World) did nevertheless make a
great number of Disciples, not only
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:63500:114"/>
sincere Imitators of their Master's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Vertues, but who also dy'd for
a Doctrine, for which those that had
taught them it refus'd to suffer any
thing.</p>
            <p>It is conceiveable enough that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
Persons may be as thoroughly
perswaded of a Falshood, as others are
of the most evident Truths; and may
consequently, in maintenance of a Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
do all that the most resolute Men
would do in Justification of Truths of
the greatest importance. But it cannot
be conceiv'd, that Persons prepossess'd
from their Infancy with Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to those of the Apostles, would
let themselves be so miserably seduc'd,
that after having embrac'd their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
they would suffer for it the most
cruel Punishments, whilst they saw that
their Masters would not undergo any
at all for it. Now we see, by the Passage
of <hi>Tacitus</hi> which we cited, that at the
beginning of Christianity a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of People declared themselves
Christians, tho they saw that the bare
public Profession of that Religion would
expose them to the Punishments due to
Incendiaries, and to <hi>Nero</hi>'s Fury. The
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:63500:114"/>
reason of this must necessarily be that
some of the first Preachers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
as their Disciples assure us, gave
Examples to others. Without that it
is impossible to conceive they could
draw so many after them, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
so many who endur'd such horrible
Torments for the Religion they learn'd
from them.</p>
            <p>From all this I draw no other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
than that the Apostles were
sincere Persons, who believed their own
Doctrine; as were also those who by their
Example dy'd for it. They must have
been truly perswaded of the thing, that
would suffer so many Inconveniences,
Fatigues, and Punishments as they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd,
rather that abandon it.</p>
            <p>Now the Apostles having been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputably
sincere Persons, we must
confess that if ever there were any
in the World whose Vertue deserved
Esteem, they certainly deserv'd it from
all Men. No design could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
more profitable to Mankind
than theirs, as has been shown in
treating of the Morals they preach'd.
None could go about to bring that
Design to pass with more Earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:63500:115"/>
and Zeal than they did, who sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd
to it their Fortunes, their Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
their Honours, their Pleasures,
their Repose and their Lives. They
compass'd Sea and Land under a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Dangers, attempted a thousand
Difficulties, suffer'd Inconveniences and
Pains unexpressible. They expos'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to most Mens Scorn, Malice and
Cruelty. And to what end? To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the same Men to live one with
another after a manner so conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Reason, so advantagious to Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
so pleasant, so sweet, that, except
the Soveraign Happiness to be injoy'd
in the Life that never ends, nothing can
be imagin'd preferable to it.</p>
            <p>I ask now, If (being perswaded of
the probity and sincerity of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and otherwise satisfied by their
Discourses that they were not at all
out of their Wits) we could deny Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to their Testimony, if they had
said they had seen with their own Eyes
certain matters of Fact, which they
related with many Circumstances; and
that they had heard with their own
Ears Discourses full of Sense and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which they repeated from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:63500:115"/>
to end. Let every Man ask
himself, if he would refuse to believe
one of his Friends, whom he knew
to be sincere and judicious, if he assur'd
him positively that he had heard such
and such a thing. Would one suspect
for a Lie the Testimony of a rational
Man, and one who gave good signs
of Sincerity, when he affirm'd that he
had been present at the Execution of
one of his Friends, had seen him die,
and had heard him say many things
which he very distinctly remember'd?
I confess they that know not the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
or Judgment of a Person,
may make a doubt of the Truth of
what they hear him say; but if once
they are perswaded of his Integrity
and Understanding, it is impossible
they should refuse to believe him. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man may be convinc'd of this by
his own Experience, and may, as I have
already observ'd, frame a thousand
particular Examples to himself of what
I have been saying.</p>
            <p>Now the Apostles tell us they liv'd
some Years with Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> from
whom they learn'd all their Doctrine;
that they saw him crucified, such a day,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:63500:116"/>
of such a Month, of such a Year; that
they saw him die upon the Cross, and
after that buried in a Sepulchre, hewn
out of a Rock for the Family of a Jewish
Counsellor call'd <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi>
who begged the Body of Jesus from
<hi>Pilate,</hi> and who, after having put it
into the Sepulchre, roul'd a great Stone
to the Door; that they saw the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Souldiers keep Guard about the
Sepulchre, and that the chief of the
Jews had carefully seal'd it up, for
fear any should take away the Body.
Can we, being perswaded as we ought
to be of the Sincerity and Wisdom
of the Apostles, refuse to believe them
in these things? Certainly we must
have lost all Sense, to believe that
Persons of Wisdom and Integrity
would prevaricate, in affirming a thing
of this nature with so many Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
The same Judgment must
be made concerning the Discourses
of Jesus Christ, which they relate to
us after a manner so lively, and so
circumstantiated, that we could not
relate them better, if we came direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from hearing them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:63500:116"/>
It is more clear than day, to those
who are perswaded that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
had but common Sense and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
that they really spoke Truth in
all these Particulars.</p>
            <p>That being so, Why should we not
believe the same Apostles, when they
assure us that they have often seen
their Master, in a moment, cure many
incurable Diseases; restore the Dead
to Life; raise himself, after having lain
more than thirty hours in the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre;
eat and drink with them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
for several days; and at last
ascend, in their Presence, in a Cloud
to Heaven? I perceive indeed that
many Persons who would not have
question'd the Testimony of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
if they had said nothing of the
Miracles, Resurrection, and Ascension
of Jesus Christ, do, for that reason
only, doubt of it. They would have
easily believed that in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> during
the Government of <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> there
had been a Man named Jesus, who taught
the Morals we read now in the Gospels;
that the Jewish Priests through Envy
and Malice put him to Death; but that
his Disciples refrained not from teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:63500:117"/>
his Precepts, and that the most
afrightful Torments hinder'd them not
from publishing them. They would
praise all Christ's Doctrine, as the most
excellent Philosophy that ever was
known to have been taught amongst
Men, and the best Principles that can
be thought on to oblige them to live
well one with another. But they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
all this, and believe that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
were Impostors, only because they
speak of Miracles, which they say they
saw their Master do. Let us consider
a little why these Men do so.</p>
            <p>There are but two ways whereby
the Falshood of a matter of Fact may
be known. The first is, when it is
known that the Witnesses who relate
it are deceiv'd, or have a design to
deceive, though otherwise what they
relate seem very possible. The second
is, when by clear and evident Proofs
we know that the Fact in question is in
it self absolutely impossible. That the
Apostles design'd not to deceive us has
been made appear; nor can it be said
that they were themselves constantly
deceiv'd in all the Miracles of Jesus
Christ which they relate. If the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:63500:117"/>
were about a small number of
Miracles, that could not without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
be examin'd, this Suspicion might
with some probability be started: But
they relate so many, and of so many
different sorts, that if what they say
be not true, it must of necessity be that
they have gone about to deceive us.
For Example, they could not be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in Christ's Ascension into Heaven,
which they have constantly affirm'd,
and of which the Christians from the
very beginning have made one of the
chief Articles of their Faith. Those
who, as <hi>Pliny</hi> reports, sung Hymns to
Jesus Christ as to a God, believ'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt that Christ was ascended into
Heaven. And indeed I cannot but think
that any who will take the Pains to read
only the Gospel of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and the first
Epistle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
(where are related the Circumstances
of many of the Miracles of Christ, and
particularly of his Resurrection, and
after that of his appearing divers times
unto the Disciples) must certainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
that those who spoke after that
manner were not seduced; and that if
what they say be not true, of necessity
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:63500:118"/>
they must have design'd to deceive those
to whom they related these matters.</p>
            <p>Now it has been shown demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
that the Apostles were very sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Persons. And those who <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to
admit their Testimonies do not tax
them of having been deceived; Nor
do they undertake to oppose directly
the Reasons, by which we prove their
Sincerity. They content themselves
in making Objections upon the nature
of Miracles; and so reduce themselves
to the second way of knowing the
Falshood of a matter of Fact, which
consists in showing that the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
is in it self absolutely impossible.</p>
            <p>I cannot ingage my self here in the
Examination of their Reasons; neither
is it necessary. It is sufficient to observe
in general, that all the Arguments,
with which <hi>Spinoza</hi> and those that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his Opinions do dispute against Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
are not comparable in evidence
and force to the Principles we have
establish'd. These Men endeavour to
show that the extraordinary Effects of
the Divine Power, which we call Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
may be the necessary Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of some of the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:63500:118"/>
to us unknown; and that they are
no more to be made use of as Proofs
in this matter, than those which occur
daily in the ordinary course of Nature.
They bring also some Metaphysical
Arguments, to show that every thing
comes to pass necessarily. But all this
overthrows not the direct Proofs which
we have brought of the Truth of these
Events, and which are infinitly more
clear than their Reasons, which no body
can understand, as perhaps neither do
they themselves. But there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that they should perswade any
Man that the Resurrection of a dead
Body, or the Ascension of Jesus Christ
into Heaven, could happen as naturally
as the Birth of a Man into the World.
As long as the direct Proofs of the Truth
of those matters of Fact hold good, no
Man will be perswaded that the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
which the Apostles relate are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Effects of certain Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
unknown to Men: Because it will
presently be ask'd, Why then are no
more of these Effects produced? How
could Jesus Christ know that after he
was buried, he should rise again and
ascend into Heaven? And how came
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:63500:119"/>
it to pass, at that instant that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a lame or a Paralytic Man to
go, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the Laws of Nature (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to us) were prepared and ready
to cause the lame or Paralytic Man to
walk.</p>
            <p>It is plain then that the Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Difficulties alledg'd against the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of the Apostles, are not of so
great force as the Arguments we have
brought to confirm it; nor can they
rake place, so long as a Man is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of the Sincerity of the first
Disciples of Jesus Christ. And the
truth is, that those who make these
Objections do take this course, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot possibly alledg any
thing against the matters of Fact,
which we have prov'd. They indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to confound the Minds of their
Admirers by obscure Metaphysical Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
and Suppositions, which they
cannot prove, and which they assert
nevetheless to be common Notions.</p>
            <p>This being so, it cannot be doubted
that Christ Jesus was extraordinarily
favoured by God: And as it cannot
be suppos'd, with any colour of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that God would work Miracles
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:63500:119"/>
in favour of an Impostor, it must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
be acknowledged that he was
a Teacher sent from Heaven, to set
Men right that were gone astray; and
consequently, that his Doctrine is true.
But I will not insist upon this Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
as well because it is evident
in it self, as because many Learned
Men already have thoroughly handled
it. I will add only this Reflection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I end; <hi>viz.</hi> That we have no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to suspect that Jesus Christ himself
designed to deceive us: Because all the
Reasons brought to prove the Sincerity
of the Apostles are as strong in respect
of him as of them. To be convinc'd
of this, we need but apply to him,
both as to his Person and Doctrine, all
that has been said concerning the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
All the Religion which he taught
Men, and which we find in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels,
tends only to bring us to the
Observation of the most holy and
most admirable Morals that can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be imagin'd. And he could have
no other Interest in the Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof than what we all have;
that is, the universal Welfare of all
Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:63500:120"/>
Thus then you see the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
establish'd after an invincible
manner, without supposing any Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in the Histories of our Lord and
his Apostles. There remains nothing
more to be added, but that to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Truth of all our Proofs, it is
necessary only that we have the same
Disposition of Mind towards the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
that we have towards any Person
whose Sincerity is very well known to
us, and whom we could not refuse to
believe when he should assure us of a
thing he had seen and heard, and in
which it is morally impossible that he
should be deceived. The chief thing
then is, to be well assur'd of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
of the Apostles, which is easy to
be done in following the Method we
have described. Otherwise, while we
attend not to the Reasons which give
Evidence thereunto, we shall never be
sufficiently sensible of the strength of
the other Arguments, that may be
brought to prove the Divine Original
of our Religion.</p>
            <p>I intreat you, Sir, to examine what
I have said exactly, and to let me know
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:63500:120"/>
if I have been to blame in affirming
that we may be perfectly assured of
the Truth of Christianity, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
the History of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be inspir'd. If I would have
treated of this Subject thoroughly, I
must have compos'd a Book, not writ
a Letter. But what I have said is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to let you see, that our Friend is
not with any sort of Justice to be
suspected of Irreligion, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his not believing the Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Scriptures as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
believed. I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
