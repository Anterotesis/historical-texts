         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

vs a great example, if we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beware.
But we ſeme to bee holy like the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: thei had

iudgement of God: whoſe witneſſe remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

had there a plaine ſpectacle before

but ſo farre prouoked the wrathe of God,
that he driued theim by the <hi>Aſſirians,</hi> from

their brethren of Iuda ſawe all theſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

Iſrael: wherefore God puniſhed them like

can not be caſt out, but onely by our ſauior

<pb facs="tcp:19834:22"/>
any other doctrine, ſhal not heale the
diſeaſe, but rather increaſe it. And it is not
inough to come in the name of Chriſt, and
to bryng his doctrine, but it muſt be doen
with his ſpirit, and faithe. For, the ſonnes
of Sceua did vſe the name of Chriſt, when
thei Coniured the wicked ſpirite, yea, the
name of Ieſus which <hi>Paule</hi> preached:<note place="margin">Actes. 16.</note> but
he obeyed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, for thei tooke the name
of Ieſus in vaine, not hauyng ſuche faithe
in hym and in his worde, as <hi>Paule</hi> had: and
therefore the Deuill anſwered them, that
he knewe them, but feared them not. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
alſo in theſe daies come in the name of
Chriſt, and boaſt muche of his Goſpel, but
becauſe thei are without faithe and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
towardes the churche of Chriſt, their
doctrine is of no greate force. For, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of Ieſus Chriſt and his doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
not in wordes, but in faith: his troth
lieth not in the tong, but in the harte. For
the Goſpell is no Goſpell, nor the woorde
of God is no worde, but onely the dead let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
except it be ioyned with the power and
efficacie of the holie ghoſt, who is the auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
thereof. Neither hath it any great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
in him that vttereth it, except it be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in faithe, ſo that he maie truely ſaie

and therefore haue I ſpoken. And, we

the worde of God, onely in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth,
without the faithe and trothe of the ſpirite
of God, is to abuſe the name of God, as the

will manifeſtly gaineſaie S. <hi>Luke</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow
his meaning, for he ſpeaketh not
in this place of the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes,
whiche Synners obtaine through Ieſus
Chriſte: but he manifeſtly ſpeaketh of the
merueilous woorkes of Chriſte, through
which, he not onely deliuered the poſſeſſed
of the wicked Spirites whiche tormented
them, but alſo he healed many of diuers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes,
infirmities &amp; ſickenneſſes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
there is no cauſe why thei ſhould here
take thoſe Deuilles for the ſeuen deadly
ſinnes.<note place="margin">The differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixt the poſſeſſed, and thoſe that the Deuill dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in by ſin.</note> For if we will vnderſtande hereby
that our Sauiour Chriſt driueth Deuils
out of thoſe, who he deliuereth out of their
handes, and withdraweth from ſinne: wee
maie rightly ſaie, that he woorketh many
ſuche miracles daiely. But thei are mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
in the ſoule, whereof S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
no whitt in the place here alleadged,
but of ſuche miracles as were manifeſtly
doen in the bodie it ſelf. For although the
Deuill dwell in thoſe that are ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:19834:32"/>
hym through ſinne: neuertheleſſe, we do
not properly call them poſſeſſed with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilles,
except thei torment their bodie, or
ſo trouble their mynde, as it tourne into a
furie or rage. And if wee ſhould take the
Deuilles for mortall ſinnes, in all the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
that the Euangeliſtes make mention
of, wee could not then ſaie, that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

nature and ſubſtaunce of the poſſeſſed who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he healed, but only that he deliuered them
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſinnes. For there is no more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

then of any other ſo poſſeſſed.</p>

this ſorte of poſſeſſed are muche more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous

<pb facs="tcp:19834:33"/>
but to their owne ſelues. And becauſe men
can not well perceiue how the Deuil hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

ſo ſubiect to Ieſus Chriſt, as if he had had
them in chaines and bondes, and although
thei fledde to the graues and deſertes, yet
when it pleaſed Ieſus Chriſte, he brought

Now if our Sauiour Chriſt, haue ſhewed

                     <p>It is <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostata.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
this <hi>Iulian</hi> became Emperour, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
the Chriſtian Religion, which he

might, wholy to aboliſhe it, and to eſtabliſh
<pb facs="tcp:19834:46"/>
that Heathen religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiche he followed.
And becauſe he knewe by experience, that
the tyrantes before hym, profited nothyng
with their perſecutions againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
but rather increaſed that Religion,
whiche thei ſought to aboliſhe, then dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed

                     <p>Thou maieſt be ſure that he wan
many by that practiſe. For the ambicious,
<pb facs="tcp:19834:46"/>
glorious, and couetous, whiche deſired ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
riches, and offices in the court, and
to be heaued vp into high dignitie, ſought
to pleaſe hym, perceiuyng that thei were
moſt made of that moſt fauoured his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and were fartheſt from the Chriſtian
religion, whiche this <hi>Apostata</hi> hated to
the death. But notwithſtandyng all theſe
practiſes, he could not winne ſo many by
this meanes as he deſired: for, by reaſon
that there were many Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
before hym, ſince <hi>Constantine</hi> the
greate, the nomber of the Chriſtians was
greatly encreaſed, in ſo muche that <hi>Iulians</hi>
Courte was full, and the greateſt parte of
his officers &amp; ſeruantes were Chriſtians.
For this cauſe he vſed a more ſubtill craft
and dangerous ſleight,<note place="margin">Chriſtians in Iulians Court</note> to deceiue the moſt
vertuous, &amp; thoſe which moſt feared God,
and his religion. For he knewe that good
life and holie conuerſation would muche
moue the people. And becauſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Paſtors,
and Miniſters of the Chriſtians, were the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of very vpright life and holie conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and that by their example thei ſtirred and
drewe men to their religion, and to fellow
their doctrine, and alſo confirmed thoſe
more which had already receiued their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb facs="tcp:19834:47"/>
he went about to reforme the ſtate
and liues of the Prieſtes and religious me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the Paynims,<note place="margin">Another ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of Iulian to make men haue the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deuotion to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then religion.</note> and their Gods &amp; Idols,
after the example of the Paſtors and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of the Chriſtians. And this he did,
to the ende that the Chriſtians ſhould caſt
the Gentiles in teeth, with the wicked life
of their Prieſtes and Miniſters, neither
that the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles being offended therwith,
ſhould be moued to forſake their heathniſh
religion, and become Chriſtians. For thei
that haue any ſparke of the feare of God,
yea the very ſuperſtitious and Idolaters,
miſlike their Paſtours and Miniſters of
what religion ſo euer thei be, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
their wicked and vicious life. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the wicked them ſelues,<note place="margin">The offence of the euill life of Paſtors</note> looke for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
life then their own at their hands who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thei eſteeme to bee their guides, &amp; to haue
adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thinges which thei think
holie. And therefore thei require of ſuche
perſons a ſtraighter and vprighter life the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
their own or any other. For thei think thei
haue more libertie then thei that ought to
be the example &amp; rule of their life. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
thei can not ſuffer that to be in them,
which thei can well ſuffer in other that are
not of that calling, yea and in themſelues,
<pb facs="tcp:19834:47"/>
as wee ſee the Papiſtes at this daie. For,
not onely the moſt ſuperſticious &amp; demute
of them, but alſo the leaſt religious, the
greateſt mockers of all religion, the moſt
vicious and vnruly of all, are ſore offended
with their Prieſtes and Monkes, and crie
out againſt them, that thei leade an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue
life, and a life that ſeemes not to bee
according to their profeſſion. And therfore
there are many of bothe ſortes, that care
neither for them, their calling, nor religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
But becauſe thei can not iudge of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,<note place="margin">Hypocriſie in ſtead of holy life.</note>
vpright life, and good conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
accordyng to the rule of Gods worde, thei
are contented with the life of their Prieſts
and Monkes, ſo that there bee no notable
or apparant vice in them. It ſufficeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
if thei haue onely an outward ſhewe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
and holineſſe, which thei take prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
to conſiſt in ſuperſtition, hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
ceremonies, counterfaiting, &amp; outward
works: and not in true Chriſtian vertues.
And therfore, whoſoeuer can beſt plaie the
ſuperſticious hypocrite, pleaſeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beſt,
and is beſt eſteemed amongeſt them. And
this knew <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostata</hi> very well.<note place="margin">A reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Iulian in the heathens Prieſtes.</note>
Therefore, he commaunded the Prieſtes

<pb facs="tcp:19834:48"/>
God, to enforce themſelues at the leaſt to
counterfaite as nigh as thei could the life
and maners of the Paſtors and Miniſters
of the Chriſtians: and that thei ſhould vſe
themſelues ſo, that there might bee no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
or notable crime in them,<note place="margin">Tripart. hiſt. lib. 6. cap. 28.</note> whiche
might make the people miſlike the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, their
Miniſterie, or the Religion of the Gods
whiche thei ſerued. Wherefore, he forbadd
them to go to any common plaies, to Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes,
or to meddle with any filthie prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,<note place="margin">Popiſh refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note>
or any vnhoneſt arte not ſeemely for

a reformation amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g theſe fellowes, as the
Pope and his make commonly among
them ſelues for their Prieſtes, Monkes,
and the reſt of their Clergie. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei
ſee that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> crieth out at their pride,
pompe, brauerie, pleaſures, ditties, and at
their greate exceſſe in all thynges, at their
Epicurian life, giuen ouer to al filthineſſe
and enormitie more then any other, thei
make a ſhewe of reformation and creation
of ſuche vice and horrible ſin as raigneth
amongſt them, whiche thei can in no wiſe
excuſe: but in the meane while, thei neuer
come to the principall matter, but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to dazell the eyes of the poore igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb facs="tcp:19834:48"/>
with a fained apparance of ſlight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
as in apparrell, in pompes, in
meates, &amp; exceſſiue braueneſſe, in haukes,
in horſes, in paſtimes, and in the obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Ceremonies, and ſuche like
thynges: and as for the moſte notable and
infamous vices whiche thei can not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
nor correct, it ſufficeth for reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof to woorke ſecretly, and not ſo
openly and commonly that all the worlde
perceiue it, and point at them, and that the
moſte vicious, vnruly, and moſte offenciue
them ſelues, be not offended with their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue
life. In this meane while, there is
no talke at all of their falſe doctrine, nor of

are ſo euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and intollerable, that there is

the <hi>Apoſtata.</hi> For, he did not onely reforme

that he could deuiſe, he could not abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe

and augument the Heathen Religion, but
that contrariwiſe it increaſed more and
more, he was merueilous angrie, and in
ſuche rage, as he could not forbeare, but in
the ende manifeſtly to open it. And here
vpon he forbad the Chriſtians, the reading
of the Heathen Poetes, Orators, and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers:
to the ende that thei might not
alledge thelm for aucthoritie againſte the
Heathens. For, he vſed to ſaie: the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
dooe pricke vs and thruſte vs through,
with our owne Fathers, becauſe thei did
confounde the Heathens with their owne
bookes: And whipped the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with their owne
Roddes, as the faithfull at this daie dooe
whipp the Papiſtes. For, if we had none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bookes but their own, we ſhould haue
ſufficient to condemne them all of falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb facs="tcp:19834:53"/>
and abuſe. Wherefore if thei would
doe well, thei ſhould rather forbid the faith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful
to read their bookes, then the holy ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
For, the diſhonor is the greater vnto
them, if thei bee condemned by their owne
writinges, &amp; by ſuche bookes as thei make
of greater aucthoritie, then the ſcripture it
ſelf, for that thei will rule y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> doctrine therof

of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and would haue vſed more
crueltie, if he had durſt. But his deuil was
ſore troubled in this. For, when he would
haue plaied the black deuill, and haue ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
out his ſwellyng venim, two thinges
hindered hym: The one was that, whereof
I ſpake before, that is, that he ſawe that it
profited little or nothyng to retourne to
that firſt furie, wherewith he vſed of olde
tyme to ſtirre and enflame auncient Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauntes,
to ſuche cruell perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt
the Chriſtians. For, he had often prooued
full ſore againſt his will. O how the fleſhe
and conſtancie of Chriſtians had repulſed
the ſharpe pointes of the cuttyng ſwordes
<pb facs="tcp:19834:53"/>
of tyrauntes, quenched their furies, &amp; van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
all their rage and furie. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, this Deuill ſawe, that in <hi>Iulians</hi>
tyme the nomber of the Chriſtians was ſo
greate, that <hi>Iulian</hi> could not vſe greeuous
and cruel perſecution amongſt them, with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
his hinderaunce, and great daunger of
his perſon and Empire. For, his court, yea
and his campe were full of them. Yea how
many Lordes, Captaines, and Officers
had he in his Court that were Chriſtians?
amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt whom <hi>Valentinian</hi> that was Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
after him, was in great authoritie.
Who ſo little feared in <hi>Iulians</hi> time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the honor &amp; reuerence that he beare
to the Chriſtian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and how he hated
<hi>Iulians</hi> Paganiſme, and that entring on a
daie in <hi>Iulians</hi> company into the Temple
of <hi>Fortune,</hi> (whom the Panims helde for a
Goddeſſe) he ſtrooke a Prieſt on the eare
which ſprinckled Holy water at the entrie
of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, becauſe he threw a fewe drops
on his Cloake: and tolde hym that he had
ſpoyld hym, and not purged hym. For the
Panims beleeued as our Papiſtes now a
daies doe, that ſinnes were purged awaie
by Holy water. Seing then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Valentinian</hi>
durſt bee ſo hardy in the preſence of <hi>Iulian</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:19834:54"/>
hymſelf his Emperor &amp; Prince, <hi>Iulian</hi> had
not ſo little vnderſtandyng but he did wel
foreſee and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, what trouble he ſhould
bryng not onely his Court in, but alſo his
Empire, if his deuil ſhould become a black
deuill and tirannous perſecutor. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
he was conſtrained to countefaite the
white Deuil, &amp; diſſemblingly to let many
matters ſlippe, whiche neuertheleſſe were
greate greefe and harte breakyng to hym:
But he was fame to bee patient perforce.
And when he ſawe that the Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
proſpered more and more, when thei
had any releaſe without perſecution, this
white Deuill forgetting the maſke wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he was diſguiſed, falling into a great
rage, came to his natural and firſt occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and became a black Deuill as before.
And then knowyng not at whiche ende to
begin, but perceiuyng all thynges went
from euill to worſe, beeyng at his wittes
ende, he knewe not what part to plaie.</p>

parte to plaie, and not without cauſe, for he
had to doe with a very ſtrong aduerſarie,
when he had to do with God. For were he
white Deuill, black Deuill, or tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſformed
into what Deuill he would, God knewe
<pb facs="tcp:19834:54"/>
hym well enough what maſke ſo euer he
tooke on, and knew the waie how to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe
all his enterprizes and practizes,

                     <p>There are many now adaies in

<hi>Iulian</hi> was: for thei haue had ſufficient
knowledge of the Goſpell, to be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned
with him: But theſe fellowes are as much
troubled to play thoſe parts that thei play
as <hi>Iulian</hi> and his Deuill was. For thei ſee
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is impoſſible to finde water inough to
que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch the fire of the Goſpel which is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
round about them on euery ſide. Thei
ſee there is no hope to quenche it by their
fires, as heretofore thei haue thought. For
experience hath taught them, that one fire
quencheth not an other, but rather enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
it the more. Thei ſee alſo into what
daunger thei are like to bring themſelues,
if thei continue ſuche Tarmagantes and
plaie the blacke Deuils as thei haue doen
heretofore. And therefore now thei beg in
to plaie the white Deuils, more then thei
haue doen, &amp; are contented to confeſſe that
their cruell and rigorous maner was not
the beſt nor ſureſt waie for them. For this
<pb facs="tcp:19834:55"/>
cauſe thei are contented to goe more gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to work, and to hide their black Deuils
hornes more then thei had wont, til thei ſee

&amp; accordyng as their ſhal ſee their ſtrength

meanes ſhall be graunted or debarred the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
For looke thei neuer ſo ſmoothe, it is eaſie
to be iudged what thei pretende, and that
thei counterfaite the white Deuilles, but

                     <p>It is, that as there is difference,
betwene blacke &amp; white Deuils, there are
alſo diuers kindes of white deuils. For as

                     <p>I will make thee vnderſtande it
by example. Seyng the Papiſtes, whiche
reſiſt the Goſpell, be named Chriſtians as
well as other, thei maie bee counted white
Deuils, in compariſon of Iewes, Turkes
and Painims, whiche declare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to

but if thou compare them with thoſe,
that bragge of the title and reformation of
the Goſpell, the perſecuting Papiſtes wil
ſeme blacke deuils, when other ſhall ſeme
white. For, thei be bothe falſe Chriſtians,
but th'one hath a fairer ſhew then th'other,
for he couereth hymſelf with the cloake of
the Goſpell, &amp; the reformation of theſame.</p>

                     <p>This Deuill whiche ſpake in

                     <p>There are many cauſes that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
them ſo to doe. Firſt, when the Deuill
muſt appere before God, he is like a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor,
that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth before his Prince and
Iudge. Who, how wicked and rebellious

to acknowledge hym his Prince &amp; Iudge,
&amp; to confeſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth vnto him of al his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>behauior.
For, if he will not confeſſe it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
the racke ſhall make him confeſſe it
whether he will or no. So theſe Deuilles
whiche were in theſe poſſeſſed, were in the
preſence of Chriſt, not onely as tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
whiche are brought before the Iudge,
<pb facs="tcp:19834:59"/>
to haue ſentence of condemnation, but as

for their findyng was coſtly, and the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng

But the worſt is,<note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpell.</note> that thei would haue our

Therefore thei are contented to haue Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
to preache, ſo that thei rubbe them not

which are contented to let them ſpeak what
thei will, when thei ſee that thei can not ſtop

bothe the ſpiritual and temporall ſword: and
that which thei doe, ſeemeth to me not much

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
ſword from the Magiſtrate, thei them
ſelues goe about to take awaie the ſpirituall
ſworde from the Churche and Miniſters of

take their miniſters to be the true miniſters

hath giuen them. If thei goe about either to
take it from them, or to hinder them therein,
thei are tyrauntes both to the Church &amp; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters

haue greater occaſion to complaine of them,

thei eſteeme them to bee ſuche, I haue good

if thei hold them for ſuche, then maie the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
iuſtly complaine of them, for takyng
awaie that ſpirituall ſworde of the Churche,
whiche God hath committed to them, aſwell
as thei complaine for takyng awaie their

doe thei allow them? And why are thoſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

haue ſo deſpiſed the ſtate of Prieſthoode, and
miniſterie of the Churche, and ſo magnified
<pb facs="tcp:19834:70"/>
the ſtate of Magiſtrates, that thei now feele
the fruites thereof. Thei thought to ſett the
Magiſtrates and people, againſte the Pope
and his Churche men, but thei haue now ſet
them againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. For thei now drinke

thought it a goodly reformation in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church,
to aboliſhe all the Cannons and Decrres,
with the good ſtatutes, whiche the auncient
Fathers and Doctors had ordained, to main<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine
good diſcipline in the Churche. Thei
haue putte all into the Magiſtrates handes,
and haue made them maiſters of the church.
It is no maruaile, though thei will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
maintain that, whiche thei haue in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
but alſo encroche farther, to be out of the

ſubiecte to the diſcipline, whiche haue been
ordained in the churche, thei themſelues will
appoincte ſuche diſcipline, aſwell to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,

thei themſelues will not bee ſubiecte to that

For one that hath been founde to yeld ſuche

haue been twentie found that haue doen the

abuſe whiche was in the Church might bee
corrected and reformed accordyng to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word

ſhould take any tyrannie ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church,
whiche thei condemned, and that thei ſhould
tread the miniſterie therof vnder their feete:
but that thei ought to beſtow their whole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
in reſtoryng of it to ſuch perfectneſſe, as
it ought to be according to Gods word. And
to the ende that the Magiſtrates ſhould not
ſticke at it,<note place="margin">The declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Miniſters to the Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> and think that it belonged not to

and how muche God had honoured them

vnto them, the honour that the ſpirite
of God ſheweth to that holy ſtate in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacred
Scriptures: and what diſhonour and iniury
the Pope and his prophetes haue doen vnto
it. Wherein thei did not amiſſe, but faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
executed their charge. If there be any that
haue paſſed their boundes therein, I will not
excuſe their fault. And likewiſe, if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Magiſtrates,<note place="margin">Magiſtrates abuſing the Goſpell aud their office.</note> that ſtretch that farther the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

the authoritie and power that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord
<pb facs="tcp:19834:76"/>
hath giuen them: the fault is not in the true
miniſters, but in thoſe which abuſe their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
which is the doctrine of God. For ther
is no more reaſon to blame them in ſuch caſe
then to blame the Prophetes and Apoſtles
becauſe thei writ of the excellencie, as wel of
the miniſterie of the Goſpell, as of the ſtate
of Magiſtrates. For thei wrote not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which
thei haue written, to giue the Deuill, falſe
prophetes, and tyrauntes, occaſion therby to
vſurp tyrannie ouer the Church, but becauſe
the troth is ſo, and that it is needfull that the
faithfull ſhould ſo vnderſtande it: for whom
thei haue both written and preached, and not
for tyrauntes or enemies of the Churche. If
there be the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any Magiſtrates in theſe daies,
whiche vnder title of authoritie and power
that God hath giuen them, will take more
authoritie and power ouer the Churche then
God willeth them, and will make the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie

Pope hath made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſubiect to hym and his,

                     <p>Thou knoweſt, that what power ſo
euer the Pope and his, haue ouer the church
in their eſtate, yet can thei not doe what thei
liſt, except thei do otherwiſe then thei ought
to doe. For, firſt thei ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> put no man to death:
but muſt deliuer vp to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecular power ſuche
as thei iudge worthy of corporal puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
either for hereſie, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mittyng of any other
crime againſt the faithe and religion. But if
the whole power of the church, be in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
handes, thei maie bind and looſe as
thei liſt. Thei nede not to borrowe the ſword
of an other, whiche thei enioye theimſelues.
Furthermore, notwithſtandyng the greate
abuſe in the Romiſhe Churche, yet were the
Councels, Sinodes, and auncient cannons
alwaies of ſome aucthoritie with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. There
is neither Pope, Cardinall, nor Biſhop, that
dare vndertake to admit any into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb facs="tcp:19834:77"/>
of the Churche, except he haue paſſed the
order which he muſt paſſe, and without ſome
forme of electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If any be depoſed out of the
miniſterie, he ſhal not be depoſed without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
heard, as appertaineth to hym: that is to
ſaid, without forme of Eccleſiaſticall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But if the whole power be in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
hand, thei may place or diſplace the
Miniſters as thei liſt, without any Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
order, be it right or wrong. Thei maie
vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſeruauntes, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of them, thei maie put them awaie, or put
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to death as thei liſt, I meane if the Magi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtrates
bee tyrantes, and haue none that dare
gainſaie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without the like daunger. And
ſo Wolues ſhalbe thruſt into the Churche of
God, and the true ſhepheardes ſhalbe driuen
out. For tyrantes will neuer abide to heare
the troth, as it ought to be told the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and if thei
be no tyrantes, thei will be content with the
charge whiche the lorde hath giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and

that whiche is common to all the

themſelues, yea, to haue left wiues and

and therefore thei eſtemed nothyng in the

themſelues to followe hym, whatſoeuer did
happen. Contrariwiſe the Genezarians ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
not of this grace, but had onely a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the diuine power, whiche thei ſawe
in Ieſus Chriſte, whiche knowledge made
theim to feare hym, but taught theim not to
loue hym, and followe hym, thereby to bee
<pb facs="tcp:19834:88"/>
made partakers of greater goodes, without
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon then that was, which thei thought
he had ſpoiled them. The moſte part of men
are thus diſpoſed to Godward:<note place="margin">Feare of God without any loue towards hym.</note> becauſe thei
knowe the power he hath to puniſh, thei fear
hym. This feare cauſeth them to honour and
worſhip hym, but not hartely: thei feare hym
as wicked ſubiectes feare their Prince, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thei honour and reuerence againſt their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
for feare of his power: And therefore all
the honour and ſeruice, that thei doe to hym,
is but onely fained. So the greateſt parte of

hym ſo farre from theim, that thei might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

as for my ſelfe, I was euen ſuche a one,
<pb facs="tcp:19834:95"/>
as that I was not able to make anye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traunce
into it, or yet ſtoupe ſo lowe, as
once to be able to put my head into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> intres

whereof I now ſpeake, when I looked vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
this peece of Scripture, but thought
it vnworthy to be compared to <hi>Tullies</hi> dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.
For, my greate pryde coulde no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

away with the baſeneſſe thereof, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

wytte ſo ſharpe, as that it was once able
to pearſe into it, and yet it was ſuche, as
grewe vp amongeſt the baſeſt and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt.
Howebeeit, I might haue vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
to haue beene lowlie. And becauſe I
was highe mynded, I thought my ſelfe to
be a great Clearke. Heere wee ſee howe
Saynte <hi>Auguſtine</hi> confeſſeth, that whiles
he flattered himſelfe, and eſteemed ſo much
of his owne knowledge, and of the pride of
his mynde, as that he continually diſdayned
and contemned the holy Scriptures. And
although hee had a mynde oftentimes to
giue him ſelfe to the ſtudie of them, it was
ſo farre of that he found any taſte or ſauour
in them, as that hee founde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſſe ſauour in
them at that time, then he did at the firſte.
<pb facs="tcp:19834:95"/>
For, hee thought them to bee nothing in
reſpecte of the eloquence, and knowledge
which hee founde in the Bookes of <hi>Tullie</hi>
and of the reſt of the heathen Philoſophers.
But, after that this his pryde was come
downe and abaſed, and the opinion whiche
he had of him ſelfe and of his knowledge,
hee was of an opinion, cleane contrarye
to his firſt: And then, hee right well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued,
all humane eloquence, and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie,
to be no better then bladders ſtuft
full of wind, and of no ſubſtance in reſpect
of the holye Scriptures: although to the
outwarde apparaunce they made a farre
gallanter muſter and ſhewe. And therfore,
whiles the eyes of Saynt <hi>Auguſtines</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
were blyndfolded with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> falſe

and ſame predicament, that Saynt <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>
was in, at that time. But I know
not, whether GOD will giue them that
grace, which he gaue vnto him, to let them
<pb facs="tcp:19834:96"/>
vnderſtande their pride, that thereby they
might be humbled, and for the falſe opinion
which they haue of their eloquence, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

ſelues to be ſuche fooles, and blockeheaded
beaſtes as indeede they are, to the end they
might bee made apte and Teacheable

not onely make ſmal accompt of the books
of the holy Scriptures, in compariſon of
their Heatheniſhe volumes: as that, which
is of all other the moſte vyle, they eſteeme
of them no better, then of the Dreames of
olde doatyng fooles, and of doating olde

let them haue as great knowledge as they

                     <p>Thou toucheſt now a diſeaſe,
which at this day raygneth more then euer
it did, yea, and that amongſt ſuch as beare
<pb facs="tcp:19834:96"/>
the name of Chriſtians, which is the cauſe
that we haue ſo many Libertine Atheiſtes,<note place="margin">Libertine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts.</note>
who ſcorne and laughe at all Religions.
And although they are not in trueth, ſetled
in any Religion, yet forſooth they woulde
not hee thought to be vtterly voyde of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
And therefore, becauſe they are
of no religion, they are neuertheleſſe of all
Religions, in what Countries ſoeuer they
come vnto. For, they ſhoote at none other
marke, but temporizing, or ſeruing of
times, with euery man, a Papiſt amongſt
Papiſtes, an Epicure with Epicures, an
Atheiſt, with Atheiſtes, and to be ſhorte, a
Diuel amongſt Diuels, for they wil not be
diſquieted eyther in body or mynd neyther
yet hazarde eyther bodye or goodes. And
therefore, they will not greatly frame them
ſelues neyther after Ieſus Chriſte, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Pope, neyther after the Goſpell,
nor after the Maſſe, nor yet after any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie
that is at this day for Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt
Chriſtians, without perhaps ſome of
them ſuſtaine ſome particular loſſe therby.
For, if eyther gayne, or loſſe fall out vnto
them on eyther ſide, they will counterfayte
zeale in that Religion whiche they thinke
<pb facs="tcp:19834:97"/>
will bee moſte for their profite, and whiche
they ſuppoſe will beſte agree with that,
which they deſire to haue heere in this life,
as wee haue a manifeſt example, chiefly, in
the Prelates and Beneficed men of the
Popiſhe Churche. For, if they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that there were a GOD in heauen,
and anye true religion, whereby their life
and conuerſation ought to bee gouerned,
and that they ſhoulde render an accounte
thereof in the day of Iudgement, they
woulde ſurely, be other maner of men, then
in deede they are. Howebeit, they right
well ſhew, as wel by their doctrine, as alſo
by their life and conuerſation, that they
haue as much mynde of God, as haue bruite
beaſtes, and doe as muche eſteeme of the
immortality of their ſoules, as of the ſoules
of their horſes and moyles. And therfore,
all the zeale which they haue to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
proceedeth not from any loue whiche
they beare thereunto, but onelye to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and greate wealth whiche commeth
vnto them thereby. And therefore, when
they ſee them ſelues in danger to looſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
they eyther become manifeſt blacke diuels,
and beginne openlye to perſecute, or if
<pb facs="tcp:19834:97"/>
they haue anye knowledge and eloquence,
they ſtraight way,<note place="margin">Libertine Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laamites.</note> playe the iollye Balaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites.
For they commend themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Antichriſt to reſiſt the trueth of God,
and mainteyne his falſe doctrine, againſt
their owne conſciences: For, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
laugh him to ſcorne in their heartes,
and doe no more beleeue him, then thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
whom they oppoſe them ſelues. But
I feare mee, I haue doone them greate
wrong to compare them vnto Balaam, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they haue not ſo muche fayth vnto
the true Religion, as Balaam hadde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Religion of the auncient Churche
of GOD, neyther haue they ſo greate a
regarde to God, as he had. But they are
as like him in all other poyntes, as like
may bee, as in deſire of honours, and
worldly poſſeſſions. And therfore although
they are in part, black Diuels, yet are they
in nature, more like vnto white and Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
Diuels, where, the reſt ſhew them ſelues
to bee altogether blacke Diuelles.</p>
                     <p>Howebeit, whatſoeuer vizers they put
on, they are alwayes in trueth, very Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Atheiſtes, notwithſtandyng, that they
ſeeme outwardely the Followers of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhe
<pb facs="tcp:19834:98"/>
Religion. And there are others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
who are almoſt like them, euen of thoſe
which follow the Goſpel, if they knew they
might any way gayne thereby. But the
moſt of that ſort, ſerue in Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Courtes.<note place="margin">Libertine Courtiers.</note> For, if Kinges and Princes
fauour the Goſpell, then they know, that
if they fauour it as he doeth, that they ſhal
come to greater dignity, or at leaſt, be the
better and more firmely eſtablyſhed in that
degree and honour wherein they ſtand, for,
as they can court it well, ſo will they alſo
be the firſt that ſhall make court to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,
and will bee come fayre whyte, and
familiar Diuels, amongſt the very angels.
But if a man ſhoulde iudge them by theyr
woorkes, fruites, and life, what Goſpell
it is that they profeſſe, it woulde be ſoone
iudged that they are very Libertine Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtes.
For, a man ſhall neuer finde any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of life in them, which is the chief
cauſe of the preaching of the Goſpell, and
the principal marke to be marked and kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
by, in thoſe who haue receiued the
true faith, in the true feare of GOD, and in
a good conſcience. And ſo by that meane,
all their Goſpel wilbe come a thing where
<pb facs="tcp:19834:98"/>
with to ſcorne the Pope, his Prieſts, Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,
and the reſt of his ſhorne Balaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,
and all the abuſes of the Popiſhe
Churche, and to make ſporte and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauntly
talke of them, eſpecially in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of Ladies and Gentlewomen. And
if the Goſpel wil giue them any ſuch liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye,
whereby they may abuſe it, into carnal
lybertie, they will be ſure to laye faſt holde
thereon: and not ſticke to ſaye, that they
are not like vnto thoſe ſuperſtitious hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall
Papiſtes, whom they laugh to
ſcorne.</p>
                     <p>Howbeyt, further they will not, but as for
the reſt of their life, it ſhalbe as diſſolute,
as the moſt diſſolute Papiſtes, from whom
they differ in nothing but in this, that they
haue put on a vizar of the Goſpel, that they
might therewith the better couer theyr
Atheiſme.</p>

                     <p>Thou haſt hitherto ſpoken of

tendeth either to their commodity or diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity.
But there are ſome others, who be

                        <pb facs="tcp:19834:99"/>
as it were newters,<note place="margin">Libertine new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> beeing of neyther ſide,
as thou haſt oftentimes ſayde. And the
chiefe men whiche marche vnder this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne,
and that are of this Bande, are
they which are puffed vp with eloquence, &amp;
knowledge, and are dronken in their own
wit and vnderſtanding: As Saynt <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>
confeſſed him ſelfe to bee, before
ſuche tyme as GOD had touched his heart
with his holye ſpirite, whiche is the ſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of humilitie. But, although Saynt
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> preſumed thus of him ſelfe, by
reaſon he was of ſo fine and quicke witted
a ſpirite, and of ſo verie a ſharpe vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and excellent knowledge in humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as anye man that euer liued in his
time and age: yet was there alwayes in
him, ſome good ſeed of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But becauſe
hee was an heathen man borne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had not from his youth beene brought
vp in the woorde of God: but onely in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie
and Paganiſme, and in the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
wherein he was borne, hee could not
rightly iudge of the true Religion, whiche
he knewe not. And the opinion whiche hee
had of himſelfe, did ſo hinder him, as that he
could not ſearch after it, as he ought to haue
<pb facs="tcp:19834:99"/>
done. And after that diuers, but eſpeciallye
his mother Monica, who was a widdowe,
and became a Chriſtian before him, a very
good woman, and one that feared GOD,
had exhorted and ſolycited him, to ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the holy Scriptures: thoſe their exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
ſtirred him vp to the reading of the
Bible. Howbeit, hee read it not ſo reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
as he ſhould haue done, but rather
for faſhions ſake, by reaſon he came not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
with that humilytie and modeſtie,
which afterward hee knew was meete for
the diſciples of the holy Ghoſt to come.
But when God had rebated this his pride,
with the ſpirite of modeſtie and humilitie,
then found he that in it, which before hee
knew not how to finde in it: And by that
meane, he was ſomuch the more humbled.
Howbeit, theſe glorious arrogant men, of
whome we now ſpeake, who thus glory of
their knowledge, and ſkill, are euen the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
ſcorners and contemners of God: for
they neuer ſhew, that euer they had the true
feare of God before their eyes, nor yet any
good ſeede of religion in them. For, there
is a great many of them, who haue manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
them ſelues greater Atheiſts, after they
<pb facs="tcp:19834:100"/>
had once gotten ſome knowledge of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,
then euer they had before, and ſince y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
time, haue euer leſſe reuerenced the worde
of God. For, the knowledge which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
by the entertayning of the Goſpell,
ſerued them to none other vſe, but to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the Idolatries, ſuperſtitions, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which are in the popiſh Church, that
they might laugh at them.</p>
                     <p>And euer ſithence that time, they are
growen euen vnto this, that they are almoſt
at the like poynt with the doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
religion. For, as S. Paul ſaid, They
iudge thereof,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> as the Grecians and wiſe
men of the world, iudged of Ieſus Chriſte,
&amp; of his Goſpel: who thought the preaching
thereof to be fooliſhneſſe, becauſe they were
carnall men, and puffed vp with an opiny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their owne wiſdomes.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe the Grecians, were alwaies
more accounted of then any of the reſte of
the Nations, by reaſon of their ſharpeneſſe
of witte, and of the knowledge which they
had in the artes, in Philoſophy, and in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Letters of humanitie, S. Paule na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
them ſpecially, although hee compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
vnder this name, all the reſt of the
<pb facs="tcp:19834:100"/>
heathen, as well appeareth by that, that he
oppoſeth them to the Iewes, and ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
them alſo from the Chriſtians, vnto
whome, as hee him ſelfe witneſſeth, Ieſus
Chriſt is the true wiſdome, vertue, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of God.</p>
                     <p>Nowe, if theſe Libertine Epicures and
Atheiſtes, had beene heathen borne, as S.
Auguſtine was, or, if they had as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in them, being Chriſtians borne, as
hee had in his Paganiſme, they ſhoulde
neuer haue ſhewed them ſelues, to haue
beene ſo monſtrous beaſtes, as in deed they
are. But although in name, they are
Chriſtians born, they are to be accounted
of, as if they had beene borne and bredde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
Infidelles and Paganes, yea euen
amongſt the Epicures, out of whoſe books
they haue ſucked and droonke, this prophan
ſpirite of Athieſme, who thus caryeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
away.</p>
                     <p>For, they haue yet leſſe Religion in
them, then euer had any of the heathen, who
not onely did not approue their doctrine,
but which is more, manifeſtly, both by word
and wrytinge condemned it, yea, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
executed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by publick iuſtice name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb facs="tcp:19834:101"/>
Athens. For, when God giueth vs ouer
ſo farre, hee then by his iuſt iudgement bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſheth
vs in the cauſe of religion.<note place="margin">What it is to conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne prayer.</note> And
therefore, that we ſhall not neede any more

of his holy word.</p>
                     <p>But, ouer and beſides, that Dauid, and
S. Peter,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 119.</note> calleth the holy Ghoſt, the word

the ſimple,<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.</note> yet there is one thing more in it,
which the Lord hath promiſed,<note place="margin">1 Pſal. 50.</note> that he will

                     <p>I warrant thee, the leaſt of all
theſe miſchiefes is great enough to make
the eſtate of a poore man miſerable. For,
although we bee neuer wholy blind, deafe,

<pb facs="tcp:19834:104"/>
our ſight alone, beginneth to faile vs, and
that wee muſt bee faine to vſe ſpectacles?
Or, if wee heare not ſo well as wee were
wonted to do? or that we ſtammer, or haue
any other impediment in our tongue, and
ſpeake not ſo plainely as wee woulde. And
if we be thus at this point, wee may eaſily
iudge, what a miſerie it is to bee altogether
blinde, deafe, and dumbe. But, if we haue al
theſe at once, beſides a number of other
ſtrange diſeaſes, ioyned together with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
then is there a notable ſort of miſchiefes pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

                     <p>That is out of al doubt, and by
how much both the ſight, the hearing, &amp; the

                     <p>For mine owne part, I verily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that there is no man liuing but had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

more, al men are ſuch by their owne nature,
vntill ſuch time as, Ieſus Chriſt commeth
vnto them, to driue out the diuel, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
them ſo deafe, dumbe, and blinde. And
therefore,<note place="margin">Deafe, dumbe, &amp; blinde Demoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acks, healed by the goſpell.</note> ſo often as we ſee any man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
to the Goſpell, wee muſt thinke it

at the matter, then if wee ſawe him healing:
the deafe, dumbe, &amp; blynde demoniacks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

what grace God ſheweth to thoſe kindes
of people, out of whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſus Chriſte driueth
the Diuell, by the preaching of the goſpel;
that they might ſee the light of God, whiche
without al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon, is a great deale more
to bee deſired; then the light of the Sunne,
and make them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heare the voyce of theyr

glory.<note place="margin">The grace, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to men, by the preaching of the goſpel.</note> For, there is no harmonie of the

is pleaſant to the eares of the ſoules, of the
children of God. And as this greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
them; to heare this ſo ſweete and
pleaſant a voyce, euen ſo likewiſe is it as
<pb facs="tcp:19834:105"/>
great a delight to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to haue their mouths
open, to magnifie and ſanctifie the name of
God,<note place="margin">What a curſed eſtate they are in, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of the goſpel.</note> and to call vpon him inceſſantly. And
contrariwiſe, we may iudge in what a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
eſtate they are, who bee depriued of this
benefite of the Lord. For, it is euen as
muche as if wee ſawe the Diuell viſibly
raigne amongſt the deafe, dumbe, &amp; blinde,
neuer ceaſing tormenting of them, both in
ſoule and body, more cruelly, then the moſte
tormentious hangman in the world is able
to deuiſe to torment the moſt wicked man
that might poſſibly be committed into his

                     <p>By this we may euidently ſee,
that euen as God by his iuſt iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoneth

For, ſeeing they toke pleaſure to blind

And therefore this propheſie of <hi>Iſayah,</hi>
is alleadged and rehearſed ſixe times at the
leaſt in the newe teſtament, as well by the
foure Euangeliſts, as alſo by Saint Paule.
For,<note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> euen as the preaching of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> did
blind and harden the heartes of thoſe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,<note place="margin">Mark. 4.</note>
and rebels that were amongeſt the
Iewes,<note place="margin">Luke. 8.</note> not through the Prophetes faulte,<note place="margin">Iohn. 12.</note>
but through their owne:<note place="margin">Actes. 28.</note> euen ſo was the
preaching of Ieſus Chriſte, and of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note>
amongeſt them who in their dayes
were like vnto theſe, againſt whom <hi>Iſaiah</hi>

is dayly accompliſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not onely in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

And therefore, becauſe their vnthankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is merueilous great, it is good reaſon

Wherefore, it is not without iuſte cauſe

proueth, that becauſe children dye, that they

conſidering, that wee haue not this natural
corruption onely in vs, which we call Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall

that whiche is more, wee continually carry

                     <p>This example ought to teach vs,

For it cannot take a man hier, then by

<pb facs="tcp:19834:109"/>
head and braine, as that he falleth to the

infant, that the Diuell caſt him, and made
him ſometimes fall into the fire, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
into the water, in ſuch ſort, as that it
was maruaile that hee had not beene kild a

watched and pryed out the tymes and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
when this diſeaſe came agayne to this

furthered it as much as was poſſible. And
<pb facs="tcp:19834:110"/>
therefore the Diuell ſurpreſed this childe,
when hee knew that hee ſhould fall into the
diſeaſe, to make him fall either into the fier

                     <p>I haue alreadie conſidered of two

is of that which hath heretofore been hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
as concerning the deſire which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
hath to hurt the creatures of God, but
eſpecially men, as for example wee haue
ſeene in the Legion of Diuels, who entred
into the Gergeſites ſwine, after they had
beene driuen out of the Demontacks.</p>

                     <speaker>Tob.</speaker>
                     <p>It is euen this, That I ſee the
horrible iudgement of God, and his greate
mercy together, in one and the ſelfe ſame
perſon. For, although God had left this
poore and miſerable childe vnto the diuell,
yet hee ſo brideled vp the diuel, as that hee
coulde not hurte the childe as hee woulde:
but in good ſorte, in deſpite of all that the
Diuell coulde doe. And God preſerued
this childe, that Ieſus might heale him, at
<pb facs="tcp:19834:110"/>
ſuch time as hee had appointed, to the end
that his ſonne Ieſus Chriſte might be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
by hym, and that the worlde might
know what power hee had, ouer the moſt
wicked and terrible diuels.</p>

                     <p>Nowe in very deede, this was

of this wicked ſpirite, which came vppon
Saul, after that the good ſpirit of the Lord
was departed from him. It hath heretofore
beene declared, that Saule was a great hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,
and a moſt glorious man, and an
enuious Rebel to God, and had ſo prouoked
God vnto anger,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 17</note> as that he cauſed Samuel
to tell him,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 31.</note> that he ſhould be bereaued of the
kingdome,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 11.</note> which he had giuen him, as in
deede it was. And the cauſe why GOD
gaue him ouer vnto the wicked ſprite, came
by reaſon therof.</p>
                     <p>Now, Saule was not ſo wicked and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
before ſuch time as the wicked ſpyrite

And therefore, how are wee to vnderſtand
this, that the good ſpirite of the Lorde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted

                     <p>For,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> when Ieſus Chriſte ſayd, that Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das
was a Deuill, there is no doubt, but that
the Deuill reigned in the heart of Iudas

more and more abuſed the giftes and

wher he ſhould haue waxed better &amp; better,
hee made the waye more open and plaine,
for the Deuill to enter into him.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore S. Iohn ſetteth it down, that
the Deuill put it in Iudas heart, to beetray
Ieſus Chriſte:<note place="margin">Iohn. 13.</note> and afterward hee ſaieth, as
S. Luke ſayde,<note place="margin">Luke. 22.</note> that Satan entred into
him.</p>
                     <p>It was not meant by the Euangeliſtes,

their meaning is,<note place="margin">Mark. 14.</note> that we ſhould vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
that the Deuill at that time,<note place="margin">Iohn. 12.</note> had taken lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

Euen ſo fell it alſo out with Saule,
after that the good ſpirite of the Lorde was
gone from him, and he left vnto the wicked
ſpirit. For, before that, the good ſpirit of
the Lorde, cauſed him to doe manye good
things, although Saule had not a true and

ſelfe no good, yet did he good to others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering

after that the good ſpirit of the Lord, had

the Deuil had ouer him, when as he ſo
openly fought againſt his own conſcience,
which oftentimes enforced him to accuſe &amp;
condemne his own ſelf, for the iniuries and

<pb facs="tcp:19834:115"/>
For, how often was he enforced to ſay, that
he was a vile and wicked man, and had done
great iniurie to Dauid,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 24. 26.</note> and that Dauid
was innocent, and a far honeſter man then
him ſelfe? And who enforced him this to
doe, but the very power of the trueth, and
his owne conſcience, which draue him to it,
as if he had beene racked to doe it? he right
well knew, that he did wickedly, and that he
manifeſtly fought againſt God, and yet for
all this, he no whit amended him ſelfe: but

                     <p>There was great likelihoode,
that the ſeruantes which gaue Saule this

vppon them, without they bee enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
thereto, with the greate blowes of a

the Egyptians.<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> And therefore, where they
ſhould looke vp vnto heauen, they ſtil looke
groueling downe to the earth, and runne
rather vnto creatures, then vnto the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator.</p>
                     <p>And agayne, they that are about them, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:19834:123"/>

Wherefore, when Saul was not well at
eaſe, hee muſt needes ſende for remedy for
his diſeaſe. And his moſte excellent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
had beene, to haue ſent for ſome ſound
Prophete or Preacher, to haue told Saul
of the grieuous and great ſinnes which he
had committed, whereby the wicked ſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
had ſo great power ouer him, to torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
him as he did: For, by theſe and ſuche lyke
ſpeeches, he muſt needes haue been brought
to repentance, and ſo haue fled to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God, whereby he might haue obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his fauour, and remiſſion of his ſinnes:
for, if he had growne to an attoneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with
God, through true and faithful repentance,
he ſhoulde haue founde at Gods handes,
that remedye that was moſte neceſſary for
him. For, that God, who had ſtriken him in

haue healed him in mercy. But becauſe that

                     <p>There are many Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,

draweth awaye their imaginations els
whether, if it be vſed as it ſhould be. But
Saules madneſſe proceeded not onelye of
a ladde and melancholicke humour, eyther
yet vppon anger and wrath. But the
principall cauſe was ſupernaturall: And
therefore, although hee founde him ſelfe

hee ſtill in his madneſſe, yea inſomuch that
he ſtill enforced him ſelfe to thruſt through

                     <p>And therefore hee was to looke for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie

madneſſe proceeded from the curſſe of god,<note place="margin">The cauſe of Sauls madnes.</note>
wherewith hee threatneth all ſuch as will

                     <speaker>Theo.</speaker>
                     <p>He himſelf declared that ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
enough, when as he as wel rebuked
his Diſciples, as alſo the father of the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticque,
for their incredulitie, giuing them
therby to vnderſtand, that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was the cauſe,
why his Diſciples were not able to caſt out
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Deuil, albeit they had vſed al the ſkil and
cunning they had. Wherefore, ſeeing it
was for want of fayth,<note place="margin">Encreaſe of fayth neceſſary.</note> it was requiſite, that
their faith ſhould be encreaſed. And this
could not be had, but by the grace of God.
For, fayth is the gift of GOD: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as we cannot haue it without him, no
more alſo can it bee encreaſed but by him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
And therefore, Ieſus Chriſt exhorted
his Diſciples,<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.</note> to pray that it might bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
in them. Wherfore,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> ſith it is ſo, we
muſt addreſſe vs vnto GOD, by hearty
and faythfull prayer. And prayer can in
no wiſe pleaſe him, without it come from
the ſoule and heart.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe that abſtinence or faſting,<note place="margin">The right vſe of faſting.</note>
greatlye auayleth the ſoule or minde, forſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as being leſſe preſſed by the body, it
is better diſpoſed towardes God: therfore
the ſeruauntes of GOD, haue commonly
<pb facs="tcp:19834:126"/>
ioyned abſtynence and faſting with their
prayers, when as they would addreſſe them
ſelues vnto his Maieſtie, for any things
of great importaunce, and be more feruent
in prayer, according as the neceſſitie of the
cauſe requyred. And therefore, Ieſus
Chriſte meaning to let his Diſciples vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande,
that they had great neede to pray
vnto GOD, for the encreaſe of their faith,
and that faſting, greatly auayled vnto prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
becauſe it was of great effycacie: he ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
faſting with prayer, when as he ſpake

greater power, to the end hee might finiſh
that worke which hee ſo long before trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
about, which was, to kill this poore mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
childe. For, euery man thought
the childe to bee dead, when the Diuell leaft
him. Howbeit, it fell out cleane contrary.
For, when it was thought, that hee was
ſtarke dead, hee was quite and cleane deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
of the Diuell, and made through
whole.</p>
                     <p>Nowe, wee ſee that the like of this fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
out dayly, we ſee how the Diuel trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
and tormenteth the worlde, eſpecially
in thoſe places, out of which hee knoweth
he ſhall be caſte. For, he then falleth into
ſuch a rage, as that a man woulde thinke
that the Goſpell, by which meane Ieſus
Chriſte will caſt him out, had ſet open all
the gates of hell, to let out all the Legions
of Diuels that were in it. For, then hee
fretteth and fumeth, and maketh as manie
as he hath power ouer, to fret and fume.
<pb facs="tcp:19834:130"/>
To be ſhort, he ſo terrifieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world,
yea, the valianceſt and moſt conſtant, as that
a man would think it ſhould be vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
and come to naught. But euen
then, when we thinke it ſhoulde bee cleane
waſted and deſtroyed, our Sauiour Ieſus
Chriſte, ſheweth himſelfe to be farre ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then he. And therefore, wee muſt not
ſtande in a maze when we ſee the troubles
and perſecutions, which the Diuell and his
retinue ſtyrre vp in the world, when as they
feele Ieſus Chriſte come neere them, to
caſt them out through the power of his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.
We haue none other thing to doe
but to remaine ſtedfaſt and conſtant, and do
that duetie that appertaineth vnto euery of
vs: and ſo leaue the charge of all the reſt of
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, who

For, we are of that nature and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

I doe conſider thus with my ſelfe, howe it
ſhould be poſſible, that one man ſhoulde be
faythfull to an other, when as man, is ſo
trayterous, ſo vnfaythfull, and altogether
ſo vnthankful, towardes God his Creator
who is both his Father, and ſouereine lieg
Lorde and Prince. For, howe can hee
obey a mortall man, who is a Rebell, to the
immortall GOD,<note place="margin">Iſaiah. 40. 4.</note> who hath both our lyfe
and death in his hand,<note place="margin">Acts. 17.</note> and is the ſame God,
by whome we are, liue, and dye. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
is not this a moſt horryble thing, that
man, who is but a worme of the earth, and
no man in deede, in reſpecte, and ſcarſe able
to crawle vpon the ground, ſhould be ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull
and rebellious? For, were it not
for the hope of eternall lyfe, wee might
<pb facs="tcp:19834:136"/>
right well ſay, that he were the moſt myſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of all the creatures in the world. And
yet he dareth him ſelfe alone, boldly reſiſte
al order of nature, and refuſe to doe his due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
wherunto al the reſt of the creaturs are
moſt obedient. He boldly dareth lift vp him
ſelfe, againſt the Authour, and Gouernour
of all things, who made him of the ſlyme of
the earth, and in a moment is able again to
diſſolue him. I cannot inough meruayle,
when as I conſider of this great pryde and
arrogancy of man, how he alone dareth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſte
his God, whome, all the reſt of his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures,
the heauens, the earth, the ſea, the
ſtarres and planets, al the elements, beaſts,
Angels, and Deuils obey.</p>

of man, wherewith hee is continuallye
enuyroned, and as it were almoſte quite
and cleane ſwallowed vp, ſithence the time
of his conception, and what his nature and
frame is. And therefore, ſeeing we are
<pb facs="tcp:19834:136"/>
entred into this talke, me thinketh, that this
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration, and contemplation wil not be
amiſſe, for vs to debate on. For the which
cauſe, I am of the opinion, that wee might
handle this poynt ſomewhat more at large,
if you will agree vnto me herein. Howbeit,
I feare nothing but that we ſhould be ouer
long, becauſe there are in this behalfe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good thinges, and worthy dilygent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>

but would be right gladde of it. For, it is
a matter worth the handling. But to the
ende we might all profit the more. I take
it, that our beſt way were, for the preſent, to
talk of ſome other matter between, &amp; recre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ate
our ſelues a little in this faire Garden.
For, when our mindes are alwayes occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed
about one thing, it groweth yrkeſome
vnto vs at laſt, although it were neuer ſo
pleaſaunt or profitable. Againe, we cannot
ſo well carry away all, when our mindes
are ſurcharged with ouer great a multitude
of matters, and beſides, when wee haue no
delight in that that we heare.</p>

                     <p>I know not my mayſters, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you be weary or no: But for mine own

becauſe we may be the freſher, and followe
the matter more cheerely, I am contented
to agree to <hi>Ierome.</hi> And therefore, I
thinke it moſte expedient, that we walke a
little here in this garden, and looke vppon
the goodly flowers, which God hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for our vſe: to the end, that in beholding
of them, we may the better alwayes learn,
to acknowledge his great power, wiſdom,
bountie, and that therby, we may haue the
better occaſion to prayſe him, and yeelde
him our humble and hearty thankes: And
then wee maye after enter againe into our
matter. And where wee haue heretofore
ſpoken in generall, of the diſorder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedneſſe
of the world, and of the daunger
wherein it ſtandeth, wee will alſo ſpeake
ſomewhat more, in perticular of man, who
is the cauſe of all the diſorder, and great
