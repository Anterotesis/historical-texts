         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

accused of the said Treasons, and were committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and afterwards were impeached for the same by the Commons in Parliament Assembled, as also that <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> was impeached of High Treason and other Misdemeanours, that the Defendants knowing Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> had given In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of these Treasons to stifle the Evidence, and to scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize them, did falsly conspire to represent them as wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and men of no credit.

               <p>Gentlemen, something I must observe to you, that is an inducement to this matter, that there hath been an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and abominable Conspiracy against the King, the Nation, the Religion, and the Law, appears (my Lord) by the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in Parliament, wherein the Lords and the Commons, have several times joyntly declared, and, I think, 'tis so publick that no body will doubt there is such a thing; who is guilty that is another matter.</p>

               <p>This Court must take notice of that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because, some have been tryed, convicted, and condemned for it by this Court.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Your Lordship says right. But, my Lord, the first discovery of this Conspiracy came from a single person, one that stood single and discouraged a long time, and that there were endeavours to discourage his further discovery that will appear. My Lord, when it stood so, it happened that Sir <hi>Edmondbury God. frey</hi> had taken his Examination, and these things will be material in the end of the Cause. Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> having taken the Examination of <hi>Oates,</hi> then the endeavour was to suppresse this Examination that he had taken, and that by no less a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse then the barbarous murder of that honest Gentleman, whom you all knew, and they not only took away his Life, but they did strive to baffle and defame him when he was dead, and that will appear too, and is publick and known. My Lord, all this while stood <hi>Oates</hi> single, it fell out by the Mercy of God, that a further discovery was made by <hi>Bedloe,</hi> he was examined, and it is publickly known, and publick Justice hath gone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p>The next attempt was to corrupt the testimony of <hi>Bedloe,</hi> with Bribes and Rewards, and by other ways, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that transacted it, <hi>Reading,</hi> is attainted of it, <hi>Scelere tutandum est scelus,</hi> when men have invented and designed any great wickednesse, they are forced to enter upon others to cover and conceal the former. My Lord, it proceeded now, and comes to that which will be the Question this day. Having gone all these wayes, now they return again, to see if they can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and baffle the Evidence <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedloe</hi> had given, and the way to that is by disparaging and scandalizing them with foul offences, especially Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and that was thus (as we shall prove to your Lordship) <hi>Lane</hi> had been a servant with <hi>Oates,</hi> and the other was one of the like condition, and he was tampered with to accuse Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> of that horrid sin of Sodomy, and I think if he were such an one, little credit were to be given to such a man. This was the design they were to accomplish. And we shall prove to you, in order to it there were Letters (written and contrived by <hi>Knox</hi> indeed) written by <hi>Osbourn</hi> who is not now before you, but a contrivance of them all. And, my Lord, there must be a pretence) for in truth these persons had been Examined, and had charged him with this offence, but upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93087:7"/>
Examination they had renounced their discovery.</p>

               <p>No, my Lord pardon me, I am not speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Evidence but only of their Examination, before the Lords.</p>

               <p>Then they pretended this matter, that they were touched in Conscience, and now they repent, and must discover the truth for the truths sake, that themselves were false in the making of the charge, and this, my Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> must be furthered with Bribes and Rewards as we shall prove to you. We shall make out the particulars by Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and then we think we may leave it to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and the Jury to determine. In truth, my Lord, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in this case as it did long ago, when the first discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was of a like design, and as is told us by the Historian. <hi>Multi ob stultitiam non putabant, multi ob Ignorantiam non vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debant, multi ob pravitatem non credebant &amp; non credendo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurationem adjuvabant.</hi>

               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Jury. I am of Counsel for the King in this Cause whose Suit it is. The Evidence hath been opened fully by Mr. <hi>Serjeant.</hi> I shall only say this, that this is a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-part of Mr. <hi>Readings</hi> case, only it seems in this to differ, that the Counter-Part exceeds the Original, for, I think, that it is of a further extent then his was. It hath been told you by Mr. <hi>Serjeant,</hi> and, I know, the Court will tell you, that it matters not whether those persons that are accused of the Plot, and impeached for it were guilty or not, it is sufficient that they are accused, and that by these persons. For any body to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to suppresse and withdraw the Kings Evidence, or to disgrace the Kings Evidence, that is not lawful, be the Crime what it will be, but it is a much greater Crime in a case of this nature of High Treason, where the Life of the King, the Government of the Kingdome, the Religion, and the true Worship of God Established in it, and the Laws of the Nation are in danger: Some of these persons are Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for Mr <hi>Coleman</hi> and several others, have been found Guilty, and have been Executed for it,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:93087:7"/>The design in this case that lies before you Gentlemen to try, was to throw a disparagement upon the testimony of those persons by whose Evidence those Traitors were princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally attainted and executed. This is Gentlemen to affront the justice of the Nation, and indeed to cast a disparagement upon it; and that sure is as great an offence as can be; the matter of the Evidence hath been opened to you, I shall only acquaint your Lordship and the Jury, that it hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed a great while, and so long designed, that one of the persons here accused, Mr. <hi>Lane,</hi> one of <hi>Oats's</hi> Servants, had the opportunity to get into his Masters secrets, thereby the more effectually to betray him, and as it will appear by Witnesses, did carry on the design till it was discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and by that discovery prevented as to any suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</p>

               <p>And you will admit that Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> were witnesses upon those Trials?</p>

               <p>Yes, and gave evidence very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Then my Lord, we must hint to you, that <hi>Lane,</hi> who is one of the persons taken notice of in the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was a Servant to Doctor <hi>Oates, Knox</hi> was not in his service; but <hi>Knox</hi> is a man that made use of <hi>Lane</hi> as a handle
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93087:8"/>
to the matter he had designed; therefore Letters are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but by whom? that we shall give you an account of was by the direction of <hi>Knox,</hi> though the Letters that will be produced are directed to <hi>Knox</hi> himself.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Iust.</speaker>
               <p>Your Indictment says so.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Recorder,</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>But we shall give you an account, that he was director of those Letters himself; but as your Lordship may observe, there are not only Letters, but some accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or informations. We shall prove to your Lordship whose hand-writing they were, and who dictated those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations: for I think that Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> is pretended to have the most brains; and I believe Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> in the consequence will appear to have the most malice. And we shall prove in the next place, that inasmuch as it would be natural in the course of Justice to ask, whether these persons should not have money for the reward of such a business; we shall prove that there were treaties with Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Osborne</hi> who is not Indicted, (but was likewise a Servant to Doctor <hi>Oates,</hi> and had thereby an opportunity of deceiving him) that they had meetings; how Guineys have been cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly dropt down, which was to prevent, as I was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting your Lordship, any such question that should be asked, what moneys and rewards they were to have for this great discovery of any wickedness that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> should be guilty of. Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> he prepares them in this manner, At every meeting, when they were discoursing and pursuing this business, then by some <hi>unlucky</hi> accident or other Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> he is to drop a Guiney or two, according as Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> and the other person had occasion or a desire to have it; but none were to be given, but as by accident, as if <hi>Knox</hi> holding his Guineys in his hand, or in some other accidental way should drop them, and then <hi>Osborne</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> were to pick them up in a kind of a jest only, as if <hi>Knox</hi> had accidentally let them fall, and they had as accidentally taken them up. How this came to be discovered we must give you an account. Matters being thus prepared by the instigation of <hi>Knox,</hi> and transacted so far by <hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Osborne,</hi> they thought it then fit to put their design in execution. Accordingly their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations are produced before a Justice of Peace, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matters were improbable; (for I think they had some scrutiny before the Justice of Peace, and before the Lords
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93087:8"/>
Committees of the Lords house) one of them Gentlemen, though now he is pleased to say he is <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> yet at that time had a little more ingenuity, and did confess the whole matter, and how he was drawn in, and how far he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and how Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> had directed him, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and rewards he had received, and that besides di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other summs of money had been promised, and great rewards offered in case this design had taken effect. We shall call our Witnesses before your Lordship, and give in Evidence the Informations that they had intended to offer; and if we shall prove the matters that have been opened to you, I believe the consequence of this case will appear as much to concern the Government as any that hath come to this Bar.</p>

               <p>Sir, if it please your Honour, <hi>R. Lane,</hi> Father of <hi>Iohn Lane</hi> was a Yeomen of the Guard ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and I am one of his Majesties Yeomen of the Guard. As he was in waiting he was telling me a story —</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Iust.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> was?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Radford,</speaker>
               <p>Yes, <hi>Richard</hi> the Father was telling me that Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> did attempt his Son many times to do such and such things to him that was in the way of Buggery;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93087:9"/>
said I, <hi>Richard,</hi> I am ashamed of you, that you should cherish your Son in such things as these are, so I went away in an anger, and told him, that if he were my Son I would correct him severely for it, and said no more, knowing him to be a lying fellow, and all the whole Guard know him to be a lying fellow, and that there is no truth in him.</p>

               <speaker>Lord Chief Iust.</speaker>
               <p>All who?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Radford,</speaker>
               <p>All the Guard, and that is all I can say.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Iustice Iones,</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>When was this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Radford,</speaker>
               <p>Above a twelve moneth ago. And I knew that he was a lying man, and I durst not speak of it, because I knew he was so, and was afraid he would have put it upon me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Iust.</speaker>
               <p>What, he told you that his Son told him so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Radford.</speaker>
               <p>No, he told me only that his Son was weary of Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> his service, and I told him that he was come away once before, and why did he go again? he said his Son could not be quiet.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Iust.</speaker>
               <p>Did he say his Son told him? The question is plain, Did he speak it of himself, and not that his Son told him?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Radford,</speaker>

               <p>Now, if your Lordship please, we shall give your Lordship an account, that when he was admitted again, he bragg'd he should get a great summ of money, and for that we call <hi>Mr. Samuel Oates. Who was sworn.</hi>

               <speaker>Mr. S. Oates,</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, about a matter of a fortnight before he went away from my Brother, I was in the withdrawing-room—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Iust.</speaker>
               <p>How long is it ago since he went away?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. S. Oates,</speaker>
               <p>It was in <hi>April</hi> last, as near as I can remember.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. S. Oates,</speaker>
               <p>So there were several Servants in the room, and they were talking and laughing together, and he was wishing, said he, I wish I had a Thousand pounds; said some of them to him, what would you do with it? said he, I would take it and fling it upon the ground and tumble it: says one of them, you may wish long enough before you have it: I que ion not, says he, but ere long to find a way to get a Thousand pounds.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder,</speaker>
               <p>Do you hear him Gentlemen? This was a fortnight before he went away.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. S. Oates,</speaker>
               <p>I can only speak as to <hi>Osborne</hi> as to the thing it self.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. S. Oates,</speaker>
               <p>No, I do not remember that, but upon these scandalous things coming out, I was considering what he had said, and how he behaved himself in his service, and upon recollection I did think of this saying of his.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Iust. Pemberton,</speaker>
               <p>Ay, he recollected it afterwards.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Francis Winnington,</speaker>
               <p>Although he is not a party that does defend this matter, yet it is all one intire Act that they three were in combination to corrupt the King's Evidence, and to stifle it; and though so far as it does relate of <hi>Osborne,</hi> it will not convict him being absent, yet it will inlighten the King's Evidence about the Conspiracy, for he is mentioned in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. S. Oates,</speaker>

               <p>Unless we do bring it down to <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> afterwards, that they were guilty, it will not be any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <hi>I</hi> know.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Holt,</speaker>
               <p>If it be not evidence, we conceive with submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to your Lordship, it ought not to be heard.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder,</speaker>
               <p>They need not labour it on the other side, we shall. We agree it is no evidence against the Defendants, but only circumstantial as of the general Conspiracy.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord, that he had been induced by Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> to betray his Master, and for to swear several things against him which <hi>Knox</hi> had drawn up, and dictated to him. He did not write them himself, but <hi>Osborne</hi> writ them, and he did Sign them. There were four Letters that were brought before us, there were three or four Memorials, as they called them, three or four Informations, which were those Papers that they carryed to Mr. <hi>Cheyney</hi> to <hi>Chelsey.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
               <p>Who carryed them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>W. Waller.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Knox</hi> took <hi>Osborne</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> with him, and carryed them thither, as <hi>Lane</hi> swore. And when they came thither, and he was acquainted with the business, he looked upon it as so foul and notorious a thing, that he would not meddle with it: but he advised them that they should go (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Knox</hi> pretended the Lord of <hi>Danby</hi> was much concerned in it) to some other Justice of Peace, or some of the Privy Council that were Friends of my Lord of <hi>Danby.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>Knox</hi> advised this, did he?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>W. Waller.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>No, they said Mr. <hi>Cheyney</hi> did. They went afterwards (and they did all confess it) to Mr. <hi>Dewy,</hi> and M. <hi>Dewy</hi> gave them the same Answer, that he could not meddle with it; and after this, Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> went and took se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Lodgings for them, fearing that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> would hunt after them; and one Lodging, amongst others, was I think the <hi>Three Flower-de-Luces</hi> in <hi>White-Fryers.</hi> And afterwards they removed to a place in the Paved Alley, betwixt <hi>Lincolns-Inn Fields</hi> and <hi>Chancery-Lane.</hi> During which time, <hi>Knox</hi> did bid them stand firm to what they were to do, and they should not want for a considerable Reward; and have wherewithal to maintain them with their Footmen, and live very well. And, my Lord, <hi>Lane</hi> did confess this, that he brought Mr. <hi>Osborne</hi> to <hi>Knox</hi> first into the Painted Chamber, and made them acquainted there. And, my Lord, there is one thing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93087:12"/>
that I omitted; Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> did confess to me, that Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> did at the One-Tun-Tavern, I think it was, drop a Guinney upon the Table, and said, I will not give it you, because now I can safely swear that I never gave you any Money; but be sure you stand fast to these Informations, and to what I have dictated to you, and you may be sure you shall be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for your pains. And he told them this more, <hi>My Lord Treasurer would never have surrendred himself to the Black Rod, unless you had promised to stand fast to this Evidence</hi>; that was to swear to what Evidence he had dictated to them.</p>

               <p>My Lord, they were produced before us.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>One part was to swear, that M. <hi>Bedloe</hi> should come to Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and say to him, That my Lord of <hi>Danby</hi> should offer him a considerable Sum of Money to go beyond Sea.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
               <p>To whom?</p>

            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>To <hi>Bedloe.</hi> And that was only considerable as relating to Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> in any part of the Examination: but as to Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> they were to accuse him of having a design of abusing his Body: for he sent to me—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>

               <p>
                  <hi>Lane</hi> sent twice. Upon his first Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he did seem to be very shy: but upon the second, he sent one <hi>Rix</hi> to me, one of the Yeomen of the Guard, to let me know, that he was troubled in his Conscience at what he had unjustly done in charging Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and that he was desirous to discharge his Conscience of the burden that lay on it, and to wave his own Reputation, that he might acquit the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>

               <p>My Lord, it was in reference to his swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against Dr. <hi>Oates.</hi>

               </speaker>
               <p>He was brought that very Morning before the Lords; but notice being come that the King was come in, and the House was sitting, he was remanded, and afterwards sent <hi>Rix</hi> to me, to tell me, he was sensible of the Injury he had done to Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and would make a Confession of all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>

               </speaker>
               <p>In reference to those Abuses that he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to swear, and I think had sworn, but before whom I don't know. I suppose you will have an account of that by and by.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
               <p>So then, this is the Substance of what you say as to Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> That <hi>Lane</hi> sent to you, and shewed you seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Papers and Informations against the Credit of <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedloe,</hi> and told you that <hi>Knox</hi> did tempt him to justifie this, and swear it; and that he went with them to a Justice of Peace in order to do it, but he did not care to meddle with it, and bid them apply themselves elsewhere, and afterwards they came to you; and whether it was sworn or no, you cannot tell, but you say he did confess he had wrong'd Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> in those Scandals that he would have put upon him; and that this was by <hi>Knox</hi>'s advice and direction.</p>
            </sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>But there is this thing further, he said truly that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> would be something hasty and passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, but that he was very religious, and was very constant in sending his Servants to Prayers; and that what he had accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him of, it was an abominable falshood, and was done by the instigation of <hi>Knox,</hi> who had incouraged him to it by the promises of a great Reward.</p>

               <p>Pray did <hi>Lane</hi> confess to you from whom this Money and Reward was to be had? for he was not a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that was likely to bestow so much Money of his own.

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Knox</hi> did say he sent such a Note up to <hi>Osborne,</hi> and that the words were as I remember, <hi>We always club'd, and you paid two Shillings at the</hi> Sugar-Loaf, <hi>Tear this.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
               <p>Look you, the use I see that would be made of this, is, that <hi>Knox</hi> in a secret way, should give Intimation to this <hi>Osborne,</hi> that he should not own that he had been treated by him, or any money spent upon him, and this Note is the cunning way of Insinuating that matter, as I understand it.</p>

               <p>I shall humbly acquaint your Lordship with one thing further; <hi>Knox</hi> did confess that he had lain with these People in several private Places, for there were Warrants out for the Apprehending them, upon the Information given by Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> of this Contrivance, that he had lain with them at <hi>White Fryars,</hi> and <hi>Charing Cross,</hi> and at other Places.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I perfectly remember this, That <hi>Knox</hi> did confess he had paid for their Lodgings, but they were to pay him again; but both <hi>Osborne</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> did positively swear he did pay for all, and several times at several Taverns where he treated them, he bid them call for what they would, and they should have it.</p>

               <p>I tell you what I find here he confess'd, that they complaining they knew not where conveniently to Lodge, this Examinant told them he would endeavour to find them a Lodging, and the very self-same day, he went by the direction of one of my Lord <hi>Dunblain</hi>'s Servants, a Coach-man to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-loaf in <hi>White-Fryers</hi> &amp; took Lodgings as for himself &amp; two of his Friends, and lay there with them to the time of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the same Lodging, which was five or six days.</p>

               <p>My Lord, Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> speaks of one <hi>Rix</hi> that was sent by <hi>Lane</hi> to him to make a Discovery, this is the Gentleman.

               <p>May it please your Lordship, There was one <hi>Osborne</hi> that was concerned with this <hi>Lane,</hi> who is since run away: <hi>Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne</hi> came first upon the Guard to me, and desired me to get him into Service. He desired to come into my Lord Treasurers Service, and what he desired of me was to frame him a Petition to my Lord Treasurer. We had no Answer till two days after, and I being upon the Guard with Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> I did suppose I might get him into his Service, I spoke to Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd him; and after he had entertain'd him a while, this <hi>Lane</hi> then being a Servant with him, they both told me they were going off now from Mr. <hi>Oates.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>Who told you?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Rix.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Osborne,</hi> and that they should get preferment; they were sworn Brothers together, if one did go the other would go. I asked them why they would go away; oh, said he, I shall keep my man my self. Say you so, said I, I have been in Town so long, and I could get no such preferment. Then they told me they should have 100 <hi>l.</hi> a year, and 500 <hi>l.</hi> in Money.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Iust. Pemb.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Rix.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Osborne</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> both.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Iust. Pemb.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rix.</speaker>
               <p>Yes: So I asked them how, but they would not tell me, but, said <hi>Osborne</hi> to me, for your preferring me to Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> you shall be no loser. I met him another time, for <hi>Osborne</hi> came to desire me to lend him a Cravat. Said he, I must come down to your House to morrow morning to get a Cravat, I desire I may have a good one, for I am to go before one of the greatest Peers of the Realm, to dine with him: Where, said I, to which end of the Town? the other end of the Town, said he to me: But, said I, why do you leave Mr. <hi>Oates?</hi> oh, said he, let Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> look
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93087:16"/>
to himself, for I have enough against him. Then I smelt some<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing of some design against Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and brought it before Justice <hi>Warcup,</hi> and gave in my Testimony, and upon further Inquiry into it, the Lords ordered him to send out his Warrant for the taking of those Fellows, <hi>Knox, Lane,</hi> and <hi>Osborne,</hi> which he assigned over to me; in a short time after they were taken, first <hi>Lane</hi> was taken, and in a day or two <hi>Osborne</hi> and <hi>Knox,</hi> and were examined and taxed with it. <hi>Osborne</hi> he made a Confession before Justice <hi>Warcup,</hi> and they desired me to see <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> in Prison, and I did see them in Prison, and when they did come there, <hi>Knox</hi> said, where is <hi>Osborne,</hi> why don't he come to Prison as well as I? I am a better Gentleman than he. Oh, said I, he hath confessed; so he was turned up into the Prison. Said I to Mr. <hi>Lane,</hi> will you drink a Pot of Beer? said he, I don't much care if I do: and, said he, Mr. <hi>Rix,</hi> if I have not gone too far against my self, if you will stand my Friend, I will make an honest Confession. Said I, I am glad there is so much Grace in you, I will then do you all the good I can. Pray, said he, will you please to go and call Sir <hi>William Waller</hi>: why not Justice <hi>Warcup,</hi> said I, who was first concerned in this Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: No, he would have only Sir <hi>William Waller.</hi> I came and found him in the Court of <hi>Requests,</hi> so I went with him to <hi>Smiths</hi> the Tobacconist near the Gate, and sent for <hi>Lane</hi>; the Keeper brought him: I think this was about nine or ten in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and from that time till about six at Night he was in Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. I went then to Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and told him <hi>Lane</hi> had made an honest Confession. I waited on Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> till the Afternoon, and then he made an Order, that he having made an honest Confession, should have the enlargement of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and not be confined, as others were, which he had. <hi>Lane</hi> sent for me the next Day, I came down in a Day or two after, and his Sister was there with him, they were eating Butter and Radishes, and when I would have paid for the Drink, <hi>Lane</hi> cry'd No, by No means; for <hi>Knox</hi> hath sent me in Three and twenty Shillings the other Day, and that will serve me, I hope, till I come out: but now, said he, I have made a Confession, I believe I shall have no more Money from him; and I desire you would speak for my Enlargement. I came down to him another time, and he told me he had received a Note, which Note was put up from a Gentlewoman in the Street,

I asked the Nurse what the Gentlewomans Name was, she told me, she had asked, but she would not tell her.</p>

               <p>He told me he was set on by <hi>Knox,</hi> and he drew up all the Writings for him; and <hi>Knox</hi> told him, if you come to be Examined at such or such a thing, make a stop, and turn this way and that way.</p>

               <p>I was a Prisoner there my self, and under-Goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler too, and I was offered Money to carry Notes between the one and the other, that they might not betray one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Slightam.</speaker>
               <p>I had three half Crowns given me at one time by <hi>Knox,</hi> and he promised me he would give me a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable sum.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Slightam.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, that they might not betray one another, for they were fearful that they should, because they could not speak together, to lay their stories together.</p>

Pray Mr. <hi>Dewy</hi> will you acquaint the Court and the Jury, what discourse you had with <hi>Knox,</hi> who he came from, what he came about, and what recommendations he brought with him, and from whom.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Dewy.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, sometime in the sitting of the last Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament that began in <hi>March,</hi> about ten a clock at night a Message was sent in to me that one would speak with me from my Lord <hi>Latimer:</hi> I was either in bed or going to bed; and I did not think there was really any such Message, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause my Lord <hi>Latimer</hi> did not know me, nor I him. They were very pressing to come in, insomuch as my man could hardly keep them out. I told them there was nothing sure of so much haste, but what might be done to morrow, or some other time: so I spoke not with them that night. Either the next day, or some short time after, as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> came to me with another Gentleman, and he brought Papers in his hands ready written; he told me that they were Informations of one <hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Osborne</hi> (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member those were the names he mentioned then) and they were against Mr. <hi>Oates.</hi> Then I began to look upon it as something extraordinary, the Parliament being then sitting, and the Committee of each House having the Examination of this business. Said I, Mr. <hi>Knox,</hi> you have been a Justice of Peace's Clerk (for I knew him so) and you know 'tis very unusual to take Informations against a person without the parties being present, if he may be had to cross-examine the Witnesses upon Interrogatories, as the Case may be: and besides, this looks as if it were to take Informations against the King; which we never do upon Oath. So I dismissed them, and directed them to the Committee of Secrecy of the House of Commons, for whom it was most proper. This is all I know of this business.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Did Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> tell you any thing what was contained in those Examinations?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Dewy.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Yes, he did give me some information, that <hi>Osborne</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> did repent of something, but I can't give you information particularly.</p>

               <p>About the latter end of <hi>February</hi> last, <hi>Mr. Knox</hi> and I met at <hi>Charing-cross,</hi> and we went in and drank toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and he proposed several things to me; first he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that I would get for him a Copy of the Papers my Master had.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Bedloe.</hi> And especially what concerned my Lord Treasurer; as also to take a Journal of all my Masters Actions, and the Names of the persons that came to him; for, said he, my Lord hears that my Lord of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> do cabal with him against my Lord. But if my Lord could but find out his Enemies, he would oppose them, and strive to baffle them. My Lord, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage me to this, he told me he would carry me to his Lord, though it were at mid-night, to discourse with him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wiggins.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord Treasurer: and he said he should give me incouragement to go on. Said I, Does my Lord know of this? Yes, said he, I told my Lord I had a friend lived with <hi>Mr. Bedloe,</hi> and he gave me incouragement to go on and Treat with him. And he said moreover, my Lord, <hi>Mr. Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedloe</hi> were two great Rogues; that the King believed not a word they said; and as soon as he had heard all they could say, they should be Hanged.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Williams.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wiggins.</speaker>
               <p>He desired me to give my Lord the Papers, and then my Lord should tell me what I should do about my Master.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wiggins.</speaker>
               <p>He said, That <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedloe</hi> were great Rogues, and that the King knew them to be so; and when he had heard what they could say, he would hang them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wiggins.</speaker>
               <p>No, but he told me my Lord should give me directions how to go on.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wiggins.</speaker>
               <p>I told him I would do him any service that lay in my power, but nothing that would be to my Masters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice; and I was appointed by him to meet him at my Lord Treasurers.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. VViggins.</speaker>
               <p>I know no more than what my Son knows; he first came to my House.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
               <p>Who?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Wiggins.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Knox</hi>; and asking me where my Son was, I told him he lived with Mr. <hi>Bedloe:</hi> and he said, he very much rejoyced at it, and desired to speak with him. I told him, No, he could not, for his Master had so much employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93087:20"/>
for him, that it was very seldom I my self could get a sight of him. Said he, I have a little concern with him; and he living with Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> may do my Lord Treasurer great service; and doing my Lord Treasurer service, he does his Majesty service; for his Majesty loves my Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer above all things in the world. And he would not be contradicted, but he would see him. Then the next day I told him he should come, and we appointed to go to him; but he should not see him alone without me, I told him; he told me he desired it not. He came according to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and I carried him to <hi>Charing-cross</hi> to an Ale-house, and there I sent a Porter for my Son, and he came: and the first thing he said to him was, I am mighty joyful to know you live with <hi>Mr. Bedloe</hi>; you may do my Lord great ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: In what, says my Son? In letting my Lord know what company your master keeps, and what Lords they are that dayly and hourly keep company with your master, and Cabal against my Lord. Said I, <hi>Mr. Knox,</hi> that is the way to bring my Son's neck to the Stake; that he shall never do. But, says he, I will tell him a way how he shall do himself no harm at all: And then he up and told him, he desired him to write him Letters when he found any thing of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, and set no Name to it; and if he came at twelve a clock at night, he would let him in to my Lord Treasurer's, and no body should take notice of it: and he would have had him taken a Coach to have gone to my Lady <hi>Danby</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, to have an assurance from her mouth of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that he should have any Place in her Lords disposal.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
               <p>Were you ever with my Lady <hi>Danby?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Wiggins.</speaker>
               <p>No, we deni'd it; and it was discovered. And besides, my Lord, I told him, if he would lay down my Son a thousand pound he should not do it; he should not betray his Trust. And then he said, that the King knew <hi>Mr. Oates</hi> and <hi>Mr. Bedloe</hi> to be two great Rogues; and when he had got what he could out of them, he would hang them.</p>

               <speaker>Mrs. Wiggins.</speaker>

My Lord, I am one of the Yeomen of the Guard, and I waited upon <hi>Mr. Bedloe,</hi> and he desired me to help him to a Clerk: I helped him to <hi>VViggins,</hi> this young man. He had not been there three weeks, or a very little time, when <hi>Knox</hi> came to him to tempt him; and being a stranger to his master, he knew not how to discover it to him, and told me, Such a thing is offered to me, but I am a stranger to my master, and I know not how to break it to him.</p>

               <p>My Lord, all that I have to say in this Case, is this: I do think it was in the Month of <hi>Iune</hi> I was at my Lord <hi>Castlemains,</hi> and he asked me, if I had been imployed in a business of <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane,</hi> that were Prisone<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> at the <hi>Gatehouse</hi>: I told him, Not. His Lordship then wrote a Letter to my Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> and desired I might be imployed in it: And she did tell me that it was a thing of material consequence, and that I should be furnished with money for the getting of <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> out. I took all opportunities for the doing of it that were necessary. I went to the <hi>Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,</hi> made enquiry after <hi>Lane,</hi> and took care with his Mother to relieve him, for I heard he was in an indigent condition at that time.</p>

               <p>Yes, my Lord, Twenty shillings, and I had that money from Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> by my Lady <hi>Powis</hi>'s Order. After that time there was one Mrs. <hi>Airy,</hi> who used to carry money to the Catholicks in Prison, she said that it was possible, as she had been informed from some of the Priests in the <hi>Gate-house,</hi> that some things might be had under the hands of <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> that would be very material against Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>: She said she had been informed so. I then desired that Mrs. <hi>Airy</hi> that Pen and Ink might be conveyed to them, that they might have the convenience of giving it under their hands, which she promised, and they did convey Pen and Ink under the door to this Mr. <hi>Lane.</hi>

               </speaker>
               <p>As Mrs. <hi>Airy</hi> told me. Then she came again, and withal told me, that it was Mr. <hi>Knox</hi>'s desire that <hi>Lane</hi> should do something to signifie to him, or satisfie him that he did stand fast, then <hi>Lane</hi> wrote a little note, and that note was to this effect. <hi>I will die before I will comply with that Villain</hi> Oates, <hi>and if any good People will do me the kindness to get me my liberty, I will do the Catholicks the greatest service imaginable in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering what I know about Mr.</hi> Oates. <hi>This I write from

               <p>I am very well satisfied of it my Lord, according to the Judgment I am capable to give of hands; indeed I was not acquainted with his hand then, but that was the first to my knowledge, that ever I saw of it; but after I having parted with the Note, and seeing some of his hand-writing, upon recollection I can say I believe it was his own hand.</p>

               <p>Never afterwards. And then my Lord, my Lady <hi>Powis</hi> was exceeding glad upon the hearing of it, and as I was informed of it afterwards, she was the greatest part of the following day upon her knees, giving God thanks for the great advantage, and strength that was come to their Cause.</p>

               <p>Afterwards I received money seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, and gave his Mother more to furnish and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him. And several times afterwards I received mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> by Order of my Lady <hi>Powis</hi> for the doing of <hi>Lane</hi>'s business, that is, for his liberty; and I had the Papers from one <hi>Lawson</hi> an Attorney, that had been employed in the same business before; and as I
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93087:22"/>
was informed by him, a motion or two was made at this Bar for their Liberty, but however he began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair of it, and I was to undertake it; but withal he said, he was glad he was rid of it, for he had been often em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the business of the Catholicks, and it had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired his credit very much, and very freely delivered the Papers to me, which indeed were not many. After that, my Lord, I retained Mr. <hi>Sanders,</hi> as I think it was he, but there was a motion about it, and with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty I did get <hi>Lane</hi> out upon common Bail; and when I had done so, according to my Lady <hi>Powis</hi>'s Order, I brought him to <hi>Powis</hi> House; and then my Lady <hi>Powis</hi> ordered, that he should go by the Name of <hi>Iohnson;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if any of the Servants should talk of one <hi>Lane</hi> being in the House, it might come to <hi>Oates</hi>'s Ear, the House might be search'd, and if he were found there, it might be prejudicial to the Lords, and all their business. And then, my Lord, Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> came a little after with the same Command from his Lord, and he had some Order—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Iust.</speaker>
               <p>Who is <hi>Wood?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Dangerfield,</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>That <hi>Wood</hi> is my Lady <hi>Powis</hi>'s Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman: And he came and ordered that my Lady <hi>Powis</hi> gave particular Command to the Porter of the House, in my hearing, that he should give order to all the Servants, to have a particular eye and care that he did not go from the House, for they were very dubious of him, having made so many Equivocations before, for they feared Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> might find him, or he might go voluntarily and make a Discovery of himself, and so contradict all he had given an accompt of there. For, my Lord, before this, as soon as ever <hi>Lane</hi> was gone out, they were very desirous to have what he had to say put in Writing; but they had not opportunity then, but we let it alone to some other time. Then, my Lord, soon after, about three Weeks or a Month after; I cannot be positive in the time, because I had a great deal of business upon my hands; but I suppose it was about three Weeks or a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93087:23"/>
Month after, my Lord <hi>Powis</hi> sent for me to the Tower; and told me he was informed that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was then making search after <hi>Lane,</hi> and if he found him at his House, it would be very prejudicial to their business; and he desired me to take care, and to send him out of the way, that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> might not find him, which I did; and thinking of several places, I could not find any so convenient as <hi>Gray</hi>'s in <hi>Essex,</hi> by the Water-side. I came to <hi>Lane,</hi> and told him that he should be furnished with mony and necessaries for his Journey, and, in order to it, that very day I took him and gave him a pair of Shooes and Ten Shillings in his Pocket, and sent him to <hi>Gray</hi>'s. I received two Letters afterwards from this <hi>Lane,</hi> by which Letters I am very well satisfied, that that Note that he wrote before that was given under the Door, was his Hand. So then I received a third Letter (I think) my Lord, and in the Letter he told me that some Person of Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Acquaintance had been in that Town and seen him, and he thought it was not material that he staid any longer there, and desired to be removed. So then I shewed my Lady <hi>Powis</hi> the Letter, and I suppose my Lord <hi>Powis</hi> had an accompt of it also; but I cannot be positive in that, but I had order to remove <hi>Lane,</hi> and by my Lady <hi>Powis</hi>'s means I sent down one on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and he discharged some Debts <hi>Lane</hi> had contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the House, and sent him away to <hi>London</hi>; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his return to <hi>London,</hi> he continued three days more at my Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s House: At which time, he says, he was forced to lye upon the Chairs, for at that time were the St. <hi>Omers</hi> Witnesses removed from Mrs. <hi>Celier</hi>'s, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were afraid of being taken up by Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> who was in search for them. So having some other business, I did not send him away presently, but I had particular order to send <hi>Lane</hi> into some other place: And I did advise with Mrs. <hi>Celier</hi> where to send him, and she said, I think it will be necessary to send him to <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> at one Mr. <hi>Waites</hi>'s House in <hi>Buckinghamshire</hi>; for, said she, they are Catholicks, and will be sure to take a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93087:23"/>
care of him: But I told her it would be too far; and I would think of some place nearer; and then I thought it would be necessary to send him to <hi>Totten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> to the <hi>White Hart</hi>; and there he stayed, I suppose, four or five Days, or a Week. This was after the Tryal of the Five Jesuits, as I remember. My Lord <hi>Powis</hi> sent to me, and told me; Says he, I am in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral doubts about this <hi>Lane,</hi> and if it should be known that he is Countenanced by me, or any of our people, it would not be well; so I leave him wholly to you, do what you will with him; but I advise you to send for him up to Town, and give him Ten Shillings a Week, to live upon. So when I was at leisure I sent for him again from <hi>Tottenham,</hi> and I told him; Mr. <hi>Lane,</hi> it will be very necessary that you do take some care for a Livelihood about Town; it is not safe nor adviseable for you to be about <hi>Powis</hi> House; and at that time I took care he should come there no more, and that if my Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s Servants should meet him, they should take no Notice of him; which they did perform I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and as I was told. But before this, and before I sent <hi>Lane</hi> into the Country, the second time, as near as I can remember, <hi>Knox</hi> was at Liberty; I had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring, as soon as I had got <hi>Lane</hi> out of the <hi>Gate-house,</hi> to get <hi>Knox</hi> out also; but I found I could not, and I left that. But I have been informed by Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> himself, that one Mr. <hi>Nevil, aliàs Paine,</hi> was furnished with mony from the Lords in the Tower, for the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Knox</hi>'s Liberty; and this <hi>Nevil</hi> himself did say, as Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> told me, that he did it by their Order; and from this <hi>Knox,</hi> by Mrs. <hi>Celier</hi>'s perswasion, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived several Papers, which were Informations against <hi>Oates</hi>; or, at least, those Papers that they had drawn up before they were in Custody. These Papers were sent by me to the Tower, and from thence to Mr. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> to enlarge upon, I suppose, as he thought fit; and after to my Lord <hi>Castlemain,</hi> and afterwards they were re-sent to me by Mrs. <hi>Celier,</hi> who ordered me to draw
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93087:24"/>
up an <hi>Affidavit</hi> according to those Directions, and get <hi>Lane</hi> sworn to the same, which I did, and took <hi>Lane,</hi> and asked him, said I, Mr. <hi>Lane,</hi> here is an <hi>Affidavit,</hi> can you swear it; yes, said he, I can swear it, before I read it to him.</p>

               <p>Nay, said I, you know not what it is; so I read it to him; said I, do you know this to be a truth; yes, said he, I do know it to be all true: Said I, I will read it again to you, because you are to make Oath of it, and I would not have you do any thing, but what is safe, and then we went to Sir <hi>Iames Butler,</hi> but he was not at home then to have it sworn.</p>

            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>It was for attempting Buggery on the body of this <hi>Lane.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Iust.</speaker>

               </speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord: And I did take this <hi>Lane</hi> to Sir <hi>Iames Butler,</hi> and he did make <hi>Affidavit</hi> that it was true: And it was left there before Sir <hi>Iames Butler.</hi> I suppose the <hi>Affidavit</hi> may be in Court, or a Copy of it. So my Lord, after that <hi>Lane</hi> being gone from <hi>Powis</hi>-house, and I having no manner of converse with him more; but only that every Saturday I took care he should have his money, sometimes I went to his Mother's Lodgings and left it there for him, sometimes he would come to me for it: After this we were remov'd from <hi>Powis</hi>-house to Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi>; but he was always certain of Ten Shillings a Week. Sometimes he would pretend
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93087:24"/>
that it was too little for him to live upon; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I would give him Two, or Three, or Four Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings more of my self; but I had no Order to do that from any body. This is all my Lord, I do know of <hi>Lane</hi> as I remember.</p>

               <p>First, by Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi>'s perswasion, <hi>Knox</hi> delivered to me the Papers, which imported the whole matter of the Charge against Mr. <hi>Oates:</hi> These I sent to the <hi>Tower</hi> by Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi>'s hands, from thence they were sent to <hi>Nevil</hi> to be enlarged upon, from
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93087:25"/>
thence to my Lord <hi>Castlemain,</hi> who was also to inlarge upon them, and from thence they were sent to Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> again, and from her delivered to me, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them to <hi>Knox</hi> again. I found by his discourse and every thing else, that Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> was desirous of my Correspondence, but yet seemed as if he were shy of any body's taking notice of it. Said I, to Mr. <hi>Knox,</hi> there is one Mrs. <hi>Downing,</hi> that lives at <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> over the Water, where Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Dr. <hi>Tongue,</hi> and several other Persons used to meet, where I had been informed by some of the Catholicks; by <hi>Parsons,</hi> my Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> and several others, that Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tongue,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Danby,</hi> and others, did meet at the Almes-houses there, where the Plot was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived and formed; for they pretended to me there was no such thing really. So, said I, if you will go with me, we will discourse with her about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for I heard she talked very freely in several mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters nearly concerning Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> and other Persons. So, as I said, I told him, if you will go along with me, I have not been there yet, I will go and discourse with her, and put down what she says in writing. Then Mr. <hi>Knox,</hi> my Brother, and my self did go over to this Mrs. <hi>Downing,</hi> and had much discourse with her, where she did repeat many Transactions that were very agreeable to the Story that I had received from my Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> and several other Persons before. <hi>Knox</hi> did seem to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well satisfied about it, and promised to take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of it, and said, it was very material, but we did not put it down in writing. I did not, I know not what he did afterwards. We promised to come again another time, but I do not remember we did ever go afterwards. But Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> solicited me to go with him, and some Business or other did still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene; that is all that is remarkable of Mr. <hi>Knox,</hi> which I do remember at that time; but I do remember that after we were removed from <hi>Powis</hi>-House, when I
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93087:25"/>
was at Mrs. <hi>Celiers,</hi> nay I think both before and after he was often treating with Mrs. <hi>Celier,</hi> but I know not what was their discourse, nor was <hi>I</hi> desirous to know. But <hi>Mr. Knox</hi> came then to me, and began to renew his Correspondence, and withall told me, that he had some likelihood of bringing <hi>Osborn</hi> over to their Party. Said he, I find he is gone again to his Master, but he shall do his Business, (meaning, as <hi>I</hi> suppose, <hi>Mr. Oates</hi>) for he had, as I understood by him at that time, been tampering with <hi>Osborn,</hi> but he did tell me it was <hi>Osborn</hi>'s voluntary act, that he did own it, and that he did go to <hi>Mr. Oates</hi> again only <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o do <hi>Mr. Knox</hi> service. My Lord, some time after this, <hi>Knox</hi> came to me at <hi>Mrs. Celiers,</hi> and told me he had done the Business, expressing the greatest Joy that could be. What Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, said I? <hi>Osborn</hi> is come over, said he, and <hi>I</hi> have had an account from the beginning to the end of all the transactions of his Master <hi>Oates,</hi> and I have not only an account of it, but it is put into writing, and <hi>I</hi> took <hi>Osborn</hi> before a Justice of Peace, and he hath made <hi>Affidavit</hi> of it. When I heard this, <hi>I</hi> thought it would give great satisfaction to the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and desired <hi>Mr. Knox</hi> to let me have a Copy of that <hi>Affidavit.</hi> He told me, No, he thought it would not be material to let me have a Copy, for by that means it might become publick and be discovered; and, said he, I have some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther design in this, <hi>Mr. Oates</hi> is going down to my Lord <hi>Lovelace</hi>'s in <hi>Oxfordshire,</hi> and <hi>Osborn</hi> is going with him, and he hath promised me to be a Spy upon his Masters actions, and to give me an account of all. And this will be material, but I do not think fit to let you have a Copy of the <hi>Affidavit</hi> at present. Some time after this, I told <hi>Mrs. Celier</hi> the Story, who <hi>I</hi> suppose went to the <hi>Tower</hi> and gave the Lords an account of it. And the next time <hi>I</hi> had the Honour to see my Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> she was pleased to say, she liked it very well, but did not as <hi>I</hi> remember say any thing of the Copy; but being desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to see what <hi>Osborn</hi> had sworn, and whether it were agreeable to <hi>Lane</hi>'s <hi>Affidavit</hi> that <hi>I</hi> spake of before, <hi>I</hi> desire <hi>Knox</hi> to let me see it, but he had it not about him at that time. Some time after that, as near as <hi>I</hi> can remember <hi>I</hi> was at <hi>Proctor</hi>'s Coffee-house at <hi>Charing-cross,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Knox</hi> came thither, whether by my appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or his, <hi>I</hi> can't well tell, but there we met, and one <hi>Bedford</hi> was with me; at that same time <hi>Mr. Knox</hi> desired we would go into a Back-room, and now, said he, <hi>I</hi> will give you satisfaction, and drew out of his Pocket an <hi>Affidavit,</hi> it was a sheet of Paper, if not written of every side, <hi>I</hi> believe of three sides; it was very long, and he read it, my Lord, and <hi>I</hi> did find by the Contents of it, that it did imply
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93087:26"/>
the same thing that <hi>Lane</hi> had sworn before Sir <hi>Iames Butler</hi>; that is, that <hi>Mr. Cates</hi> should attempt upon <hi>Lane</hi>'s Body to commit Sodomy, or something very agreeable to it. <hi>I</hi> told him, <hi>Mr. Knox,</hi> said <hi>I,</hi> this is very material, this will do you a great deal of Service, the Term is coming on, you would do well to get an Indictment drawn up against <hi>Mr. Cates.</hi> Said he, <hi>I</hi> will do his Business, and will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise with persons able to instruct me in it, and <hi>I</hi> don't doubt but to carry on the Business effectually. And to that purpose <hi>I</hi> desired him to let me have a Copy of the <hi>Affidavit</hi>; he promised me <hi>I</hi> should, and said he would bring it several times, and he came several times to my Lodging, but did not bring it; but <hi>I</hi> having it read to me, and remembring the Contents of it, the next time <hi>I</hi> saw my Lady <hi>Powis, I</hi> gave her an account of it. Said she, this man is very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and deserves to be encouraged, and as <hi>I</hi> believe gave the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> an account of it too, for then she was lodgd at the <hi>Tower</hi> with her Lord, and so her Ladishop told me: And, said she, do you know whether this man be in a condition to prosecute this Business against <hi>Mr. Cates?</hi> said she, <hi>I</hi> believe he is put upon this by my Lord of <hi>Danby,</hi> and he <hi>I</hi> believe takes care of him to furnish him with money. Said <hi>I, I</hi> have endeavoured to trace him out in that thing, and by all his Correspondents <hi>I</hi> could never find, but only by one, that <hi>Mr. Knox</hi> was ever acquainted or held correspondence with my Lord of <hi>Danby,</hi> and that person is <hi>Mr. Nettervile,</hi> who is a worthy Gentleman of my acquaintance in the <hi>Pall-mall</hi>: And being in his Chamber, <hi>Knox</hi> came in, and speaking merrily after his manner to him, said he, <hi>Knox</hi> when were you at the <hi>Tower</hi> with my Lord of <hi>Danby?</hi> said he, <hi>I</hi> hold no correspondence with him. Yes, said <hi>Mr. Nettervile,</hi> 'tis plain you do, and <hi>I</hi> believe a Friend of mine saw you go in the other day: But <hi>Knox</hi> did positively deny it; that was all that ever <hi>I</hi> heard of his correspondence with my Lord of <hi>Danby.</hi> After this, when her Ladiship came to me to ask me what condition he was in to prosecute the Tryal; <hi>I</hi> told her, <hi>I</hi> believed his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was very mean, and it would be very acceptable, if he might or could be furnished with Money. Well, said she, <hi>I</hi> will take care of it, and give an account of it to my Lord, and he shall be furnished. And in the mean time, if <hi>Mr. Knox</hi> wants money, be sure you take care and furnish him; but you need not let it be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, till you see what is raised. Some time after this, <hi>Mr. Knox</hi> came to <hi>Mrs Celiers</hi> House to ask for me, <hi>I</hi> was then in my Chamber, but not ready; he came up to me, and told me, said he, Really <hi>I</hi> am very poor, <hi>I</hi> am going to pavvn my
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93087:26"/>
Sword, or something to that purpose, can you lend me five pounds? Really Mr. <hi>Knox,</hi> said I, I will tell you, the <hi>Affidavit</hi> that you read to me I have given an account of it to my Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> and I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose some other Persons of Honour have had an account of it also; I am satisfied they are, and that the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> will take care that Money shall be raised for your prosecuting of Mr. <hi>Oates.</hi> He seem'd to smile at this; but said he, if this should be known, it would be very prejudicial to the Business, and spoil it; but yet however if you can furnish me with Money at this time, you will do me a great kindness, for I have very great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. I told him, said I, I have not so much Money by me, you come at an unseasonable time, though indeed I told him a Lye, but I thought it not safe to part with Money without further order. Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> went away, and I gave an account of it to Mrs. <hi>Celier,</hi> who went either every day, or every other day to the <hi>Tower</hi>; I told her what Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> said, and I do believe (as she told me afterwards) she told my Lady <hi>Powis</hi> of it, and Mrs. <hi>Celier</hi> seem'd to be angry that I did not let him have the Money, and order'd me that at what time soever after that Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> should come to me, I should let him have what Money he wanted. Some time after this, Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> did come to me, and said his condition was very mean, and you told me, said he, that care should be taken by the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> to furnish me with Money. Said I, Mr <hi>Knox</hi> I can let you have 30 or 40 <hi>s.</hi> if that will do you any kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; I have no order for any sum at present, but as soon as it comes, it must come to you through my
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93087:27"/>
hands, and it must pass as if I lent it you, and you shall give me a Note for it to repay it, lest any thing should come to be discovered, and coming to Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> hearing, should prejudice the Business; though I had been too forward before in giving Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> an account that the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> would contribute to this Business. At that time I went up stairs and fetch'd down 40 <hi>s.</hi> and gave it him: He came afterwards, and would have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed more of me at other times, once or twice after that, but I did not furnish him, for I had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no order to furnish him any further. And this, my Lord, is all the correspondence I had with him, and as near as I can remember, I have given nothing in but what is a very true account of the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action.</p>

                  <p>THIS Informant doth upon his Oath declare, that on the first of this present <hi>April,</hi> there came one <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Osborne</hi> to the Informant in the <hi>Painted-Chamber</hi> in <hi>Westminster,</hi> and told to him the said Informant, that he had somthing of moment to reveal to him; and did also desire the Informant to go with him into the Abby, and he would reveal it to him; upon which the said <hi>Osborne,</hi> and the Informant being together, the said <hi>Osborne</hi> did tell the Informant, that his Conscience was mightily troubled for that he found the <hi>Lord Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> was maliciously prosecuted by Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi>; for that he having been a servant to Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and had often heard Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> consult together, in Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> his Chamber in <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve how they might contrive a way whereby to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy my Lord <hi>Treasurer</hi>: And that he had chosen to reveal this secret, and ease his Conscience to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant, rather than to any one else, because he thought he would keep it secret, for his own sake, because he had already suffered by endeavouring to serve the said <hi>Lord Treasurer,</hi> and thereupon the said <hi>Osborne</hi> shewed to the Informant some Papers written, as he told the Informant, all in his own hand, and which were rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the said <hi>Lord Treasurer</hi>; upon which the said In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant, told the said <hi>Osborne,</hi> that he was no servant of the said <hi>Lord Treasurers,</hi> and did not therefore desire to meddle in it; and that particularly, because he had never spoke with the said <hi>Osborne</hi> before, and desired to be excused; upon which the said <hi>Osborne</hi> did press the

               <p>All that I can say of <hi>Lane,</hi> is this; That <hi>Lane</hi> did say once to me, I am here; and I was Dr. <hi>Oate</hi>'s Man, and he would have Buggered me: And he did make Complaint for want of Linnen; and spoke to me, to wash him some Linnen. Said he, Here I have no Linnen, neither will they let me have any; and his Boy here, will not stir to look for any, unless <hi>Willoughby</hi> speak to him. Then the Boy was spoke to.</p>

in this Case for Mr. <hi>Knox</hi>; there are two Persons here made Defendants: as for Mr. <hi>Lane,</hi> I have nothing to do with him, nor to say for him; and his Case hath made him appear to be a very evil Man. But My Lord, I do observe that Indictment consists of two parts: the first is, that these two Defendants did Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire together; and this was the Thirtyeth of <hi>April</hi> (and the proof comes to that time, for it will be Material in our Case) that they did Maliciously and Deceitfully combine, and Conspire against <hi>Titus Oates</hi> Clerk, and <hi>VVill. Bedloe</hi> Gentleman, who had discovered this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Popish Plot, and whom they knew to have given Informations of it, to take away their Reputation, and make them Witnesses of no Belief or Credit; that is one part of the Indictment, the other part is that to further the same; Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> did cause two or three Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be written, as from <hi>Osborne</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> to him pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting those aspertions to be layd upon <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe:</hi> for the last part of the Indictment, the Council for the King have not thought fit to proceed upon it, and they have not given an account of the Letters: but for the first part, their conspiring to take off the Reputation of <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedloe</hi> is the only thing they have proceeded upon as I conceive. I must needs say, my Lord, that Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> as well as Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> have had a very great misfortune to meet with these men.</p>

But I shall say this, that as <hi>Osborne</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> had a great designe to disgrace and discredit Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi>; so they had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe to draw my Clyent Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> in, to pursue their malice. I did shew you, that they did begin their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence as to time in <hi>April,</hi> and they have laid it so in the Indictment: we shall prove to your Lordship, and shew you, that before this, and before that Mr.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93087:30"/>
                  <hi>Knox</hi> knew either <hi>Osborne</hi> or <hi>Lane,</hi> that they had drawn up this Accusation against Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and read it to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Witnesses, which we shall produce. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when they came to advise how they should Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the same, they were advised first to go to Mr. <hi>Thewer</hi>: he told them that it was a dangerous thing to meddle about, and he would not involve himself, but bid them take care what they did in it. Upon this they apply themselves to my Clyent Mr. <hi>Knox,</hi> he told them the same thing; it is a matter of great Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, I desire not to meddle with it. Said they, will you not assist us in this business, when we only Discover this to acquit our own Consciences, who knew these things to be treating and contriving against the King and my Lord of <hi>Danby?</hi> For my part, says one of them, I cannot leave the Town till I have discovered it. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this, Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> would not undertake to meddle with it, but left them. They come to him the second time, and Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> being a young man, and it seems, being a Servant in the Family, Entered into a Corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with them, to prosecute what they had design'd to do. There is nothing appears (and this I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, if your Lordship please) in the whole Evidence, that Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> was to Swear any thing against Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> (as I remember) but he was indeed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to carry on the Prosecution, these Witnesses en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming him of it; and that it was a Truth, I must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to your Lordship upon their Evidence, they did insinuate, as if Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> had been at the Charge of maintaining <hi>Lane:</hi> But I think, that Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> hath pretty well cleared whence that Maintenance came, that he gave to Mr. <hi>Lane</hi>; that it came through none of the Hands of my Clyent Mr. <hi>Knox.</hi>

               <p>That was <hi>Lane</hi>'s own Evidence. <hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Osborne</hi> might brag what they would, of what they were to have, and from whom: But I believe, not one in the Court, believed a Word they said. For it does appear, that <hi>Lane</hi> did forswear himself backwards and forwards, as the Wind blew. So that, as for what <hi>Lane</hi> hath said, it weighs not; but we shall call two Witnesses, to whom <hi>Lane</hi> declared this matter in <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> before the time that <hi>Knox</hi> was concerned: so that if we make it appear, that the Contrivance was theirs, and there was only a great deal of weakness and indiscretion in Mr. <hi>Knox,</hi> to believe such idle Persons, against Persons that had shewed themselves so considerable in this Discovery. I hope it vvill not be thought such a Crime in us, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is nothing in it, but that a young man was led away; and only his folly, and his indiscretion drew him in; not any malice or ill design.</p>

               <p>This is the Use the Defendant <hi>Knox</hi> his Counsel make of it, at first <hi>Knox</hi> was not acquainted with the matter, and when he did come to understand it he thought it to be true, as they affirmed it was true, and, said they, we will go before a Justice of Peace and swear it: he was willing, there being a discovery of several Conspiracies against his Lord's Life, as they said, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Servant, he was willing to prosecute the business, and this is the Use they make of it.</p>

               <p>But I'll tell you what, it will be necessary to clear your selves as well as you can of those Papers that were delivered by <hi>Knox</hi> to <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> and went about to the Lords in the Tower, and afterward to <hi>Nevill,</hi> and by him amended, and after delivered to <hi>Knox</hi> again by <hi>Dangerfield:</hi> this does shew as if you were concerned in the whole affair, and in all the matter of the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before it was cooked and after it was dressed.

            <sp>

            <sp>

               <p>May it please you my Lord, <hi>Osborn</hi> brings a Paper to our House and would have had my Son have read it, but he could not, so he read it himself; and there were some desperate things in it.</p>

               <speaker>Frances Lane.</speaker>
               <p>In <hi>March</hi> last, at our House, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired them they would not meddle with such things, for I said they were things beyond them. My Son promised me he would not meddle with it, but let <hi>Osborne</hi> alone with it, but said I, pray go to one Captain <hi>Thewer,</hi> he is a good civil man, and a man of understanding.

               <p>Yes they both told me so. With that says Mr. <hi>Osborne,</hi> I'll find out one Mr. <hi>Knox,</hi> who had been some acquaintance of Mr. <hi>Wiggins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s Clerk, and so, said he, I will ask Mr. <hi>Wiggins,</hi> if he be acquainted with Mr. <hi>Knox.</hi>

               <p>The nature of the thing is such, that it can be proved no otherwise. But it seemed to them that they were of no acquaintance, it is hard to prove when an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance begins.</p>

               <p>And further then this we cannot go in such a case; for that thing of the great sums of money, certainly it was as little a thing as could be; there was no more in the case then a Guiney, and ten Shillings and three half Crowns as proved, and he was cheated of them it seems, for they would not do the work.</p>

               <p>Well my Lord we have done: We say that we had no part in the malice of the contrivance, and therefore ought not to be punished with them.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I am assigned of Counsel for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant <hi>Lane.</hi> I have no Witnesses at all to examine, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shall make some little Observations upon the Evidence that is given for the King. As for the Indictment it self, though it is not several Crimes, but one complicated Crime, yet the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that is given is onely to one part thereof, and therefore I submit it to your Lordship if the proof be proportionable to the Charge, and whether the Defendant ought not to be found not Guilty. There hath been great mention made of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Letters, yet it would be hard that the Defendant should be found Guilty of such an Offence when the proof does not come up so high: that would introduce a severer punishment then the crime proved would justifie.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Just. Pemb.</speaker>
               <p>Pray <hi>Mr. Holt</hi> don't go away with that: I must set you right a little there, the Crime that is laid is, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance the Kings Evidence, and to make them that they should not be believed; the means are several, partly by casting of Crimes upon them, partly by writing Letters; that Crime is another thing, and therefore if they do not find them Guilty of every one of the particular means, yet the Crime must be found.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. <hi>Ch.</hi> J.</speaker>
               <p>You are in the right thus far <hi>Mr. Holt,</hi> they have laid in the Indictment, that they endeavouring to disparage the credit of <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedloe,</hi> have for money's sake, and by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and contrivances, and writing of Letters wherein was scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous matter against <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedloe,</hi> they thereby did attempt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93087:35"/>
to discredit them. Now say you if this matter be not proved that there was any scandalous matter concerning <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedloe,</hi> then the contrivance is not proved: but what though all the Facts in the Indictment are not proved, yet if there be enough to prove your contrivance to discredit them, and if you suppose the Evidence true that is given, it rests I think plainly upon your Client, and you cannot get off from it: but if there be not sufficient proof to maintain the Indictment for the crime of endeavouring to discredit <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedloe,</hi> unless they prove the Letters also, you say something, but there is the business that sticks on you, they have proved enough without that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Holt.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>If the Jury do not find them not Guilty generally, may they not find them not Guilty of writing the Letters?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. I.</speaker>
               <p>No; for if the other part of the Evidence did not amount to a proof of a design of disparaging their Testimony, you had a very strong objection of it: but if they lay five things, and they prove but one of them upon you, if that one serves to the disparaging of <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedloe,</hi> which is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Indictment, that maintains the Indictment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>It does so my Lord, but not the aggravations.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Just.</speaker>
               <p>All that you say then is in mitigation of a Fine, but if all be true that is proved upon your Client, as I see no reason to doubt it, you will save but little by this defence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, as to the matter, it all depends upon the credit of the Witnesses, and credibility of the Circumstances in themselves and one with another. Some of the Evidence is but very slight, and sure were but produced to spend time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Just.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed there was a great deal of it to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; for ought I see this Tryal needed not to have been above an hour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Holt.</speaker>
               <p>As for his saying he should have 100 <hi>li.</hi> a year, and the bettering of his fortune, it was but his vanity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance.</p>

               <p>They have endeavoured to lay all upon us, now if so be we are affected with any severe Evidence, I think the same Evidence (to requite them) does affect them.</p>

Besides, take notice of this, you would have this to be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance by <hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Osborne</hi> to be between themselves, and that your Clyent must be a stranger to it; and when he comes to know it, he knows it only as a remorse of Conscience that they tell him they have, and desire him to go with him before a Justice of Peace to swear it, and he hearing something that might affect his Master the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> and believing that always true, did encourage that matter onely for his Masters Service, and thought he did a good Act in it: but your sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent behaviour shews it was a Conspiracy rather; for, First, your secret wayes of sending your cunning Notes, <hi>We all club'd together, and you payd two Shillings at the Sugar-Loaf, bear this,</hi> which shews, and does to my apprehension, signifie as if he would never own that he spent any thing upon them, and that he was bountiful to them. And then the giving of Money to the man to convey Notes, that they might not betray one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; does not all these subsequent Actions, especially those <hi>Dangerfield</hi> tells you of, and receiving the Papers after they were enlarged upon speak it a Conspiracy, what can you say to all this?</p>

               <p>That does not reach this Indictment indeed but that thing that he would have tempted him to, was to have discovered, and to have a transcript of all the Papers that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned my Lord of <hi>Danby</hi>; that he should watch his Company, and know what Lords were with him, that he might make his opposition as well as he could, and that he should have what Place he did desire under my Lord.

               <speaker>Lord Chief Iustice,</speaker>
               <p>The Use of the Argument he makes is this, that as Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> might be deceived into a belief that the Information was true; so might Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> as well, when he saw one ready to swear it; but hath <hi>Dangerfield</hi> done those subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Acts which he hath done in the Confederacy, for which he is now Indicted?</p>

               <p>Well Gentlemen, you of the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and of the Jury, you need not any summing up of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I think the thing is Evident.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Iustice Pemberton,</speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen, 'tis a very clear Case, as clear as the Day, I think you need not go from the Bar, but do as you will.</p>
