            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>GEORGE WITHER,</hi> to his <hi>Friends,</hi> who have inquired after him, ſince the late ſeizure of his <hi>Perſon, Books</hi> and <hi>Papers.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <l>WHere <hi>I now am,</hi> you much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to hear,</l>
            <l>What, I am <hi>blam'd for</hi>; what,
I <hi>want,</hi> or <hi>fear</hi>;</l>
            <l>Which, this will briefly tell you: I am well,</l>
            <l>(In <hi>Purgatory,</hi> between <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi>)</l>
            <l>My <hi>Fact,</hi> (which I acknowledge, in good ſooth,</l>
            <l>May ſome offend) is only <hi>writing Truth</hi>;</l>
            <l>And, that is, in prevaricating times,</l>
            <l>Much more offenſive, then ſome hainous Crimes.</l>
            <l>I nothing <hi>Want,</hi> that's truly needful, ſave,</l>
            <l>Due thankfulneſs to GOD, for what I have,</l>
            <l>Who hitherto, in an unuſual wiſe,</l>
            <l>Without my care, vouchſafeth me ſupplies;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95870:4"/>Which hereby, I acknowledge, to this end,</l>
            <l>That, others may in ſtraits, on him depend.</l>
            <l>All, I need now to <hi>fear,</hi> is, that before</l>
            <l>I ſhall be freed,, I way be made ſo poor</l>
            <l>The <hi>Meſſenger,</hi> will hardly get his fees,</l>
            <l>Or,, that the <hi>Remnant</hi> of a Loaf and Cheeſe,</l>
            <l>Which at my now forſaken Chamber lies,</l>
            <l>Will mouldy be, or eaten by the Miſe.</l>
            <l>I do not fear, that what I have expreſt</l>
            <l>Or publiſhed, will not abide the <hi>Teſt,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Unleſs my <hi>Judges,</hi> do, by looking back</l>
            <l>The <hi>Gen'ral-Pardon,</hi> ineffectual make:</l>
            <l>For, that, which I laſt wrote, was but fruit torn</l>
            <l>Out of the Mothers Womb before 'twas born,</l>
            <l>Which, whether <hi>Life,</hi> or <hi>Death</hi> receive it ſhould,</l>
            <l>No man with certainty, determine could;</l>
            <l>And, if (according unto my <hi>Appeals</hi>)</l>
            <l>That, which I purpos'd for the <hi>Publick-weal,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And honor of the <hi>King,</hi> may be peruſed</l>
            <l>Intirely, and not palpably abuſed,</l>
            <l>By <hi>taking from,</hi> or <hi>adding thereunto,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I do defie the worſt, this <hi>World</hi> can do;</l>
            <l>Well knowing, that, if ſhe conceal what's done,</l>
            <l>From Publick view, yet paſſeth <hi>doomes</hi> thereon</l>
            <l>Which may be to my wrong, 'twill be reveal'd</l>
            <l>And judg'd by GOD, to whom I have appeal'd.</l>
            <l>Though now there be not left with me, one <hi>Line</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Of what I laſt wrote, I no whit repine:</l>
            <l>For, <hi>Providence</hi> will further my intent,</l>
            <l>Thereby, much better, than the courſe I meant;</l>
            <l>Or, elſe will raiſe up, if that be calcin'd,</l>
            <l>A ſprightlier Product of the ſelf-ſame kind,</l>
            <l>Which to obliterate, none ſhall preſume,</l>

            <l>Either the <hi>King,</hi> or GOD, will ſet me free,</l>
            <l>To whoſe <hi>Free-mercies</hi> only, I appeal</l>
            <l>Ev'n in thoſe things, which I intended well:</l>
            <l>For, <hi>extream Juſtice,</hi> is a dreadful thing,</l>
            <l>Whether pronounc'd by GOD, or by a <hi>King</hi>:</l>
            <l>And, otherwhile, men of an <hi>upright-way,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Permitted are, in ſomethings to <hi>miſ-ſay,</hi>

            <l>I have not purpoſely, one Paper hid</l>
            <l>To cloake the worſt, that er'e I ſaid or did;</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Emanuel</hi> my Protector is become,</l>
            <l>He, keeps all <hi>Pannick-fears</hi> out of this <hi>Roome,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And, though the <hi>Devil</hi> and my <hi>Foes</hi> together</l>

            <l>Which, I perceive are more afraid of me,</l>
            <l>Then cauſe I have of them afraid to be:</l>
            <l>For, if I do but ſhrugg, where it doth itch,</l>
            <l>They skip into a hole, and there they couch.</l>
            <l>No Thief, I think, to rob me dares appear,</l>
            <l>Within theſe Walls, the <hi>Gallowes</hi> are ſo near;</l>

            <l>This, juſtly, thereupon inferr I do,</l>

            <p>THeſe <hi>Pieces,</hi> being communicated to ſeveral Perſons in writing, were ſent back to me im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed; by what Printer I know not. Two or three large <hi>Cantles,</hi> are thrown in among them; which, though you would have diſliked, in reſpect of their Quantity, I ſhould have made no ſhorter; for, I could with more contentment have
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95870:60"/>
lengthned them. So much was neceſſary to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe my own <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and ſtrengthen my <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> during the <hi>preſſures</hi> which lie upon me. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if they begin to ſeem tedious, give over the peruſal: For, they were intended to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to thoſe onely, who were voluntarily deſirous of them, to whom I beſeech GOD to ſanctifie them in the reading. They were diſtill'd out of me, by that <hi>Fiery-tryal,</hi> which will extend to many other before it be ended, and which will evidence that they are no counterfeit or <hi>Sophiſtical Extractions,</hi> though they may ſeem trivial to ſome, becauſe they relate chiefly to my ſelf; for, they will be found uſeful to many of them, who, are or ſhall be, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with like Paſſions and Afflictions.</p>
            <p>That, which tends to the Vindication of the <hi>Poem</hi> occaſioning my Commitment hither, will concern others as well as my ſelf; So, may alſo that which expreſſeth my ſuddain diſtemper, at the firſt hearing of my Wives Sickneſs, lying at 52. Miles diſtance in a very diſconſolate Condition, as to all outward things: And they who are as truly ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a <hi>Conjugal</hi> and <hi>Paternal Affection</hi> as I am, will perhaps, think when they read what I have written, that it may be of uſe to ſome of them, when they conſider well the ſtruglings between my <hi>Fleſh</hi> &amp; <hi>Spirit</hi> during that <hi>Tryal</hi>; and, in regard it is in probability, the ſtrongeſt Temptation whereby the world and the Devil ſhall have power to afflict me. But, whatſoever ſhall be thought of that, of the reſt of theſe Parcels, or of me, I ſent them to thoſe in writing, who deſired to have Copies of them, and to paſſe further, as God ſhould give leave.</p>

            <head>The <hi>Authors Dream,</hi> the night before the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing of this Book, and (as he believes) the true Interpretation thereof.</head>
            <l>I Am <hi>awake:</hi> GOD's bleſſed Name be prais'd,</l>
            <l>That, he to ſee the Light, my eyes hath rais'd:</l>
            <l>For, <hi>ſleep,</hi> I ſee, which we repute the beſt</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Temporal things</hi> pertaining to mans <hi>Reſt,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>(Next to a <hi>quiet Conſcience</hi>) may become</l>
            <l>A <hi>Torment,</hi> very near as troubleſome,</l>
            <l>If he, that giveth his <hi>Beloved</hi> ſleep,</l>
            <l>Did not, within a <hi>Bound,</hi> nights terrours keep.</l>
            <l>My <hi>Soul,</hi> ſo toyl'd, and tired out, hath been</l>
            <l>With what, this <hi>night,</hi> in <hi>Dreamings</hi> I have ſeen,</l>
            <l>That, peradventure, if I waking, had</l>
            <l>Been ſo oppreſt, it might have made me mad:</l>
            <l>For, from the twelfth hour, to the fourth, well nigh,</l>
            <l>I have been ſtrugling, in an <hi>Agonie,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>With ſuch <hi>Confuſions,</hi> that, if I would tell</l>
            <l>How, I have been turmoyl'd, I, might aſwell</l>
            <l>Another <hi>World</hi> endeavour to <hi>Create</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Out of a <hi>Chaos,</hi> as the ſame relate:</l>
            <l>And, not a littie troubled is my mind,</l>
            <l>Now I am <hi>waking,</hi> how, I forth may find</l>
            <l>What it <hi>preſignifies:</hi> For, I believe</l>
            <l>Thoſe <hi>Notions,</hi> I did not in vain receive:</l>
            <l>And, therefore, (ſince no <hi>Daniel</hi> I do know,</l>
            <l>Who, either can to me my <hi>Viſion</hi> ſhow,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:95870:63"/>Or, what it means) Ile, by GOD's Grace, aſſay</l>
            <l>To make the beſt uſe of it, that I may;</l>
            <l>Not doubting, but, that he will condeſcend</l>
            <l>To ſhew ſome glimpſe, of what, he doth intend.</l>
            <l>It hapned (which, forget not to remember)</l>
            <l>The day before the <hi>Kalend's of November,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The <hi>firſt year</hi> (and may be the laſt) wherein</l>
            <l>I had infranchiſed in <hi>Newgate</hi> been,</l>
            <l>For off'ring to <hi>Record,</hi> what I have heard</l>
            <l>By <hi>common Fame,</hi> and, was by me declar'd</l>
            <l>To no worſe end, then, that, prevent it might</l>
            <l>Such like <hi>Confuſions,</hi> as me thought, this night</l>
            <l>To me were repreſented. And, who knowes</l>
            <l>But, that, this <hi>Dream,</hi> a <hi>Conſequent</hi> foreſhowes</l>
            <l>To that relating, which, fulfill'd will be</l>
            <l>Either, upon theſe <hi>Nations,</hi> or on me,</l>
            <l>Or both of us, if God, averts not from</l>
            <l>The beſt of us, that, which is like to come;</l>
            <l>And, as dreadful our <hi>waking Dreams</hi> may be</l>
            <l>As this was in my <hi>ſleep,</hi> laſt night to me.</l>
            <l>This very day, moreover, (as I hear)</l>
            <l>Thoſe <hi>Muſings,</hi> which by me compoſed were</l>
            <l>Since my <hi>Commitment</hi> hither, paſs the <hi>Preſſe</hi>;</l>
            <l>And, our <hi>confuſions,</hi> will be more or leſs,</l>
            <l>As they ſhall take effect. GOD's <hi>Will be done,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>(What ere, he pleaſeth ſhall ſucceed thereon)</l>
            <l>For, he, who wak'd me out of this sad <hi>Dream,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Will, when, at their worst, raise me out of them;</l>
            <l>Or, when the <hi>Reſurrection morning</hi> comes,</l>
            <l>Save, me, at leaſt, from all <hi>deſtructive Dooms,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>This, (though my <hi>Dream</hi> admits no explanation)</l>
            <l>I take to be a true <hi>Interpretation.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But if, that any finds me out a better</l>
            <l>I will approve it, and remain his debter.</l>
