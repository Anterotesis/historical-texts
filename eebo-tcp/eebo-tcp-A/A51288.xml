         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That this <hi>Divine</hi> Food there discoursed of, the <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ, is most copiously to be fed upon in the Holy <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and that our <hi>Communion-Service</hi> alludes to the same, nor does by such a <hi>Real Presence</hi> imply any <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>

1. THE occasion of writing this short Treatise was this. I observing the Papers here in <hi>England,</hi> published in behalf of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and for the drawing off People from the Orthodox Faith of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which holds with the ancient pure Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church in the <hi>Primitive</hi> Times, before that general <hi>Degeneracy</hi> of the Church came in, to drive at nothing more earnestly, than the maintaining their grand Error touching the Eucharist, <hi>viz.</hi> their Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation:</hi> Into which they would bring back the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hold of some Intimations, or more open Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions of theirs, of a <hi>Real Presence</hi> (though they absolutely deny the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation)</hi> and thus entangling and ensnaring them in those free professions touching that Mystery of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> would by hard pulling hale them into that rightfully relinquish'd Errour, for which and several others, they justly left the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> I thought it my duty so far as my Age, and Infirmness of my Body will permit, to endeavour to extricate the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially our Church of <hi>England</hi> from these Entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with which these witty and cunning Writers would entangle Her, in Her Concessions touching that mysterious Theory, and to shew there is no clashing betwixt her declaring against <hi>Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> and those Passages which seem to imply a <hi>Real Presence</hi> of the Body and Bloud of Christ at the Celebration of the Holy <hi>Eucharist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning which, that we may the more clearly judge, we will bring into view what She
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41811:3"/>
says touching them both. And as touching the former (Article 28.) her words are these: Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation (or the change of the substance of Bread and Wine in the Supper of the Lord) cannot be proved by Holy Writ, but it is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occasion to many Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions. And in the latter part of the <hi>Rubrick</hi> at the end of the <hi>Communion-Service,</hi> She says, That the Sacramental Bread and Wine remain still in their very natural Substances, and therefore may not be adored (for that were Idolatry to be abhorred of all faithful Christians) and the <hi>natural</hi> Body and Bloud of our Saviour Christ are in Heaven and not here, it being against the <hi>Truth</hi> of Christ's <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Body to be at one time in more places than one. This is sufficiently express against <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Now those passages that seem to imply a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Presence</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist</hi> are these. In the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Article 28. <hi>The Body of Christ,</hi> saith our Church, <hi>is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after an Heavenly and Spiritual manner. And the mean whereby the Body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper, is Faith.</hi> Against which our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries suggest; that no Faith can make us actually receive and eat that, which is God knows how far distant from us, and that therefore we imply that the Body of Christ is <hi>really present</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> Another Passage occurs in our <hi>Catechism;</hi> where it is told us, <hi>That the inward part of the Sacrament, or thing signified,</hi> is <hi>the Body and Bloud of Christ, which are</hi> verily <hi>and</hi> indeed <hi>taken and received by the faithful in the Lord's Supper.</hi> Where [verily] and [indeed]
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41811:4"/>
seems to imply a <hi>Real Presence</hi> and Participation of the Body and Bloud of Christ. The last place shall be that in the <hi>Homily,</hi> of <hi>worthy receiving</hi> and reverend esteeming of the Sacrament of the Body and Bloud of Christ. The words are these. But thus much we must be sure to hold, that in the Supper of the Lord there is no vain Ceremony, no <hi>bare Sign,</hi> no <hi>untrue Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi> of a <hi>thing absent.</hi> But as the Scripture saith, the Table of the Lord, the Bread and Cup of the Lord, the Memory of Christ, the Annunciation of his Death, yea the <hi>Communion of the Body and Blood of the Lord, in a marvellous Incorporation,</hi> which by the <hi>Operation of the Holy Ghost</hi> (the very bond of our conjunction with Christ) is through Faith wrought in the Souls of the faithful. Whereby not only their Souls live to Eternal Life, but they surely trust to win their Bodies a Resurrection to Immortality. And immediately there is added, The true understanding of this Fruition and Union which is betwixt the Body and the Head, betwixt the true Believers and Christ, the ancient Catholick Fathers both perceiving themselves, and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their people, were not afraid to call this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, some of them, the Salve of Immortality, and sovereign Preservative against Death; others the <hi>Deifick Communion,</hi> others the sweet Dainties of our Saviour, the Pledge of Eternal Health, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Faith, the Hope of the Resurrection; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Food of Immortality, the Healthful Grace and the Conservatory to Everlasting Life. There are so many high Expressions in these passages, that our Adversaries who would by this Hook pluck us back again into the Errour of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> will unavoidably imagine and alledge from hence
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41811:4"/>
that if we will stand to the Assertions of our own Church, we must acknowledge the <hi>Real Presence</hi> of the Body and Bloud of our Saviour in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And let us be so civil to them as at least for the present to yield, that understanding it in a due sense, we do acknowledge the <hi>Real Presence.</hi> But it does not at all follow from thence that we must hold that that very Body of Christ that hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cross, and whose Bloud was there shed, is <hi>really</hi> present in the Sacrament, but that our Church speaking <hi>conformably</hi> to <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Discourse</hi> on this Matter in the sixth of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and to the ancient <hi>primitive</hi> Fathers, whose expressions do plainly allude to <hi>that Discourse</hi> of our Saviour's in the sixth of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> doth assert both a <hi>Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> of the Body and Bloud of Christ to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the faithful in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and also a <hi>Real Absence</hi> of that Body and Bloud that was crucified and shed on the Cross. And this seems to be the express Doctrine of our Saviour in the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Chapter of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> where the <hi>Eternal</hi> Word incarnate speaks thus—</p>
               <p>John 6. v. 51. <hi>I am the living Bread which came down from Heaven,</hi> (viz. the Manna which the Psalmist calls the Food of Angels also) <hi>if any eat of this Bread he shall live for ever</hi> (viz. of this true <hi>Manna,</hi> of which the Manna in the Wilderness was but a Type) <hi>and the Bread that I will give is my flesh</hi> (which therefore still is that <hi>immortalizing</hi> Manna, the true Bread from Heaven) <hi>which I will give for the life of the World,</hi> that the whole Intellectual Creation may live thereby, it being their vivifick Food. For as you may gather by <hi>vers.</hi> 62, 63. he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41811:5"/>
does not understand his flesh that hung on the Cross. And it was the ignorance of the <hi>Iews</hi> that they thought he did: and therefore they cryed out on him, saying, <hi>v.</hi> 52. <hi>How can this man give us his flesh to eat?</hi> And that is because they took him to be a mere man, or an ordinary man, not the incarnate <hi>Logos.</hi> Which Logos <hi>Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>Then Iesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, except you eat the flesh of the Son of man</hi> (that is of the <hi>Messias,</hi> or the <hi>Word Incarnate) and drink his bloud, you have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my bloud hath Eternal Life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my bloud is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my bloud dwelleth in me and I in him. As the living Father hath sent me and I live by the Father, so he that eateth me (viz.</hi> that eateth his flesh and drinketh his bloud) <hi>even he shall live by me. This is that bread that came down from</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:41811:5"/>
                  <hi>Heaven, not as your Fathers did eat Manna and are dead; he that eateth of this Bread shall live for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This is that <hi>earnest, lofty</hi> and <hi>sublime</hi> discourse of our Saviour touching his <hi>real</hi> Flesh and Blood, that the scandal given to the Jews could not drive him off from, and persisting in it he gave also offence to his Disciples, that muttered and said, <hi>This is an hard saying, who can hear it?</hi> Wherefore I must confess ingenuously, that it seems to me incredible, that under so <hi>lofty mysterious</hi> a Style, and <hi>earnest</hi> asseveration of what he affirms, though to the scandal of both the <hi>Iews</hi> and his own <hi>Disciples,</hi> there should not be couched some most weighty and profound Truth concerning some <hi>real</hi> Flesh and Blood of his, touching which this vehement and sublime Discourse is framed, which is a piece of that part of the Christian Philosophy (as some of the Antients call Christianity) which <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> terms <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The <hi>Object</hi> of this <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> is the <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ: But to rectifie the errour of his Disciples, he plainly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that he doth not mean what he said of the Flesh and Blood he then bore about with him. In <hi>v.</hi> 61, 62, 63. <hi>Does this offend you</hi> (saith he to them) <hi>what and if you shall see the Son of Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend up where he was before</hi> (then my particular <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Body will be far enough removed from you, and your selves then from so gross a conceit as to think I understand this of my <hi>natural, particular</hi> Body or Flesh). No says he, <hi>the flesh profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, it is the spirit that quickens; the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life,</hi> that is to say, they are concerning that <hi>spiritual Body</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:41811:6"/>
and <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> that accompanies it <hi>(That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit)</hi> the both <hi>seed</hi> and <hi>nourishment</hi> of those that are <hi>Regenerate;</hi> the Principles of their <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and the <hi>Divine Food</hi> for their <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,</hi> whereby they grow up to their due sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Christ.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And where, or where so fully is this <hi>Divine Food</hi> to be had, as in that most solemn and most devotional approaching God in the Celebration of the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> where we both testifie and advance thereby our <hi>spiritual union</hi> with him, according as he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in <hi>Iohn</hi> ch. 6. <hi>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which our <hi>Communion-Service</hi> thus glosses: That if with a true penitent heart and lively faith we receive this Holy Sacrament, we then spiritually eat the Flesh of Christ and drink his Blood, we dwell in Christ and Christ in us, we are one with Christ and Christ with us. And whereas the Adversaries of our Church object, We cannot eat the Flesh of Christ and drink his Blood, in the Celebration of the Lords Supper, unless his Flesh and Blood be really present; we do acknowledge that <hi>that</hi> Flesh and Blood which our Saviour dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Iohn,</hi> and which our <hi>Liturgie</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to, as also those notable sayings of the Fathers above-cited out of the <hi>Homily,</hi> touching the <hi>worthy receiving the Lord's Supper,</hi> is <hi>really present</hi> in the Eucharist. And that there is <hi>that</hi> which Christ calls his <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> distinct from that which he then bore about with him, and was Crucified on the Cross, he does most manifestly declare in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41811:6"/>
that discourse in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Iohn,</hi> as I have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. So manifest is it that the <hi>Real Presence</hi> does not imply any <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> of the Bread and Wine into the Body and Blood of Christ.</p>

               <p n="1">1. AND therefore to prop up this great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> they are fain to recur and stick to a <hi>literal</hi> sense of those words of our Saviour [This is my Body] which I finding no where more handsomely done than by the Right Reverend Bishop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> I shall produce the Passage in his own words (that is the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41811:7"/>
of them) in his <hi>Exposition of the Doctrine of the Catholick Church,</hi> Sect. 10. The Real Presence, says he, of the Body and Blood of our Saviour is solidly established by the words of the Institution (This is my Body) which we understand <hi>literally;</hi> and there is no more reason to ask us why we fix our selves to the proper and <hi>literal</hi> sense, than there is to ask a Traveller why he follows the <hi>high Road.</hi> It is their parts who have recourse to the <hi>Figurative</hi> sense and who take by-paths, to give a reason for what they do. As for us, since we find nothing in the words which Jesus Christ makes use of for the Institution of this Mystery obliging us to take them in a <hi>Figurative</hi> sense, we think that to be a sufficient Reason to determine us to the <hi>literal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In answer to this, I shall, if it be not too great a Presumption, first accompany this venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Person in this <hi>high Road</hi> of the <hi>literal</hi> sence of the words of Institution (This is my Body) and then shew how this <hi>Road,</hi> as fairly as it looks, is here a mere <hi>Angiportus</hi> that hath no <hi>exitus</hi> or Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, so that we must be forced to divert out of it, or go abck again.</p>
               <p>First then, let us take this supposed <hi>high Road,</hi> and say the words (This is my Body) are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood <hi>literally.</hi> Wherefore let us produce the whole Text and follow this kind of Gloss, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 19. <hi>And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my Body, which is given for you, This do in remembrance of me. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the New Testament in my blood, which is shed for you.</hi> Now if we keep to the mere <hi>literal</hi> sense, <hi>This</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:41811:7"/>
                  <hi>Cup</hi> (as well as this Bread is the Body of Christ) must be really the <hi>New Testament</hi> in Christ's Bloud, which is a thing unavoidable if we tye our selves to the <hi>literal</hi> sense of the words. But why is not the <hi>Cup</hi> the <hi>Bloud</hi> or <hi>Covenant</hi> in Christ's Bloud? But that a <hi>Cup</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi> are <hi>Disparata,</hi> or in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <hi>Opposita,</hi> which to affirm one of another is a Contradiction; as if one should say a <hi>Bear</hi> is a <hi>Horse,</hi> and therefore we are constrained to leave the <hi>literal</hi> sense, and to recur to a <hi>figurative.</hi> But precisely to keep to the institution of that part of the Sacrament that respects Christ's Body; It is plain that what he took he gave thanks for, what he gave thanks for he brake, what he brake he gave to his Disciples, saying, <hi>This</hi> (which he took, gave thanks for, brake, and gave to his Disciples, <hi>viz.</hi> the above-mentioned <hi>Bread) is my Body.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>literal</hi> sense must necessarily be, <hi>This Bread</hi> (as before it was this Cup) <hi>is my body.</hi> Insomuch that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this <hi>literal</hi> sense it is both <hi>really Bread</hi> still, and <hi>really</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> at once. Which, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, there is no <hi>Romanist</hi> but will be ashamed to admit. But why cannot he admit this but that <hi>Bread</hi> and the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> are <hi>Opposita,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the one cannot be said to be the other without a perfect repugnancy or contradiction to humane Reason; as absurd as if one should say a <hi>Bear</hi> is a <hi>Horse,</hi> or a <hi>Rose</hi> a <hi>Black-bird,</hi> whence, by the bye, we may note the necessary use of Reason in Matters of Religion, and that what is a plain <hi>Contradiction</hi> to humane Reason, such as a <hi>Triangle</hi> is a <hi>Circle,</hi> or a <hi>Cow</hi> an <hi>Horse,</hi> are not to be admitted for Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Christian Faith. And for this Reason,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41811:8"/>
I suppose the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> fell into the opinion of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> (from this <hi>literal</hi> way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding these words [This is my Body]) rather than according to the genuine leading of that way, they would admit that what Christ gave his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, was both <hi>real Bread</hi> and the <hi>real Body</hi> of Christ at once.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But see the infelicity of this Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> which does not only contradict the inviolable Principles of <hi>Reason</hi> in humane Souls, but also all the <hi>outward</hi> senses, upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it is more intolerable than that opinion which they seem so much to abhor, as to prefer <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> before it, though it contradict only <hi>Reason,</hi> not the <hi>outward Senses,</hi> which rightly circumstantiated are fit Judges touching sensible Objects, whether they be this or that, Fish or Fowl, Bread or Flesh. Nay I may add that these Transubstantiators have fallen over and above that contradiction to the rightly circumstantiated senses, into <hi>that very absurdity,</hi> that they seemed so much to abhor from, that is the confounding two <hi>opposite Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> into one <hi>Individual Substance, viz.</hi> that one and the same Individual Substance should be really both <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Body</hi> at once. But by their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiating the <hi>Individual</hi> Substance of the <hi>Bread</hi> into the <hi>Individual</hi> Substance of <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Body,</hi> they run into this very Repugnancy which they seemed before so cautiously to avoid; two Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Substances (as <hi>species infimae)</hi> being <hi>Opposita,</hi> and therefore uncapable of being said to be the same, or to be pronounced one of the other without a <hi>Contradiction.</hi> It is impossible that the Soul of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> for example, should be so Transubstantiated
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41811:8"/>
into the Soul of <hi>Plato,</hi> that it should become his Soul, insomuch that it may be said of <hi>Socrates</hi> his Soul, that it is the Soul of <hi>Plato;</hi> and there is the same Reason of Transubstantiating the Substance of the Bread into the Substance of the Body of Christ. So that the <hi>Substance</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> may be said to be the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> or the <hi>Substance</hi> of his Body, <hi>which</hi> it must either <hi>be,</hi> or be <hi>annihilated,</hi> and then it is not the <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> of the <hi>Substance</hi> of the <hi>Bread,</hi> but the <hi>Annihilation</hi> of it, into the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And having rid in this fair promising <hi>Road</hi> of the <hi>literal</hi> sense, but thus far, I conceive, I have made it manifest, that it is not <hi>passable,</hi> but that we have discovered such difficulties as may very well move me to strike out of it, or return back. And further, to shew I do it not rashly, I shall add se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Reasons, as this venerable Person (that thinks fittest to keep in it still) doth but rightfully require; as declaring, It is their parts who have recourse to the <hi>Figurative</hi> sense, and who take by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paths to give a reason why they do so. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore besides what I have produced already, I add these transcribed out of a Treatise of mine writ many years ago. Besides then the Repugnancy of this Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense of all men, according to which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be judged to be <hi>Bread</hi> still, I shall now shew how it contradicts the Principles of all <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> (which if we may not make use of in Theology, to what great purpose are all the Universities in <hi>Christendom?)</hi> the Principles, I say, of <hi>Physicks,</hi> of <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> of <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and of <hi>Logick.</hi> It is a Principle in <hi>Physicks,</hi> That that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41811:9"/>
Internal space or place that a body occupies, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the body that occupies it. Now let us sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that one and the same body occupies <hi>two</hi> such internal places or spaces at once. This body there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is equal to two spaces which are double to one single space; wherefore the body is double to that body in one single space, and therefore one and the same Body <hi>double</hi> to <hi>it self,</hi> which is an enormous <hi>Contradiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Again in <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> the body of Christ is acknowledged <hi>one,</hi> and that as much as any one body else in the World. Now the <hi>Metaphysical</hi> Notion of [one] is to be <hi>indivisum à se</hi> (both <hi>quoad partes</hi> and <hi>quoad totum)</hi> as well as <hi>divisum à quolibet alio;</hi> but the body of Christ being both in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and without any continuance of that body here upon Earth also, the whole body is divided from the whole body, and therefore is entirely both <hi>unum</hi> and <hi>multa,</hi> which is a perfect contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Thirdly, In the <hi>Mathematicks (Concil. Trident. Sess.</hi> 13.) the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> saying, that in the separation of the parts of the <hi>species</hi> (that which bears the outward show of Bread and Wine) that from this division there is a parting of the whole, divided into so many <hi>entire</hi> bodies of Christ, the body of Christ being always at the same time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to it self. It follows, that a <hi>part</hi> of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision is <hi>equal</hi> to the <hi>whole</hi> that is divided, against that common Notion in <hi>Euclid,</hi> That the whole is bigger than the part.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And lastly, In <hi>Logick,</hi> it is a Maxim, That the parts agree indeed with the whole, but disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree one with another; but in the above said division
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41811:9"/>
of the Host or Sacrament, the parts do so well <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> that they are intirely the <hi>same individual thing.</hi> And whereas any Division, whether <hi>Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> or <hi>Physical,</hi> is the Division of some <hi>one</hi> into <hi>many,</hi> this is but the Division of <hi>one</hi> into <hi>one</hi> and <hi>it self,</hi> which is a perfect contradiction.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To all which you may add, That the <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation</hi> of the Bread and Wine into the Body and Blood of Christ implys, that the same thing both <hi>is</hi> and <hi>is not</hi> at the <hi>same time</hi> (which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that Fundamental Principle in <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> that both parts of a contradiction can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true) which I prove thus. For that <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual</hi> thing that can be made, or is to be made of any thing, is not; the progress in this case being <hi>à privatione ad habitum,</hi> as the Schools speak, and the <hi>terms</hi> of Generation or of being made, <hi>viz. à quo</hi> and <hi>ad quem</hi> being <hi>Non esse</hi> and <hi>Esse,</hi> or <hi>Non-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istent</hi> and <hi>Existent,</hi> so that that passing, is from <hi>Non-existent</hi> to <hi>Existent.</hi> Now the <hi>individual</hi> body of Christ is <hi>to be made</hi> of the Wafer consecrated, for it is turned into his <hi>Individual</hi> Body. But his <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual</hi> Body was before this Consecration; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it both <hi>was</hi> and <hi>was not</hi> at the same time. For in the making thereof there was a passing from the <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> which is the <hi>Non-existency</hi> of the thing to be made, to the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> to the <hi>Existency</hi> of it, which yet was in Being before.</p>
               <p n="9">9. These difficulties are sufficient to show that this <hi>high Road</hi> of the <hi>literal</hi> sense taken to establish <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is not passable, so that there is a necessity of diverting or going back. Nor will it be much needful to hint briefly these or other like absurdities more intelligible to the <hi>vulgar</hi> capacity,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41811:10"/>
such as, That the same Body at the same time is greater and lesser than it self; Is but a foot distant from me or less, and yet many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand miles distant from me: That one and the same Person may be intirely present with himself, and some hundred thousand miles absent from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at once: That he may sit still on the Grass, and yet journey and walk at the same time: That an organized body that hath head, feet, hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is intirely in every part of it self, the comely parts in the more uncomely: That the same Body now in Heaven may really present it self on Earth without passing any space either directly or circuitously: That our Saviour Christ <hi>communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> with his Disciples in the last Supper, swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed down his whole intire Body, limbs, back, belly, head and mouth and all into his stomach, which might amuze and puzzle one to conceive how it was possible for his Disciples not to miss the sight of his hands and head, though his cloaths were still visible as not being swallowed down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his stomach. Or, whether our Saviour swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed down his own Body into his stomach or no, this puzzle will still remain, how his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples could swallow him down without his cloaths, he being still in his cloaths; or how they could swallow him down in his cloaths, the bread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not transubstantiated into his cloaths, but into his body only. These and several such Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities it were easie to enumerate. But I hope I have produced so much already that I may, and any one else, be thought to have very good cause to leave this <hi>high Road</hi> of the <hi>literal</hi> sense, and betake our selves to that more safe path of

It is an invidious thing to dispute the Power of the Eternal <hi>Logos</hi> or <hi>Word Incarnate,</hi> who is God of God, very God of very God, and therefore <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> and can do all things that imply no <hi>Contradiction</hi> to be done, as most certainly none of these things there specifi'd do imply it. But things repugnant to be done we may, and that with due reverence, declare God cannot do. As the Apostle does not stick to say, <hi>God cannot lye,</hi> Hebr. 6. 18. And why is it impossible for God to lye, but that it is <hi>repugnant</hi> to the Perfection of his Nature, and particularly that Attribute of his <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity.</hi> Nor will any adventure to affirm that he can make a Globe or Cylinder which shall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidistant from, or touch a Plane though but in half of their Spherical or Cylindrical Superficies: or a Circle from whose Center the lines drawn shall be unequal, or a Rectangle Triangle, the Power of whose <hi>Hypotenusa</hi> shall not be equal to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41811:11"/>
both the Powers of the <hi>Basis</hi> and <hi>Cathetus.</hi> And in fine, there are sixt and immutable Ideas of things, and such necessary and inseparable respects and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of them, that to imagine them <hi>mutable,</hi> or that God can change them, is to disorder and change the <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Immutable</hi> Intellect of <hi>God</hi> himself. Of which those indeleble and necessary Notions, which the minds of all mankind are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious to themselves of, if they be but awakned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to free attention thereto, is but a compendious <hi>Transcript.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore God his being not able to do any thing that is a <hi>Contradiction</hi> to those Eternal Ideas and Habitudes of them in his own mind, is no les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sening of his <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> but to imagine other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, is to dissolve the Eternal Frame of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Intellect, and under a pretence of amplifying his <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> to <hi>enable</hi> God to <hi>destroy himself,</hi> or to make him so <hi>weak</hi> or <hi>impotent</hi> as to be <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>being destroyed</hi> by himself, which is a thing impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But suppose the <hi>Eternal Word Incarnate</hi> could have turned the Bread and Wine into his own <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual</hi> Body and Bloud, and the thing it self were fecible, though it seems so palpably contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to us: yet there would be this difficulty still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, that it is repugnant to his <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> so to do (as the Apostle says, it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for God to lye) in that manner he is supposed to have done it, that is, in declaring, a thing is done that is repugnant so apparently to our Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Faculties, and leaves so palpable an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to all our Senses, though never so rightly <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiated,</hi> that it is not done, but that it is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41811:12"/>
                  <hi>still Bread;</hi> and yet that these <hi>species</hi> of Bread and Wine should be supported by a Miracle, to obfirm or harden us in our unbelief of this Mystery of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> How does this sute with either the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God, if he would in good earnest have us to believe this Mystery, or with his <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> to give this Scandal to the World, for whom Christ died, and to occasion so bloudy Persecutions of innumerable innocent Souls, that could not believe a thing so contrary to all Sense and Reason, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to Passages of Scripture it self, whose Penmen he did inspire? Wherefore this is a plain Evince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that our Saviour meant <hi>figuratively</hi> when he said [This is my Body] and that his Disciples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood him so (there being nothing more usual in the Jewish Language than to call the <hi>Sign</hi> by the <hi>Name</hi> of the thing <hi>signified)</hi> and that this <hi>literal</hi> Gloss has been introduced by After-ages without any fault of our Saviour. But in defence of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral sense which he would have to infer <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi> our Author holds on thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That this may be done without danger of multiplying his Body, and making as many Christs as Altars, or leaving the right hand of his Father, but only by giving to his Body a <hi>Supernatural manner of Existence,</hi> by which being left without <hi>Extension of Parts,</hi> and rendred <hi>independent of Place,</hi> it may be one and the same in <hi>many</hi> places at <hi>once,</hi> and <hi>whole</hi> in every <hi>part</hi> of the Symbols, and not obnoxious to any Corporeal Contingencies. And this kind of Existence is no more than what in a manner he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows upon every <hi>glorified</hi> Body, than what his <hi>own Body</hi> had when born without the least violation of his Mother's Virginal Integrity, when he rose
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41811:12"/>
from the Dead out of the Sepulcher without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the stone; when he entered amongst his Disciples, the Doors being shut.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This is, as I said, a witty contrived evasion to elude the above-mentioned Repugnancies I have noted, and exquisitely well fitted for the amusing and confounding of more vulgar and weak minds, or such as have not leisure to consider things to the bottom, and for the captivating them into a profession of what they have no determinate or distinct apprehension of, by <hi>distinctions</hi> and <hi>exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifications</hi> that give no real support to the cause they are brought in for to maintain.</p>
               <p>For first, to pretend that by a <hi>supernatural man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Existence</hi> a body may be in more places than one at once, at the right hand of God the Father in Heaven, and on the Altar at the same time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Artifice of the Sophistry lies in this, that he has put a more <hi>tolerable</hi> and <hi>soft</hi> expression in lieu of one that (according to his explication of the matter) would sound more <hi>harsh,</hi> but is more <hi>true</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> in this case. For this manner of Exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a Body which he describes is not simply <hi>supernatural,</hi> which implies it is a Body still, as a Mill-stone by a supernatural power held up in the air is a Mill-stone still, though it be in that super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural condition. But the condition he describes is such as is not only <hi>supernatural</hi> but <hi>counter-essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> or <hi>Asystatal,</hi> that is, <hi>Repugnant</hi> to the very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Body, or of any finite substance in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse. It is as if the Mill-stone were not only <hi>supernaturally</hi> supported in the Air, but were as <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,</hi> as <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>fluid,</hi> and of as undetermined a shape as the Air it self, or as if a right-angled
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41811:13"/>
Triangle were declared to be so still, though the <hi>Hypotenusa</hi> were not of equal power with the <hi>Basis</hi> and <hi>Cathetus,</hi> which is a thing impossible; but if instead of a <hi>supernatural manner of existence,</hi> it had been said an <hi>Asystatal</hi> manner of existence, that is, an existence repugnant to the very Being of a Body or any finite substance else, it would have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to be a contradiction at the very first sight, and therefore such as ought to be rejected, as well as the affirming that what Christ gave was <hi>really Bread</hi> and <hi>really his Body at once.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. And now, notwithstanding this <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>smooth</hi> term of [supernatural] that it is an <hi>Asysta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> manner of existence, that is here given to the Body of Christ, may appear from our Author's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription thereof. For in vertue, he saith, of this <hi>supernatural manner of existence,</hi> there may be a <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> without danger of <hi>multiplying</hi> Christ's Body, and making as many Christs as Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars. But it is impossible this Absurdity should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, supposing <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> For there is not a more certain and infallible sign of two bodily Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons being <hi>two</hi> bodily Persons, and not the <hi>same</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that distance of place, wherein they are separate one from another, and consequently <hi>two</hi> not <hi>one</hi> body, and this is the very case in <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which manifestly implies, that the body of Christ is in many thousand distant places at once. Which imagined condition in it is not <hi>supernatural</hi> but <hi>Asystatal,</hi> and <hi>contradictious</hi> to the very Being of any finite substance whatever, as has been intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and firmly proved before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>distance</hi> of <hi>place</hi> necessarily infers diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Bodies or Persons, so does also <hi>difference</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:41811:13"/>
of <hi>time</hi> of their <hi>Production.</hi> That which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, suppose sixteen hundred Years ago and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains so produced cannot be produced suppose but yesterday, or at this present moment, and so be sixteen hundred Years older or younger than it self. This is not only <hi>supernatural</hi> but <hi>Asystatal,</hi> and implies a perfect contradiction; but yet this is the very case in <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> The Body of Christ born suppose sixteen hundred Years ago, is yet produced out of the <hi>Transubstantiated</hi> Bread but now or yesterday, and so the same body is six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred Years older or younger than it self, which is a perfect <hi>Contradiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Secondly, The Papist represented declares, That the Body of Christ by vertue of this <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural manner of Existence,</hi> is left without <hi>Extension of parts,</hi> which is a perfect contradiction to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nature and essence of a Body, whose universally acknowledged Definition is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, implying a <hi>Trinal inpenetrable dimension</hi> or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension. Besides, did Christ's Body at his last Supper so soon as he had <hi>Transubstantiated</hi> the Bread into it, lose all extension of parts? What then filled out his cloaths as he sat with his Disciples at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? or how could the Jews lay hold on Christ's Body to Crucifie it, if he had no extension of parts to be laid hold on? How could there be hands and feet and organization of parts, either at the <hi>Table</hi> or on the <hi>Cross,</hi> if there were no extension of parts to be organized? And lastly, being the <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiated</hi> Bread is the very <hi>Individual</hi> Body of Christ, if they would have this being left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extension of parts, to be understood of it, how can the very same <hi>Individual</hi> Body of Christ
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41811:14"/>
have Extension of Parts and have no Extension of Parts, have Organization of Parts and have no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization of Parts at once: so that the condition of Christ's Body here supposed is plainly <hi>Asystatal,</hi> not as is <hi>smoothly</hi> expressed only <hi>Supernatural.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Thirdly, Whereas the <hi>Papist Represented</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that this <hi>Supernatural</hi> Manner of Existence of Christ's Body renders it <hi>Independent of Place,</hi> what can the meaning of that be, but that by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this priviledge it might exist without any <hi>Place</hi> or <hi>Ubi,</hi> which Bodies in their natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition cannot? But this clashes with the very Story of our Saviour Christ, who was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Room in which he ate the Passover with his Disciples, after he had <hi>transubstantiated</hi> the Bread into his <hi>Individual</hi> Body, and therefore it did not exist <hi>Independently of Place,</hi> in virtue of any such <hi>Supernatural Manner of Existence</hi> as is imagined. And as this does not agree with matter of Fact, so it is a perfect contradiction to the Essence of any Body or finite Substance to be exempted from all connexion with <hi>Place</hi> or <hi>Ubi,</hi> but a <hi>finite</hi> Substance must be in a <hi>definite Ubi,</hi> and while it is in such a definite <hi>Ubi,</hi> it is impossible to conceive that it is in another <hi>Place</hi> or <hi>Ubi,</hi> whether <hi>intra</hi> or <hi>extra moe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia Mundi.</hi> He that closely and precisely considers the point, he will not fail, I think, to discern the thing to be impossible. And what contradiction it implies I have demonstrated above. So that we see there can be no such <hi>Supernatural Manner</hi> of Existence conferred on a Body in making it <hi>independent</hi> of <hi>Place</hi> or <hi>Ubiety,</hi> as to capacitate it to be one and the same Body in diverse places at once, but that this supposed <hi>Supernatural Manner</hi> is truly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41811:14"/>
an <hi>Asystatal Manner,</hi> and such as is <hi>repugnant</hi> to the very <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>Body,</hi> or any <hi>finite</hi> Substance whatsoever.</p>
               <p n="9">9. To make a body in this sense <hi>independent of Place</hi> or <hi>Ubiety,</hi> is as unconceivable as to make it <hi>independent</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> which yet would so compleat this impossible <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> that under this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence when a thing has such a <hi>Supernatural Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence</hi> as exempts it from all connexion with or relation to <hi>Time,</hi> but supposes it utterly inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent thereof, as was explained before touching <hi>Place,</hi> we may suppose what we will of a Body, that it may be <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>not Bread</hi> at the same time, that it may be at <hi>Thebes</hi> and at <hi>Athens</hi> at the same time, as we ordinary mortals would phrase it, sith it is lifted up above all Relation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with <hi>Time,</hi> nor hath any thing to do with any Time. But yet this assuredly is not a mere <hi>Supernatural Manner of Existence,</hi> but plainly <hi>Asystatal,</hi> and such as if God could cause, there would be no <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Immutable</hi> Truths, but under a Pretext of exalting the <hi>Omnipotence</hi> of God, they would imply him <hi>able</hi> to <hi>destroy his own Nature,</hi> which would argue an <hi>Impotency</hi> in him, and to extinguish and confound the <hi>Inviolable</hi> Ideas of the Divine Intellect, as I intimated above.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And fourthly and lastly, That in vertue of this <hi>Supernatural manner of Existence,</hi> the Body of Christ should be <hi>whole</hi> in every <hi>part</hi> of the Symbols, and thereby become not obnoxious to any corporeal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies; (which is said, I suppose, to avoid the Absurdity of grinding a pieces the Body of Christ with our Teeth when we chew the supposed Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies) thus to exist <hi>whole in every part,</hi> is not a mere
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41811:15"/>
                  <hi>Supernatural Manner of existing,</hi> but <hi>Asystatal,</hi> and implies either that the least part of Christ's Body is as big as the whole, or that the whole Body is God knows how many thousand times bigger than it self. For certainly the whole Body comprized under the whole <hi>Bread</hi> or Species of Bread, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousand times bigger than one particle thereof no bigger than a Pins point. Besides that this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Body of Christ <hi>whole</hi> in <hi>every part,</hi> takes away all possibility of distinct <hi>Organization</hi> of his Body, unless you will have every Pins point of it to have Head, Feet, Hands, Arms, and the rest of the Parts of an humane Body, or have the same <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual</hi> Body <hi>organized</hi> and <hi>unorganized</hi> at the same time, which are as palpable <hi>Contradictions</hi> as any can occur to the understanding of a man.</p>
               <p>And thus much I thought fit to intimate touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Witty Distinction of a <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Manner of Existence of a Body,</hi> and to shew that this pretended <hi>Supernatural</hi> Manner of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence of Christ's Body, arising from the Bread <hi>transubstantiated,</hi> as the <hi>Papist Represented</hi> describes it, is indeed an <hi>Asystatal Manner of Existence,</hi> and <hi>inconsistent</hi> with the Being of any <hi>Body,</hi> or <hi>finite Substance</hi> whatsoever.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. IT remains now that we only touch upon lightly the <hi>exemplifications</hi> of this <hi>supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral manner of Existence</hi> of a Body, consisting in these peculiarities, <hi>Non-extension</hi> of parts, <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi> of <hi>Place,</hi> and being <hi>whole</hi> in <hi>every part,</hi> and to note how none of these instances reach the present case.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As first that of a glorified Body. What Scripture, Reason or Authority ever suggested to us that the <hi>glorified Body</hi> of Christ himself, much less every glorified Body, is without <hi>extension of parts,</hi> has no relation to or connexion with <hi>Place,</hi> or is <hi>whole</hi> in every <hi>part.</hi> For without extension of Parts it cannot be so much as a <hi>Body.</hi> And were not <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> together with Christ at his Transfiguration on Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> at least <hi>live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Figures</hi> of the state of a <hi>glorified Body,</hi> but it is evident by the description that they had extension of parts, else what should shining Garments do
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41811:16"/>
upon what is unextended, and what glory can issue from a single Mathematical point as I may so call it? And in that they were on Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> together, it is manifest they had a connexion with or dependency on <hi>Place,</hi> nor did exist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being in some <hi>ubi.</hi> And that the glorified Body of Christ is in Heaven not on Earth, is plain from <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 21. and touching his Body he rose in, and therefore was his Resurrection-Body, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 6. The Angel says, <hi>He is not here, for he is risen;</hi> which had been a mere <hi>Non sequitur,</hi> if his Body could have been in more places than one at once, which property the <hi>Papist represented</hi> gives it upon account of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> And for as much as the <hi>Transubstantiated</hi> Bread and the Body of Christ is one and the same <hi>Individual</hi> Body, and that this that is once Christ's Body never perishes, it is evident, that the Body he rose in, being one and the same Body with the <hi>Transubstantiated</hi> Bread, must have the capacity by this <hi>supernatural manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence</hi> above described, to be in more places than one at once, which is a perfect contradiction to the Angels reasoning: <hi>He is not here, for he is risen,</hi> and gone hence. For according to this <hi>supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral manner of Existence,</hi> which they suppose in Christ's Body upon the account of <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he might be both there and gone thence at once.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The second Instance of this <hi>supernatural man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of existence</hi> of a Body, is Christ's Body born without the least violation of his Mothers Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Integrity, which is such a secret as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture has not revealed, nor any sufficient Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity assured us of: The Mother of Christ still
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41811:16"/>
continuing a Virgin, because she had nothing to do with any <hi>man,</hi> though that which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in her by the overshadowing of the Holy Ghost came out of her Womb in the same cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances there, that other humane Births do. But suppose the Body of Christ pass'd the wicket of the Womb without opening it, as the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams pass through a Crystal or Glass, does this import that his Body is either <hi>Independent</hi> of <hi>Place,</hi> or is devoid of <hi>Extension,</hi> or <hi>whole</hi> in every <hi>Part?</hi> surely no, no more than that light that passes through the pores of the Crystal: so that there is nothing repugnant to the nature of a Body in all this. No <hi>Non-extension,</hi> no <hi>Independency</hi> of <hi>Place,</hi> no <hi>penetration</hi> of corporeal <hi>Dimensions,</hi> nor any being <hi>whole in every part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The third Instance is <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>rising</hi> out of the Sepulcher <hi>without removing the Stone.</hi> But this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance may very justly be rejected, it disagreeing with the very History of the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> which tells us the <hi>Stone was removed,</hi> Matt. 28. 2. <hi>And behold there was a great Earthquake, for the Angel descended from Heaven, and rolled back the Stone from the door, and sate upon it.</hi> Wherefore we see the Stone was removed. Nor can I imagine why this should make a third Instance, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ's Body passing out of the Sepulcher, the Stone unremoved from the door thereof, unless from an heedless re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on the fore-going verse (where <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> and the other <hi>Mary</hi> are said to go to see the Sepulcher) and connecting it to an ill grounded sense with what follows in the second verse, <hi>And behold there was a great Earthquake;</hi> as if it were implyed that the Earthquake and the rolling
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41811:17"/>
away the Stone were at that very time that these two Women went to see the Sepulcher, and Christ having risen before, that it would follow that he rose before the Stone of the Sepulcher was remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but this is a mistake. For agreeably to <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablus</hi> his Gloss (who for <hi>erat [&amp; ecce erat terrae motus magnus]</hi> puts <hi>fuerat,</hi> and for <hi>descendit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scenderat,</hi> and for <hi>devolvit lapidem, devolverat)</hi> which implies the thing done before these Women came to the Sepulcher; it is manifest out of the other Evangelists that the matter was altogether so; for <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 2. it is said of the two above said parties, That very early in the morning, the first day of the Week they came unto the Sepulcher at the rising of the Sun, and they said among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, Who shall roll us away the Stone from the door of the Sepulcher, and when they looked they saw the Stone was rolled away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly said in <hi>Luke,</hi> That they found the Stone rolled away from the Sepulcher. And the like is recorded in St. <hi>John,</hi> ch. 20. so that it is a plain case the Stone was rolled away before their going to the Sepulcher.</p>
               <p>What time therefore can we imagine more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this rolling away the Stone and terrible Earthquake, than at the very <hi>Resurrection</hi> of Christ, who rose in this awful terrour to the Keepers, the Earth quaking, and the too Glorious Angels offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously opening the stony door of the Sepulcher, that the King of Glory might pass out, without any further needless or useless Miracle, such as he ever declined in his life time, before his Death and Resurrection? Wherefore this third Instance, it is plain, cannot with any shew be accommodated to the present case, it being raised out of a mere mistake of the Story.</p>

5. The fourth and last Instance is, <hi>Christ's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring amongst his Disciples, the doors being shut,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded <hi>John</hi> 20. 19, and 26. there the Disciples are said to be gathered together privately or secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for fear of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for which cause they lockt or bolted the doors with-inside, that no man might suddenly come upon them. But while they were in this privacy or closeness, Christ, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>suddenly</hi> presented himself in the midst of them, for all this closeness or secrecy, and not without a Miracle, supposing himself or some ministring An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to unlock or unbolt the door suddenly, and softly, <hi>sine strepitu,</hi> which upon this account would be more likely, in that if he had come in, the doors being still shut, that might have seemed as great an Argument to <hi>Thomas</hi> that he was a <hi>Spirit,</hi> as the feeling his Hands and Side that he was <hi>no Spirit.</hi> Wherefore, I conceive, it is no sufficiently firm Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis, that Christ entred among his Disciples, the doors in the mean time, at his very entrance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining shut. But suppose they were so, this will not prove his Body <hi>devoid</hi> of <hi>Extension,</hi> to be <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> of <hi>Place,</hi> and <hi>whole in every part,</hi> more than his passing the wicket of the Womb, like light through Crystal, did argue the same in the second Instance But the truth of the business will then be this, That he being then in his <hi>Resurrection-body</hi> (even that wherewith he was to ascend into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which yet he kept in its <hi>Terrestrial</hi> Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Organization, for those services it was to do amongst his Disciples while he conversed with them after his Resurrection upon Earth; as he made use of it in a particular manner to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

he pleased, Aerial, Aetherial, or Coelestial, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining still that <hi>Individual</hi> Body, that was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. This therefore might easily pass through the very Pores of the door, and much more easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the door and the side-posts there, without any inconvenience more than to other Spiritual Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. For the <hi>Resurrection-body</hi> is an Heavenly and Spiritual Body, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> himself expresly declares. But yet as truly a Body as any body else; that is, it hath <hi>impenetrable Trinal Dimension,</hi> is not without <hi>Place</hi> or <hi>Ubiety,</hi> nor <hi>whole</hi> in <hi>every part.</hi> This ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Story demonstrates all this, That his Body is not <hi>without Place.</hi> For it stood in the midst of the Room amongst his Disciples. Nor the <hi>whole in every part;</hi> For here is distinct menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ's Hand and his Side, as elsewhere of his Flesh and Bones, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 26. which would be all confounded, if every part were in every part. And if there be these distinct parts, then certainly his Body hath <hi>Extension,</hi> and this ingeniously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitated Distinction of the <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Manner of Existence</hi> of a body, can by no means cover the gross Repugnancies, which are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily imply'd in the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                  <hi>Real Body</hi> of Christ at once. But this, as being a Repugnancy, as was noted above, and Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the known inviolable and immutable Laws of <hi>Logick</hi> and humane Reason, is justly rejected by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for this very Reason, that it implies a Contradiction, that one and the same Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy should be <hi>Bread</hi> and the <hi>Real Body</hi> of Christ at once. Wherefore <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> containing, as has been proved, so many of such Contradictions, every jot as repugnant to the inviolable and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Laws of <hi>Logick,</hi> or humane Reason (that unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishable Lamp of the Lord in the Soul of man) as this of the same body being <hi>Real Bread</hi> and the <hi>Real Body</hi> of Christ at once: And there being no <hi>Salvo</hi> for these harsh Contradictions, but the pretence of a <hi>Supernatural Manner of Existence</hi> of a Body, which God is supposed to give to the Bread transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Body of Christ, that is, into the very <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual</hi> Body of Christ, they being supposed by <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> to become one and the same Body. I say this neat distinction of a <hi>Supernatural Manner of Existing</hi> being plainly demonstrated (so as it is by the <hi>Papist Represented,</hi> explained) not to be a mere <hi>Supernatural Manner of Existence,</hi> with which the <hi>being</hi> of a <hi>Body</hi> would yet consist, but a Counter-essential, Asystatal, and Repugnant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Existence, inconsistent with the <hi>being</hi> of a <hi>Body;</hi> and none of the Instances that are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as Pledges of the truth of the Notion or Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all reaching the present case, it is manifest that though there be a Real Presence of Christ's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Bloud in the Celebration of the Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, acknowledged as well by the Reformed as the Pontifician Party, that it is impossible that

The sincere Piety of our Predecessors in believing the Real Presence, and their unfortunateness afterwards in determining the mode by Transubstantiation or Consubstantiation.</p>

Which opinion of the Real Presence the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Meaux</hi> declares to be the Doctrine of all the Churches as well Reformed as Un-reformed; as I must confess I have been of that perswasion (ever since I writ my Mystery of Godliness) that it is the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that the Doctrine is true. And this I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I heard from a near Relation of mine when I was a Youth, a Reverend Dignitary of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that often, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Church was for the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> but for the manner thereof, if asked, he would answer, <hi>Rem scimus, Modum nescimus,</hi> We know the <hi>thing,</hi> but the <hi>mode</hi> or manner thereof we know not. And the assurance we have of the thing is from the common suffrage of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers, such as the above-cited place of our Homilies glances at, and from the Scripture it self, which impressed that Notion on the minds of our Pious Predecessors in the Church of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For I do verily believe that out of mere Devotion and sincere Piety, and out of a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend esteem they had of the solemnity of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, they embraced this Doctrine as well as broached it at the first. And if they had kept to the profession of it in general, without running into <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> or <hi>Consubstantiation,</hi> and had defined no further than the plain Scriptural Text in the sixth of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> and the suffrages of the Primitive Fathers had warranted them, <hi>viz.</hi> That there was a twofold Body and Blood
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41811:20"/>
of Christ, the one <hi>Natural,</hi> the other <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Divine,</hi> which we do really receive in the Holy Communion (within which limits I shall confine my self here without venturing into any farther curiosities) it had been more for the Peace and Honour of the Christian Church, and it might have prevented much scandal to them without, and much Cruelty and Persecution amongst our selves: The History of which is very horrid even to think of. But though there have been these Mistakes in declaring the Mode, yet the thing it self is not therefore to be abandoned, it being so great a Motive for a Reverend ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the Lord's Table, and duly celebrating the solemnity of the Holy Eucharist. Nor can we, as I humbly conceive, relinquish this Doctrine of the Real Presence of the Body and Blood of Christ, without the declining the most <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> sense of the Holy Scripture, as it stands writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the sixth Chapter of St. <hi>Iohn.</hi>

                  <hi>Iohn</hi> v. 54. <hi>Whoso eateth my Flesh and drinketh my Bloud hath Eternal Life.</hi> But every one that eateth the Bread transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated into the Body of Christ, that once hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cross, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, has not Eternal Life in him. Nay if that Souldier that pierced our Saviour's side and let out his Bloud with his Lance had drunk also thereof, and cut some piece of his flesh from his Body and eaten it, is any one so fond as to think, that he thereby would have been made Partaker of Eternal Life? But if Christ meant that Body or Flesh of his and not some other that is rightly also called his Flesh or Body, it would follow that that Souldier by doing that savage and inhumane act, would have obtained
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41811:23"/>
Everlasting Life. Wherefore it is plain from hence, that there is <hi>another</hi> Body or Flesh of Christ and <hi>another</hi> Blood, distinct from that Blood that was shed on the Cross, and from that Body that hung there, which our Saviour aims at in his Discourse.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Secondly, It is plain that our Saviour's Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course in that Chapter (he passing from that <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Food which he had lately procured for the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, to a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Eternal)</hi> has for its Object or Subject not the <hi>Manner</hi> or Way of receiving his Body and Blood, as if it were meant of that very Flesh and Blood on the Cross, but that it was to be received in a <hi>Spiritual Manner,</hi> which Interpreters, several of them, drive at; but the Object of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is his <hi>very Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood it self,</hi> to be taken (as the Fish and Loaves were wherewith he lately fed them) or it is <hi>himself</hi> in <hi>reference</hi> to this <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> which belongs to him as he is the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> and in this sense he says, <hi>He is the Bread of God that cometh down from Heaven and giveth Life to the World,</hi> v. 33. <hi>And</hi> v. 48. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>I am the Bread of Life,</hi> and speaking of the <hi>Manna</hi> he presently adds, <hi>Your Fathers ate Manna, and yet died, viz.</hi> the natural Death, the natural <hi>Manna</hi> being no Preservative against the natural Death. And <hi>v.</hi> 51. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>(Iohn</hi> 1.) or <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and this <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Life</hi> in the <hi>Divine Body.</hi> I am the living Bread coming down from Heaven (as the Manna is said to do, and to which <hi>Philo</hi> compares the <hi>Divine</hi> Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos) <hi>if any one eat of this Bread he shall live for ever.</hi> He speaks not of the <hi>manner</hi> of eating of it, but of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41811:23"/>
the <hi>Bread it self</hi> to be eaten, and yet immediately thereupon he calls <hi>this Bread</hi> his <hi>Flesh,</hi> which he says, <hi>he will give for the Life of the World,</hi> that is to the end that they may be enlivened thereby, he thus communicating to them his <hi>Divine</hi> Body and Spirit together. And then presently upon the <hi>Iews</hi> striving amongst themselves and saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? (the reason whereof was because they took him to be a <hi>meer</hi> man, and thought that Christ himself understood it of his <hi>humane Flesh)</hi> he affirms with greater earnestness and vehemency, <hi>Verily, verily, I say unto you, unless ye eat the Flesh of the Son of Man (viz.</hi> of the <hi>Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> who is the <hi>Logos</hi> incarnate) <hi>and drink his Bloud, ye have no Life in you. Whoso eateth my Flesh, and drinketh my Bloud hath Eternal Life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my Flesh is meat indeed, and my Bloud is drink indeed.</hi> And so all along to the very end of his Discourse, he speaks of a <hi>really eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Flesh,</hi> and <hi>drinking his Blood,</hi> not of the <hi>Manner</hi> of eating, as if it never came nigh them, but only they <hi>thought</hi> of <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> God knows how far distant from them, and so ate the <hi>humane</hi> Flesh of Christ by meer thinking of it, and drank his Bloud after the same <hi>imaginary</hi> Manner, which would, I think, be a very <hi>dilute</hi> and <hi>frigid</hi> sense of such high and fervid Asseverations of our Saviour, if the Mystery reached no farther than so.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But thirdly and lastly, That it does reach further than so, is exceeding evident from what our Saviour utters upon his Disciples being scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized at this strange Discourse of his, <hi>v.</hi> 61. <hi>When Iesus knew in himself, that his Disciples murmured at it, He said unto them, Does this offend you?

                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:41811:24"/>
                  <hi>you shall see the Son of man ascending where he was before,</hi> which he must needs understand of his <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> visible Body which he bore about with him, and which his humane Soul did actuate, and which was appropriated to his <hi>humane</hi> nature, which is <hi>finite</hi> and circumscribed. It is an <hi>Ellip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> speech of his, but thus naturally to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed as I have also noted above, as if he suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by an <hi>Aposiopesis</hi> this <hi>objurgatory</hi> sense insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereby. Will you then imagine so <hi>grosly</hi> as if I understood it of this very Flesh I bear about with me, when as this <hi>particular body</hi> of mine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my <hi>Ascension</hi> into Heaven will be removed at a <hi>vast distance</hi> from you. I tell you <hi>this Flesh of mine,</hi> as to this purpose I have all this time driven at, <hi>profiteth nothing,</hi> you cannot feed of it at such a distance if it were to be fed on.</p>
               <p>The Text runs thus, <hi>v.</hi> 63. <gap reason="foreign">

That we are to eat his Flesh and drink his Blood as we hope ever to have Eternal Life. 2. And his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41811:24"/>
his Flesh profiteth nothing, it is manifest that that distinction of <hi>Gratian</hi> is true, which he seems to have taken out of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> or some other ancient Father, who tells us the Flesh and Blood of Christ is twofold, the one <hi>natural</hi> and which he bore about with him and hung once on the Cross, the other <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Divine,</hi> which we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally eat and drink, that is <hi>really receive</hi> and draw in at the Celebrating the Holy <hi>Eucharist</hi> by a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, fervid and devotional Faith. And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there is a <hi>Real Presence</hi> of the Body and Blood of Christ in partaking of the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, whereby our Souls are nourished to Eternal, Life.</p>
               <p>And in that, he says, his <hi>natural</hi> Flesh profiteth nothing to this purpose (for it cannot be said that it profiteth nothing at all, since in vertue of the <hi>Crucifixion</hi> of that <hi>Flesh,</hi> and <hi>Effusion</hi> of that <hi>Blood</hi> on the Cross, we have the remission of our Sins) Christ plainly infers that he has (which cannot be well understood but as he is the <hi>Eternal Logos) another Flesh,</hi> viz. that <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Divine Flesh,</hi> which is mainly profitable for <hi>this</hi> purpose, for the maintaining, perfecting and renewing the <hi>inward man,</hi> that he may attain to his due growth in Christ.</p>
               <p>And lastly, How can Christ say his Flesh that was Crucified on the Cross <hi>profiteth nothing,</hi> when by being <hi>meditated upon</hi> at the solemnity of the Holy Eucharist, and also at other times, it may serve to kindle and inflame our Love and Devotion towards him, and so urge us to greater degrees of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> and <hi>Mortification,</hi> and <hi>serious Holiness;</hi> it therefore being useful and profitable for <hi>all this,</hi> I
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41811:25"/>
say, why does he then affirm <hi>it profiteth nothing,</hi> but that he does on purpose advertise us that it profiteth nothing <hi>as to the present case</hi> he has spoke to all this while, <hi>viz.</hi> to be the <hi>real meat</hi> and <hi>food</hi> of the <hi>inward man,</hi> and to be <hi>really received</hi> into him, to maintain and increase those <hi>Divine</hi> Principles in him out of which he is <hi>regenerated.</hi> This his <hi>particular Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> that hung on the Cross, cannot be profitable for, nor can be come at, at such a distance, to be taken in and received; which therefore plainly implies <hi>those other,</hi> which were mentioned above out of <hi>Gratian</hi> (the <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Spiritual</hi> Flesh and Blood of Christ only) to be properly useful to this purpose.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And for this Divine and Spiritual Flesh and Blood of our Saviour distinguished from his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; besides St. <hi>Hierome</hi> you have also the suffrage of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> in his <hi>Paedago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> lib. 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. The Blood of our Lord is twofold, the one carnal, by which we are redeemed from corruption; the other Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, wherewith we are anointed, and by vertue of drinking thereof we attain to incorruption. <gap reason="foreign">

1. THE Reader may haply think I have been over operose and copious in inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Distinction of <hi>Gratian</hi>'s, touching the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood of Christ in the Holy <hi>Eucharist.</hi> But the great usefulness thereof, I hope, may apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize for this my extraordinary diligence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry. For the Notion being both true and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable, and not at all clashing, so far as I can discern, with either the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> or <hi>right Reason</hi> and <hi>solid Philosophy,</hi> to say nothing of the Suffrage of the Primitive Fathers, but rather very agreeable and consentaneous to them all; and also having, as I said, its weighty usefulness, it was a point, I thought, that was worth my so seriously insisting upon; and as I have hitherto endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed faithfully to set out the <hi>Truth</hi> thereof, I shall now, though more briefly, intimate its <hi>Usefulness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And the first Usefulness is this, Whereas that Reverend Prelate the Bishop of <hi>Meaux</hi> tugs so hard to pull back again the Reformed Churches to the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,</hi> or rather <hi>Profession</hi> of theirs, that there is a <hi>Real Presence</hi> of the Body and Blood of Christ at the Celebration of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> to be received by the <hi>faithful,</hi> and that therefore they must return to the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> as if there were no other Mode of a <hi>Real Presence</hi> to be conceived but it: the force of this Inference is plainly taken away, by this Distinction that <hi>Gratian,</hi> one of their own Church, hath luckily hit upon, or rather taken out of some antient Father, and is more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made out in this Discourse, that there is a <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> and <hi>Divine Body</hi> of Christ, distinct from that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41811:26"/>
                  <hi>particular</hi> Body of his that hung on the Cross, which the faithful partake of in the Lord's Supper. Whence it is plain there is no need of <hi>Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> which is incumbred with such abundance of <hi>Impossibilities</hi> and Contradictions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Secondly, This Notion of ours is hugely ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable for the rectifying of the Doctrine of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation</hi> in the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Church, who are for an <hi>Ubiquity</hi> of the <hi>particular</hi> Body of Christ that hung on the Cross, which assuredly is a grand Mistake. But I believe in the Authors thereof there was a kind of <hi>Parturiency,</hi> and more confused <hi>Divination</hi> of that <hi>Truth,</hi> which we have so much insisted upon, and their Mistake consists only in this, that they attributed to the <hi>particular</hi> Body of Christ, which belongs to his <hi>restrained</hi> and circumscribed <hi>humane</hi> Nature, that which truly and only belongs to his <hi>Divine Body,</hi> as he is the <hi>Eternal Logos,</hi> in whom is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Logos,</hi> to which Spirit of <hi>his</hi> this Body belongs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is rightly called <hi>his Body,</hi> as appertaining to <hi>his</hi> Spirit. For this Body, this <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Flesh, as <hi>Gratian</hi> calls it, is every where present, though not to be received as the Food of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man,</hi> but only by the <hi>Faithful</hi> and <hi>Regenerate,</hi> so that according to this Notion there may be a <hi>Consubstantiation</hi> rightly interpreted, that is a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentiation,</hi> or rather <hi>Compresentiality</hi> of both the <hi>Real Bread and Wine,</hi> and the <hi>Real Body and Blood of Christ</hi> at once; so that they both may be <hi>really</hi> and <hi>indeed</hi> received by all true Believers. And <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theranism</hi> in this point thus candidly interpreted, will prove a sound and unexceptionable <hi>Doctrine.</hi> And I charitably believe the first Authors of it, if
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41811:27"/>
they had fully understood their own meaning, meant no more than so. And I wish I had as much reason to believe that the <hi>Pontificians</hi> meant no more by their <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> but a <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>fast hold</hi> of the <hi>Real Presence.</hi> I hope the most inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous of them at this time of the day mean no more than so, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are as well assured of the <hi>Real Presence</hi> of the Body and Blood of Christ to be received in the Celebration of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist;</hi> as if the very Bread was turned into his Body, and the Wine into his Blood by a miraculous <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Thirdly, It is from this Notion or Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the antient Fathers, as I hinted above, of the Body and Blood of Christ into Natural and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual or Divine, that we have ever been well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to give a more full and distinct account of the nature of the Solemnity of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> as it is celebrated in our Church, it plainly comprizing these two things. The first the <hi>Commemoration</hi> of the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> of the breaking his Body or Flesh, <hi>viz.</hi> the wounding thereof with Nails and Spears. The other, The partaking of the <hi>Divine Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ, by which our <hi>Inward Man</hi> is nourished to Eternal Life: which our <hi>eating</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> the <hi>Wine</hi> are Symbols of. Both which in our <hi>Communion-Service</hi> are plainly pointed at. The first fully, in the Exhortation to Communicants, where it is said, <hi>And above all things you must give most humble and hearty thanks to God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the World by the</hi> Death <hi>and</hi> Passion <hi>of our Saviour Christ, both God and Man, who did humble himself even to the</hi> Death upon the Cross <hi>for us mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:41811:27"/>
                  <hi>sinners</hi>—And to the end we should always remember the exceeding great love of our Master and only Saviour Jesus Christ thus dying for us, and the innumerable benefits, which by his <hi>precious Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shedding,</hi> he hath obtained to us, he has instituted and ordained Holy Mysteries as pledges of his Love, and for a continual remembrance of his <hi>Death.</hi> And in the Prayer of Consecration, the Celebration of the Eucharist is again said to be a <hi>continued</hi> or <hi>perpetuated Commemoration</hi> of Christ's <hi>precious Death</hi> till his coming again.</p>
               <p>But now for our receiving the <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> Body and Blood of Christ, such passages as these seem to intimate it. In the <hi>Exhortation</hi> to the <hi>Communicants,</hi> it is there said, if with a true penitent heart and lively faith we receive this Holy Sacrament, then we <hi>spiritually eat the flesh of Christ and drink his blood,</hi> then we <hi>dwell in Christ and Christ in us,</hi> we are <hi>one with Christ</hi> and <hi>Christ with us.</hi> This passage plainly points to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Discourse, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 56. where he says, <hi>He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me and I in him.</hi> And he thus dwelling in us, he enlivens us, we becoming <hi>one</hi> with <hi>Christ</hi> in a manner as the Soul and Body makes <hi>one,</hi> as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the next verse, <hi>As the living father has sent me, and I live by the father, so he that eateth me shall live by me,</hi> and so we become <hi>one with Christ</hi> and <hi>Christ with us,</hi> we living by Christ as he by his Father; that is to say, as Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lives by his Father, so we live by the Spirit of Christ dwelling in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. which <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Life</hi> of Christ always implies the <hi>Divine Body.</hi> As he that is joined unto the Lord in this Body is one Spirit,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41811:28"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. Now this Exhortation so plainly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding to this passage of our Saviour's Discourse, which speaks not of his <hi>particular</hi> natural Flesh, but of that which is his <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Divine</hi> Flesh, it is plain that the genuine sense of the <hi>Exhortation</hi> in this place is, that we <hi>really</hi> though <hi>spiritually</hi> (that is by a fervent and devotional Faith) eat or <hi>receive</hi> the <hi>real</hi> Body and Blood of Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Body and Blood of his above-mentioned. And this passage of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Discourse is again alluded to in the Prayer immediately before the Prayer of <hi>Consecration</hi> in these words, Grant us therefore, Gracious Lord, so to <hi>eat the Flesh</hi> of thy Dear Son Jesus Christ, and <hi>to drink his Blood</hi> that our sinful Bodies may be made clean by his Body, and our Souls washed through his most precious Blood, and that we may evermore <hi>dwell in him</hi> and <hi>he in us,</hi> John 6. 56. And these two places so plainly alluding to our Saviour's Discourse in the sixth of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Iohn,</hi> it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry easie and natural to conceive that what occurs in the <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> after our receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment does sound to the same purpose. Almighty and everlasting God, we most heartily thank thee for that thou dost vouchsafe to feed us who have duly received these Holy Mysteries, with the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Food</hi> of the most <hi>Precious Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of thy Son and our Saviour Jesus Christ—The words even of themselves do very naturally point at a <hi>real</hi> though <hi>spiritual</hi> partaking or <hi>receiving</hi> into us the Body and Blood of Christ, namely, of that Flesh and Blood which our Saviour discourses of, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. And therefore we may be much more assured that they do so, if we take notice, the sense
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41811:28"/>
is so back'd and strengthned by the other two Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages which do plainly relate to the Body, or Flesh and Blood Christ discourses of, in the sixth of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Gospel.</p>
               <p>I will only add one Consideration more, and that is from the Title of our <hi>Communion-Service.</hi> Can there be any more likely reason why the Lord's Supper is called THE HOLY COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MUNION, than that it refers to that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 16. <hi>The Cup of Blessing which we bless, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Christ? The Bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Christ? Because there is one Bread, we being many are one Body. For we are all partakers of that one Bread.</hi> Which is that Bread from Heaven, which our Saviour discourses of in the sixth of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> But the Words I have chiefly my Eye upon are those: The Cup being called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>Communion of the Blood,</hi> and the Bread, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>Communion of the Body</hi> of Christ; and the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in all likely hood, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the same sense that it had, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, where we are said to be called to the <hi>Participation</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> Communion here in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> must <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally</hi> imply our <hi>real</hi> receiving or <hi>partaking</hi> of the Body and Blood of Christ in the celebrating of this Holy Communion, and that by thus partaking of that <hi>one</hi> Divine Body and Blood of his, signified by the eating and drinking the Bread and Wine, we, though <hi>many,</hi> become <hi>one Body:</hi> not in a <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Sense</hi> only, but, if I may so speak, Divinely <hi>natural,</hi> we being made <hi>all</hi> Members of that <hi>one</hi> Universal <hi>Divine Body</hi> of Christ, as he is the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41811:29"/>
                  <hi>Logos,</hi> and so becoming <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, That Passage in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> does marvelous-fully set out the Nature of that part of the Lord's Supper, that is distinguished from the <hi>Commemoration</hi> of his <hi>Death;</hi> and gives the most genuine Reason of its being called the <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> it implying the <hi>real Communication of</hi> that <hi>one</hi> Divine Body of Christ to the faithful, and their <hi>real Union</hi> thereby with Christ and with one another, which is a full and perfect Holy Communion indeed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fourthly, This Notion of the Fathers touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Divine</hi> Body and Blood of Christ, affords us a very easie and natural Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of that Passage in our <hi>Church-Catechism,</hi> touching the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, where to the Question, <hi>What is the inward part, or thing signified?</hi> It is answered, The Body and Blood of Christ which are <hi>verily</hi> and <hi>indeed</hi> taken and received by the faithful in the Lord's Supper. In the Answer to a former Question, <hi>Why was the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord's Supper ordained?</hi> it is answered, For a continual Remembrance of the Sacrifice of the <hi>Death</hi> of Christ, and the <hi>Benefits</hi> received thereby. <hi>One</hi> eminent benefit whereof is the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of our sins</hi> through the <hi>Bloud</hi> of Christ shed on the Cross, for without blood there is no Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; the <hi>other</hi> is the <hi>feeding</hi> of the <hi>Regenerate</hi> Soul, or <hi>Inward man,</hi> by the <hi>Real,</hi> but <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Divine Body</hi> and Blood of Christ, which contains in it our through <hi>Sanctification,</hi> which is also a fruit or benefit of the Sacrifice of the <hi>Death</hi> of Christ, forasmuch as we had not been capable of Regeneration and of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41811:29"/>
growth and degrees of Sanctification by the feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on and <hi>really</hi> receiving the <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> Body of Christ, without our <hi>Reconciliation</hi> by his Blood shed on the Cross, which our Church here calls the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Death</hi> of Christ.</p>
               <p>Now as in <hi>this</hi> Answer there is contained that great Benefit of the <hi>Remission of our Sins</hi> in the Blood of Christ, and thereby of our <hi>Reconciliation</hi> to God; so in the Answer <hi>mentioned before</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that singular Benefit of <hi>perfecting</hi> our <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> by the nourishing and corroborating our <hi>inward man</hi> by eating or partaking of the <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Divine</hi> Body and Blood of our Saviour, which are <hi>verily</hi> and <hi>indeed</hi> taken and received by the faithful in the Lord's Supper. [Verily] that is to say, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>truly,</hi> in counterdistinction to <hi>Typically,</hi> or Symbolically, the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> being but <hi>Types</hi> or Symbols of this. Touching which in the Answer to the Question, <hi>What are the Benefits whereof we are made partakers thereby?</hi> it is said, <hi>The strengthening and refreshing our Souls by the Body and Blood of Christ, as our Bodies are by the Bread and Wine,</hi> viz. which are but <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>true,</hi> spiritual or <hi>Divine</hi> Body and Blood of Christ, but they have a very handsome Analogy the one to the other. But we proceed to the following words, [And indeed] that is to say, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>reverâ,</hi> or <hi>really,</hi> not as one scoptically would make us to profess, that this <hi>real</hi> participation of the Body and Blood of Christ, has no <hi>reality</hi> any where but in our <hi>phancy,</hi> which we call <hi>Faith.</hi> To which sense the Translator of the <hi>peaceable method for the re-uniting Protestants and Catholicks,</hi> speaks in his <hi>Preface</hi> to his <hi>Translation.</hi> To which exception,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41811:30"/>
this Notion of the Primitive Fathers, according to which our Communion-Service is framed, and our Homilies allude to, and we so much insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is not lyable. [By the Faithful] and that <hi>only</hi> by them, which Body and Blood the <hi>Faithful</hi> do not receive by champing it with their Teeth, and swallowing it down their Throat. But by a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid and living devotional <hi>Faith</hi> more than ordinarily kindled at the Celebrating the Holy Eucharist, they draw this <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Celestial</hi> Food (the true <hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven) into their Hearts, whereby their <hi>inward Man</hi> is fed and strengthened, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished up to Eternal Life, and so the <hi>New Birth</hi> getting growth daily, arrives at last to the due measure of the stature of Christ.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This is the Priviledge of the <hi>faithful</hi> Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. But for those that are devoid of this <hi>true</hi> and living <hi>Faith,</hi> though the <hi>Divine</hi> Body and Blood of Christ is every where present to the faithful, yet they who are <hi>unregenerate,</hi> and consequently devoid of the Divine Life, are capable of no union therewith, nor of any growth or strength therefrom. But it is like the light shining into a <hi>dead</hi> man's eye, of which there is no <hi>vital</hi> effect. But for those who are <hi>regenerate,</hi> and consequently have a <hi>real</hi> hunger and thirst after the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of God, though the great Feast upon this Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Food is more especially and copiosely injoyed in the Celebration of the Holy <hi>Eucharist,</hi> yet they may in some good measure draw it in day by day by Faith and Devotion, as without the <hi>Presence</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> we may at any time <hi>devotionally</hi> think of the Sacrifice of the Death of our Saviour. But certainly this solemn Institution of Celebrating
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41811:30"/>
his last Supper, being particularly and earnestly injoyn'd us by <hi>Christ,</hi> if we conscientiously ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the same, it will have a more than ordinary efficacy in us for the ends it was appointed.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Sixthly and lastly, as those words of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism</hi> [the Body and Blood of Christ which are <hi>verily</hi> and <hi>indeed</hi> taken and received, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> have, considered in themselves, a very easie and natural sense so explained, as we have according to the Analogy of the Doctrine of the Primitive Fathers and our Church's Homilies that allude to them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained them; so do they not at all clash with those words of the <hi>Rubrick</hi> affixed at the end of the <hi>Communion-Service,</hi> where it is affirmed, That the Sacramental Bread and Wine remains still in their very <hi>natural</hi> substances, and therefore may not be adored (for that were Idolatry to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred of all faithful Christians) and the <hi>natural</hi> Body and Blood of our Saviour Christ are in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>not here,</hi> it being against the <hi>truth</hi> of Christ's <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Body to be at one time in more places than one. There is I say, in this, no contradiction to what occcurs in the <hi>Catechism,</hi> which affirms that there is a <hi>Real Presence</hi> of the Body and Blood of Christ, which are <hi>verily</hi> and <hi>indeed</hi> taken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Faithful in the Lord's Supper, though here a <hi>Real Presence</hi> is denyed of the <hi>natural</hi> Body of Christ. But it is to be considered that this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation and Negation is not of the same Body of Christ, and therefore can be no <hi>contradiction,</hi> and further to be observed, how the very <hi>Rubrick</hi> sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests to us this distinction of the <hi>Natural</hi> Body of Christ (which is appropriated to his <hi>particular</hi> Soul, and which hung on the Cross and was Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified)
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41811:31"/>
and his <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Spiritual</hi> Body, the Body of the <hi>Essential Life</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Eternal <hi>Logos,</hi> and therefore rightly termed the Body of the <hi>Logos</hi> incarnate, or of Christ.</p>
               <p>And therefore when passages of the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the Primitive Times before the degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Church came in, may some of them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a <hi>Real Absence,</hi> other a <hi>Real Presence</hi> of the Body and Blood of Christ according as different places of the Scripture might occur to their minds touching this matter, the controversy might well be composed by distinguishing betwixt the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Body of Christ and his <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Spiritual</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. According to the former whereof is the <hi>Real Absence,</hi> according to the latter the <hi>Real Presence</hi> of Christ's Body and Blood, to be received by the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Celebration of the Holy Eucharist.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. I HAVE, I hope by this time, sufficiently proposed and confirmed both the Truth and Usefulness of the distinction of the Body and Blood of Christ (which occurs in the Primitive Fathers) into Natural, and Spiritual or Divine. From whence it may plainly appear to any pious and uprejudiced Reader, that the Inference of a <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> of the Bread and Wine into the <hi>Real Body</hi> and Blood of Christ, from a <hi>Real Presence</hi> of them in the Lord's Supper, is very weak and invalid. Which Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> (as well as the Bishop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> formerly Bishop of <hi>Condom)</hi> though he take special notice of in his <hi>Peaceable Method, viz.</hi> that this <hi>Real Presence</hi> of the Body and Blood of Christ in the Lord's Supper, is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41811:32"/>
acknowledged by the Protestants, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. whom he will have to hold, <hi>That the Sacrament is not a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure or empty Sign without Efficacy,</hi> but they do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, saith he, that it does communicate unto us in a most <hi>real</hi> and <hi>effectual</hi> Manner, the <hi>Body</hi> of Jesus Christ to be the <hi>Food</hi> of our Souls; And he will have Monsieur <hi>Claud</hi> himself acknowledge, that before this Novelty of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, every one believed that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is <hi>present</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> that his Body and Blood are there <hi>truly</hi> received by the faithful; yet he is so wise and cautious as not to trust to the strength of this Engine for the pulling us back into a belief and profession of that incredible Hypothesis, but according to the Fineness of his wit, has spread a more large Net to catch us in and carry us captive, not only into this gross Errour of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> but into all other Errours which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has broached, or may hereafter broach and propose as <hi>Articles of Faith.</hi> And therefore it is a point worth our closest consideration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His general <hi>Maxim</hi> is this, That that Church in which are found two Parties concerned, has ever had the power to determine all differences, and to declare that as <hi>matter of Faith,</hi> which before there was no obligation to believe, and that we are bound to acquiesce in her Decisions, under Penalty of being <hi>Schismaticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Church her declaring as <hi>matter of Faith</hi> (which seems to sound so harshly) he does not mean, That the Church has Authority to frame <hi>New Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith, (pag.</hi> 17.) but that She is to act according to a <hi>Rule,</hi> which is <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Tradition</hi> truly and purely <hi>Apostolical,</hi> from
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41811:32"/>
which we have also received the Holy Scripture it self. And <hi>(page</hi> 18.) The Church never did make, and undoubtedly never will make any <hi>New Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> since it is not in her power to define any thing but according to the <hi>Word of God,</hi> which she is always to consult with, as with her <hi>Oracle,</hi> and the <hi>Rule</hi> she is bound to follow.</p>
               <p>His meaning therefore must be this, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those plain and Universally known Articles of the Christian Faith, and acknowledged from the very beginning of Christianity, such as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised in the Apostles Creed, there have been, and may be other Articles of Faith more obscurely and uncertainly delivered in Scripture, which, until the Church in a lawful Synod or Council has deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the sense of those places of Scripture that appertain to the Controversie, men have no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to believe, but go for the present, for but uncertain and indifferent Opinions. But when once the true Church, in which the Parties differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Opinion are, and her lawful <hi>Representative</hi> assisted by the Holy Ghost, (as is affirmed <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 28.) a <hi>Canonical</hi> Assembly, which alone has full Power and Sovereign Authority to say juridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally <hi>(Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 27.) <hi>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us,</hi> has given definitive Sentence touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Controversie, that which before was but an <hi>indifferent Opinion,</hi> becomes now <hi>Matter of Faith,</hi> and is to be received as an <hi>Article of Faith</hi> by the Dissenting Party, upon penalty of being <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks</hi> and <hi>Hereticks.</hi> This I conceive to be his precise meaning.</p>
               <p>But the great Artifice of all is, That he will have this meaning of his to be the <hi>general</hi> Opinion
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41811:33"/>
also of the Protestant Churches. Who can, says he, <hi>(page</hi> 27.) question, but the Protestant Churches of <hi>England, France, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Switzerland</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries</hi> do hold as a Fundamental <hi>Maxim,</hi> that in such Controversies as do arise concerning Doctrine in Matters of Religion, the true Church of which the Dissenting Parties are Members, has full and sovereign power to declare according to the Word of God, <hi>what is of Faith,</hi> and that there is an Obligation of standing to her Decrees, under pain of being <hi>Schismaticks.</hi> And <hi>(page</hi> 35.) I demand, saith he, nothing more for the present: I will content my self with what themselves do grant; That that Church of which the Parties contesting are Members, (be she <hi>fallible</hi> or <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)</hi> has full power to decide Differences, and her Decrees do oblige under the Penalty of being <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Now from this general <hi>Maxim</hi> granted, as he conceives, on both sides, and which he does chiefly endeavour to prove from the carriage of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> toward the <hi>Arminians</hi> (all which things to repeat here would be too moliminous and inconsistent with the Brevity I intend, a full An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi>'s <hi>Method</hi> requiring some more able Pen) he declining, I say, all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute touching the <hi>Merit</hi> of the Cause, the point of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> he would hence draw us in, to the imbracing that Doctrine merely because we were once of that Church that has <hi>Synodically</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined for it, and consequently reconcile us to all the rest of the Errours of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But that we may not so easily be taken in this <hi>Net,</hi> or pulled in by this <hi>Engine,</hi> we will first examine
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41811:33"/>
the <hi>Supposals</hi> that support the strength of it, or of which it does consist.</p>
               <p>The first and chiefest whereof is, That such Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods to whose definitive sentence he would have us stand, are assisted by the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>The second, That whether they be or be not, we are to stand to their determination.</p>
               <p>The third, Whatever Matters of <hi>Opinion</hi> (as they are for the present but such) are decided by such a <hi>Synod,</hi> pass into <hi>Articles of Faith</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth, That those that will not close with these Decisions be they what they will, they are guilty of <hi>Schism,</hi> as being bound to assent.</p>
               <p>The fifth, That these decisive <hi>Synods</hi> or Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, are to decide according to the Rule of the Word of God.</p>
               <p>The sixth and last, That both the Protestants and Papists are agreed in all these.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now before I examine these <hi>Particulars,</hi> these <hi>Supposals, Parts</hi> or <hi>Props</hi> of his general <hi>Maxim,</hi> by which he would draw the Protestants again into the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and make them embrace <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and all other Superstitions and Errours which they have <hi>Synodically</hi> decided <hi>for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith:</hi> I will, following the very method of this shrewd Writer, propose not only <hi>one</hi> Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime, but <hi>several Maximes,</hi> wherein both the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> and <hi>We,</hi> and indeed all mankind are agreed in, and which therefore I will instead of <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes</hi> call <hi>Common Notions,</hi> in allusion to those of <hi>Euclid.</hi> And the first shall be this,</p>
               <p n="1">I. That which in it self is false, no declaring or saying it is true can make it true.</p>

               <p n="5">5. Certainly all the World as well <hi>Papists</hi> as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi> as soon as they do but conceive the meaning of the Terms, will assent to the Truth of these Propositions at the very first sight; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore has made me call them <hi>Common Notions.</hi> Let us now apply our selves to the use of them in the examining the strength of Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi>'s general <hi>Maxime,</hi> wherein he will have the Papists and Protestants agreed.</p>
               <p>The first Prop thereof is, That the <hi>true</hi> Church is <hi>infallible</hi> by the promise made to her of being <hi>assisted by the Holy Ghost.</hi> But here I demand whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this promise be made to the <hi>Universal</hi> Church or any <hi>Particular</hi> Church or Churches throughout all Ages. That it is not made to the <hi>Universal</hi> Church <hi>throughout all Ages,</hi> is plain, in that the parts thereof have been and are still divided in several <hi>matters of Faith.</hi> That no such promise is made to any <hi>Particular</hi> Church or Churches, is plain from hence, that <hi>these</hi> Churches <hi>are not named</hi> in any part of the Scripture; which omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is incredible if there had been any such entail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Infallibility</hi> upon any <hi>Particular</hi> Church or Churches. But of all Churches, I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, it is <hi>impossible</hi> it should be the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> unless it be possible that all those <hi>Common Notions</hi> which I have set down, and in which all the World, even the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her self, if they will speak their Consciences, are agreed in, be false, which they must be if <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> be true. And therefore let any man judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41811:35"/>
is themore likely, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> should be false or those <hi>Common Notions</hi> not true.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Again, How does it appear that this promise of the assistance of the Holy Ghost is not <hi>conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal?</hi> Indeed Christ says, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 13. <hi>When the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth, viz.</hi> the same spirit that is promised, <hi>chap.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16, 17. But the words of this pretended <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of <hi>Infallibility</hi> are there set down more fully: <hi>If you love me keep my commandments; And I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you for ever, even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive</hi>—The promise of the assistance of the Holy Ghost for the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly concluding what is true, even from the words of this pretended <hi>Charter</hi> of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> is <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,</hi> that is to say, if they so <hi>love</hi> Christ as to <hi>keep his commandments,</hi> and become not worldly and carnal (for the World cannot receive this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of truth) then this spirit which leadeth into all truth shall assist them. Wherefore as many as Christ sends this <hi>infallible</hi> spirit to, he <hi>first</hi> fits them for it by <hi>mortifying</hi> the <hi>spirit</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> in them, and making them <hi>members</hi> of his <hi>truly Holy</hi> Church; for the calling themselves <hi>Holy Church,</hi> makes them never a jot the more Holy, if they really be not so, by the first common Notion.</p>
               <p>And besides, If the Words of this <hi>Charter</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> had not been so express, yet in common sense and reason this condition would necessarily have been understood. Forasmuch as nothing can be more absurd than to imagine the <hi>Assistance</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to be so <hi>cheap</hi> and <hi>trivial</hi> a thing, as to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41811:36"/>
be procured for the concluding Controversies arising or set on foot in the Church, which are needless and frivolous, or more for satisfying <hi>Curiosity</hi> than <hi>Edification,</hi> and which tend to <hi>Division,</hi> and tearing the Church violently into parts, which was <hi>one</hi> before and in a <hi>salvable</hi> condition without this Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> confesses himself: Or that the Holy Ghost will <hi>assist</hi> such <hi>Assemblies</hi> as are <hi>worldly</hi> and <hi>carnally</hi> minded, and are called to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude for the <hi>worldly</hi> Advantage and Interest of a worldly Polity, who for the upholding and increasing their <hi>Temporal</hi> Empire (whereby they Lord it over the World, and ride on the necks of Kings and Princes) call themselves <hi>Spiritual.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly when all Christian Truth tends to real and indispensable Holiness, if mankind were not left to the liberty of their own Will, but Christ would have them so <hi>infallibly</hi> wise, he would all along have prepared them for it, by making them unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionably Holy, that they might become wise in his own Way and Method</p>
               <p n="7">7. And lastly, There being <hi>Predictions</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalpyse</hi> of an <hi>Antichristian</hi> State in the Church to come (in which there will be such a general Apostasie from the Apostolick Purity) even according to their own Interpreters, I demand what assurance we have that these Times came not (in a very great measure) upon the Church, some hundreds of Years before <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> was concluded on by the Roman Church, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must much invalidate the pretence of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of any such Councils. And our Church of <hi>England,</hi> as all know, in her <hi>Homilies,</hi> whether by <hi>inspiration</hi> or by <hi>mere</hi> solid <hi>Reason</hi> and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41811:36"/>
refers the vision of the seventeenth Chapter of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And, I hope, to any unprejudiced Reader, that has lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to examine things, I have even demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively made out that truth in my <hi>Exposition</hi> of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> and most punctually and distinctly of all in my <hi>Ioint-Exposition</hi> of the thirteenth and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth Chapters thereof, <hi>Synops. Prophet.</hi> Book 1. Chap. 11, 12, 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the <hi>preparatory</hi> Chapters thereto. Let any one read them that please, and in the due fear of God consider them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, to conclude, touching this first Prop of his general <hi>Maxim,</hi> whereby he would insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate that <hi>Synods,</hi> to whose definitive Sentence he would have us to stand, are <hi>assisted</hi> by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> it does not only not underprop, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his grand <hi>Maxim.</hi> Forasmuch as we have no assurance that those <hi>Roman</hi> Councils which have concluded for <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> were assisted by the Holy Ghost, but rather quite contrary.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The second <hi>Prop</hi> is, That whether a Synod be or be not assisted by the Holy Ghost, we are to stand to their determination. If the <hi>Synod</hi> be not assisted by the Holy Ghost then they are <hi>fallible,</hi> and may be in the wrong: so that the sense is, whether the <hi>Synod</hi> determine <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong,</hi> yet we are to stand to their determination. Which as odly as it sounds, yet in some sober sense, I must confess ingenuously, for ought I know, may be true, that is, in such things as are <hi>really disputable,</hi> and which for no sinister base design, but merely for the peace of the Church and Her Edification, it has been thought fit to make a <hi>Synodical</hi> Decision of the Controversie. But is this colour enough
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41811:37"/>
for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Determination to be stood to? Of making the Bread in the Sacrament to be <hi>transubstantiated</hi> into the very Body of Christ that hung on the Cross at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (and has ever since his Ascension been in Heaven) by the Priest's saying over it, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> the Bread still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Bread to all outward appearance, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, so that Christ is fain to be at the expence of a perpetual Miracle to make the <hi>transubstantiated</hi> Bread look <hi>like</hi> Bread still, though it be <hi>really</hi> the Body of Christ that hung on the Cross at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> Which, as I have noted above, is against his Wisdom and Goodness, in that, if <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> be a true Article of the Christian Faith, this is the most effectual way imaginable to make men, if left to their own free thought, <hi>to mis-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it,</hi> however force and cruelty might constrain them to <hi>profess</hi> it: And so it is against <hi>his Goodness,</hi> to expose so great a part of his Church to such bloody Persecutions as this Article has occasioned in the Christian World. That Christ should do a perpetual Miracle not that will confirm mens Faith, but subvert it, not to edifie his Church but distract it, and lay all in confusion and blood! Let any one consider how likely this is to be.</p>
               <p>This therefore could never be a point, <hi>bonâ fide,</hi> disputable, but to such as were horribly hoodwinkt with prejudice, and blinded with a desire of having a thing concluded by the Church which was of such unspeakable advantage, as they then thought, for the <hi>magnifying</hi> the <hi>Priest-hood,</hi> though I believe nothing will turn more to their Disrepute and shame in the conclusion. Now I dare appeal to Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> himself, whether we are to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41811:37"/>
stand to the Determination of a <hi>fallible</hi> Synod in a <hi>Point,</hi> that, besides what I have already hinted, <hi>contradicts</hi> all those <hi>Common Notions,</hi> which I have above recited, and in which all mankind are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed. And such is this point of <hi>Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Now for the third <hi>Prop,</hi> That whatever Matters of <hi>Opinion</hi> (as they are for the present but such) are decided by such a Synod, pass into <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> of <hi>Faith;</hi> this <hi>Prop</hi> is also really a puller down of this general <hi>Maxim.</hi> For by an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> must be meant such an Article as after the <hi>synodical</hi> Decision, is necessary to be believed by all Parties up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of Damnation But to this I answer, first, No <hi>Falshood</hi> can be an <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> nor can what is in it self false, by all the declaring in the World that it is true, become true, by the first <hi>Common Notion.</hi> And secondly, Since the whole Church before, in which arose the Controversie, were in a <hi>salvable</hi> Condition, how Unchristian an act must this be, to put so many thousand Souls in the State of Damnation, by so <hi>unnecessary,</hi> nay <hi>mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi> a synodical Decision! And therefore what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence can there be to the <hi>Assistance</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> which Christ has promised his Church, when they machinate that, which so manifestly tends, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the <hi>Synod</hi> acknowledges, to the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of such a multitude of Souls, which before the Decision were in a salvable Condition, and also to most <hi>barbarous Persecutions</hi> of their <hi>Persons,</hi> as it is notoriously known in History, touching <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. The fourth <hi>Prop</hi> charges those with the guilt of Schism and Heresie that will not close
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41811:38"/>
with the above-said <hi>Synodical Decisions,</hi> be they what they will. In which matter we cannot judge whether the charge be right, unless we first understand what is truly and properly <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Schism.</hi> The former whereof I demand what it can be, but a dissent from the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in those things in it, that are <hi>Apostolical.</hi> For whatever <hi>National</hi> Church is found to have <hi>all</hi> and <hi>nothing</hi> else in it but what is <hi>Apostolical,</hi> or not <hi>inconsistent</hi> with the Apostolical Doctrine and Practice, is most assuredly one part of that <hi>one Catholick</hi> and <hi>Apostolick</hi> Church, which we profess our Belief of in our <hi>Creed.</hi> And for the latter it can be nothing else but a separation from the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Church, or from any Church that is part thereof, even then, when she approves her self to be <hi>Catholick,</hi> that is to say even then, when she is <hi>Apostolick,</hi> or, though she be Apostolick, and offers no opinions or usages but such as are conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the usages and Doctrines of Christ and his Apostles, or have no repugnancy thereto. To se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the Church in such circumstances as these, certainly is that great Crime of <hi>Schism;</hi> but to separate from that part of the Church which imposes opinions and practices plainly <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant</hi> to the Precepts of Christ and his Apostles, this is no <hi>Schism</hi> but <hi>Union</hi> with the <hi>truly antient</hi> Catholick and Apostolick Church. And the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring it <hi>Schism</hi> does not, nor can make it so, by <hi>Common Notion</hi> the first.. And if it were <hi>Schism</hi> to separate from such a Church as propounds things repugnant to the Precepts of Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, the guilt of this <hi>Schism</hi> is not upon them that thus separate, but upon those that impose such <hi>Anti-Apostolical</hi> matters.</p>

11. The fifth <hi>Prop,</hi> That these <hi>decisive Synods</hi> or <hi>Assemblies</hi> are to <hi>decide</hi> according to the <hi>Rule</hi> of the <hi>Word of God,</hi> the strength of this Prop he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours more fully to display <hi>pag.</hi> 34. and he calls upon the Brethren of the Reformed Churches to reflect seriously upon these two Propositions he sets down.</p>
               <p>The first is, That as the Word of God is <hi>infallible</hi> in it self, so certainly the judgment of him who truly judges according to this <hi>Rule</hi> is also <hi>infallible:</hi> And consequently they are obliged to believe, That the Church when she judges according to <hi>this Rule</hi> or the Word of God, does not only not err, but that she also cannot err.</p>
               <p>The second, That they [the Reformed] are bound [as well as we the Romanists] to believe that the Church of God deciding <hi>Controversies</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> does judge according to the <hi>true</hi> sense of the <hi>word</hi> of God: Because upon the matter it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this <hi>very sense</hi> that she gives judgment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Parties, who give it a <hi>different sense,</hi> and who are obliged in Conscience to submit to her judgment, under pain of being <hi>Schismaticks</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as their Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> has positively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The first of these Propositions may pass for firm and sound, provided that the meaning of <hi>her judging according to this rule</hi> is the <hi>giving the right and genuine sense thereof:</hi> Of which she can neither assure her self nor any one else, but by being assured of that <hi>Holiness, Integrity,</hi> and <hi>single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of Heart, in those of the <hi>Synod,</hi> that makes them capable of the <hi>Assistance</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> and also that their <hi>Decision</hi> clashes not with those
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41811:39"/>
                  <hi>indeleble</hi> Notions in the Humane Soul, that are <hi>previous Requisites</hi> for the understanding the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>not only</hi> the Holy Scriptures, but of <hi>any writing</hi> whatever. And <hi>unto which</hi> if they find any thing in the <hi>letter</hi> of the Sacred Writ <hi>repugnant,</hi> they may be sure it is a <hi>Symbolical</hi> or <hi>Figurative</hi> Speech, but in <hi>other writings,</hi> that it is either a <hi>Figurative Speech</hi> or <hi>Nonsense.</hi> He that has not this <hi>previous</hi> furniture, or makes <hi>no use</hi> of it, it is impossible he should prove a safe judgeof the sense of Scripture. And if he runs <hi>Counter</hi> to what is <hi>certainly true,</hi> it is evident his Interpretation is <hi>false</hi> by the second <hi>Common Notion,</hi> and that he is not inspired by <hi>Common Notion</hi> the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth.</p>
               <p>Touching the second Proposition, I demand how any can be bound to stand to the judgment of any <hi>Synod,</hi> if they decline the <hi>previous Requisites,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it is <hi>impossible</hi> to understand the right meaning of <hi>any writing whatsoever;</hi> and whether their pretending to judge <hi>according to a Rule,</hi> does not imply, that there are some <hi>Common Principles,</hi> in which <hi>all Parties</hi> are agreed in, according to which, though they cannot discern that the Synod has certainly defined right, yet if the <hi>Synod</hi> run <hi>Counter</hi> to them, they may be sure they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined wrong, touching the <hi>very sense</hi> controverted between the <hi>Parties.</hi> Their professing they judge according to the <hi>Rule,</hi> implies the Rule is in some measure known to all that are concerned. Nor does it at all follow, because the <hi>Object</hi> of their <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision</hi> is the <hi>very sense</hi> controverted between the <hi>Parties,</hi> that the <hi>Synod</hi> may give what judgment she will, break all Laws of <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>Syntax</hi>

in the expounding the Text, much less contradict those Rules which are <hi>infinitely more Sacred,</hi> and inviolable, the <hi>Common Notions</hi> which God has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed <hi>essentially</hi> on the Humane Understanding. If such a violence be used by any Interpreters of Scripture, neither the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort,</hi> nor any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church, has or will declare, That under pain of being <hi>Schismaticks</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> they are obliged in Conscience to submit to their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

AND yet the sixth and last <hi>Prop</hi> of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Maxime</hi> implies as much, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, That both the <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in <hi>all</hi> the <hi>five</hi> foregoing <hi>Supposals,</hi> or to speak more compendiously in that his general <hi>Maxime.</hi> That that Church in which are found the two Parties concerned, has ever had the power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine all differences, and to declare that as <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Faith,</hi> which <hi>before</hi> there was <hi>no obligation</hi> to <hi>believe,</hi> and that we are bound to aquiesce in their decisions under the penalty of being <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I demand here of Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg,</hi> whether he will have his <hi>Maxime</hi> understood in a full latitude of sense, and that <hi>immediately</hi> without recourse to <hi>any Principles</hi> in which the <hi>Synod</hi> and the <hi>Parties</hi> are <hi>agreed,</hi> and Counter to which, if any determination be made it is null, such as <hi>Grammatical Syntax</hi> and <hi>Lexicographical</hi> sense of Words; and (which are Laws infinitely more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and inviolable) the <hi>Common Notions</hi> (as I said before) <hi>essentially</hi> imprinted on the Soul of man, either of <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Morality,</hi> whether without being bounded by these, the <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches as well as the <hi>Pontifician</hi> are agreed, that we are to stand to the Determination of a <hi>Synod,</hi> under the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of being <hi>Schismaticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As for example, If a <hi>Synod</hi> should interpret, <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> of the Clergy <hi>only,</hi> and declare it does not reach the <hi>Laity,</hi> though the Apostles and Primitive Church understood it did: If not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

they should by some distinction or evasion conclude it lawful. If when as it is said, Thou shalt not make to thy self any graven Image to worship and fall down before it, they should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish and restrain it only to the graven Images of the <hi>Heathen Gods.</hi> If when as it is said, Thou shalt have no other Gods but me, they should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish Gods into <hi>Supream</hi> and <hi>Subordinate,</hi> and declare, we may have many <hi>Subordinate</hi> Gods, but only <hi>One Supream.</hi> If when as it said, Honour thy Father and thy Mother, they should restrain it to a <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Mother</hi> of the <hi>same Religion</hi> with our selves, whether <hi>Political</hi> Father or <hi>Natural,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we are free from this Command, and may despise both our <hi>Natural</hi> Parents and our <hi>Prince,</hi> if they be not of the same perswasion with our selves. And whereas it is said, Thou shalt not commit Adultery, if they should understand it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of such an Adultery as is committed for the <hi>mere pleasure</hi> of the Flesh, <hi>not</hi> for the <hi>health</hi> of the Body, or assisting the <hi>Conjugal Impotency</hi> of his Neighbour. If the Commandment against Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Killing an Innocent Person, they should restrain to Murther that is accompanied with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in <hi>Cruelty,</hi> not that which is committed to raise a <hi>livelyhood,</hi> or secure an <hi>Interest</hi> the Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer has espoused. If the Commandment against <hi>Stealing,</hi> they should restrain to such Theft as is against Men of our Religion and Perswasion, but that we may rob and steal from others without sin. And according to the same tenour they should interpret, Thou shall not bear false witness against thy Neighbour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I demand, I say, whether Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> does conceive, that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:41811:41"/>
nay, or his own Party, are agreed that all such determinations are to be submitted to upon penalty of being <hi>Schismaticks.</hi> Let him ask the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches if they be thus agreed, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let him ask his own Conscience, if he think they are. Wherefore it is plain, that what he produces out of the History of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> reaches not the point that he drives at, that is to say, That it is acknowledged by them, that after a Synod has decided the Controversie, or given the sense of places of Scripture controverted, be it what it will be, the Decision is to be stood to, under penalty of being <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> and that there are not some commonly known Truths, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notions of Reason and Morality, with which if the determination of a <hi>Synod</hi> does clash, it is <hi>ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so facto</hi> null, and a demonstration that the Spirit of God did not assist.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I observe farther, That all the Citations that are produced either by Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> himself, or his <hi>Translator,</hi> in his <hi>Preface</hi> and <hi>Appendix,</hi> will not amount to the Protestants professing that every Controversie or controverted Opinion, after the <hi>Decision</hi> of the <hi>Synod,</hi> passes into an <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> which properly signifies such a Doctrine, as without the Belief of which, when it is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, he that mis-believes it forfeits his Salvation; for hereby the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> had damned all the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches. For my own part I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that in points that are so obscure, intricate, and abstruse, and which, as touching the main part of them, have exercised and much baffled hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane understanding through all Ages, it had been a great piece of Christian Prudence for that <hi>Synod</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:41811:41"/>
to have made Decrees against all bitterness of speech of the disagreeing Parties one against another, and to have admonished them that they were bound, notwithstanding their difference of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to live in mutual Love one to another, which is the true Badge of Christ's genuine Disciples, rather than to have exasperated one Party against another, by making that Doctrine <hi>Authentick,</hi> which is really in it self from places of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> so <hi>intricate</hi> and <hi>disputable.</hi> But it seems to have been the sleight of Satan for the weakning the Reformed Churches that drove them to it. But I must say, on the other side, that when the Synod had determined, they who were determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against, ought to have submitted to her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination in a thing so <hi>really disputable,</hi> and by this Christian Policy to have conserved the peace of the Church, and out-witted the Devil. For if they had had any modesty in them, they might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well in such abstruse, dark and disputable points have compromised with the <hi>Synod,</hi> and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the peace and safety of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches, before the satisfaction of their own <hi>Opinionative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And that wise Prince, <hi>King Iames</hi> the first of Blessed Memory, seems to come near to what I have said, in the words delivered by his Embassadour at the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> as they are cited by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> himself in his <hi>Peaceable Method,</hi> pag. 23. That for the allaying those troubles, <hi>There was but that one only means which the Church had ever made use of,</hi> a National Synod, <hi>which was to be judge in the case, and to decide which of the two Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was more conformable to the Word of God: or at</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:41811:42"/>
                  <hi>least how and in what manner the one or the other might be tolerated in the Church of God.</hi> Which latter part is cunningly left out by the <hi>Translator,</hi> in his <hi>Preface, pag.</hi> 3. But in those latter words, King <hi>Iames</hi> plainly intimates his moderate Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments touching the Controversy, and that he would not have the Decision made too rigidly and pinchingly on either side. And sutably to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent judgment of his, in the Conference at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> when the <hi>Puritans</hi> would have had the nine <hi>Lambeth</hi> Articles, which are more full and express against the points of <hi>Arminianism,</hi> to be embodyed into the Articles of our Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded on in the Convocation holden at <hi>London,</hi> in the Year 1562. the King earnestly refused it. And in his Instructions to his <hi>Divines</hi> he sent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> this remarkable one was amongst the rest, That they would advise the Churches that the Ministers do not deliver in Pulpit to the People those things for ordinary Doctrines, which are the highest points of the Schools, and not fit for vulgar Capacities, but <hi>disputable</hi> on both sides. And we may be sure when he was so careful in this for the foreign Churches, he would not neglect to infuse the same good Principles into his own. And that he could not easily believe that upon the <hi>Decision</hi> of the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort,</hi> that passed into an <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there is no Salvation, which yet he would have hid from the knowledge of the People.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>1. What <hi>Synodical</hi> Decisions are <hi>capable</hi> of passing into <hi>proper</hi> Articles of Faith, and what <hi>not.</hi> 2. The necessity of distinguishing the <hi>doctrinal</hi> Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Synods</hi> into <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> properly so called, and <hi>Articles of Communion.</hi> 3. The meaning of the King's Answer to Mr. <hi>Knewstub,</hi> in the Conference at <hi>Hampton-Court:</hi> And that <hi>Synods</hi> have <hi>unlimited</hi> Power to put what sense they please on places of Scripture, and make them pass into <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> not proved to be the Opinion of the Protestant Churches. 4. That our <hi>English</hi> Church is against it, largely proved out of her Articles. 5. No <hi>Article of Faith</hi> pre-exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in Scripture that cannot be fetched thence but by interpreting against the <hi>Proleptick</hi> Principles of <hi>rightly circumstantiated</hi> Sense and <hi>Common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> ingrafted <hi>essentially</hi> in the Humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. 6. Of Decision of points <hi>necessary</hi> to Salvation, and to the justifying the Christian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and those that are <hi>less necessary,</hi> and <hi>less clear,</hi> and lastly, those that have an <hi>Insuperable Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> on <hi>both sides.</hi> 7. Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi>'s ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Maxime,</hi> that it is not agreed in by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Churches, abundantly demonstrated, with a Note of the <hi>Subtilty</hi> of the <hi>Romanists</hi> in <hi>declining</hi> the Dispute of the <hi>particular</hi> merits of their Cause, and making it their business to perswade, <hi>first,</hi> that <hi>their Church is Infallible.</hi> 8. A Meeting with Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> once more in his own Method, and thereby demonstrating that <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41811:43"/>
                     <hi>grosly false, and consequently the Church of</hi> Rome fallible, <hi>with an hint of a true</hi> peaceable Method of reconciling Papists and Protestants.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. WHerefore it seems needful to take notice of this distinction of the <hi>Doctrinal</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions of <hi>Synods,</hi> that some pass into, or rather are of the nature of the <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them being <hi>necessary</hi> to keep us from Sin and Damnation. And such were the <hi>Doctrinal</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions of those ancient <hi>Primitive</hi> Councils, who out of Scripture plainly declared, the truth of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Christ and <hi>Triunity</hi> of the <hi>God-head,</hi> without which the Church would be involved in <hi>gross Idolatry.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Decisions</hi> of the Controversies did naturally pass into <hi>professed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> and such as our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depended on. But to imagine that every <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal</hi> Decision of a <hi>Synod</hi> passes into a <hi>proper</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of <hi>Faith,</hi> without which there is no Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that a <hi>Synod</hi> has power to make that an <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> before which men were safe and sinless as to that point, is to put it into the power of a <hi>Synod</hi> to damn God knows how many Myriads of men which Christ dyed for, and had it not been for these curious, or rather mischievous Decisions, might have been saved; than which what can be more prodigious?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whence we see plainly it is <hi>most necessary</hi> to make this distinction in <hi>Doctrinal</hi> Decisions of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,</hi> that some may be <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> others only <hi>Articles of Communion,</hi> that if any oppose or disparage the said Articles, whether they be of the Clergy or Laity, they make themselves obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41811:43"/>
to <hi>Excommunication;</hi> and if a Clergy-man does not subscribe to them, he makes himself uncapable of <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Imployment. This is all that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> can squeeze out of all his Citations out of the story of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> so far as I can perceive, or his <hi>Translator</hi> in his <hi>Preface</hi> and <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix,</hi> out of those he produces touching the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And that which his <hi>Translator</hi> in his <hi>Preface</hi> would make such a great business of, <hi>viz,</hi> This wise Kings answer to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Knewstubs,</hi> at the Conference at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> when he was asked, <hi>How far an Ordinance of the Church was to bind men without impeachment of their Christian Liberty:</hi> to which he said, he would not argue that point with him, but answer therein as Kings are wont to speak in Parliament, <hi>Le Roy s'avisera.</hi> And therefore I charge you never speak more to that point how far you are bound to obey when the Church has once ordained it. I say nothing more can be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of this answer, but that he modestly intimated his Opinion, that he meant not that <hi>all</hi> Synodical <hi>Decisions</hi> passed into <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> but may be only <hi>Articles of Communion</hi> in the sense I have already explained. And what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready said, if seriously and considerately applyed to what he produces in his <hi>Appendix,</hi> will easily discover that they prove nothing more touching the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than what we have already allowed to be her Doctrine touching the Authority of Synods.</p>
               <p>But that a <hi>Synod</hi> without any limitation or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to certain <hi>Principles</hi> in which both the <hi>Synod</hi> and <hi>Parties</hi> contesting are all agreed in, may by her
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41811:44"/>
bare <hi>immediate</hi> Authority, give what sense she pleases on places of Scripture, alledged in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy, and that her <hi>Decision</hi> passes into an <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith,</hi> which the Parties cast are bound to assent to, under the pain of becoming <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks.</hi> Nothing can be more contrary than this to the Declarations of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> So far is it from truth, That <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> Churches are agreed in his grand <hi>Maxime</hi> above mentioned.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let the Church of <hi>England</hi> speak for her self, <hi>Artic.</hi> 19. As the Church of <hi>Jerusalem, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> so also the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has erred, not only in their <hi>Living</hi> and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, but also in <hi>Matters of Faith.</hi> And <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> 21. General Councils may not be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without the Commandment and Will of Princes. And when they be gathered together (forasmuch as they be an Assembly of men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all be not governed with the Spirit and Word of God) they may err, and sometimes have erred even in things appertaining to God, wherefore things ordained by them, as <hi>necessary to Salvation,</hi> have neither Strength nor Authority, unless it may be declared that they be taken out of the Holy Scriptures. Here our Church plainly declares, that forasmuch as a Council or Synod consists of <hi>fallible</hi> Persons, they can determine nothing <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation,</hi> but what they can make out that it is clearly, to any unprejudiced Eye, contained in the Scripture, not fetched out by weak and <hi>precarious</hi> Consequences, or <hi>phanciful</hi> Surmises, much less by a <hi>distorted</hi> Interpretation, and <hi>repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> to <hi>Common Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41811:44"/>
supposed in the understanding of any Scripture or Writing whatsoever, as I have inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated above.</p>
               <p>And even that Article (20.) which the <hi>Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> produces in his <hi>Preface,</hi> in the behalf of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi>'s grand <hi>Maxime,</hi> do but produce the whole Article and it is plainly against it. For the words are these: The Church has power to decree Rites and Ceremonies and Autority in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies of Faith; and yet it is not lawful for the Church to ordain any thing that is contrary to God's Word written, neither may it so expound one place of Scripture that it be repugnant to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Wherefore although the Church be a Witness and Keeper of Holy Writ, yet as it ought not to decree any thing <hi>against</hi> the same, so <hi>beside</hi> the same, ought it not to inforce any thing to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved for <hi>Necessity of Salvation.</hi> It is true, the Church is here said to have Authority in <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of Faith.</hi> As certainly if any should raise new Stirs in any National Church, touching such points as the Antient Primitive Synods have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded for, in the behalf of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Triunity</hi> of the God-head, pretending they have clearer demonstrations than ever yet were proposed against those Decisions or any of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which may concern the <hi>Iustifiableness</hi> of our <hi>Christian Worship,</hi> and <hi>indispensable</hi> way of <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> the Church has Authority as she ever had, in such Controversies, to ratifie such <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> but she is not said to have Authority to make every <hi>Synodical</hi> Decision an <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> whether the nature thereof will bear it or no. Nay her Authority is excluded from inforcing any
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41811:45"/>
thing besides what is clearly enough contained in the Scripture (as assuredly those points are above mentioned, though with weak or cavilling men they have been made questionable) to be believed for <hi>Necessity of Salvation.</hi> Which is the proper Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of an <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> according as the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> to the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed intimates. And Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> himself is so sensible of this main Truth, that in the Explication of his general <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime,</hi> he acknowledges that the Church has no Autority to coin any <hi>New</hi> Articles of Faith, but only to declare she has discovered them <hi>existent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> in the Scriptures, but not so clearly espi'd or discerned as by an assembled Synod.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But certainly no <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> that is to say, no Truth necessary to Salvation can be said to be <hi>pre existent</hi> in the Scriptures, and having lain hid to be discovered afterwards, that is not discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but by such forced Interpretations of the Text, that are repugnant to <hi>Common Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi> Is not this a Reproach to the Wisdom of God, that he should inspire the Holy Penmen to set down Truth <hi>necessary to Salvation</hi> so obscurely, that the meaning cannot be reached without doing vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to <hi>Common Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> and running counter to those <hi>previous Principles,</hi> without which it is impossible to make sense of any writing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever? Or without interpreting one place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture <hi>repugnantly</hi> to the plain sense of another. Which this Article expresly forbids as unlawful. So plain is it that our Church limits the Authority of a Synod to certain Rules agreed of on all hands, against which they have no Authority to define any thing: And <hi>plain places</hi> of Scripture is one
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41811:45"/>
Rule, contrary to which it is not lawful to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret any either <hi>pretendedly</hi> or <hi>really</hi> obscure place. Nor can any place at all be plain without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance of those <hi>Proleptick</hi> Principles of <hi>rightly circumstantiated sense</hi> and <hi>common</hi> undeniable <hi>Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons essentially</hi> ingrafted in the mind of man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they relate to <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Morality.</hi> These, both <hi>Synod</hi> and <hi>Contesters,</hi> are supposed to be agreed on, and therefore no <hi>Synodical Decision</hi> repugnant to these according to our Church in interpreting of Scripture (if I rightly understand her) ought to have Autority with it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But as for <hi>doctrinal</hi> Decisions, such as concern the <hi>Justifiableness</hi> of the Christian Worship, and are of <hi>Necessity</hi> to <hi>Salvation,</hi> and such as, although ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weak or willful cavilling men may make que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable, yet are clearly enough delivered in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, these, questionless, a Synod has Autority to determine as <hi>Articles of Faith.</hi> And such as have not the like <hi>Clearness</hi> nor <hi>Necessity,</hi> as also innocent and indifferent Rites and Ceremonies, when the one and the other seem <hi>advantagious</hi> to the Church, such <hi>Synodical</hi> Decisions may pass into <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Communion,</hi> in that sense I have above explained. And lastly, As in that case of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> when the points controverted have on both sides that <hi>invincible</hi> Obscurity and Intricacy, and there seems to be <hi>forcible</hi> Arguments for either conclusion. What, I humbly conceive, is to be done in that case, I have fully enough expressed already, and therefore think it needless again to repeat.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In the mean time, I hope, I have made it manifoldly apparent that Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi>'s ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Maxime, viz.</hi> That the Church, in which are
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41811:46"/>
found the two Parties concerned, has ever had the Power to determine all differences, and to declare that as <hi>Matter of Faith,</hi> which before there was no Obligation to believe; And that we are bound to acquiesce in her Decisions under the penalty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> is not, (especially as he would have his <hi>Maxime</hi> understood) agreed on by all Churches, as well <hi>Protestant</hi> as <hi>Pontifician.</hi> And that therefore this <hi>Snare</hi> or <hi>Net,</hi> wherewith he would catch and carry Captive the Protestants into a Profession of the Infallibility of the Church in <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodical</hi> Decisions; so that the Church must be first allow'd <hi>Infallible,</hi> that we may glibly swallow down whatsoever she decides, even <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> it self, with all other Errours of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> this <hi>Net</hi> or <hi>Snare,</hi> I hope, I have sufficiently bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. And I will only note by the bye, how the subtilest <hi>Romanists</hi> declining the <hi>Merits</hi> of the <hi>Cause,</hi> labour Tooth and Nail to establish the <hi>absolute In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> of their Church. But our Saviour tells us, <hi>By the fruit you shall know them.</hi> Wherefore any man or Company of men that profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>infallible,</hi> their <hi>Infallibility</hi> must be examined by their <hi>Doctrines,</hi> which if they be plainly any one of them <hi>false,</hi> their boast of <hi>Infallibility</hi> most certainly is not true.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But forasmuch as an <hi>Appeal</hi> to a <hi>Maxime</hi> pretended to be agreed upon by both sides, both <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants,</hi> is made use of with so much Wit and Artifice, to ingage the <hi>Protestants</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Romish</hi> Errours: I hope Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> will not take it amiss, if I civilly meet him again in his own Way, and show him by an Appeal, not only to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41811:46"/>
                  <hi>one</hi> Maxime but above a <hi>dozen</hi> at least of <hi>Common Notions,</hi> which I did above recite, and in which both <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants,</hi> and all mankind are agreed, that it may demonstratively be made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is grosly false.</p>
               <p>For that which in it self is false, no <hi>declaring</hi> or saying it is true, though by the vote of an <hi>entire Synod,</hi> can make it true, by the <hi>first</hi> of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notions above-mentioned, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whatever is plainly repugnant to what is <hi>true,</hi> is certainly <hi>false,</hi> and consequently can be no <hi>due</hi> Article of a <hi>true Faith</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> by the <hi>second</hi> and <hi>third</hi> Common Notions. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> cannot pass into an <hi>Article of Faith</hi> by the Authority of any <hi>Synod</hi> whatever.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Now that the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> is false, is manifest from the assurance of our Senses <hi>rightly circumstantiated.</hi> To which our Saviour Christ appeals, who is wiser than all the Synods that ever were or will be, as was observed in Common Notion the <hi>fourth.</hi> But our <hi>Senses</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure us it is <hi>Bread</hi> still, not the <hi>Body of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, If <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> be true, an Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence or Being that is <hi>one</hi> remaining <hi>still one,</hi> may be <hi>divided</hi> or separated <hi>from it self,</hi> which is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the <hi>fifth</hi> Common Notion.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If Transubstantiation be true, the <hi>whole</hi> is not bigger than the <hi>part,</hi> nor the <hi>part</hi> less than the <hi>whole,</hi> which contradicts the <hi>sixth</hi> Common Notion.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, If Transubstantiation be true, the parts in a Division do not only agree with the whole, but agree one with another, and are indeed absolutely
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41811:47"/>
the same; for divide a consecrated Wafer into two, <hi>viz. A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> this <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> are the <hi>same</hi> intire <hi>Individual</hi> Body of Christ according to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which contradicts the <hi>seventh</hi> Common Notion.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, If the said Doctrine be true, one and the same Body may be a <hi>Cube</hi> and a <hi>Globe</hi> at once, have the figure of an <hi>Humane Body</hi> and of a <hi>Pyramid</hi> and <hi>Cylinder</hi> at the same time, according as they shall mould the Consecrated Bread, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the <hi>eighth</hi> Common Notion.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> if it be any truth at all, it is a <hi>Revealed</hi> Truth; but no Revelation the <hi>Revealing</hi> whereof, or the <hi>manner</hi> of Revealing is <hi>repugnant</hi> to the <hi>Divine Attributes,</hi> can be from God, by Common Notion the <hi>ninth:</hi> but if this Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> were a Truth, it seems not to sute with the Wisdom of God to reveal a Truth that seems so palpably to overthrow and thwart <hi>all</hi> the <hi>innate Principles</hi> of humane <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> and the assurance of the <hi>rightly circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiated</hi> Senses, to both which Christ himself ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals, and without which we have no certainty of the Miracles of Christ and his Apostles. And he hence exposes his Church to be befool'd by all the lucriferous fictions of a fallacious Priesthood.</p>
               <p>And besides this, the circumstances or <hi>manner</hi> of its first <hi>Revelation</hi> at the Lord's Supper as they would have it, shows it cannot be; for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated Bread retaining still the shape and all other sensible qualities of Bread without any change, and that by a <hi>miraculous</hi> supporting them, now <hi>not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent</hi> in their <hi>proper</hi> subject <hi>Bread,</hi> which is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiated into that very Body that holds it in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41811:47"/>
his hands, or seems so to do. I say, as I have also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated before, to be thus at the expence of so <hi>vast</hi> a <hi>Miracle</hi> here at his last Supper, and to repeat the same Miracle upon all the Consecrations of the Bread by the Priest, which is the most effectual means to make all men Infidels, as to the belief of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and to occasion thence such <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>bloody Persecutions,</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently contrary to the <hi>Divine Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness;</hi> and therefore neither <hi>pretended Tradition</hi> nor <hi>fresh Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of the inspired Text, can make so gross a fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood true, by the <hi>tenth</hi> and <hi>eleventh</hi> Common Notions.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, If <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> be true, one and the same Body may be many thousand times bigger or less than it self at the same time, forasmuch as the <hi>least Atom</hi> or particle of his Body or <hi>Transubstantiated</hi> Bread is his whole Body as well as the <hi>bigger lump</hi> according to this Doctrine, which contradicts the <hi>twelfth</hi> Common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, If this Doctrine be true, The <hi>same Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual</hi> Body still existing and having existed many Years, may notwithstanding be made whiles it already exists, which contradicts the <hi>thirteenth</hi> Common Notion.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, If <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> be true, one and the same Body may be present with it self and many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of miles absent from it self at once, be shut up in a Box and free to walk in the Field, and to ascend into Heaven at the same time, contrary to the <hi>fourteenth</hi> and <hi>fifteenth</hi> Common Notions.</p>
               <p>And lastly, If this Doctrine be true, a man may swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his own Body <hi>whole,</hi> Head, Feet, Back, Belly, Arms, and Thighs, and Stomach it self through his Mouth, down his Throat into his Stomach, that is to say, every whit of himself into one knows not what of himself, less than a Mathematical Point or nothing. This Christ might have done, and actually did if he did eat the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated Bread with his Disciples, which contradicts the <hi>sixteenth</hi> Common Notion.</p>
               <p>Wherefore since in vertue of <hi>one</hi> single <hi>Maxim,</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> supposing the <hi>Protestants</hi> as well as the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41811:48"/>
                  <hi>Paepists</hi> agreeing therein (though in that, as I have show'd, he is mistaken) would draw in the Protestants to imbrace the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and other Ertors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, I appeal to him how much more reasonable it is, that he and as many as are of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion should <hi>relinquish</hi> that Doctrine, it contradicting so many <hi>Common Notions,</hi> which not only all <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants,</hi> but indeed all the whole World are agreed in. And hence clearly discerning the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, upon which this and other erroneous Doctrines are built (such as Invocation of Saints, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping of Images, and the like) plainly to fail, that they should bethink themselves what need there is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Church from such gross errours, and to pray to God to put it into the mind of their Governours so to do; which would be a <hi>peaceable method indeed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uniting Protestants and Catholicks in matters of Faith, and principally in the subject of the Holy Eucharist,</hi> as the Title of his <hi>Method</hi> has it.</p>
               <p>But to require an <hi>Union,</hi> things standing as they are, is to expect of us that we <hi>cease to be men</hi> to become <hi>Christians</hi> of a <hi>novel Mode</hi> unknown to the Primitive Church, and under pretence of <hi>Faith</hi> to abjure the <hi>indeleble Principles</hi> of <hi>sound Reason,</hi> those immutable <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notions</hi> which the Eternal <hi>Logos</hi> has <hi>essentially</hi> ingrafted in our Souls, and without which neither <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> can consist, nor any assured sense of either the <hi>Holy</hi> Scriptures or <hi>any</hi> Writing else be found out or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Soli Deo Gloria.</hi>
