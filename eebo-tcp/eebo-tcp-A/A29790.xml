            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface to the READER.</head>
            <p>THere needs nothing more be said concerning the following Dialogue, then that it was written about a Month agoe, as several Gentlemen in Town know very well; and that it had been then Published, but for a particular Reason, that is, not perhaps so very convenient to be told. The Author is not so great a Fool, as to imagine that a little fair Language in the Preface will make any sensible Reader think the better of his Performance; only he begs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leave to acquaint him with the occasion of Printing it at this time; especially when so many People of such different Opinions and Characters in the World, have appear'd on the same Subject before him.</p>
            <p>Last Week there came abroad a certain Poem called <hi>the Weesils,</hi> which several Persons were at first pleased to lay at my door, though now they are satisfied it was done by another Hand; the Author of it having since thought fit to own it publickly, and so to take care, that whatever Reputation or Scandal was to be gotten from such an undertaking, might not be carried away by a Stranger. However a certain nameless Rascal about the Town upon no better a ground, than the common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, which yet the Fellow owns to be a common Liar, charges me with Writing it: And though in the beginning of his Libel, he cants about <hi>the Gates of Mercy being always open,</hi> and that excellent Rule <hi>of not doing to others, what what we would not have done to our selves,</hi> yet before he had fully informed himself of his Man, or the merits of the cause, he very honestly recommends it to the pious care of the Doctors Relations to get me knocked in the head for abusing his Lady; and at last tells the World that I am as proper a Person as any is in the three Kingdoms to be shewn at <hi>Chirurgeons-Hall.</hi> I am sorry for the Reader's sake, that this Malicious Wretch is of too mean and sordid a Character for me take him into my consideration; for otherwise, the Scriber might expect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a small cast of my old Office; and I assure him he should find to his own cost the heaviness of my hand, if I were in humour to give my self the trouble of Ierking him. However before we part, I must tell him, that I have no reason as yet to be so weary of my life, as to desire to be deified af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:100487:3"/>
               <hi>Andrew Marvel</hi>'s manner: Nor are my obligations to the City Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians so very great, but that I could be content to see all of them Hanged, before they should ever come to learn Anatamy at the expence of my Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle. If I must be sent to another World, I think 'tis but reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that it should be for something of my own, and not for the merits of another man; and therefore for this reason I was resolved to publish the ensuing Dialogue. What served to confirm me further in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to print it, was because it having been transcribed by several hands contrary to promise and without my own consent, it cou'd not fail one time or other to steal abroad; and according to the common Apology that we Authors use to make in such cases, I was not willing, that what was design'd as a Satyr upon other men, should turn to be a Satyr upon my self.</p>
            <p>I hope none of our Dissenters are so vain as to imagine that I wou'd ever contribute to make them merry at the charges of any Member of the Established Church; If they please to turn over two or three leaves, I don't question but they'll be sensible enough, that I design'd no such matter; and to say the truth, if a man may guess at the hearts of a People by their Pamphlets and Coffee-house Conversation, one has all the reason in the World to conclude that they'll preserve the honour of Monarchy under this Reign, much after the same ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e as they consulted the Security of the Protestant Religion under the last.</p>
            <p>I was always of opinion, that nothing in the World is so ridiculous as a feeble, impotent Satyr, and that consideration perhaps has car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me sometimes into such heats as I will not pretend to excuse, tho it is easie enough to observe that I have often avoided to pursue my Reflections, even where there was a plausible occasion to do it. 'Tis as impossible now to retract what is done upon this score, as it would be foolish to implore the Reader's Candor to forgive it: But however as this is the first time I ever meddled with so nice a subject, so 'tis likely to be the last.</p>

               <p>There was a venerable old Gentleman, that by the Courtesy of the late Reign, was made a Iustice of Peace; and he was declaiming perpetually upon the Puissance and Heroical Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of <hi>Louis le Grand,</hi> whom he fancied to be as irresistible at the <hi>Calvinist</hi> Divines make God's Grace. Then there was a Leash of Country Attorneys, who took a great deal of care I heartily thank 'em, to stun me all the way with their damn'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100487:4"/>
unintelligible Law-cases, which I had no more a mind to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, than I have to learn, either the modern notions of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or the modern Systems of Theology. Lastly, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat my Misery, we had an ancient sage Matron in the Coach, and she with Tears in her Eyes, railed very devoutly at the lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the present Age, occasioned by the Non-Resistance Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of some Divines; I thank God, says she, I never practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it since I was Fourteen: And then she fell as severely upon the Miscarriages of the late Fornicating Admiral (as she called him,) as a She Tarpaulin, who has lost her only Husband in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.</p>

               <p>A very pretty Consort I'faith. So I don't question but what between the Politicks of the Justice, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence of your Lawyers, and the pious Ejaculations of your Female Companion, you found your self as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy, as a blundering Cit amongst the Verse-repeating <hi>Beaux</hi> of <hi>Wills</hi> Coffee-house, or the Chair-man of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee amongst his Herd of Country Petitioners. But set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Business aside, prithee tell me how thou hast done this long while, for unless I am mistaken, 'tis above three Years since we saw you last in Town.</p>

               <speaker>Freem.</speaker>
               <p>Why truly <hi>Tim.</hi> I live after my old laudable Custom still; sometimes I divert my self with a chearful Bottle, and sometimes, pass away an Hour or two with an honest old Author; for to say the truth, your new Gentlemen scarce deserve a Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I pay my Taxes without repining; do what good I oan a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst my Neighbours, never trouble my self with other Mens business; and though the Duty I owe to their present Majesties will not permit me to talk so scandalously and disrespectfully of the two late Reigns, as some Hot-headed Sots have done, yet I am as well satisfied with the present Establishment, and as Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the prosperity of Old <hi>England,</hi> as the forwardest Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, who has made his Fortune by the Revolution, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is obliged to stand up for it as well upon the score of his interest as his choice.

               <p>A right Country Gentleman's Question I'faith, for the first thing he generally asks you is, <hi>What is the News?</hi> As the Country Ladies when they come up to Town, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in the first place, <hi>Which is the newest Play or Lampoon? Which is the Topping Mistress of the Court,</hi> or <hi>the most fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Suit of Ribbons at the</hi> Exchange? Well then to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy your Curiosity, you must know that there has lately happened a very remarkable Change or Conversion, (call it which you please) of a certain Person here in Town which no Body could ever have imagined or expected; and now I leave it to you, to conjecture what it is.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Freem.</speaker>
               <p>A Conversion, and that a very remarkable one too! Why then I fancy. <hi>Tim.</hi> that your Friend Mr. <hi>Bay</hi>'s is return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Primitive Church.</p>

               <p>Nay the Lord knows, which is Mr. <hi>Bay</hi>'s Primitive Church; but prithee why dost thou trouble thy head about a Poet's Religion? for as we say, a Beggar is never out of his way, so a Poet is never out of his Religion.</p>

               <p>Ay, with all my Heart. You must know then that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral worthy Persons whom I could name to you, if there were any necessity for it, came immediatly after the Revolution, to advise with the Doctor in that exigence of affairs. Some of 'em he disswaded from taking the Oaths, and without question fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished 'em with his own Reasons for his Dissenting from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in that particular, and I don't hear that he ever sent for 'em to come in with him; but when others came to consult him about the very same business, he was pleased to say, that he would prescribe to no Bodies Conscience but his own; and so dismist them with bidding them use<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their own discretion in the matter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Well, and what of all this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Freem.</speaker>
               <p>Why, say I, any Man who could deliver himself so am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguously upon a Question that so nearly concerned the security of the Government, and the wellfare as well as the Honour of the Established Church, either looked upon it not to be a thing of that importance, as it really is, or else had not fully determined his Sentiments either to the lawfulness or unlawfulness of it. I am of opinion, that nothing but the fear of incurring the guilt of Perjury, could excuse any Man from giving the Government so reasonable a satisfaction, as the taking the Oaths amounted to. Now that the Doctor was, not fully perswaded in his Conscience that there was any Perjury in such a Compliance, is very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent as I think, from his advising the Gentlemen to make use of their own Discretion; which he would never have done, if he had really believed that so black and scandalous and Cowardly a sin, would be the necessary Consequence of it.</p>

               <p>Well then, Granting all you have said to be true, what advantage do you intend to make of it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Freem.</speaker>
               <p>That the Doctor considered the taking of the Oaths to be only an indifferent thing, and no more, which a Man might ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do or not do, at his own pleasure; for otherwise it had been his Duty to disswade all Persons who came to be advised by him, from Swearing. Now <hi>Tim,</hi> pray tell me what miracle is it for a Man to part with his opinion about an indifferent thing, when there's nothing but scandal and poverty to be had in maintaining it still, and so much Interest and advantage to ballance him to the contrary side?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>To say the truth, there's no extraordinary Miracle in such a case. But then I would have you consider, dear Friend of mine, that the Doctor's Circumstances were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps clearly different from the Gentlemen's that came to consult him; and consequently what might be either lawful or expedient for them to do, might not be so lawful, at least so reputable for himself.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>You know to what heights, or rather extremities the Doctor has all along carried the Doctrine of Passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; you know how stiffly and zealously he has asserted the <hi>Ius Divinum</hi> of Monarchy; and with what assiduity and pains he has combated the other Party; who fell upon dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent schemes and notions of Government. And therefore imagining that several passages in the late Revolution could not be well reconciled to what he had formerly preached, what wonder is it, if he could not at that time prevail with himself, to give his Assent?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Freem.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, if that Reason is worth a Farthing, it holds as well now as it did the last Year.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Prithee let me alone for a while, and afterwards say what you please—But then this Cafe, as I told you before, seems only particular to the Dr. for the other Gentlemen perhaps never preached or printed those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100487:7"/>
which the Dr. has, or perhaps never believed a Syllable of 'em, as is evident some of their Brethren never did, who in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Treatises and Sermons that have been published since the Abdication, pretend to assert abundance of things, that were not so very current Doctrin in the two late Reigns. And so the Dr. might excusably enough leave 'em to use their own discretion in the matter, since if they complied with the Government it wou'd contradict nothing which they formerly preached or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. What may be the reason do you think why the Fanaticks are so loyally affected to their present Majesties; and were so easily brought over to renounce the last? All the World knows what a great deal of dutiful care they took to lull asleep the late King with their Addressing Opiates, and sacrificing their Lives and Fortunes to him, whenever he should have an occasion to make use of them. And yet among so numerous a Herd, unless a very few, and those <hi>incognito,</hi> none have scrupled to take the Oaths, altho you know they are a People that understand how to make the best of a Scruple of any men breathing. Their <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratick</hi> Principles are still the same, and their Sincerity to this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has no better a foundation than what they pretended for the last. Therefore in short the business is this, besides the interest they perceived in crying up their Loyalty now, our last turn of Affairs could not but be very acceptable to those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who all along placed the Sovereign Power in the multitude; and made their Princes upon every Transgression and male-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration in the State accountable to the People.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Freeman.</speaker>
               <p>As for what concerns the Fanaticks I readily own. But then the other part of your Discourse, <hi>Tim.</hi> is not so well grounded as it ought to be. You say the Dr. might refuse to take the Oaths, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in doing so, he must run counter to several Principles, which he had formerly justified and asserted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now if this be true, he's as much oblig'd at this present moment to dissent from the Government, as at first. You say likewise that the Case of those Gentlemen, who consulted him about taking the Oaths, is very different from his; but this I take nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be satisfactory nor solid. The Question is, whether what the Dr. has formerly preached or written, is the true Doctrin of the Church
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100487:8"/>
of <hi>England</hi> or no? If it is not, I am of opinion he's bound to make a solemn Retractation of it; and if it is, it obliged his Brethren, who came to advise him, equally with himself, altho they never preacht it, or publickly justified it in Print. For instance, here are two Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-men, one of 'em preaches against Oppression and Covetousness once a Month at least, and perhaps has appear'd in a Term-Catalogue upon that Subject; the other, we'll say, never medled with the point in all his Life: and yet you'll never conclude I suppose, that the latter has more pretence and plea to cheat the Poor, and trouble his Parish for a single Tithe-Pig than the former. After all, <hi>Tim.</hi> you seem to make the Dr's dissent rather to proceed from a nicety of Honour than a Principle of Conscience; for which piece of Service, I believe, he'll never return you his thanks: Now I wonder in my heart, that you should lay so great a stress upon that point, or admire to see one single Man be prevailed with at last to make a sacrifice of his Honour, (if even so much as his honour be concerned) when you see so many thousand People in the World, that make no scruple at all of sacrificing their Conscience.</p>

               <p>Ay without question, tho as the World goes, I don't think a Man' Honour and Reputation are worth the while to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at the expence of starving for 'em, and some people I cou'd name to you, wou'd scarce put that dangerous compliment upon their Religion, as to suffer any severe extremities for its sake. Besides, now you talk of Scandal, I question whether the Dr. has not given a great deal more Scandal by his late compliance with the Oaths, then then his former dissenting from 'em. Before he was generally consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a person of Conscience and Honour, and now perhaps abundance of ill-natur'd People will allow him a share of neither. And what may serve to confirm 'em in such an opinion, is that the Dr's Conscience, which has for this long while lived among the Laywers, has not been so uniform (if I may use the expression) as you imagine it first sight to be, or I cou'd have wished it had been.</p>

               <p>I call that an Uniform Conscience, <hi>Tim,</hi> which proceeds regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in all its Actions, and never does any thing in contradiction to its own Principles. Now let us see whether the Dr's conduct since our new Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of affairs can endure the left of this definition. Most Men will agree that the reason why the Dr. refused the Oaths, must be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he apprehended it was sinful to take them; so then if the Dr. at the same time when he judged the taking the Oaths to be Sinful, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless submitted to do another thing, which was tantamount to taking 'em, how can you or any man else excuse him from acting quite contrary to his own principle?</p>

               <p>I was in good hopes you would never give me the trouble to prove so plain a point. Did you never hear then, that when some of the Doctor's Councel had found out a Loop-hole for him in the Act of Parliament to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to Preach at his Lecture in St. <hi>Dunstans',</hi> how he Prayed very heartily for both their Majesties by Name, when at the same time he cou'd not prevail with his Conscience to Swear to 'em.</p>

               <p>Why prithee man, every Body in the Town knows that. The truth on't is, People discoursed very differently upon that occasion; but all his Friends, who at that time seemed to justify his Proceedings, were agreed that it was a different thing to pray for a Person, and swear Allegiance to a Person; for you know the Apostle commands us, to pray for all men, but he no where commands us to swear to all Men.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Freem.</speaker>
               <p>This is a very miserable pitiful shift, as I take it, when it comes to be narrowly examined; for prithee tell me, honest <hi>Tim,</hi> what is it to swear Allegiance to any Prince?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>To acknowledge in the presence of God Almighty, that the Prince to whom I swear, has a Lawful Title to the Throne he possesses; and consequently to my fidelity and Service, as far as the respective constitution of the Government, where I live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Freem.</speaker>
               <p>Well then, and is not praying for a Prince, and recommending him in all his acknowledged Titles to the protection of God Almighty, the very same thing in effect with Swearing to him? I am sure it is, if your
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100487:9"/>
heart goes along with your words; and a Church, as far as I understood the matter, is none of the fittest Places in the World for a man to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate in. Besides <hi>Tim,</hi> there's this remarkable difference between Swearing to a Prince, and praying for him, that you may perhaps have occasion to swear to him but once in your life, and that before very few Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses; whereas you are obliged to do the other once a Week at least, in the face of a very numerous and Solemn Assembly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>But how do you know, Dear Friend, but this very same case which looks so intricate and perplexed at first sight, may be made to appear plausible enough with the help of two or three of the Doctors Distinctions?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Freem.</speaker>
               <p>Nay let<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> me conjecture you, <hi>Tim,</hi> to overwhelm me with no Distinctions as you love me; for the case is so very plain and obvious, that it will not admit of any. I am certain that, where there are two Controverted Titles, if my Conscience would not give me leave to Swear to a Prince, my Conscience would never permit me to pray for him publickly; and I am as sure, that if I could prevail with my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to pray for him under the Title he assumes, and which this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son once controverted,) I should never make any scruple of Swearing to him. The Apostle you tell me, commands us to pray for all Men. So we do, and for my own part I can pray very heartily for the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> the <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary,</hi> or the <hi>Great Mogul</hi> without any remorse; but at the same time I can never pray for any of the aforesaid Monarchs as King of <hi>England,</hi> and so forth; or if I could, why then as I told you before <hi>Tim,</hi> I should make no question of testifying my acknowledgment of them by an Oath.</p>

               <p>That may be your Conscience perhaps, but it were as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>reasonable to think that all People are acted by the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, as to imagine that all People pursue the same end, or think the same things, or are influenced by the same Motives. You see several Hundreds of Men flock every Sunday to Church, yet one man goes there to pick a Pocket, a Second to make an assigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a Girl, a third to take a comfortable Nap, and a Fourth perhaps to hear Dr. <hi>Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi> contradict himself. Thus every man has his particular aim or design, and so it is in the business
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100487:9"/>
of Conscience; a thousand men may do the same thing, and pretend their Conscience is interested in the doing of it, and yet every particular man's Conscience may proceed upon a different motive or <hi>salvo.</hi> As for an instance, let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Case of swearing to this present Government. The Dissenters, of all sects and denominations, do it to be revenged on the Monarchy, and Passive Obedience; for, tho' the Protestant Religion is the Word with them now, it is not to be imagined, that those people, who shew'd so small a Concern for it in the late Reign, should heartily entertain any affectionate regard for its welfare in this. It wou'd be too tedious a business to examine the grounds upon which all the rest have gone; yet you may be pleased to observe, that as all of them have embarqued their Conscience, more or less, in this affair, so generally speaking, every man's Conscience goes a different way to work; for Conscience is a very intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate thing, and oftentimes is influenc'd by very unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble considerations.</p>

               <p>That Observation of yours is very true, and I could cite several famous modern Examples, to prove the truth of it, but shall at present only content my self with one of ancient standing. Is it not a strange thing, that <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who had the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a wise and learned Philosopher, should ever make it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Conscience to refuse the eating of Beans; or that any of his Disciples should arrive to that prodigious degree of stupidity, as to be Confessors for that sottish, unthinking, Bean-renouncing Doctrine? And yet we have one of their Names upon Record, who chose to undergo the punishment of the Rack, rather than gratifie the curiosity of a certain Tyrant so far, as to acquaint him with the true reason why <hi>Pythagoras</hi> forbad so innocent a Food, and at last very heroically bit off his Tongue, lest the extremity of his torment should oblige him to part with so profound a secret. Here was an odd whimsical sort of a Conscience, with a witniss; and I believe you'll find it a hard task to meet with a Conscience in any of the Conventicles about the Town, that would suffer so much for its lawful Prince, as this poor fellow suffer'd
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100487:10"/>
for a Bean, and is very like the Conscience of a certain person, who never saw his Cathedral, and yet took that care of his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, as to prohibit 'em the eating of black Puddings, because it seem'd to contradict St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Admonition about Blood. But all this while, honest <hi>Tim,</hi> as I take it, we have discoursed besides our matter, therefore to return to our first subject again, prithee tell me how the Dr's Conversion relishes with you here in the City.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Why you know there are store of malicious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all Communities in the World, and these are hardly to be pleased. Indeed, as for the generality of the establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed Church, they are well enough satisfied with his new Acquaintance with the Oaths, &amp; don't at all question, but that as he had leisure and retirement enough to study the point, so he has at last complied upon very solid substantial grounds.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Freeman.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but the Dissenters, I hope, are very well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with his coming over to us. They seem, you know, upon all occasions to be very zealous and affectionate to their present Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties, by the same token, that by their good will they could be content to have all the Gentlemen in the Kingdom hanged out of the way, or <hi>De-witted,</hi> who refuse to acknowledge them by taking the Oaths. Therefore, I should think, it must needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice the Hearts of all these worthy Patriots, to see a person of the Doctor's Learning and Character, lay aside his former prejudices to our settlement, and voluntarily own it.</p>

               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>No, no, you are quite mistaken; the Dissenters are Masters of too good Memories, to be ever guilty of any Charity towards a Man, who had the boldness to touch the Copyhold of the Schism. They rail at him ten times more furiously than ever they did, and challenge him, if he dares, to reconcile his present compliance with his old musty Notions of Passive Obedience; and then they say, they'l get <hi>Enroclydon Baxter,</hi> or one of the <hi>Poultry</hi> Divines, to reconcile <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> to his <hi>Preservative against Popery.</hi>

               <p>But are they all so inveterate? What, not one single man amongst the whole Herd, that congratulates the Government for the great Happiness of his Reduction?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>The only man I hear of, who has been pleased to testifie his Joy for this occasion, is that learned son of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas F—rm—n</hi> by name: He pretends, that the Doctor has effectually answered all his other Treatises, by taking the Oaths, excepting his late Book against the Anti-Trinitarians, and he comforts himself, that the Doctor will all in due time ruin the reputation of that piece; for, says he, the Dr. has got such a pretty way of answering his own Books, that 'tis a thousand pitties any one else should take the trouble out of his hands. Nay, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd (continues he) that when he took the Oaths, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to be sworn upon the Naked Gospel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Freeman.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis strange me thinks that the Dissenters should be angry with the Dr. for what he has done: if their Zeal for the Government is real and sincere, which 'tis a Sin for us in the Country to question, I wonder why they should quarrel with him upon this score, since the influence of his Example, for all they know, may be serviceable to reduce the rest of his Brethren, who at present dissent from us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>That does not signifie a farthing; for, besides their particular pique against the Dr. as he is a Member of the Established Church, they would have neither him, nor any one else who is not of their party, be thought Loyal: For all their former Bellowings and Cries against the Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of Monopolies, yet at present they would willingly engross all the little Honesty and Loyalty that is left in the Nation, into their own hands; though, by the By, their Loyalty is compounded of such cross, surly, ill-natur'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, and is such an odd awkward sort of Loyalty, that for all I can see to the contrary, no Prince in <hi>Christendome</hi> is likely to be the better for it.</p>

               <p>A Dissenter's Loyalty is like the officiousness of a Rock at play, who only lends you Mony in order to your ruin. I pray Heaven it proves of long continuance, but for my own part, I am afraid it will last no longer, than they find their Religion (I mean their Interest) concerned in it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>More than all this, they'l tell you, that we owe the Sunshine of the Gospel, and all the other Blessings of the late Revolution, intirely to their Discretion and State-princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and, that if these impracticable Doctrines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> concerning the Civil Magistrate, had taken place, we had by this time been utterly overwhelmed with <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery.</hi>

               <p>Why this is ten times over a more fulsome Plea than their pretensions to Loyalty. They preserve the <hi>Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</hi> Where, or how? or in what Reign, that we may see it registred in our Almanacks? I am sure they have contributed in all their pious Endeavours to make the Reformation as scandalous and despicable, as any of the Fathers of the Society could have done. They preserved it after a fine rate, by their universal si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the late Reign, and their little, low, abject applications to <hi>Popery;</hi> and now, when the Enemy is beaten out of the field, they make a great pother with a few Gleanings out of our own Authors, and pretend the Victory is owing to their Assistance and Conduct.</p>

               <p>Nay, the Dissenters have not been wanting, even in this Reign, to do the Protestant Religion all the good service they can. One of the Tribe, in his <hi>Modest Enquiry,</hi> as he called it, very modestly advised the Rabble to knock all the Clergymen in the Head. And another nameless Rascal, in his <hi>Reflections</hi> upon the Miscarriages of our Navy, that are printed by one of those godly wholesale Dealers in Scandal, those scruple-selling Vermin of the <hi>Poultry,</hi> has this remarkable passage, <hi>viz.</hi> That there's more Virtue and Honour to be found among the Rabble than the Gentry: <hi>Rabble</hi> is likewise the word with their dear Brethren in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and you may guess what a brave Religion we shall

               <p>Thus you see, Sir, with what contempt and aversion the Dissenters in Town entertain the story of the Dr's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version; now give me leave to add a word or two more concerning them, and then I'll have done. You very well observe, that they pretend to have abundance of Zeal for Their present Majesties, so they do, &amp; if you'l take their own words for it, they'l tell you, that no body keeps the Fasts, and Thanksgiving days with that Devotion as themselves have done. But for all this, dear Friend of mine, they are angry to see the number of the Kings Subjects increased, &amp; if they see a Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-man come over to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100487:12"/>
they immediately call him all the Rogues and Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals in the World: the Reason is plain, they'd willingly have His Majesty served by none but themselves, and then they don't question, to reduce the <hi>French</hi> King, and demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <hi>Popery</hi> in due time. Besides, if all the Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-men had taken the Oaths, they had lost their dearly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Topick of railing at them, and I dare swear (so well am I acquainted with a Dissenter's tenderness) they'd rather sacrifice all the Princes in the Universe, than lose the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious opportunity of libelling and railing. You are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely mistaken, if you imagin, that the Bishops would find better Quarter from the Fanaticks, if they should ever take the Oaths; no, no, they pray, with all their Hearts, that they may refuse the doing of it still, for then they are in hopes to see their Order abolish'd, and their Revenues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided amongst the Saints, <hi>i. e.</hi> their old <hi>Oliverian</hi> Leases come in play again: Of all which expectations they would be miserably disappointed, if those immortal Patriots could prevail with themselves to comply.</p>

               <p>All this you and I cannot possibly help, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis a great piece of Nonsence for us to talk of it any longer, only thus much I must add, That in my opinion too, the Dr. lay under all the Obligations in the World, to make the true Occasions of his late Reconcilement publick. 'Tis a Debt which was due to the Interest he now espouses, no less then the Party he has forsaken, some of which, as you say, the Temptation of being thought of his Acquaintance or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, has reduced to their present mortifying necessities. And therefore this being so necessary a Debt, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to himself, as the rest of the World, I always persuade my self, that the Dr. would take care to acquit it as soon as ever he has got his Reasons ready.</p>

               <p>Got his Reasons ready do you say? That's a Iest with all my heart, as if a man of the <hi>Drs</hi> learning and experience in the world, after so long a time too, to examine all the niceties of the Case, could suffer himself to be ingaged in an affair, to which he formerly expressed so incurable an aversion, without having his Reasons ready by him. Nothing but either pride (which I would be loath to suspect in a person of his mortified Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter) or the weakness of his Cause could engage him
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100487:13"/>
to act only on the Defensive part. 'Tis a hundred to one, but a man's Adversary may say somthing or other, which will lye a little obnoxious to Censure and Exception; so 'tis but falling with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more ado, upon the Authors blind side, and the business is soon over. There are a thousand ways for a man of any tolerable discretion to put by his Enemy's Thrust when he is attacqued; nay, 'tis possible too he may come off with the better on't, especially if the man he has to dealt with, plays open, and lies unguarded in any part. And therefore if this had been the Dr's policy, I should have thought the worse of his skill in Polemies, as long as I lived. I remember I was once in a Coffee-house in the Country, where we happened to be talking of the Dr's coming over to the Government; and a Gentleman in the room was pleased to say, he was of opinion, That the Doctor had got his Reasons ready, much after the same rate as a Country Innkeeper, whom he knew, got a poor fellow's Porcupine ready.</p>

You must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand then, that a certain Fellow, here about the Town, who gets a sorry livelihood by carrying some outlandish Beasts about the Country with him, and shewing 'em for pence a piece to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, had by chance brought a Porcupine, the only support he had left him in the World, to an Inn where this Gentleman was acquainted; the next morning he calls the Innkeeper to him, and thus accosts him: 'Landlord, says he, I must beg one favour of you, and that 'is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to get my Porcupine and Room ready by Eleven of the 'Clock precisely, and in the mean time I'll step into the Town, to see what company I can pick up.</p>

Nay, no harm in the World, says the man of the House; you ordered me to get the Porcupine ready for you by Eleven, and so I have, for I gave directions to the Maid to put him in the pot immediately; but sir, says he, I never boil'd a Porcupine in my Life before, and therefore must once more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest you to let me know what Sawce your Worship will order for him.</p>

The Dr. (as I have told you) has been pleased to oblige the World with his Reasons; you may have them at any Bookseller's Shop in Town, but I cannot forbear to tell you, that there was never any Book since the days of the <hi>Hind</hi> and <hi>Panther,</hi> or the <hi>Letter</hi> to a <hi>Dissenter,</hi> that has been so universally pelted as this; Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers and Divin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Well then, since you'l have it so, I'll dispatch them out of hand; but however, before I make any trial of my noble Faculty, <hi>I</hi> must desire you to remember, how that at the beginning of our Conference, when you told me of the Dr's Conversion, I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100487:14"/>
upon it as no Miracle, and that for these two following weighty reasons. In the first place, because when some Gentlemen came to advise with him about that matter, he civilly referred them to their own discretion, which I supposed he would never have done, if he had been fully satisfied, that the taking the Oaths was a Sin, or had looked upon it to be any thing more than an indifferent Action. In the next place, because the Dr. had long ago prayed for Their present Majesties; which is virtually, and in effect, the same thing with swearing to them; and if it is a Sin to swear to a Prince, where the Title is controverted, and under di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute, I am sure it must be the very same thing to pray for him. Now then <hi>Tim,</hi> since I was so bold as to make the Dr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion no miracle at all, you are not to expect that I should assign any miraculous Reasons for it but onely such as are frequent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the World; so I will begin with that which ever since the Creation of the World has had a mighty influence upon men of all Countries, and Degrees, and Religions. The greater part of Mankind, and especially our Dissenters at home, love to chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten it by the name of Conscience, but for my part, the best En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish word I think we have for it, is INTEREST. What think you of this now?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>To say the truth, there are abundance of ill-affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men about the Town, that have trumped that unlucky Card upon the Dr. but for my part, I don't believe it had any great share in his Reconciliation to the Government. Therefore you had best guess again.</p>

               <p>Nay, but prithee consider, dear <hi>Tim,</hi> what a lovely charming thing this same <hi>Interest</hi> is, before we shut our hands of it: it has all the ear-marks of Love, and Love, you know, works little less than Miracles. It conquers the Young, and the Old are not able to withstand its Almightyship: it makes those that can see, as blind as so many Beetles, and as for those that are blind, why 'tis the best Oculist in the World, and recovers their Eyesight to all intents and purposes.</p>

               <p>To proceed then, is the Dr. brought to a better Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Abdication, or does he go altogether upon the merits of Forefaulture?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Why other people, <hi>Tim,</hi> have store of Passive Obedience about them, as well as the Dr. and yet they dont apprehend that it is a farthing the worse, or that they have broke it at all. Suppose <hi>Tim</hi> you should find occasion, for Reasons best known to your self, to remove a Bag of your Money from one Goldsmith to another of better Reputation, would you not break that fellows Head, who should have the impudence to tell you, you had broke your sum? Even so in the business of Passive Obedience, the Dr. and some of his Brethren, have only transferr'd it from K. <hi>James</hi>'s hands, who, you know, is broke and ruin'd, and a Statute of Bankrupt has passed against in Parliament, to K. <hi>William,</hi> who can give them better Security for it: and Passive Obedience, I can tell you, will

               <p>Not married say you? poor Rogue, thou art unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted I perceive with the damn'd persecution of a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Lecture. Oh! dull, dull still; I can't imagin how to cure this stupidity of thine, thou art ten times duller than one of <hi>Sh—dwell</hi>'s men of sence, or a Simile without a Sting, or an Expounder of the Revelations, at the finding out stoln Silver-Spoons, or an old dozed fellow of a House at the ingenious sport of Questions and Commands.</p>

               <p>Once more then I'll endeavour to relieve the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of thy Apprehension, therefore listen to the following Rhimes about <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi>
               </p>
               <lg>
                  <l>When <hi>Eve</hi> the Fruit had tasted,</l>
                  <l>She to her Husband basted,</l>
                  <l>And chuck'd him on the Chin-a;</l>
                  <l>Dear Bud (quoth she) come taste this Fruit,</l>
                  <l>'Twill finely with your pallate suit,</l>
                  <l>To eat it is no sin-a.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Dost thou now comprehend my Meaning?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Freem.</speaker>
               <p>No, 'saith <hi>Tim, I</hi> am in the dark still; you have made me no wiser with your dull story of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> than you would make a <hi>Cheapside</hi> Tradesman, by telling him, that an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle is an Impediment; or a walking <hi>Oxford</hi>-Dun, that Motion is an Action from the <hi>Terminus a Quo</hi> of his Habitation, to the <hi>Terminus ad quem</hi> of the Refectory.</p>

               <p>Nay then, I am sensible thou art full as slow of Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension as the famous <hi>Ierry Blackacre</hi> in the Play. I have but one trick left to bring you to't at last, and if that fail, I must even serve thee as a stale City-wife serves her dull rustick Prentice, when she has a mind to make him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100487:17"/>
her virtuous inclinations; that is, I must needs name the thing to thee in plain downright broad English. But listen prithee:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>As moody <hi>Job,</hi> in shirtless case,</l>
                  <l>With Collyflowers all o're his Face,</l>
                  <l>Did on the Dunghill languish,</l>
                  <l>His Spouse thus whispers in his Ear;</l>
                  <l>Swear Husband, as you love me, Swear;</l>
                  <l>'Twill case you of your anguish.</l>

               <p>Oh ho! now <hi>I</hi> begin to smell a Rat; your meaning is, That the Dr. has been brought to swear at last through the vertue of a few Conjugal Sollicitations; is it not so, <hi>Tim?</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Of a few Conjugal Sollicitations do you say? No, I am afraid there were abundance of them used in the present case.—Well, dear Friend of mine, not to be tedious with you, I must tell you, that you have made a shift at last to hit my meaning. However, I would not have you report this matter as from me, though I can safely wash my hands from the Guilt of inventing it, and all the Town will do me the Justice, to own, that 'tis a common Story, and no more a Secret than the Mole on the Rector of <hi>Exeter</hi>'s Foot. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, you are desired not to lay too great a stress upon the truth of it, but to follow that Advice, which the Dr. you know gave upon another account, and so to make use of your own Discretion.</p>
