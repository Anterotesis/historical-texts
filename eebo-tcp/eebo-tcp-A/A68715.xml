            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The perſons, to whom this precept of policy is commended, are not all men in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall without difference, but only the beſt ſort of Chriſtians, whom a little before our Sauiour Chriſt called ſheepe, which are a <note place="margin">

Is there any thing amiſſe in the Church or common wealth, but they commonly are made the Authors and cauſers of it?

            </p>
            <p>The perſons, of whom he biddeth them beware, are <hi>Men.</hi> For among all creatures there is not a greater enemie to man, then one man is to an other. Be a beaſt neuer ſo ſauage and cruell in his kinde, yet if a man come not neere him, he will not hurt him, but the malice of man is ſuch, that, whom he hateth, he will reach him with his heart, with his tongue, or with his hand, though hedwelleth neuer ſo farre from him. A ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, though hee be a very venemous and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:164:9"/>
vile beaſt, yet ſtandeth he in that awe and feare of man, as he dare not bite him, if he perceiue, that he ſeeth him; but when one man is bent to doe miſchiefe to another, he feareth the face of no man. If a man anger a ſnake, ſhe may perchance hiſſe at him, but go by her, and let her alone, and ſhee will creepe from him, but anger a man, and by and by his anger turneth into rancoure, and rancoure deſireth reuenge. The Lion, though he be a verie fell and feirce beaſt, yet will he ſpare a man and forbeare to hurt him, if, when it is in his power to hurt him, he fall downe and proſtrate himſelfe before him, but when one man hath aduantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an other, no kinde of humiliation or ſubmiſſion will content him. A Dogge though he come of neuer ſo curriſh a kind, he will commonly barke at a man, before he bite him; but among men, he is commonly counted the wiſeſt man, that will bite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he barke. <hi>Beware of men</hi> therefore. He doth not ſay, beware of men, that are flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, backbiters, adulterers, drunkards, and others, that are giuen to ſuch like vices, but generallie without diſtinctions of their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:164:9"/>

to themſelues, <hi>The warning of the Prophets is but winde, the word of the Lord is not in them,</hi> but beware, and bee warned in time, leſt hereafter you wiſh you had taken warning, when it ſhall be too late. The good King of <hi>Niniae</hi> and his people hearkened to the warning of <hi>Ionas,</hi> and receiued his wordes <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ionas.</hi> 3. 10.</note> not as the wordes of a man, but (as they were indeed) the words of God, and what God purpoſed to do againſt them, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented to do it, and did it not. <hi>Lot</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be warned by the Angels, that were ſent to giue him warning, and ſo fled out of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and ſaued his life in <hi>Zoar,</hi> which hee <note place="margin">

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:164:16"/>
ſoone as euer hee heard the cocke crow, remembring CHRISTS warning, he went out, and wept bitterly. It was GOD al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighties expreſſe commandement to his owne people, that they ſhould in no wiſe haue any intercourſe of friendſhip or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie with thoſe idolatrous nations, which they were to paſſe by, as they went into the land of promiſe, the tranſgreſſion whereof was puniſhed in <hi>Iehoſophath</hi> King <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 34 12.</note> of <hi>Iudah,</hi> who making a league and giuing aide to that wicked King <hi>Achab,</hi> had a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſent vnto him to reproue him, and to tell him, that becauſe hee did helpe the wicked, and loued them, that hated the <note place="margin">2. <hi>Paral.</hi> 19. 2.</note> LORD, the wrath of the Lord was kindled againſt him, which within a little while after the LORD alſo did execute vpon him. Since the Lord GOD is ſo angrie with the wicked, that hee holdeth thoſe for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that are friends to the wicked, haue no fellowſhip with their vnfruitfull workes of darkeneſſe, but, if you loue yourſelues, or deſire to haue GOD and good men your <note place="margin">

and friendſhip with them long, they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row you and teare you in peeces, euen as Wolues are wont to worrow ſheepe, when they get them in their clawes. It is not ſafte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for the lambe to dwell with the Fox, nor for the doue to houſe with the hauke, it is no policie for the ſillie Mouſe to truſt her ſelfe with the Cat, it is dangerous for ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to lie neere the fire. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had rather <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 12.</note> loſe his cloake, then to hazard his credit, or tarie in her company, that entiſeth him to ſinne againſt his owne conſcience. It is the wiſedome of Serpents to ſtop their eares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 7.</note> muſt flee the companie of the wicked, if they will not be poiſoned and peruerted by the wicked. A man cannot touch pitch, but <note place="margin">

For as he ſtraineth vp one ſtring and letteth downe another, thereby to accord them together, ſo muſt a good Magiſtrate ſometime be remiſſe, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time vſe rigour: but as there is leſſe danger in letting down a ſtring then in drawing it vp, ſo is there leſſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill to rule remiſſely and with mercy, then with rigour and ſeuerity. Magiſtrates are gods vpon the earth, and it cannot be denied, but they are the beſt Magiſtrates that come neereſt the example of God.

            <p>The ſecond thing wherein wee muſt not be too iuſt is our obedience, wherein we muſt giue honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to all God Almighties Magiſtrates, firſt to the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> King as hauing the preheminence, and then to other inferiour rules ſent of him, and ſet ouer vs by him, whom we muſt obey in all things that are in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to command, and in ours to performe.

If this doctrine bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to the rule of iuſtice in obedience, then are they too iuſt, that refuſe to obey their Princes in theſe things, that are of this nature vnder a pretence of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, who doth hold himſelfe diſobeyed of them, that in ſuch things diſobey their Princes. <hi>Non ea reiecerunt, ſed me:</hi> they reiect not them (ſaith the <note place="margin">1.

            <p>The third thing, wherein we muſt not be too iuſt is conſcience, when our conſcience is erroneous.

The cauſes inducing conſcience to error are many. In ſome it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the malice of Satan, who, when he can not tempt them to great and groſſe ſinnes, he ſeeketh many times to vexe them with ſcruples of conſcience, troubling them in their imaginations, and ſometime peruerting the iudgement of their mindes onelie through aboundance of melancholie humors, that raigne in their bodies, <hi>Mille ſurgunt apud aliquos ſcrupuli</hi>

            <p>In ſome error of conſcience proceedeth of meere <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anton. part.</hi> 1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. 3.</note> negligence, when a man ſtanding doubtfull of any thing, wherein he ought to be reſolued, or being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of any thing hee ought to know; neglecteth to take counſell in time of them, that are able to informe and reforme him in his doubtfulneſſe and ignorance, and ſo it was with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> before hee came to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In other ſome it proceedeth of the proude conceite they haue of their owne learning and wit, thinking ſcorne to humble their vnderſtanding to men of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter iudgement and knowledge then they are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his confeſſions acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth to haue been his fault many yeares, whereby he remained obſtinate a long while, and would neither be brought to baptiſme nor beleife, but being morallie learned in the ſeuen liberall ſciences hee defended his errors againſt all men, and would not be remoued, till at laſt by hearing of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> he was brought to change his minde, content to ſubiect his reaſon and learning to the obedience of faith, which (as hee ſaith himſelfe of himſelfe) if he had not done, he had ſtill liued and died in error, and neuer beene ſaued.</p>
            <p>In otherſome it proceedeth from a certaine ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:164:27"/>
of minde, a vice, that delighteth to be oppoſite to authoritie, and maketh a man to carrie himſelfe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in opinion and iudgement from other men, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be noted and pointed at <hi>prae caeteris,</hi> becauſe, as the <hi>Poet</hi> ſaith of ſuch, they thinke it a kinde of credit and glory to them <hi>notarier &amp; dicier, hic eſt,</hi> to be a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man, and to haue it ſaid of them, this is he, which was a thing, that the proude hipocriticall Phariſes much delighted in, wherein alſo they haue many followers euen at this day.</p>
            <p>In otherſome it proceedeth from a certaine inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affection and admiration of their perſons, from whom they haue receiued their opinions. <hi>Nimius enim amor &amp; nimium odium in errorem inducunt &amp; peruertunt iudictum, Senec.</hi> Extreame loue and extreame hatred lead men into error and peruert their iudgement, as is to be ſeen in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> where ſome held of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſome of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and ſome of <hi>Cephas,</hi> euery man, as he fancied the man, whom he followed, which is likewiſe one of the greateſt cauſes of ſchiſme and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in our Churches, wherein ſome humerous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons delight to draw diſciples after them, and other ſome hauing itching eares do turne their hearing from the truth, and delight to heare onely thoſe, that will <note place="margin">2.

From theſe and ſuch like cauſes proceede all errors in conſcience, for reformation whereof we are heere for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to be too iuſt in theſe extreames, and bidden to ſuffer our conſciences to be guided by thoſe rules of Iuſtice, which ought to direct our conſciences, whereof there are many.</p>
            <p>One and the firſt is this, <hi>In indifferentibus plus obligat praeceptum principis. &amp; pralati, quam propria conſcientia,</hi>
