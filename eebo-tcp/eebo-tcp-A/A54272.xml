         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>called by the Name of the LORD, why ſeek ye to ſtop the Leadings of his pure Spirit of Life in his Children, that ſeek nothing but to ſerve Him, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in any thing but to obey Him? the glory of this World, and the favour of men they deſpiſe. Why, why Cannot you let them have their Conſciences at liberty to ſerve the LORD? In our Father's Houſe is Bread enough; to Him wee muſt go; in Him our Souls take pleaſure: It's His Right alone to Rule, and wee cannot give it to any other, neither can we bow to the Will of any, though becauſe of that wee be caſt out from amongſt You; in Meekneſs, Love, and Lowlineſs of Mind wee can bear your hard ſpeeches, but only as the LORD leads, ſo muſt wee follow Him. O the riches of his Love! who can declare it? Is the Croſs now become an offence unto you? that none can truly take it up and eſcape reviling. Ah, my Father! the Noble Birth thou haſt raiſed up, that muſt follow Thee fully; its joy and delight being only in doing thy Will, and thy Peace is reward enough: In the quiet retired mind let all ſink down this day, and they ſhall know that ſaying fulfill'd, <hi>Not one barren amongſt them, but every one bearing Twins.</hi> Oh, thou pure righteous Seed! who teacheth like Thee? Thy Glory is excellent, and cannot be given to any other. Oh ye wiſe men, quench not the Spirit, ſeek not to quench the Spirit, but let it ariſe in whom it will, and be not you ſo troubled, for as much as ſome there be that muſt be kept chaſt unto it, and are willing to lay down their lives for its ſake. Many years tryal have wee made of it, and found the virtue and life thereof, and it a preſent ſtrength in all temptations, its love and bounty in all ſufferings. O my Soul, bend to none that would oppoſe its Leadings, it being known to thee the chiefeſt of ten thouſund; yea, <hi>the Marriage of the LAMB is truly come, and the Friend of the</hi> BRIDEGROOM <hi>greatly rejoyceth to hear the</hi> BRIDEGROOM's <hi>Voice:</hi> They who ſtand and hear Him, have no deſire to cumber themſelves with many things, but to keep waiting in ſilence.<note place="margin">10th day of the Month called <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> 1670.</note> O GOD of mighty Power, ariſe and reign in thy full Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, in the Hearts of all thy dearly beloved Children, who cry night and day for thy Preſence, and nothing elſe can ſatisfie.</p>

               <p>I Am truly glad thou art at liberty again, although I did believe thou mighteſt obtain it when thou pleaſedſt, no Law being broken: Yet, for thy Family's ſake, thy Liberty is deſirable, except thy Confinement were of publick ſervice, and not to be prevented without unlawful complyance. People are generally diſſatisfied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this paſſage of thine, for that (beſides the probability that thou wouldeſt have burnt thoſe Books which the Porter carried after thee into the middle of the Exchange, and there (as ſeems by thy Paper) poured out) thou doſt not declare to what end and purpoſe the ſaid Act was. Perhaps thou intendedſt only to burn ſome looſe and vain Pamphlets, to give publick deteſtation of their vanity; or, perhaps thou didſt intend to burn ſome of thy Friends Books, and other good Writings, to ſhew that they are too much idolized, that people look too much without, and that time will be when they ſhall be laid aſide. A <hi>meaning</hi> I am perſwaded thou hadſt in it, which thou thinkeſt not fit to publiſh. In the mean time, ſince the Action had nothing of poſitive evil in it; and ſince I, and all that know thee are aſſured that there could be nothing in it of ſelf-intereſt, or diſhoneſt project, it becomes us to be ſlow (if not mild) in judging.
