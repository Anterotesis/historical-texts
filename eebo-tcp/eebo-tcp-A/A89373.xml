            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Moſt Strange and VVonderful News from a place call'd the</hi> LEISTER, <hi>By</hi> Caſtle-Street, <hi>in the Pariſh of St.</hi> Martins <hi>in the</hi> Fields: Of a moſt Dreadful Diſcovery of a Murther of a Man and a Child, made on <hi>Sonday</hi> Morning being the 11th inſtant, on a Dunghill there; of the finding the <hi>Skin,</hi> and <hi>Nails</hi> of a Mans Hands, with his Privy-Members, Heart, Liver, Breaſt, and great Quantities of the Fleſh of his Buttocks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> alſo the Hart, Liver, Hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of a Child, with the ſtrange Manner of the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very by a Butcher, and one <hi>John Williams</hi> a Labouring Man.</head>
            <p>AS for the Hainouſneſs of this <hi>Sin</hi> of Murther, I ſuppoſe none can be ignorant that it is of the deepeſt Die, <hi>a moſt loud crying Sin.</hi> This we may ſee in the firſt Act of this kind, that ever was committed, <hi>Abel</hi>'s Bloud crieth from the Earth, as God tells <hi>Cain,</hi> Gen. 4 10. And it is worth our Notice, what ſtrange &amp; miraculous means it hath often pleaſed God for to ufe for the <gap reason="illegible" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap>covery of this <hi>Sin;</hi> the very Brute Creatures have often been made Inſtruments of it: Nay, often the extream horrour of a man's own Conſcience that will in ſpite of him be privy to the Fact, and that very often proves a means of diſcovering of it to the <hi>World.</hi> But to <hi>proceed to the Relation:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ON <hi>Sonday</hi> the 11th of <hi>March</hi> Inſtant, an honeſt <hi>Butcher</hi> coming over a place call'd the <hi>Leſter,</hi> a Heap of <hi>Dung-hills</hi> near <hi>Caſtle ſtreet,</hi> not far from St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s<hi>-Church,</hi> eſpied the Skins and Nails, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of a Chriſtians Hands, which taking up, and being Very curious, ſhew'd them to ſome of the Neighbours, upon which great ſearch was made, in order to a farther Diſcovery; and between Eleven and Twelve at <hi>Noon,</hi> one <hi>John Williams,</hi> a <hi>Labouring-man,</hi> diſcovered [about 30 yards from the Place where the <hi>Hands</hi> were found) the <hi>Privy-members, Heart Liver and Skin of the Breaſt of a man; and at the ſame Time were fouund great quantities of pieces of Fleſh, ſuppoſed to be cut off from the Buttocks and Thighs of the ſaid Perſon, cover'd over with a little Bubbiſh onely: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo there was then found the Skinny part of the Hand of a Child, with the Heart</hi> and <hi>Liver,</hi> &amp;c. as ſince upon the View of ſeveral able <hi>Chyrurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> it does moſt plainly and evidently appear; the Skin and Fleſh was freſh and ſweet; which ſhews it was but newly done.</p>
            <p>At This Inſtant further ſearch is made in all parts thcre abouts, in hopes to find the Heads, Legs, Arms and other Limbs belonging to theſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that ſome Light may be given as to the Murtherers and murthered. But at preſent there is not any perſon we hear of, that is ſo much as gueſſed at: It was obſerved, That the Skin of the mans Hands were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary White, ſo that 'tis thought they belonged to no mean perſon: <hi>That this Horrid and moſt Barberous Murther may be detected and the</hi> Anthours <hi>thereof brought to Condign Puniſhment, is and ought to be the Prayers of all</hi> good <hi>Chriſtians, to whom this Relation ſhall come.</hi>
