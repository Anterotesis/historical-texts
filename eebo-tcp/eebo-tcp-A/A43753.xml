            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I Whom the Lord hath called out amongſt you, and redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me from the abominations that is committed amongſt you, and hath ſet me as a ſign and a wonder, and my name is become a reproach in the mouthes of fools and children, and am looked upon as one unto whom ſome ſtrange thing had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and am deſpiſed and rejected by thoſe that were my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in wickedneſs and miſchief, in the daies wherein I walked according to the courſe of this world: But before the ſtrength of ſin was perfected in me, the Lord in the riches of his love cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me, and pluckt me as a brand out of the fire, yea the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God was ſo, that oftentimes (though young in yeers when I was in the wayes of ſin and evil) the witneſs of God in my own conſcience accuſed, and let me ſee the evil of my wayes, and then my own heart condemned me in ſecret, which cauſed me many times to mourn and walk ſadly in the ſenſible feeling of the Lords juſt judgement in my heart and conſcience againſt the evil of my waies, though not ſo wicked and common in all groſſe ſins as manie of my familiers were, yet was I not free from fear and torment in my own heart: And in this eſtate I went of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the place called the Church, thinking thereby to get peace
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:32118:2"/>
in my own heart, and by the knowledg of God I thought there to finde; but from thence I came mourning and troubled in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, becauſe in that which is called good duties I found no peace, nor ſatisfaction to the oppreſſed in me, and here I witneſſed truly that ſin was to me a burden; ſo that manie times I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part into the fields to pray and mourn in ſecret, deſiring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then the knowledge of the onlie true God which ſaves from ſin, for the want of which was my ſorrow: ſo after a time in this condition, the Lord heard the true deſires, and raiſed a ſwift witneſs in me, that the waies of man were evill continually, and that ſelf muſt be denied, and a croſs to it muſt be borne, and ſo the life of Chriſt Jeſus was manifeſt unto me, which being known and received, redemption from ſin and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from condemnation was witneſſed according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Faith in Chriſt the Light, by which ſin is made manifeſt; ſo the knowledge of the pure God was revealed, (even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the imaginations of man in the ſenſuall wiſdom) and he being known and his judgements received, the hard heart is broken and the darkneſs expelled, and his fear which is a ſhield againſt ſin is witneſsed, whereby the heart is kept pure and clean in his ſight, and here to ſtand a witneſſe for God, againſt all that talk of his name and fear, but know not the life and ſtrength thereof.</p>
            <p>And now hath the Lord opened my mouth, to declare in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs and truth the things which I have ſeen, and am a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt; even the great abominations that is committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you Inhabitants of <hi>England,</hi> the ſound of which rings into other Countries, and your lewdneſs doth exceed many other places, and your ſins are more in number then the ſins of <hi>Sodom,</hi> or many other places which the Lord hath overthrown for their wickedneſs, becauſe they repented not, but refuſed to know the Lord: Therefore harken and conſider, for aſsuredly the Lord hath a controverſie againſt you, becauſe there is no knowledge of God amongſt you, but altogether walking in vanity and in uncleanneſſe, for your young men are wild and wanton, whoſe minds runs after women and ſtrong drink, and the aged men and women are living and delighting themſelves in vanity and lewdneſs, even the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32118:2"/>
and the pride of life; ſo that the knowledge of God is even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and oppreſſion, covetouſneſs, and deceitfull dealing is received and exalted amongſt you, and much of the Creatures of the Lord is deſtroyed amongſt you, through the luſt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and that abominable ſin of drunkenneſs you are highly guilty of, and lyeing, and ſwearing, and pride, and greiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exaction in your buying and ſelling is found amongſt you, eſpecially in a time of quick tradeing, and through the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of this unrighteous gain and eaſe in the fleſh, you are grown groſs and fat, that you are even as the Beaſts that is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the ſlaughter. And this is not the number of thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, but you are ſet againſt the Lord, and being heart-blind you know it not, neither deſire the knowledge of his waies, but deſpitefully uſe them that are ſent amongſt you, for ſeverall times hath the Lord brought me amongſt you to bear witneſs againſt you ſin, and idolatrous worſhip, and once was I hailed out of your Synagogue, and once beaten in your ſtreets, and often ſtoned and mocked, with my friends and brethren with me; yea all this is done, and few there be that lay it to heart; and becauſe judgement is not executed upon you ſpedilie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your hearts are bent to do wickedlie, but aſsuredlie the day of the Lord is at hand, wherein all theſe things will be brought to your remembrance, and your own hearts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſhall condemne you in that day, when he brings his judgement near unto you, for he hath long born your ſinns, and given you reſt and fruitfull ſeaſons, and his goodneſs hath not been reſtrained from you, but in all this you have not known him, but his grace and mercy herein hath been turned into wantonneſs, and to the luſt and libertie of the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Woe, Woe, to all drunkards, for the day will come, wherein the Wine and the ſtrong drink ſhall be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then ſhall they weep and houle for thirſt and not be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and woe unto all you whoſe delight and life is in any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for the Lord hath determined to make the earth empty and deſolate, and all the glorie of man to deface; for verilie I have heard from the Lord a voice of terrible judgement, which will make all the Inhabitants of the earth to fear and tremble, for the Lord in his judgement will be known, becauſe in his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32118:3"/>
mercie man knows him not; therefore repent, repent whil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt his mercie is, before the day of deſolation, and miſerie come.</p>
            <p>Then woe unto you who have been the teachers of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who for filthy lucre have deceived their ſouls, teaching for doctrine the traditions of men, daubing the people with fair words, becauſe they put into your mouthes, but he that doth not you even prepare war againſt him, and peace you ſay to the rich, and judgement to the poor in ſpirit, and ſo the word is not divided aright, but truth is turned backward for the waies of unrighteousneſs, and you through your learning and arts, have been idolized manie dayes, but now your flatterie is ſeen, and your learning is come to naught, and your unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs will be made manifeſt to the eyes of al people that have been deceived therevvith, and all your righteouſneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousneſs is ſin in the ſight of God, and your revvard ſhall be accordinglie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore all, both prieſt and people, conſider of your waies, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend your lives, for verily the Lord will not be mocked although for a time he may be ſilent, for all your aſſemblies and pretended worſhip is abominable in the ſight of God, whileſt you continue in the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heathen, and all your performances is but the tradition of men, perfomed in a cuſtomary way, in ignorance of the knowledge of the living God, whom you ſay you ſerve, but the wild ſcornfull nature knoweth not the Lord of glory, and how can you ſerve him whom you know not, yet are you nouriſhing your hearts in that which the blind guides teaches you to obſerve, thinking thereby to find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with the Lord, but it is all polluted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And novv as concerning that vvhich you call the ordinances of God, and the order in your Church; novv ſee from vvhom you have your exampel, for it is altogether contrarie to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Servants of the Lord in all generations the Scripture of truth bearing teſtimonie to vvhat I ſay, and thereby let your doctrines be tried: and firſt, vvhat command or example do you think you have for ſprinkling little childern, calling that baptiſme, or an entrance into the chriſtian Church &amp;c. And if you vvould go to the vvritings of the Apoſtles for proof for this practiſe, it is not there to be found, neither vvas it ever
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32118:3"/>
their practiſe, but it is that which by the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Popiſh</hi> affected Prieſts was ordained, and by ſuch it is upheld to this day, through the ignorance that is yet remaining in the earth; but this is known and confeſſed, that water baptiſme was once the adminiſtration of <hi>Iohn,</hi> who bare witneſs to the true Chriſt, and ſaid, <hi>that is the true Chriſt which enlightneth every man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the world, who by his death and reſurrection put an end to all that ſtood in the outward Covenant, he being the ſubſtance of all types and ſhadows,</hi> who ſaid <hi>henceforth is the Father worſhiped in ſpirit and in truth</hi>; but you are ſo far from the power and life of that adminiſtration, that you are not in the true form and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, though you falſly ſay the Scripture is your rule, and the Apoſtles practiſe your example, but ſprinking of children was never the practiſe of the Apoſtles, but the inventions of the erronious ſpirit.</p>
            <p>And as concerning your practiſe ſinging in of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms, prayers and Propheſies in rime and meeter, ſaying let us ſing to the praiſe and glory of God ſuch a Pſalme, then doth all the multitude ſing after the Prieſt, when paradventure there is many drunkards, and ſwearers, and adulterers, and fighters, and proud perſons, ſinging all with a voice they are not puft in mind, but as harmleſs as a weaned child, and ſuch like words is uttered in the blaſphemous ſpirit without an underſtanding, in the Anti-chriſtian ignorance; ſo that this is abomination to the Lord, and not to his praiſe; but <hi>David</hi> being as a weaned child, even harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and innocent, he could ſing to the praiſe of the Lord, with an underſtanding according as the ſpirit gave him utterance, and that is owned by the children of the Lord, and approved of in the light of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now what example is there for Prieſts to require, or people to give them ſo much a yeare, even the tenth part (or near) of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the fields, and of the labour of themſelves, and the labour of their cattel, for preaching the traditions of men, upon the firſt day of the week; through which unrighteous gain, they are at eaſe in the luſt and liberty of the fleſh, being thereby mantained, with their wives and children, in all ſuperfluity and gorgeous apparell, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out labouring in the creation, bearing rule by their m<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>And now I exhort all in the fear of the Lord God, to mind the light of Chriſt Jeſus in your conſciences, making manifect all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousneſſe, &amp; condemning you in your own hearts for all the evil that you are exerciſ'd in, &amp; turn aſide from following of blind guides, even ſuch as go in the error of</hi> Balam <hi>for gifts and rewards, and in the ſteps of the falſe Prophets of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>who ſtudyed and divined for money, ſeeking their gain from their quarter, &amp;c.

                  </gap>ing to the knowledge of God; but the spirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is now made manifeſt, which is the originall of all truth and righteouſneſſe, and by it the miſteries of the kingdome of heaven is revealed, and all unrighteous prctiſes of men are by it diſcovered, and it ſearcheth and knoweth all things, and without it none knowes the Lord as he is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore all people come down to the manifeſtation of that ſpirit in your own hearts and conſciences, which will give you the knowledge of ſin, and every evil way, and it will diſcover the very thoughts and intents of the heart, yea all the evil luſtful deſires in the heart of man, are by it made manifeſt and condemned; and as faithful obedience unto it is yeilded, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed which by it is manifeſt to be evil, ſin comes to be deſtroyed, and the knowledge of God comes to be revealed in and by Chriſt Jeſus, who hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned every man that cometh into the world, giving unto all men a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his ſpirit, that in the day of judgement all might be left without excuſe; ſo that all they that believe in the light and follow it, ſhall not a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bide in darkneſs nor come under condemnation, but all that turn from that light of Chriſt in the conſcience abides in darkneſſe, and in ſin, and under condemnation, whatever their profeſſion is, and none ſhall ever be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God, who are condemned in their own hearts and conſciences by the light of Chriſt Jeſus; who is one with the Father, and anſwers to him in judgement, and in mercy as he is followed; and whoſoever will fellow the light of Chriſt in the conſcience, muſt deny themſelves, and bear a croſs to their own wills, and all mens will in whatſoever is thereby made manifeſt to be contrary to God; for man being in the tranſgreſſion, this hath the Lord appointed and ordained to guide and direct man out of ſin and tranſgreſſion, if ever he be reſtored into the Image of God again; ſo that man in denying the light of Chriſt, remains in ſin, and by the light is eternally condemned in ſin, being under the chaine of darkneſſe, with the damned ſpirits that rules the children of diſobedience; he that reads let him underſtand.</p>
            <p>Now in the fear of the Lord, I warn you all that keep Beer, or Ale, or VVine to, ſell that you let no man have drink till he be drunk (as hitherto you have done) for in ſo doing the Lord will not hold you guiltleſſe, and all your gain and profit thereby is even curſt of the Lord; and beſide this I know, and you are alſo ſenſible of it, that when the creature is overcome with drink, then he is fit and ready with a little temptation to act uncleanneſſe with women, and to ſweare and lye, and quarrel, and fight to the abuſe of himſelfe, and the bodies of others, and more ſuch like evil practiſes is thereby committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you; therefore fear, fear the dreadful God, who takes an accont of all theſe abominations.</p>
            <p>And all you that are called <hi>Ranters,</hi> aſſuredly the Lord will enter into judgement with you, for all your whoredom, pride, and drunkenneſſe, and all uncleanneſſe, though in the preſumption of your ſpirits, you ſay you know no evil that you do in theſe or the like practiſes, yet the living God will
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32118:5"/>
make you know by his judgements that you are the moſt filthyeſt that lives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, and the manifeſtation of Gods ſpirit in your own conſciences will for ever condemn you, and will be unto you as an everlaſting burning, except you repent.</p>
            <p>And all you young men, amonſt whom I had my converſation in the dayes paſt, conſider for what end the Lord created you, and how you live in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, and in pleaſure, and luſt, and drunkenneſſe, and all the fruits of the fleſh, for which you were not created, but he that created you and gave you life, it was to ſerve him, the Lord of glory, and not your own luſts and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and all know aſſuredly that you are under the power of the Lord, who will caſt forth his fury as a flood, which will make all ungodly ones to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and be afraid, when he thunders forth his judgements upon all the world of ungodly.</p>
            <q>And herein have I cleared my conſcience toward you in plainneſs &amp; truth, makeing known unto you, that which the Lord by his ſpirit hath made known unto me concerning you.</q>
