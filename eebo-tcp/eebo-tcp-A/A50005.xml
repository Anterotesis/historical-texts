            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>IT is now a long while that ſome of my Friends have ſolicited me to publiſh the principall Obſervations I have made concerning Fruit-trees, by endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to perſwade me, that the Curious would be very glad to have, by this means, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto them, that which I have been able to learn upon this ſubject, by an experience of almoſt fifty years: During which I have employed all the time that I believed I might juſtly take for my Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement about them. At the laſt, I have yielded to what they deſired of me, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that deſign with the moſt exact or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that it was poſſible for me to do; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I am rather obliged to excuſe my ſelf, if any thing be faulty in my Obſervations, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the ſubſtance or manner of writing them, than to recommend the matter of my
<pb facs="tcp:61372:7"/>
               <hi>work; for, I am well aſſured, that will of it ſelf be agreeable enough. And were I ſo happy to have as many Approvers of my ſmall labour, as there are perſons which love Plants, I might ſafely boaſt of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the greateſt part of good men. Indeed, never did men ſo much employ themſelves about this nobleſt and moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant part of Agriculture, as they have done of late. There is ſcarce a perſon which talks not of Fruit-trees; nor is there any, but ſuch as lack land, that do not plant; and even thoſe, too, are pleaſed with the diſcourſe of it, and with the divertiſment they take in ſeeing Fruits and Trees well ordered in the Gardens: All imaginable Curioſities tending thereunto are ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; men ran even to exceſs and ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and our Age and Countrey have now no leſs improved themſelves in this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Recreation, than in thoſe high Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations and great Employments of the moſt eminent Profeſſions, for which it is at preſent as famous as any other that ever was; which gives me occaſion to ſay, that, If this Art deſerve not to be put in the
<pb facs="tcp:61372:7"/>
number of the beſt Sciences, and principall occupations of the mind; it hath, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, this advantage, that it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes kept ſome proportion with them, and hath almoſt inſeparably followed them throughout the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All Antiquity gives us aſſured proofs of this Truth; for, not to inſiſt upon the times of the ancient Patriarchs, who were the firſt in cultivating Trees, as well as in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Manners of men; It is certain, that the politeneſs of underſtanding, the knowledge of Excellent things, and the ſtudies of Philoſophy, were no ſooner entred among the Perſians and the Greeks, but that Agriculture followed them as their faithfull and innocent Companion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>From hence we read, that the Kings of</hi> Perſia <hi>thought they did not any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath that ſupercilious Majeſty (which made them to be adored by their Subjects as Gods upon earth) when they took care of their Gardens, in the ruling and ordering their Plants, and in forming the ſquares of them, themſelves: On the contrary, they beaſted to the Ambaſſadours which came
<pb facs="tcp:61372:8"/>
unto them from that Nation of the world, with they moſt eſteemed and feared, that they had planted the Trees in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards with their own hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for the Grecians, their moſt ancient Philoſophy, treated of by their Poets, is all interwoven with Precepts of Agriculture: And the chiefeſt of their Authours, who have given unto men the Rules of living well, by the knowledge of Morality; and have raiſed their Spirits to the ſearch of the moſt hidden parts of Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, piercing even into the ſecrets of their prophane Theologie; have, at the ſame time, and in the ſame writings, taught them the Art of Tilling the Earth, and of ſoliciting her; as ſhe deſires to be, before ſhe will enrich men with the abundance of her Fruits: I pretend not to make a deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the Ancient Worthies of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Nation, whereof ſome gave up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly to this buſineſs, as the moſt proper and commodious, in order to the leading of a quiet and vertuous life; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that there was nothing more come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and agreeing with a veritable Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
<pb facs="tcp:61372:8"/>
than by reaſoning with the Earth, to learn how to reaſon well with Men, and yet better with himſelf; Others, amidſt the great employments of their Eſtates, have at leaſt looked upon it as the worthieſt and moſt excellent divertiſment of Great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>When afterwards the ſtudy of Arts and Sciences paſſed into</hi> Italy, <hi>and</hi> Rome <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to rob</hi> Greece <hi>of its Rarities; the love of Trees did at the ſame time tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant it ſelf thither, and the knowledge how to order them did there encreaſe in the ſame meaſure, as Great Men and Noble Spirits appeared in that place: The</hi> Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio'<hi>s and the</hi> Laelii, <hi>not onely pleaſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this Exerciſe, but did alſo very well underſtand the practiſe and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of it; they knew what things were neceſſary for the embelliſhment of thoſe Gardens, which they cheriſhed with ſo much tenderneſs; and planted in order and method the Trees which theſe ancient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls (having onely the inclination without knowledge) ſet confuſedly in the earth, when they came with diligence to reſume
<pb facs="tcp:61372:9"/>
their labour, after they had triumphed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the enemies of the Commonwealth.</hi>

               <hi>As ſoon as politeneſs and the knowledge of excellent things, could arrive in</hi> Africa, <hi>the curioſity of Plants came alſo thither; and, amongſt other praiſes, which Hiſtory gives unto</hi> Maſſiniſſa <hi>King of</hi> Numidia, <hi>it takes notice that he had ſo great a care of his Gardens, and bore ſo much affection unto Trees, that his Labours overcame the drouth of his Territories, and made all ſorts of Fruits to grow there, that ſeemed to require ſuch Climates as differed moſt from his; that is, a more pleaſant and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Heaven: So that Art ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Nature,</hi> Africa <hi>was her ſelf aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to find within her ſelf ſo many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent productions of the Earth, whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe knew not ſo much as the very names: It is very likely, that this King had received his inſtructions, and followed in this the example of</hi> Scipio <hi>the Great, his intimate Friend, who, out of that affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which he had unto Plants, would doubtleſs plant trees in</hi> Africa <hi>as well as Trophies.</hi>

               <hi>I cannot but further take notice, how much</hi> Cicero <hi>(that admirable Spirit, who alone was capable of equalling the vaſt great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Roman Empire) loved this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable divertiſment: It is impoſſible ſo much as to read that which he makes his</hi> Cato <hi>to ſay of it, without taking up the ſame affections, and without being charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well by the Subject whereof he treats, as beauty and graces of his Expreſſions. But can any thing be added to thoſe ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable Delicacies of the great Poet, when in his Georgicks he doth, at once, witneſs unto unto us the exact knowledge and the extreme paſſion which he had for all that which concerneth trees.</hi>

               <hi>At length, this knowledge deſcended unto us, after it had paſſed through ſo many illuſtrious Nations; and it may ſeem, that our French men have taken it up as a part of that univerſall ſucceſſion which is fallen to them, of all the excellent qualities of thoſe great Perſonages, of whom antiquity ſo much boaſts: For it is certain, that there is no Nation of the world, amongst whom it flouriſhes, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,

               <hi>Some, perhaps, may accuſe me of ſtraying too far for a Gardiner, becauſe that I may ſeem, while I thus wander through ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Nations, to forſake the matter in hand; wherein I onely propoſed to my ſelf the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of thoſe Obſervations which I have made, during ſo many years, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the method, which I eſteem to be the beſt, in order to fair Trees and good Fruits: But it is impoſſible for me, in this rencontre, to hinder myſelf from flattering my paſſion by ſo great and noble examples; and I perſwade myſelf, that there are divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who will not think amiſs of it; for ſuch as are pleaſed with this recreation will not blame me for having an affection for what they themſelves love, and for diſcourſing upon it with the greateſt advantage that I can; and if the deſire of imitating ſuch worthy Perſons, be capable of making thoſe men reliſh theſe innocent delights, who, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb facs="tcp:61372:10"/>
now, were ignorant of them, I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that they will wiſh me well, and that they will entertain ſome good thoughts of him, who hath given them an inclination unto that thing, whereof they will find e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day more and more the Charms and Sweetneſſes: For our Agriculture hath in it this ſingular property, that ſuch as have once loved it, do never forſake it, but, on the contrary, do every year take much more delight in it than before; which ſhewes, that it hath in it ſomewhat of ſolidity and truth, which attracts men, by reaſon, and not by fancy: Indeed, all other pleaſures vaniſh, or do at laſt grow leſs by time; ſome are ruined by Reaſon, others worn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by Time, the greateſt part are deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by themſelves; and, being but weak Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies of our continuall Labour, or our ordinary Indigence, they become trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and unpleaſing, ſo ſoon as they have produced their effect: But the affection which is taken unto Trees, grows up every day with them: It ſtrengthens its ſelf in well-govern'd Spirits, as trees put forth ſtronger roots in a good Soyl. So that I
<pb facs="tcp:61372:11"/>
perſwade my ſelf, I might borrow thoſe words of the Poet to make up the Motto of a true Gardiner,</hi> Creſcent illae, creſcetis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Experience hath taught me this truth in mine own perſon; for having already paſſed atmoſt through all the degrees of Age, and being now entred into that of an old man, I have found, that this inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I took up from mine infancy, hath ever ſince, from time to time, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in me; ſo that I may boaſt my ſelf to have been one of the firſt that hath ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the true method of oringing trees to perfection, particularly Wall-trees and Dwarf-ſtanders; for I remember, that in my youth my curioſity led me to viſit all the Gardens then in reputation; I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented all ſuch as deſired to have fair Fruits, and would paſs for able men in this affair: I ſaw, even at that time, ſome great trees ordered well enough; but for all other ſorts of Plants, ſuch as are moſt now in eſteem, and do ordinarily prove beſt, I could not look upon them without compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Thoſe which then took in hand to

                  </gap>d Trees, their works deſerving to be equally deteſted by expert Statuaries and good Gardiners: for my part, making at the ſame time ſome
<pb facs="tcp:61372:12"/>
ſmall reflection upon that which trees do of themſelves require, to bring them to their perfection; It ſeemed unto me, that theſe which I ſaw maimed in this manner, did groan under the tyranny of their Maſters, and complained unto me of their cruelty: Guiding my ſelf, therefore, by reaſon, in a matter whereas yet I had no example, I found that it was impoſſible to receive that ſatisfaction, which ought to be expected from the beauty of a Tree, and the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of its Fruits, by forcing it thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt its nature; and ſo was quickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that, to do well, an order muſt be ſearched out, quite contrary to that which I ſaw practiſed; and that the nature of the tree ought principally to be obſerved, that it may be followed as much as is poſſible, in preſerving unto it the ſhape and extent which it deſires to have; and that in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off what is ſuperfluous, and making it handſom, care muſt be taken not to disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure it. I applied my ſelf principally to the culture of Wall-trees, working according to theſe principles; and in few years I found the advantage which this ſort of Plant
<pb facs="tcp:61372:12"/>
gives us above others. In which I was much aſſiſted, by the invention of graffing upon a Quince ſtock, and may ſay, that I alſo was one of the firſt that brought it into vogue, and which took notice of the profit and commodity of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will not enlarge my ſelf in this Preface, to diſcourſe upon this ſubject, becauſe I have made very ample Obſervations upon it in the ſequell of this Book: But I ſhall onely ſay before-hand, that as Wall-trees pleaſe me much better than all other Plants; ſo I love Quince-ſtocks for Plants againſt a wall more than all others: There are ſtill ſome perſons that are not of this mind, though but few; ſuch as will not endure, that men ſhould ſpeak to them of Wall-trees, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that they will have no other trees, than ſuch whoſe fruits and ſhape were known in our fore-fathers dayes; They would have this way of planting to paſs for a Novelty, which hath nothing in it deſerving the coſt that is to be employed about it: they ſay, that the fruits thus produced are not good, loſing thereby the taste that is naturall to them: That ſuch trees die immediately,
<pb facs="tcp:61372:13"/>
not being able to endure the torture which is put upon them; and that the pains and care taken about them paſſeth without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon the pleaſure received by them. Theſe are the great accuſations brought againſt Wall-trees: But, ſhould I undertake their defence, I would make uſe of no other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, than to lead ſuch enemies of this ſort of Plant into Gardens that are well kept, where they might ſee walls wholly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Fruit-trees, whoſe boughs are guided in a handſome order fully garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with leaves, and loaden with thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Fruits, whoſe bigneſs, ſavour, and colour do equally ſatisfie the taſte and eyes of ſuch as eat or behold them: This ſight would doubtleſs cauſe them to change their opinion; and, if idleneſs, or an averſion for excellent things, or covetouſneſs (which cauſes the moſt part of men to cry down ſuch things as they will not be at the charge of having) do hinder them from chooſing this pleaſure for themſelves; at leaſt, I am ſure they could not blame others for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delighted with them. It would alſo prove very eaſie to anſwer, otherwiſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb facs="tcp:61372:13"/>
can be ſaid againſt Wall-trees: For, as to the beauty of their Fruit, no man ſo much as doubts that they far exceed all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trees: And as for their goodneſs, I deny not but that there are ſome ſorts of Fruits which have a higher and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect taſte, when they grow upon great trees in the open air, than when planted againſt a wall, as amongst others, the</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:61372:14"/>
are the moſt excellent in thoſe ſeaſons, which do moſt abound with Pears, which are, the end of Summer and the Autumn: Now Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth us, that the poſition of the Wall contributes very much, as well to the goodneſs, as to the beauty of this Fruit, becauſe it requires much of the Sun to come to its perfection, and doth extremely fear great winds and overmuch cold; whereas, by this means, it finds the beat of the one encreaſed, and a remedy againſt the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of the others; ſo that at preſent we ſee, by the help of this invention, a very great aboundance of them in ſuch places, as heretofore had no more than were brought out of far Countreys, or, at leaſt, if ſome did grow there before, it was upon trees well ordered, that were planted in ſome Court, and could not otherwiſe be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but under the ſhelter of a whole houſe; and yet for all this they came not to their true colour, but, by their greenneſs, witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that they could not arrive at their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire maturity. It is a wonderfull advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which planting againſt a wall hath, to afford heat enough unto ſuch fruits as
<pb facs="tcp:61372:14"/>
require much more than our climate yeilds, and yet, notwithſtanding, not to give too much to thoſe which are content with that of ordinary trees, or which bring their fruit well enough to perfection in colder Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys: For by this means, we ſee in one Garden alone, that which heretofore could not be met with, except in many different climates; and the poſition of walls helped by the addreſs of the Maſter, incloſeth within one and the ſome place all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent qualities of far diſtant Countries, ſo t' at now we are no more obliged to fetch our</hi> Bon Creſtiens <hi>from</hi> Touraine, <hi>our</hi> Amadotes <hi>from</hi> Bourgogne, <hi>our</hi> Portail <hi>from</hi> Poictou, <hi>nor the S.</hi> Lezin <hi>from</hi> Anjou: <hi>All theſe do now grow at home with us, and the Gardens about</hi> Paris <hi>do now abundantly furniſh us with them all, which each of theſe Countreys gave us but in part, and by retail. As for that objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ſaith, That Wall-trees laſt but for a while: it is true, that they come to ruine in few years, when they are ill kept; but when they are carefully ordered, and as they ought, they afford a pleaſure unto a</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61372:15"/>
man during his whole life; and if they laſt not ſo long as great trees, yet they come to perfection ſooner without compariſon; For if they be well planted, and the trees well choſen, they may bear the first year, and are at their perfection in their fourth or fifth: Whereas great trees are ſo long in coming, up, that the expectation is able to weary out the most patient man. As for the charge which many perſons fear in giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this curioſity, it is not ſo much as they would perſwade themſelves; thoſe that are at much coſt about them, do certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bestow more upon what is uſeleſs than what is neceſſary; the ability of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner, with time, and practiſe, is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall, all the reſt conſists but in a few things: And therefore I can aſſure them, that, amongst all other divertiſments, to the which they can give themſelves, as there is none more innocent, ſo none that will coſt them leſs than this: I will ſay further, though I have undertaken this work onely for the ſatisfaction of ingenious men, and at the deſire of them that lo<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

for houſe-keeping, that, notwithſtanding, ſuch as will conſider the profit more than the pleaſure of Wall-fruits, ſhall from them be ſure alwayes to find their expectation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, I cannot endure that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhould complain of the care which this kind of tree requires, becauſe that in this conſists the chiefeſt pleaſure of them: It is this care, which by its ſecret charms fetters the Gardiner to his work; 'tis this which gives him a pleaſant divertiſment through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole year, even then, when the trees are unprofitable, and ſeem to be intirely dead: 'tis this which gives life to that pleaſing hope, which is often-times more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable than the very enjoyments of the Fruits themſelves, and which aſſords us almoſt as much pleaſure in the planting of the Trees, as in ſeeing them arrived at their perfection: 'Tis this which makes us to look upon theſe productions of Nature as our own handy-works, and to make that diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which all the world takes notice of, betwixt that which we have obtained by our Induſtry, and that which we have onely
<pb facs="tcp:61372:16"/>
borrowed: And do we not ſee in all other things of the world, that pains and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which ſeem to be of a very different nature, have nevertheleſs a natural ſociety, which binds them together by an inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſequence? It is an effect of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs, which having condemned men to the juſt puniſhment of perpetuall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, was pleaſed that they ſhould find their conſolation in their pains, and that they ſhould, in them, meet with ſweetneſs, which very often ſurpaſses the bitter of them: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, thoſe that have a ſtrong affection for any thing, never complain of the difficulties which they encounter in it. Theſe rather do, for the moſt part, ſerve but to encreaſe their pleaſure, becauſe they do ſet their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire on work; and this being ſeconded by hope, renders not onely the enjoyment more agreeable, but alſo forms a preſent delight, which often-times ſurpaſſeth even the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment it ſelf: For this reaſon, we do not hear thoſe that love Hunting complain of the wearineſſes of that painful Exerciſe: It being ſo true, that they place their delight in this trouble, that often-times they would
<pb facs="tcp:61372:16"/>
not ſo much as regard thoſe beaſts which they took ſo much pains to follow, if they could have them with the ſame eaſe that men take tame beaſts out of their yards. But, beſides all this, where, I pray, is that great trouble which men would afright them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with, in the ordering of Plants? Is there any exerciſe of the body which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not much more? And beſides, Are all Maſters condemned to do themſelves the work of their Gardiners? I know very well that ſuch as do ſometimes work upon them with their own hands, do from them receive more pleaſure than others; yet they alſo do receive enough, who are able to work themſelves, when they pleaſe, and to know whether ſuch as they employ do their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as they ought; for in vain doth the Maſter ſearch after good Gardiners, if he himſelf be not able to judge of their ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; and beſides that, he deſerves not to enjoy theſe benefits of the earth, who knows not how to reliſh them. It is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that he ſhould be well ſerved, when he knows not whether thoſe that ſerve him do well or ill: For this reaſon, I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:61372:17"/>
               <hi>affirm, that ſuch ought wholly to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from our Agriculture, who deſire to continue in their ignorance, either through an affected indifference, or a blame-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy idleneſs. It is not for their ſakes that I write this Book; and if I could, I would willingly forbid them, even to read it: But if there be any one who deſires to taſt of theſe innocent Pleaſures, and finds himſelf tranſported with this inclination, which is common to ſo many deſerving perſons, I can aſſure him, that he ſhall not meet with all thoſe difficulties wherewith the enemies of our Plants do threaten him: From this Book, he may preſently receive as much knowledge as is neceſſary for him to have for his divertiſment therein: provided, that at the ſame time he ſet apart ſome hours for practiſe, and make application of my Rules upon Trees, or cauſe ſome other to do it in his ſight: Here he will find, in ſhort, all that which mine own experience, and the acquaintance which I have had all my life long with the Maſters of this Art, could gain unto me after ſo long a time; and will, in a few hours, make his advantage of
<pb facs="tcp:61372:17"/>
that pains which I have daily continued for ſo many years. For it is certain, that a long Study, and great Practiſe are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make Obſervations in thoſe things which muſt be learned by Experience and Reaſon both together, and in which a man muſt often-times attend many years to make one ſingle Experiment, eſpecially where ſearce any one hath gone before, from whom he may take inſtructions with aſſurance: But he that finds gathered into one, all that a man could get by his own experience, during his whole Age (and that long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) or draw from the communication of others, will find theſe things very eaſie, by making uſe of his labour, to whom, at the firſt, they were very hard.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>I ſay not this, as pretending to boaſt that I have ſet down all that can be ſaid of this matter; for then ſhould I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten more than I know my ſelf: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I am throughly perſwaded, that I may yet learn many things entirely new; wherefore I do with much earneſtneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat all thoſe that are able to adde to my obſervations, or elſe can correct them, as I
<pb facs="tcp:61372:18"/>
doubt not but there are many who can; I intreat ſuch, I ſay, not to envy their skill to thoſe that love Gardening, and to my ſelf inparticular, ſince I ſo freely communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate unto them all that which I my ſelf have gotten. I know there are ſome great Perſonages of theſe times, who are of the moſt knowing in this Affair, whom, as they have all their life long mixed this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſment with their publick Employments and profound Studies of the higheſt Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; I do conjure, that they would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to deny a few hours more of their leiſure, to instruct ſuch as follow them in their inclination; and that they will not refuſe to adorn thoſe Gardens which they have alwayes ſo much loved, with the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our Language which they have in ſuch perfection; or at leaſt, that they will permit ſomewhat of this ſubject to fall from their hands, amongst ſo many noble Works, which daily proceed thence, and do raviſh into admiration all ſuch as behold them: It is not that I think of entering the liſts with them, or diſputing againſt them the prize of Agriculture: For, although I

know that it is this ſort of Contention which is eſteemed good and profitable amongſt men, by one of thoſe ancient Philoſophicall Poets, whoſe Authority I have made uſe of at the beginning of this Preface notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I have no other thought in it, but that of exciting them to appear in this field, being ready to yeild them the p<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

up in a dry and barren ſoyle to replant them in a better, than to chuſe them from a good Ground: being perſwaded that theſe thirſty trees meeting with a freſh Earth, doe immediately perceive that change, and ſpring with the greater vigour; But, Reaſon and Experience teach us, that Trees brought up in a hungry ground, finding but little nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment there, doe likewiſe put forth but few roots, and can therefore have but a ſmall growth of body, and that yellowiſh and moſſy; And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be afterwards replanted in an excellent ſoyle, having but few Roots they are not capable of drawing aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly that good nouriſhment which there they meet with, and conſequently of growing to any purpoſe. Beſides that, their barke being already dry and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered for want of nouriſhment, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that ſmall moyſture which they found in that barren ground, cannot eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive the ſap when it begins to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into the branches: On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Experience lets us ſee that Trees ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61372:21"/>
from a good ground, have alwayes good ſtore of Root, the body ſtrong and vigorous, and that when they are re-planted in a ſoyle as good (be it by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Art) they doe take againe very eaſily, and ſprout with great force.</p>

                  <p>The manner of planting Nurſeries, and keeping them in order.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO make a good Nurſery, care muſt be had eſpecially of three things: The firſt is, To chooſe good Plants: The ſecond, to place it in a good ſoyle: And the third, to dreſſe it well; becauſe the want of either of theſe three, renders the two others uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>To bring up a Nurſery of Pear-trees &amp; <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pommiers France, that is,</hi> Apple-trees as are not wild.</note> Apple-trees for High-ſtanders, and proper for the producing of large Trees, you muſt chooſe Peare and Apple-ſtocks of one years growth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Theſe come of the kernels of thoſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61372:21"/>
fruits, which to that end muſt be ſowne in <hi>March</hi> upon beds of earth well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared after the ſame manner that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diners ſow their ſeeds. Theſe kernels ſo ſowne and weeded during the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, wil put forth a twig ſtrong enough to be planted in a Nurſery the Winter following: The way to procure ſuch ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels with eaſe, is to ſift the huskes or remainder of Apples and Pears, when the Perry and Sider is preſſed from them: But without taking this trouble, you may buy, or cauſe to be brought, out of <hi>Normandy,</hi> both theſe ſorts of Plants already grown, where they ſow great quantities of them. The beſt Plant to graff ſuch Apple-trees upon, as you would have to grow againſt a wall, in Palliſades or Hedges, and ſuch as you deſire to keep low for dwarf-trees, is that of the <note n="b" place="margin">A kind of Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> Paradiſe-Apple-tree, which grows but little into wood, bears quickly and much fruit. Theſe kindes of Plants are brought up of ſpriggs, or cuttings, put into the ground, as alſo thoſe of Quince-trees,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61372:22"/>
whereof I ſhall ſpeak hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The <note n="a" place="margin">Diulcain.</note> Sweeting is another kind of Apple-tree, which comes very near to that of the <hi>Paradice-</hi>Apple, and which likewiſe grows from a ſprig; but the Plant of it is not good for this purpoſe, becauſe it growes too much into wood, and cannot be kept low, as a dwarf or ſhrub.</p>
               <p>To graff ſuch Pear-trees upon, as are proper to be planted againſt a wall, &amp; <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Contr' e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpallier,</hi> properly ſuch a hedge as is planted over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a wall on the other ſide of the walk.</note> in hedges, or to be kept low for Dwarf-ſtanders, the Plant of a Quince-tree proves the beſt, becauſe the Quince is naturally of a dwarfiſh ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and may very eaſily be kept low. <note n="c" place="margin">Such as are raiſed from the kernels of Pears or Apples.</note> Tree-ſtocks are not ſo proper for this uſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they by nature ſhoot up too faſt; and if you cut off any branch to ſtop their growth and keep them low, they put forth divers others with more force, and ſo till
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61372:22"/>
they arrive at their full growth, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce nothing but wood, and very little fruit: And further, that ſmall quantity of fruit which they do bear, is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily greener, more lateward, and worſe coloured than that of ſuch trees as are graffed upon the Quince-ſtocks; except the Portail, which graffed upon a Pear-ſtock becomes very good, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it be planted in a hot and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velly ſoyle, for in rich and cold grounds it hath no taſt. Next after the Portail thoſe of <hi>Bezi-d'heri,</hi> the <note n="a" place="margin">Butter-Pear.</note> Beurre and the Orange-Pear prove bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon a Pear-ſtock then any others, becauſe they do ordinarily beare much: Since then the nature of Peare-trees graffed upon a Peare-ſtock, is to raiſe themſelves into a great tree, and to grow much in wood, it is eaſie to be judged that if they be not plaſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt very high walls, where they may ſpread themſelves with freedome, they cannot take effect, nor be proper for hedges or walls of ordinary height, or be kept low, except in a dry,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61372:23"/>
ſtony, or ſandy ſoile, where meeting with a ſcant nouriſhment they cannot ſhoot upward with much force, and therefore in ſuch grounds they will ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt bear.</p>
               <p>Some do more eſteem thoſe Peare-trees that are graffed upon a Tree-ſtock than thoſe that are graffed upon a Quince, becauſe they think the fruit of theſe latter to be harſher and leſſe delicate than the others. Experience nevertheleſſe teacheth us, that this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is not true, and that the harſhneſſe which is ſometimes found in thoſe fruits that are graffed upon a Quince is not naturall to them, but is either cauſed by the over-moiſt and groſſe earth which nouriſhes them, or by the too great quantity of dung wherewith the ground was manured when they were planted. And indeed we may eaſily mark, that this harſhneſſe grows leſſe, and paſſeth away as the dung conſumes and the trees grow older: 'Tis for this reaſon therefore that trees ought never to be dunged when they are planted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61372:23"/>
there be a neceſſity for it; becauſe the dung renders their fruit leſſe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</p>
               <p>There are three ſeverall ſorts of Quince-trees: The firſt is that which is called the Apple-quince-tree, which beares a ſmall fruit, flat and round like an Apple. This kinde is not good to graff Pears upon, becauſe its nature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to that of the Apple-tree agrees not with the Pear, ſo that we ſee the Syens which are graffed on it, do lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh or dye immediately. This ſort of Quince-tree may be known by its leaf, which is round and ſmall; and by its wood, which is rough and full of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers; as alſo by its barke, which is whitiſh. The other two ſorts of Quince-trees, though both good to graff Pears upon, &amp; both bearing fair fruit, are yet very different, the ſap of the one being much ſweeter then that of the other, and conſequently better. This differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may be obſerved at the foot of old graffed trees; one of theſe ſorts not waxing big according to the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61372:24"/>
of the graff it beares, and therefore makes a knobbe round about the joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the graffe in the faſhion of a roll, which ſpoyles the ſhape of the ſtemme, and ſhewes that this kind of Quince-tree hath not the ſap ſo plentifull nor ſo good as that which encreaſeth equally with the graffe. From whence we may eaſily conclude, that this laſt kind is the beſt of all the three, and that this is the true Quince-ſtock upon which a Peare ſhould be graffed; it being a certaine ſigne that the ſappe is the moſt pleaſant and moſt conformable of all others to the nature of the Pear-tree, becauſe both of them are ſo perfectly joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and do grow equally great: this beſt kinde of Quince-tree may be known by its fruit, which is longer and bigger then that of the other ſorts; it may alſo be known by its bark, which is ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, blacker, and clearer; and by its leaf, which is longer and bigger than the others.</p>
               <p>Quince-ſtocks may be raiſed by ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the kernels as I have ſaid before, but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61372:24"/>
the beſt and more ready way is to have them from Shoots: to which end you muſt plant great ſtocks of the beſt ſort of Quince-trees, about four foot aſſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and at the time of the new Moon in <hi>March,</hi> cut them at an inch above ground, to the end that they may put forth ſtore of young Shoots, which muſt neither be ſtripped nor pruned for feare of withering; but after they are ſhot up to the height of about a foot and halfe, they muſt bee covered a foot high with good earth, to which muſt be mingled a little rotten bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mould to make them take root the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; The Winter following, if theſe young Sprouts have put forth any roots, they may be taken away though feeble, and planted in the Nurſery: After theſe ſhoots are all taken off, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to cover the old ſtocks all the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a little earth, &amp; to uncover them again in <hi>February,</hi> to the end that they may put forth new Shoots, which when grown up, muſt be heaped with earth as the former: and by this meanes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61372:25"/>
you may gather every year good ſtore of plants: There is yet another way of raiſing Quince-ſtocks in good ground, by couching ſome of the boughs of the trees in the earth in winter time, as they do with Vines. The ſame courſe may be taken to raiſe young plants of the Paradiſe-Apple, but they are longer in growing then the Quinces.</p>
               <p>The Plants proper for ſuch Nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as are deſigned for the graffing of Peaches, <note n="a" place="margin">Peach that cleaves to the ſtone.</note> Pavies, Abri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cots, and Plumms, are thoſe of young Damſon-trees and S. Julien-plums, becauſe their ſap is more pleaſant than that of other Plummes, and alſo becauſe they laſt the longeſt: Some there are that plant ſtocks of Abricots and Almonds, to inc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate upon them Peaches and Pavies; but theſe are very ſubject to a gumme which gathers about the Scutcheon (or Bud) ſo that if the Gardiner be not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry carefull to take it away or prevent it, the bud is often-times enoked and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by it: True it is, that when they do
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61372:25"/>
take, they bear very faire fruit, and, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, admirable Nectarines. For this cauſe, the beſt and ſureſt ſtock for theſe kindes of fruit, is that of Damſons, and the S. Julien, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that of Damſons, becauſe it laſts longer, and hath the ſweeter ſap. This ſort of ſtock is bred at the foot of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon-trees, and the S. Julien, which do put forth many ſuckers.</p>
               <p>The Almond-tree is likewiſe not bad for this purpoſe in ſuch grounds as are hot and ſandy: but it proves not ordinarily from a Nurſery, becauſe that being replanted it takes again but very ſeldom; It is for this cauſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to breed it in the place where it muſt ſtand; which is done by ſowing ſweet Almonds there at the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> after they have lyen in ſand to bud during the winter: and there like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to inoculate them with a Scutche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note n="a" place="margin">A <hi>Locil</hi> dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, a cloſe ſhot bud.</note> the bud not ſhot forth, that very year at the end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> when the greateſt force of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61372:26"/>
ſap is paſt; or elſe the ſecond yeare, if they be too weak the firſt. In the ſame manner the ſtones of Peaches or Abri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cots, may be ſown and inoculated; and theſe without ſtaying for the moneth of <hi>March,</hi> may be put into the ground as ſoon as the fruit is eaten: but the trees graffed upon them, laſt not ſo long as upon an Almond-ſtock.</p>
               <p>Peach-trees and Pavies may alſo be brought up from a ſtone, but they doe very often degenerate; and there are no Peaches but thoſe of <hi>Pau, Perſiques,</hi> Violet-peaches, and the common Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which doe ordinarily take this way.</p>
               <p>Abricot-trees, although they may be graffed upon all ſorts of Plum-ſtocks, doe nevertheleſſe beare the faireſt fruit upon thoſe that have the biggeſt Plums, and eſpecially when they are white. When they are inoculated upon Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, their fruit is dryer and more firme: thoſe Abricot-trees which come of a ſtone, bring forth leſſe Abricots, but earlier ripe, and of a quicker taſt then
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61372:26"/>
others, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>. makes ſome to eſteem them the more; but they do not agree with all ſorts of ground, and are better in thoſe that are hot than in the richer ſoils.</p>
               <p>The good ſorts of Plummes may be graffed upon all kinds of Plumme-trees, except ſuch as bear ſmall ſower Plums, becauſe their ſap is too harſh.</p>
               <p>To make Nurſeries of Cherry-trees and other red fruits, you muſt plant the Suckers of white and red <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Meriſiers</hi> are trees bearing ſmall &amp; ſowre Cherries: Of this fort are our Honey-Cherries and ordinary black Cherries, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the wild kinds of them.</note> Meriſiers, becauſe their ſap is more pleaſant and nouriſhing then that of the black Meriſier: There is nevertheleſſe a ſort of the red Meriſier, whoſe fruit is bitter, upon which the ordinary Cherry &amp; Hart-cherries being graffed, the tree becomes as ſtrong and as bigge as upon other ſtocks, but there growes a great knob about the joynt of the graff, which marres the beauty of the Tree, and ſhews that this ſort of Meriſier hath its ſap very ſharp and bitter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61372:27"/>
its ſtock encreaſeth not in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the graff.</p>
               <p>The beſt ſtock to inoculate or graffe <hi>May-</hi>Cherries upon, is that of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of forward Cherries, though it be true that thereby the fruit becomes not ſo bigge or faire, nor the tree it ſelfe ſo ſtrong as thoſe which are graffed upon good Meriſiers. The Cherry-ſtock is alſo better then the Meriſier to graffe <note n="a" place="margin">Groſſes grio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</note> 
                  <hi>Morella-</hi>Cherries upon, becauſe that tree ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily blooming much and bearing but little, it comes by being graffed upon a Cherry-ſtock to beare more plentifully, and preſerves its fruit better, becauſe the ſap of a Cherry-ſtock is not ſo plentifull as that of the Meriſier.</p>
               <p>It is in vain to have procured good plants, if care be not taken to plant them in a good ſoile. To this purpoſe, a ſoft earth muſt be choſen ſomewhat freſh, and which is rich enough to be planted upon without dunging, eſpecially when in it you would plant Nurſeries of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61372:27"/>
Pear-trees and Apple-trees brought up from kernels; for the dung breeds in the ground great white Worms, which eat the roots of the Plant, and cauſe it to die. Beſides that, Earth too fat and too much manured, breeds Cankers in the bark of the Trees, which deſtroyes them utterly: but if the earth be not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe good enough of its ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being amended, it is better to ſtay till the Plant hath put forth its third leaf before it be dunged, becauſe that after three yeares it will be ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to reſiſt thoſe Worms which the dung breeds.</p>
               <p>The ground moſt proper to plant a Nurſery in, is ſuch as hath neither been too much cultivated, nor too leight; but contrarily, that is the beſt which hath a body; and provided, that you have ſome ſhort ſmall mould to put about the roots in planting: that which is new broke up and hath lain long, is the moſt excellent of all.</p>
               <p>Having then found a good plot of ground proper to make a Nurſery, you
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61372:28"/>
muſt there open trenches of the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and depth of a ſpade-bit, placing them three foot, or three foot and halfe from one another, and obſerve, as much as you can, to make them ſo that one of the ends lie towards the South, and the other towards the North: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus diſpoſed, and the Nurſeries well graffed, that is, the Graffes ſet with their backs towards the South (which muſt alwayes be obſerved if you would graff well) or as near it as is poſſible, the trees do the better uphold one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and defend themſelves much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the great Windes of the South.</p>
               <p>The ground being thus prepared, you muſt in the moneth of <hi>November,</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> chooſe a faire day to plant it in, becauſe that in faire weather the earth is ſhort, eaſier to work, and better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſes the root of the Plant; but in ſuch ſoyles as are moiſt and lateward, it is better to ſtay till the end of <hi>February</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you plant, becauſe too much moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and water corrupt and rot the roots
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61372:28"/>
during winter. For this reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in cold and moiſt countreys the water muſt of neceſſity be dreyned out, &amp; the earth heighthened in the form of ridges, upon which the trees are to be planted: but the hot and early grounds muſt be planted in <hi>November,</hi> that the roots beginning before winter, whileſt the warm weather laſts, to put forth ſome ſmall filaments, may ſo unite themſelves with the earth, that the trees at Spring may thereby grow and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh much the better.</p>
               <p>Having choſen a good Soyle, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Seaſon, and a faire Day, he that would plant a Nurſery of Apple and Pear-ſtocks brought up of kernels, muſt obſerve to cut off half the root of the Plant, and to pare off the top to about ſeven inches: then to place them in the trenches at the diſtance of ſeven or eight inches betwixt each twig, and to put them no deeper within the ground than they were in that place from whence they were taken: the trenches, after this, muſt be filled with mould that is ſoft
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61372:29"/>
and ſmall, that it may the better encloſe the roots of theſe ſmall Plants; and the earth muſt be digged on both ſides, and heaped about the Plant, that no more of it appear above than the heighth of half a fingers breadth.</p>
               <p>Nurſeries of Quince-ſtocks, and ſuch as are deſigned for the bringing up of Dwarf-trees, be they Pear-trees, Peach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or Plum-trees, muſt be planted after another manner: For theſe Plants muſt be placed in the trenches at the diſtance of two foot from one another, and muſt be cut at 2. or 3. inches from the ground, to the end that they may put forth young wood upon which to graff; onely the Paradice Apple-tree muſt not be cut lower then a foot and half from the earth, becauſe this kinde of tree being a long time in growing big, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to preſerve its old wood to graff upon in a cleft, and to enjoy it thereby the ſooner. For by this kind of graffing it comes much more quick then by ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating it with a Scutcheon.</p>
               <p>Nor is it ſufficient for the bringing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61372:29"/>
up of fair trees, to have procured good Plants, and to have planted them well; but it is further of very great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to be carefull in the well ordering of them. To this end, about the moneth of <hi>May,</hi> when the little Pear or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-ſtock begins to bud, you muſt with your finger carefully take off all the buds but one from each ſtock, ſo that it may put forth but one ſhoot onely, and at the ſame time cauſe all the weeds to be taken away which are grown about them; and at the beginning of <hi>June</hi> in a faire ſeaſon, the Nurſery muſt be digged and laid even the depth of a good ſpade-bit in the middle of the furrow onely; for the Gardiner when he comes neare the Stocks at about a foot diſtance, muſt carry the ſpade lightly, and not enter it above half ſo deep as before, for fear of hurting the roots. This being done, it muſt be covered all over with Ferne, while the earth is yet freſh, about four inches thick, yet ſo that it choke not the Stocks: Afterwards, about the end of <hi>October,</hi> the Fern muſt be handſomely
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61372:30"/>
gathered together with the ſpade, and caſt into the middle betwixt the rowes of the Plants, and the Stocks muſt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be uncovered about the depth of half a ſpade-bit in manner of a trench, that during the Winter the raines and ſnow may the more eaſily fall to the roots of the Plants to moiſten them. In uncovering the Plants, the earth that is taken away muſt be throwne upon the Fern, to cauſe it to rot the better; but care muſt be taken to leave the earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the foot of the Plants an inch or two thick, that they may be preſerved from the froſt, and for fear of cutting or uncovering their roots.</p>
               <p>When the Winter is paſt, the Plants muſt be covered again in the moneth of <hi>March</hi> in a faire ſeaſon, and the whole Nurſery digged again and laid eeven. In digging it, the Ferne muſt be cut with the ſpade, and mingled with the earth, becauſe it ſerves for ſoyle, and hath a particular property to make the Stocks put forth a great many Filaments, or ſmall haire-roots. It is neceſſary that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61372:30"/>
the Nurſery be thus kept and renued af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame faſhion every year, untill the Plants have been two years graffed: But in thoſe Countreys where Fern is not to be had, the Nurſeries muſt be leightly digged thrice during every Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to keep them freſh, and to hinder the weeds from growing: Theſe three ſtirrings muſt be in <hi>March, May,</hi> and <hi>July;</hi> and in the moneth of <hi>October,</hi> the Plants muſt alwayes be uncovered, as I have before ſhewed.</p>
               <p>If the Nurſery being thus digged pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit not, it muſt in the moneth of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of the third year, be dunged; the earth being every where and equally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ſpread and covered with good, fat, half-rotten dung, to the thickneſſe of four inches, and at the ſame time digged to mix the earth and dung together. When the Nurſery is to be dunged on this manner in the moneth of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> it will be needleſſe to dig it, or to uncover the Plants in the moneth of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctober.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Care muſt alſo be taken when the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61372:31"/>
Plants begin to form their ſtemmes to cleanſe them by cutting off all their ſhoots to the height of ſix or eight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches onely to prepare a place for the graffe; and then to cut off nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that height, becauſe theſe young Stock are ſo tender that no branch can be taken from them, or their tops be cut without altering their ſap, which keeps them back, and much hinders their growth. For this reaſon, you muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, not to ſtrip or cut off any of the wood of the Quince-ſtocks, Plumme-ſtocks, or Meriſiers, planted in a Nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry before the moneth of <hi>March</hi> in their ſecond year; but then in ſtripping them it muſt be obſerved, that not above one branch (or two at moſt) is to be left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each root; which muſt at the ſame time be cleanſed to the height of about eight inches, to make place for the Scut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheons; and each ſtump muſt be cut cloſe, that it may be recovered when it ſhall be time to inoculate. In the ſame manner the ſtocks of the Paradice-Apple are to be prepared, that they may be graffed upon a cleft.</p>
               <p>

The Nurſeries of Stocks, being in this manner well planted and dreſſed, will be ſtrong enough to be graffed in their third or fourth year: thoſe of Quince-trees and Plum-trees in their ſecond.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that would make Nurſeries of Wall-nut-trees, Cheſt-nuts, or Oakes, to be planted in Walks, &amp; Avenues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Houſes, or in their Woods, muſt procure of the faireſt Wall-nuts, Cheſt-nuts, and Acorns, which muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately be put into beds of ſand, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Veſſels, or elſe in ſome Cellar or covered place, where the froſt may not hurt them, untill <hi>March,</hi> when they muſt be planted in good ground well digged; with this difference neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, that the Nuts muſt be ſet in tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches made eight foot from one another, and ſeven or eight inches betwixt each Nut. The Nuts, being ſo ſet and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as is before-ſaid, for the Nurſeries, will put forth trees ſtrong enough at 4. or five years to be taken up and ſet in the places where they are to grow: but
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61372:32"/>
the Acorns and Cheſtnuts muſt be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered very near to one another, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly in the trenches made at two foot diſtance, and covered with earth at the depth of four or five fingers onely: afterwards they muſt be kept with ſome ſmall ſlight dreſſing and digging for three years, without pulling or ſtripping them; after which time they are to be taken up and planted in Woods: Or if you be deſirous to raiſe them into tall trees, for Walks or Avenues, they muſt be ſet in a Nurſery like Peary-ſtocks: And then, when they are ſet into the Nurſery, they muſt be cut at an inch from the ground, and ſo left at liberty to ſhoot out till <hi>March,</hi> of their ſecond year; when they muſt be ſtripped to the height of half a foot onely, and but one ſprigg left upon them: After which, they muſt not be touched, nor any branch of them be cut, till they be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up to be placed where they muſt grow.</p>
               <p>Although, according to the order of my deſign, I am to ſpeak of no Trees,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61372:32"/>
but ſuch onely as bear fruit, having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed all my Walks within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of a Garden, yet hath the beauty of Woods and Walks carryed me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly out of it: And now I find my ſelf ſo far ingaged, that I believe I may, returning to the path from which I have ſtrayed, ſpeak a word or two of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſorts of wild Trees, with which Woods and Avenues may be planted, and the manner alſo of breeding them.</p>
               <p>For Avenues, men commonly plant Lime-trees, Elmes, Pines, or Firre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees. For the bringing up of Lime-trees and Elmes, the ſeeds of them muſt be gathered, and ſown in the moneth of <hi>March,</hi> upon beds of Earth, after the manner already mentioned, for Quince, and <hi>Pear-ſtocks,</hi> then covered with ſmall mould, or rotten leaves of trees: For 3. years you muſt keep them with a ſlight dreſſing, that the weeds grow not: Theſe Seeds thus ſown, ſhoot forth Plants which may well be taken up after three years, to be planted in Woods, or in Nurſeries, if you deſire
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61372:33"/>
to have them fair Trees, proper for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues; you may likewiſe take Suckers of Elms, and plant them in a Nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry like the <note n="a" place="margin">Srocks grown from Kernels.</note> Tree-ſtocks, or the Shoots of Quince-trees.</p>
               <p>To bring up Pines and Fir-trees, you muſt, in the moneth of <hi>October,</hi> ſow the ſeeds of them, ſcattering them without any order in ſhady places, covered with leaves, as in Woods that are ſomewhat open: And when they are come up, leave them there till they be three or four foot high, when you may take them up, and ſet them where they muſt ſtand, becauſe being removed when they are young, they do the more eaſily take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. They may alſo be brought up in a Nurſery; but then they muſt be taken up, being very ſmall; and if they are to be carried far, care muſt be had of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in bags, with their Roots well wrapped up in moſſe or earth, that they come not to the aire; and obſerve to plant them immediately in good ground in the ſhade, three or four foot
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61372:33"/>
diſtant every way from one another, that you may take them up with the earth about their roots, when they are fit to be ſet in the places where they muſt ſtand.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The manner of graffing the Nurſeries.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere being many different wayes of graffing, each where of is to be ſpoken of particularly and apart; I ſuppoſe, that not onely by the order of this Diſcourſe, but alſo according to that of the Seaſons, I am to begin with that which is performed in a Cleft, and to give the Rules which muſt be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in it.</p>
               <p>Graffing in a Cleft is that which takes beſt upon the Pear and Apple-ſtocks, becauſe it comes much ſooner then that which is performed by Inoculation. When the Stocks of theſe Plants are ſtrong enough to be graffed, the firſt Rule which is to be obſerved, is, to graff
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61372:34"/>
them all at one time; and to that end, to pull upall thoſe Stocks that are too weak, and plant them in ſome other place, for they would otherwiſe choke the Graffs, and hinder them from grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Then you muſt graff them in <hi>Febr.</hi> or <hi>March</hi> at the full Moon, that they may ſpring with the more vigour: For it is certain, that if they be graffed in the Wane, they will bear too ſoon. Care muſt alſo be taken to cut the Syens from ſuch Trees as are in their year of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and full of Fruit-buds; and when they are grown, they muſt be cut in the Wane, at ſix or ſeven foot high, to form the head of the Tree.</p>
               <p>To graff well after this way, you muſt cut off the Stock you would graff upon towards the bottom, five or ſix inches from the ground; it muſt be cut aſlope like a Hinds foot, to the middle of the ſtemm, and the other half flat, that thereby the Syen may the better be placed upon it: Becauſe the Tree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this cut, doth the more eaſily reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſelf. You muſt alſo be carefull to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61372:34"/>
cut this ſlope towards the North, for two reaſons: Firſt, becauſe it will not dry ſo ſoon as if it were expoſed to the South, and therefore recovers it ſelf the ſooner: And again, becauſe the back of the Graff muſt (as I have ſaid before) alwaies be turned towards the South, or as near it as may be; in as much as thereby it better reſiſts the great winds: And on the contrary, when turned with the back towards the North, it is by the leaſt wind looſened and broken. Now that the back of the Graffs may be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned toward the South, it is eaſie to be judged, that the ſlope of the Cut muſt be on the ſide expoſed to the North.</p>
               <p>It is further neceſſary to be obſerved, that no more but one Syen be put upon each Stock, how big ſoever, to the end it may form but one ſtemm, and alſo that the Graff may become proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the bigneſſe of the Stock, that is, ſtrong if that be ſtrong, and little if that be weak: As ſoon as the Tree is graffed, it muſt preſently be covered
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61372:35"/>
handſomly, and without ſhaking the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en) with clay or galt, mixed with very ſmall Hay or Moſſe, leſt it dry and crack.</p>
               <p>This way of graffing in a Cleft is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo beſt, upon Paradice-Apple-ſtocks, and Plumm-ſtocks, when you graff o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Plumms upon them: It is alſo good for Cherries and Meriſiers.</p>
               <p>Inoculating by a Scutcheon, with a <note n="a" place="margin">A <hi>Ocil Dormant,</hi> with a ſleeping or cloſe Bud.</note> Bud not ſhot forth, is better then graffing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Quince-ſtocks; and upon Plumme-ſtocks, when you put upon them Peaches, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies, and Abricot-trees. But the Scut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon muſt be placed upon young wood, and where the Stock is not too big, becauſe when the bark is hard, they take with more difficulty, &amp; are the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger before they be recovered. Now for aſmuch as theſe <hi>trees</hi> are ſeldom brought up with a high ſtemm, for Standers, but are for the moſt part deſigned to be planted in Hedges, againſt Walls, or kept low, as Dwarf-trees, and for that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61372:35"/>
reaſon ought to be branched from the foot, there may two Buds be put upon each Stock, when they are inoculated; onely care muſt be taken not to put them both upon one ſide, one above the other: For by that means they will harm one another, and coming to ſhoot will give an ill ſhape unto the tree. The beſt way to place them is on both ſides, and one higher than the other, becauſe when they are put over againſt each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it proves very hard to cut off the head of the tree betwixt the two Buds; and the place cut, will the more hardly recover it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Some there are, who do moſt eſteem the trees that come of one bud onely, accounting them handſomer then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Wherefore in the inoculating of them, they put but one bud upon each ſtock; for my part, though I am of their opinion ſo far, as to think thoſe trees which have but one ſtemm to be more naturall, and conſequently more beautiful than others, eſpecially Dwarf-ſtanders, which, to be well faſhioned,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61372:36"/>
ought to have their ſtemm about a foot high; yet I would counſel the putting of two buds alwayes upon every ſtock, becauſe, if either of the two take, the Stock may not fail: But then too, it is onely upon condition to leave onely the beſt growing, and to take off the other at the beginning of the ſecond year.</p>
               <p>This kind of inoculating, with a bud not ſhot forth, is to be performed in the wane of the Moon, in <hi>June, July,</hi> or <hi>Auguſt,</hi> alwayes upon young wood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath more ſap, and the bark, by conſequence, more tender, and eaſie to be taken up: For this reaſon, in the planting of Quince and Plumm-ſtocks, they muſt be cut at two inches from the ground (as I have ſaid before) to make them put forth new wood, but not ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated untill their ſecond year, to the end, that they may be ſtrong enough: For if they be weak, the Graff cannot ſhoot forth but with difficulty, and doth but languiſh. There being no more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain means of procuring fair trees, than by graffiing and inoculating upon a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61372:36"/>
Stock that is ſtrong and vigorous.</p>
               <p>The time proper for inoculating, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the quality of the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe according as that is early or late, ſo muſt the work there be earlier or later; it being eaſie to judge, that in hot Countreys, where the ſap begins to aſcend betimes, it deſcends alſo ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and on the contrary, that it laſts longer in moiſt grounds, where the Spring is more lateward: For this cauſe, the Gardiner muſt not alwayes ſtay for the ſecond ſap, but often inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late after the firſt, eſpecially upon Plum-ſtocks: It is true, that it is better to ſtay for the ſecond, when Abricot-ſtocks, Almonds, and Peach-ſtocks, are to be inoculated upon: Becauſe their firſt ſap is ſo aboundant, that if, while it is in force, the bark be cut to put in a bud, it iſſues out, and cauſeth a Gumm about the Scutcheon, which oftentimes chokes and kills it.</p>
               <p>To hinder this miſchief, the Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner muſt be carefull to untye the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon betime, to give way for the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61372:37"/>
of the ſap; but the beſt and moſt aſſured remedy is, not to inoculate theſe ſorts of trees, untill the end of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſap, after that the greateſt force of it is paſt: He muſt alſo be carefull, not to inoculate them, but in a dry ſeaſon, for the rain miſchiefs the bud, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the taking of it.</p>
               <p>Peaches and Pavies muſt alwayes be inoculated with a Scutcheon, upon Damſon-ſtocks, or the S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Julien, Abri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot, or Almond-ſtocks. But, as I ſaid before, the Almond-tree, if re-planted, very ſeldome takes again; wherefore, ſuch as would put Peach-trees and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies upon it, muſt ſow Almonds in the place where they deſire their trees ſhould grow; and thoſe ſweet Almonds onely, becauſe they have a better ſap to nouriſh the Graffe than the bitter ones.</p>
               <p>The Almond-tree takes much better than the Plumm-tree, in dry and hard grounds, becauſe, having but few roots, it needs not ſo much nouriſhment; it is alſo not ſo ſubject to put forth many
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61372:37"/>
ſuckers from its foot as the Plumm-tree, and wears not out the ground ſo much: But it decayes and dies much ſooner then the Plumm-tree.</p>
               <p>Plumm-trees may be graffed upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Plumm-trees, both by Inoculation, and in a Cleft; but the Graff upon a Cleft comes to its perfection very much faſter than that which is inoculated.</p>
               <p>Abricots may be inoculated upon all ſorts of Plumm-ſtocks; but they bear the faireſt fruit, when they are put upon ſuch as bring forth the biggeſt White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plumms, becauſe theſe are ſomewhat of their nature: And by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when they are inoculated upon the ſtock of a ſmall black Damſon, their fruit is dryer, firmer, and more proper for the Confectioner.</p>
               <p>Cherry-trees, and other red Fruits, may both be graffed in a Cleft, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculated <note n="a" place="margin">A <hi>Ocil-dormant,</hi> with a ſhut bud.</note> with a Budd not ſhot forth; but it is a better way, and more aſſured to inoculate them <note n="b" place="margin">A <hi>Ocil pouſſant,</hi> with an open bud.</note> with a Budde
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61372:38"/>
ſhooting forth: This kind of inoculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is like the other, by a bud not ſhot, ſave onely that it muſt be done about mid-<hi>June,</hi> and that preſently upon it the Head or Branches of the tree muſt be cut three inches above the Scutcheon, to the end that the ſap, finding no other courſe, may come freely to it, and cauſe it to ſpring.</p>
               <p>There is another ſort of graffing like unto that which is performed in a Cleft, which they call <note n="a" place="margin">Emporie-piece.</note> 
                  <hi>Taking out a piece,</hi> becauſe in this manner of graffing the ſtock is cleft but very little, inſtead whereof a place is cut in the wood to enter the Graff. This way of graffing is principally put in practice upon great trees, becauſe they cannot wholly be ſplit, without harming them much: and in graffing them it muſt be obſerved, not to cut off their heads too ſhort, nor too near the ſtemm, becauſe they recover not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great difficulty; and being ſo wounded, do very often die: You muſt alſo obſerve, to leave them ſome ſmall
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61372:38"/>
branches here and there upon the top of the tree uncut off, to receive a part of the ſap; for when that begins to aſcend, and inſtead of meeting great branches (as it was wont) in which to ſpread it ſelf, meets with nothing but ſmall Graffs, too weak to receive it all, it chokes them through its aboundance, and cauſeth them to dye: But then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Graffs are taken, and have well ſhot forth, you muſt in <hi>March,</hi> the next year after, take away wholly all thoſe boughs which were left, and cut them as cloſe as may be, to the ſtemm of the tree, that their places may the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be covered again. This kind of graffing muſt be put in practice in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> as well as the other which is in a Cleft.</p>
               <p>If theſe great trees have their bark too hard, and their wood too ſtubborn to be graffed upon, it will be better to cut off their heads ſomewhat high, to make them put out young wood and new branches, upon which you may graff, in their third year: But ſeeing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61372:39"/>
theſe great trees cannot be graffed but very high, and at the end of the boughs, care muſt be had to put ſome twiggs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Graffs as ſoon as they are put in; for coming to grow, their ſhoot is ſo tender, and ſo full of leaves, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the two firſt years they are very ſubject to be broken with the leaſt wind. Theſe twigs alſo ſerve to hinder the Birds from ſetling upon the Graffs, and ſpoyling them.</p>
               <p>There are, beſides theſe mentioned, divers other different wayes of graffing, as that which is called <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Enter en fluſteau,</hi> is, To lodge a ſhort Graff (cut off with ſome more bark at the foot then needs to cover it) within the tender bark of a ſhoot or branch that is little bigger then the Graff it ſelf.</note> 
                  <hi>En fluſteau</hi> (or, In a Flute) which is uſed for Cheſtnut-trees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Midſomer, when the trees are in their full ſap; And that which is made betwixt the bark and the wood upon great trees, which have their bark too thick: But this laſt ſort of Graff is not ſo good, becauſe it is very ſubject to be broken with the leaſt winds, and the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61372:39"/>
ſtemm can very hardly recover it ſelf. Some uſe yet another way of graffing, very extraordinary; They take the end of a twigg (about as long as the breadth of 3. fingers) of that Fruit which they would graff, which they ſharpen flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and in the moneth of <hi>March</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi> when the ſap is in the tree, having made an Inciſion, a-croſs in the bark of the Stock, they place the Graff in it, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with hemp, as in inoculating: This ſort of Graff does not ordinarily take, no more than that which is made by Approach.</p>
               <p>For graffing in a Cleft, it is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, whether you cut your Syens in the increaſe of the Moon, or in the wane, becauſe, that in the moneth of <hi>February</hi> (which is the proper ſeaſon for this ſort of graffing) there is no ſap in the trees: For which reaſon, you may, if you pleaſe, cut them even in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of <hi>December,</hi> or <hi>January,</hi> and keep them untill <hi>Febr.</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> provided nevertheleſs, that they be put half-way into the ground, every one apart by it
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61372:40"/>
ſelf; but in Summer, as all graffing muſt be performed in the wane, to bring forth much fruit, and the boughs cannot be graffed too freſh, being then in their full ſap; ſo they muſt likewiſe be cut in the wane: But that which ought principally to be obſerved for all ſorts of Syens, is, that they muſt be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from ſuch trees as are in their year of bearing, that is, very full of fruit, or of buds in order to it: For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Syens contain in them the ſame qualities with the tree from which they were taken: and therefore if the tree be in the year of its reſt, in the which it bears none, or but little fruit, they cannot be ſo good: And indeed, Experience teacheth us, that the Graffs which are cut from trees without fruit, bear alwayes but very little, and that very ſeldome. This hinders not, but that one may take Syens very good for bearing, ſometimes from Graffs of two years: For although theſe trees have no Fruit-buds, becauſe they are yet too young, they may nevertheleſs be in their
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61372:40"/>
bearing year, and ſo communicate that good quality to their Syens: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the bearing year cannot be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from that of their Repoſe, but only by their Fruit-buds, it is alwayes moſt certain, to gather the Syens from ſuch trees, as are full of thoſe buds.</p>
               <p>The Syen, which is a ſhoot but of one year, when the wood of it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come firm, is as good to be graffed in a Cleft, as that which bath old wood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: It is true, that this laſt beares fruit ſooner then the other; and in caſe of neceſſity, when Syens of the laſt year cannot be gotten, one may cut ſuch as are of two years growth; but theſe ſhoot not forth with ſo much vigour, as thoſe which are younger, and by the ſame reaſon do alſo bear fruit ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>The Nurſeries being graffed, muſt be diverſly cultivated, according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the trees which you bring up in thom: To keep thoſe Plants well which are graffed in a Cleft, and deſigned for Trees with a high ſtemm, ſuch as Pear-trees,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61372:41"/>
Apple-trees, and others, for ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, you muſt be carefull to pull off all the buds of the Graff as ſoon as it begins to ſhoot, leaving onely one bud upon it, that it may grow up but with one ſingle ſtemm: After which, they muſt be left to grow at liberty, becauſe the young ſprout is then ſo tender and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that the leaſt branch cannot be cut off without much altering the ſap, and wronging the ſtemm; which by that means would be the longer in growing big: For this reaſon, thoſe that are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-haſty to cleanſe their Nurſeries, by taking away the ſuperfluous branches too ſoon, do hinder them and ſpoyl them; for the Graffs, inſtead of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing big, and ſtrengthening themſelves at the foot in proportion to their growth, do, when they are pruned, ſhoot up ſuddenly, and not being able any longer to uphold themſelves, muſt of neceſſity be kept up with ſticks, which ſpoyls them, and hinders a good part of the Plants in the Nurſery from coming to good: It is therefore neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61372:41"/>
to ſtay untill the third year, before you begin to ſtrip the Graffs; and then alſo at the firſt you muſt be content on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to writhe the branches, which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to take away, with your hand, at three or four inches from the body, unto the height of two or three foot, to the end onely, to ſtop the ſap, and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it from quitting the ſtemm, and ſpending it ſelf in uſeleſs branches; but in the moneth of <hi>April,</hi> in the year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, thoſe branches muſt be wholly taken away, and cut off as near the ſtem as may be, that they may recover again the ſooner, and no knot be cauſed in that place, from which each of them was cut. In this manner, the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all uſeleſs branches from the trees muſt be continued from year to year, according to their ſtrength, to raiſe and bring up their ſtemm to ſix or ſeven foot high; at which heighth they muſt be ſtopped (by cutting them) in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of <hi>March,</hi> and the wane of the Moon; to ſtrengthen them downwards, and form their heads.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:61372:42"/>
Thoſe that are curious, to have Apple-trees with a fair ſtemm, and ſtrait, muſt graff their Nurſeries with Syens, taken from the Apple-tree, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>de Suraut,</hi> which bear great ſowre Apples; becauſe theſe Syens will the firſt year put forth a ſhoot of ſix or ſeven foot high, growing more in one year than others in two, and ſo in four years do make great trees fit to be taken up, and ſet in the place where they are to grow; upon which, two years after they may graff any kinds of good Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which they deſire to have.</p>
               <p>For ſuch Nurſeries as are inoculated with a bud not ſhot forth, being for trees deſigned to be planted againſt a wall, or to be kept low, as ſhrubs, or dwarf-trees, they muſt be ordered otherwiſe than thoſe whereof I have already ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: For the ſtock upon which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculate muſt not be cut off till after the Winter, when the bud is taken, and ready to ſhoot forth; and then you muſt obſerve, not to cut it lower than at three fingers breadth above the bud,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61372:42"/>
for fear of altering it; and for the ſame reaſon, to cut it aſlope, with the cut outwards; and after that, let the bud grow without touching it, except it ſhoot upward too ſtrongly without putting forth any branches: For then it will be neceſſary to ſtop it at half a foot high, by pinching it with your fingers, to make it grow ſtrong, and put forth nearer to the foot; it being the beauty of Trees planted againſt a wall, or kept low, to be well furniſhed with branches from the foot.</p>
               <p>Pear-trees graffed upon Quince-ſtocks, cannot be fit to be re-planted, till after their ſecond, third, or fourth year, when their bark is well recovered: But Peaches and Pavies, when they are ſtrong, and have ſhot well, are better to be taken up after their firſt year, than after their ſecond or third leaf; becauſe, as they come very quickly, ſo are they ſooner fit to be removed than others: Beſides that, being of a dry wood, they ſpring again the better, when they are young, and have a tender bark.

               <p>The order of graffing differing ſorts of Fruit in the ſame Nurſery, depends upon the Ingenuity of the Maſter But the beſt, in my opinion, is either to graffe the ſame kinde of fruit upon a whole row of Stocks, or if but a part, then next to one another; and at the ſame time, to write in a book the names of the Fruits, the quantity of ſtocks that are graffed with them, and in what Row they be: And if in the ſame row there be divers ſtocks graffed with different fruits, to marke with a great ſtake the beginning of each ſort, to the end, that when you would take up a Tree, you may not be miſtaken in the kind of fruit which you deſire.</p>
               <p>Such as are curious to procure from all parts the beſt ſorts of Peares, muſt,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61372:43"/>
when they graff their Nurſeries, graff many fruits of the largeſt kind, ſuch as <hi>Pound-pears, Summer Bon Creſtiens,</hi> and others, which have ſtore of ſap; upon which afterwards they may graff in a Cleft other ſorts of rare Pears, whereof the Syens cannot be had in Summer, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe they are at too great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or elſe becauſe their wood is too tender and delicate to be inoculated: Thoſe that are curious, may likewiſe re-graff upon the ſame trees Winter-<hi>Bon Creſtiens,</hi> and <hi>Bergamots,</hi> which will thereby become bigger and fairer.</p>
               <p>Graffing may be practiſed all the year long; that is, in a Cleft, in the moneths of <hi>February, March,</hi> and <hi>April;</hi> by inoculating with a bud ſhooting forth, in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June;</hi> with a bud not ſhot, in <hi>July, Auguſt, September,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> upon Almond-ſtocks and Peaches, grown from a ſtone: And again, in a Cleft, in the moneths of <hi>November, December,</hi> and <hi>January:</hi> But in theſe laſt ſeaſons they do not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily take, ſo that it is alwayes bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61372:44"/>
and ſurer to graff in the proper ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>Curioſity hath perſwaded ſome to invent extraordinary Graffs, by ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſpecies of trees entirely differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that thereby they might prevail with Nature, to bring forth new mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Fruits: They were perſwaded, that by paſſing the branch of a Vine through the body of a Walnut-tree, pierced with a Wimble, and afterwards exactly ſtopping both ends of the hole, this branch would take its nouriſhment from the Nut-tree, and ſo might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Grapes full of Oyl, inſtead of Wine; they believed, that by graffing a Roſe-buſh upon a Holly-tree, or a Broom, it would bring forth green or yellow Roſes; that having graffed the <note n="a" place="margin">An Apple with a blackiſn rind, and red within, like our Queen-Apple.</note> 
                  <hi>Calville-Apple</hi> upon a black Mulbery, or Peach-trees upon Quinces, they might gather black Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and Peaches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtones: But Experience hath taught them, that Nature is moſt chaſt in her
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61372:44"/>
Alliances, and moſt faithfull in her Productions, and that ſhe cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched, or corrupted by any Artifice: Indeed it is but a vain imagination, to believe that the Syen can quit its Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, to take that of the ſtock upon which it is graffed; it being certain, that it takes nothing from it beſides its nouriſhment. And, as every one knows, that things which are contrary in their nature, endeavour alwayes to deſtroy each other, and that they can never be perfectly united together, becauſe union cannot conſiſt but betwixt things of the ſame nature; ſo may every one eaſily judge, that Syens cannot prove, or take effect, except upon ſtocks of the ſame kind, or which have a ſap confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to them: Experience ſhewing us, that they either grow or languiſh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the ſap of the ſtock, that nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſnes them, is more or leſs proper for them: For this reaſon, a Pear-tree can never take upon an Apple-ſtock, nor Peaches upon Quince-trees, becauſe their Species are wholly different.

                  <p>Of the ſeverall kinds of Ground, and the Trees which prove beſt upon each of them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AFter you have brought up fair Trees in your Nurſeries, before you can have Fruit of them, you muſt of neceſſity plant them ſomewhere elſe, be it againſt a wall, or in the open air. But as the beſt trees cannot proſper, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61372:46"/>
they meet with a good ſoyl, very great care muſt be taken before they be planted, to prepare the earth well for them, and to make it good. According to this order, therefore, having alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy treated of Nurſeries, I come now to ſpeak of the different ſorts of earths, and of thoſe trees which agree beſt with each of them.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who have Gardens and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, ſituated in a very good ſoyl, need not all theſe inſtructions, becauſe the excellent nature of their ground does more of it ſelf, and without any pains, than that which is amended with the greateſt care. The onely deſign of this Diſcourſe, being but onely to help Nature, preſuppoſes her to be ſick, and to have need of ſuccours from abroad.</p>
               <p>Thoſe then that would plant, muſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, obſerve the quality of their ground, and know whether it be ſtrong or light, whether it be too dry or too moiſt, ſoft or ſtony; not onely, that he may give it ſuch helps as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and capable to correct its fault,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61372:46"/>
but alſo to plant in it ſuch ſorts of trees as are proper for it: Becauſe it being impoſſible, ſo to dung or amend a ground, as to make it abſolutely to change its nature, eſpecially for great Plants, it is certain that we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to it, and ſet no trees but ſuch as will take, in it: For to endeavour to force Nature is but to loſe our labour.</p>
               <p>Every one may eaſily know the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the earth of his own Garden; wherefore I think it ſufficient to ſay what ſorts of Fruit-trees will take beſt upon each ground.</p>
               <p>Garden-Pear-trees will thrive beſt in a ſoft earth, and of a great depth, for their roots grow downwards, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſearch towards the bottom of the ground; ſo that it is obſerved, as ſoon as they meet with hard rocky <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Tuff,</hi> a kind of white ſand, or ſoft and brittle ſtone, often-times lying in flakes in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground.</note> earth, or <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Glaiſe;</hi> A moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlimy white ſoyl.</note> Galt, they turn yellow, their tops dry up, and they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh rather than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
               <p>But for Apple-trees,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61372:47"/>
ſeeing their roots tend not downward, but ſpread toward the ſuperficies of the earth, they need not ſo great a depth of it. But then it muſt likewiſe be ſtrong, ſo that they may there find ſtore of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and freſh alſo, that their roots may run into it the more eaſily: I deny not, but Apple-trees may grow in a ſandy ground, and bear very good Fruit, though finding leſs nouriſhment there, they cannot put forth ſo many branches, nor have thoſe they do put ſorth ſo ſtrong.</p>
               <p>Quince-trees thrive beſt in a ſoft ground, and ſomewhat <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Treſch,</hi> freſh or moiſt in a lower degree.</note> freſh, becauſe their roots, which are tender, do there ſpread without pain, and gather together good ſtore of nouriſhment; and, becauſe they grow not deep within the earth, it is enough for them if they find a good ſoil of two or three foot deep; in ſtrong and moiſt grounds they encreaſe much in wood, and maintain themſelves very green; but then the Fruits graffed upon them, are
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61372:47"/>
harſh, and without colour, eſpecially Winter-fruits, as the <hi>Bon Creſtien:</hi> Whereas, on the contrary, Quince-trees planted in a dry, gravelly, &amp; light ground, grow not ſo much in wood, but their fruit is better, fairer colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and more tender. The cauſe of this difference is eaſie to be known, by him who conſiders, that the beauty and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of trees depends upon that of their roots; and that according as they delight themſelves in a ground, or elſe diſagree with it, ſo the trees muſt either flouriſh extremely, or lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, ſince it is from their roots, that they draw all their nouriſhment: for this reaſon, when ever you ſee a tree grow yellow, or diminiſh, be aſſured that its roots are ſick.</p>
               <p>Now the roots cannot ſuffer, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through too much moiſture and cold, or elſe through too much drought; becauſe both the one and the other of theſe two extremes deſtroyes that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which is requiſite in the earth, for the nouriſhment of Plants; the water
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61372:48"/>
by its cold drives out that heat, which animates the earth, &amp; ſo renders it dead &amp; incapable of production: It ſtops the ſap, and conſequently makes the trees to ſuffer. Hence we ſee, that cold rains in Summer, if too frequent, make the greeneſt trees turn yellow: but too great heat doth likewiſe cauſe the ſame effect; for it dries the earth too much, and diſſipates all that moiſture which ſhould nouriſh the roots. From this, ſeeing that the Sun more eaſily pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates ſuch grounds as are dry, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moiſture, it is eaſie to judge, that Trees growing there muſt turn yellow, and changed, ſooner than in ſtronger grounds, which defend themſelves bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the heat.</p>
               <p>For the ſame reaſon muſt fruits be tender, and well coloured, in dry ground; and, on the contrary, very harſh rnd groſs, without colour or taſt, in grounds that are cold and moiſt: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the Sun, which by its heat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipates the cold and groſs moiſture of the Earth, and renders it more ſubtle &amp;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61372:48"/>
delicate: In thoſe grounds, therefore, into the which it pierces moſt, the roots finding but little moiſture do conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently encreaſe but little in their wood; but that ſap which they do draw from thence, being well prepared, and very pleaſant, makes their fruit ſweet in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and of a thin skin, which takes a better colour, and cauſes them to ripen the ſooner: Whereas, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Sun not being able to pierce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſtrong grounds, the trees are there nouriſhed with a groſſer moiſture, which renders their fruit harſh, unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and longer in growing ripe: And as Winter-fruits are longer upon the trees, and do need a greater heat to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen them, ſo they do the more partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of the harſhneſs of the earth which nouriſhed them: Experience confirms this Truth; inſomuch, as we ſee that in cold and rainy years, the fruits have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taſt nor beauty, eſpecially in ſuch grounds as are ſtrong and moiſt.</p>
               <p>After this diſcourſe founded upon Reaſon, and confirmed by Experience,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61372:49"/>
it is eaſie to know what ground is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for each kind of fruit; and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it almoſt needleſs, to go on to ſpeak more particularly of it; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, that I omit nothing, I ſhall adde, that the Plum-tree grows very well upon dry and ſtony grounds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its root is ſtrong and vigorous; that the Almond-tree takes well alſo upon the ſame ſort of ground, becauſe it requires but little nouriſhment; and that Cherry-trees, with other red fruits, are more delighted with a ſoft and ſandy earth, becauſe their roots are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſpread upon the ſurface of the ground.</p>
               <p>I muſt end this Chapter, as I began it, by ſaying, that it is not written for ſuch as have Gardens and Orchards, ſituated in an excellent ſoyl, becauſe that all ſorts of Trees prove well in a good ground. But the ground not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good every where, and men reſolving rather to cultivate and plant that place where their lot falls, though bad, then to quit it &amp; ſeat themſelves in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61372:49"/>
a better ſoyl, I conceived it my duty by this advice, co help them in making a good uſe of their ground, and to draw all poſſible advantages from their bad ſituation, by planting ſuch trees as may proſper in it.</p>

                  <p>Of the ſeverall wayes of manuring grounds, what dung is proper for them, and how it ought to be uſed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HE that knows the fault of his ground, whether it be too dry, or too moiſt, too hot, or too cold, may eaſily judge, with what dung it is to be amended, provided, that he know the different qualities of his dung. For it being certain, that no fault can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, but by its contrary, he muſt conclude, that if his ground be too dry, he muſt moiſten it; if too hot and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he muſt refreſh it; as alſo, that ground too cold and moiſt, muſt be
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61372:50"/>
heat and dryed. I ſhall, for this reaſon, content my ſelf to ſpeak onely concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the different qualities of the ſeveral ſorts of Dung and Soyl, wherewith the ground may be manured; leaving it to the prudence of the Gardiner how to apply them, &amp; to make uſe of them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different quality and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of his ground.</p>
               <p>Cow-dung, which is, of all, the moſt common, being throughly rotten, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the beſt, becauſe it is the fatteſt of all others, and ſo doth the more correct the moſt ordinary fault of grounds, which is, that they are too dry and hungry. It preſerves it ſelf a long while in the earth, and not having too much heat, it muſt be carried and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before Winter, which is the beſt ſeaſon for dunging, becauſe the Dung upholds the Soyl, makes it more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable and light, and cauſes the Snow and Rains, which fall in the Winter, to ſink the deeper into it, and by their moiſture to render it the more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:61372:50"/>
Sheeps dung is alſo very fat, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hotter than Cow-dung, it is more proper for cold grounds; this muſt be laid and buried in the moneth of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> before the depth of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Horſe-dung is the leaſt fat of them all, and therefore is not very proper for Trees, which have alwayes more need of fat and nouriſhment, than of heat: for this reaſon it is moſt ordinarily uſed for Kitchin Gardens, to heat the ground, and thereby to bring up the herbs quickly; it is upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count exceeding good in ſuch grounds as are very moiſt, to dry them, and thereby to make them more light and ſhort. It may, notwithſtanding, be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for all uſes, when it is throughly rotten, or when mingled with other ſorts of dung, that is, when it hath loſt all its heat. This muſt be ſpread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and buried in the beginning of Winter, to the end, that all its heat may be diſſipated before the Spring: For if you ſhould ſtay till Winter is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61372:51"/>
paſt, before you make uſe of it, it might heat too much, and even burn the roots of the Trees.</p>
               <p>Hogs-dung is the coldeſt of all, and therefore best for the hotteſt ſoyls; and ſeeing that trees do ordinarily turn yellow, by reaſon of too much drought, it is very proper to cauſe them to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh again; it muſt be buried as ſoon as ever it is ſpread on the ground.</p>
               <p>Pidgeons-dung is too hot to be uſed when it is freſh, but when its heat is extinguiſhed, it doth wonderfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enliven Trees, and give them a new vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. It loſes its force, and is conſumed in the earth in two years: it muſt be ſpread in the beginning of Winter, and not buried till the Spring, by reaſon of its heat: It may nevertheleſs be carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, freſh as it comes out of the Pidgeon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, to the foot of old trees, to renew them; but then, it muſt be ſpred in the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> two inches thick onely, and care muſt be had to lay it no nearer than within afoot of the ſtemm, and not to bury it untill
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61372:51"/>
Spring, that, during the Winter, it may receive all the Snow and Rains.</p>
               <p>In thoſe Countreys, where Dung is hard to be procured, it is very good to make uſe of the cleanſings of Pools or Lakes, and of the earth of Turfs out upon the High-wayes; the ſcourings of Ponds, being very fat and moiſt, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent good for ſuch Lands as are light, and which have no Body nor Moisture: But they are not to be uſed before the Sun and the Froſt have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over them for a year or two. The mould of a Turf, out upon the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, is alwayes the fatteſt, and the beſt of the whole Countrey, both becauſe it it is leaſt uſed, and alſo, becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the dung of the Bea<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts that paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it; there muſt be taken of it but the depth of half a foot, or a foot at moſt, according to the goodneſs of the ſoyl: It muſt be well out and chopt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſmall morſels, before it be buried, that it may mix the better with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall mould, and communicate its goodneſs unto it. This ſort of Earth,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61372:52"/>
being very ſoft, without heat, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely nouriſhing, is very excellent to be put into the holes about the roots of trees, when they are planted, that it may lye cloſe about them, and fill up all the vacuities, for which end it muſt be made very ſhort and ſmall.</p>
               <p>Every one knowing the quality of his Ground, and that alſo of all ſorts of Dung, and other Manure, which may be uſed, will eaſily judge, with which ſort his ground is to be amended; but this knowledge will be to ſmall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if at the ſame time he know not how to make good uſe of it: For if the Dung be not employed as it ought to be, it may hurt the Trees very much, and ſpoyl them, inſtead of doing them good.</p>
               <p>A man can never take too much care in preparing a Ground well, before it be planted, becauſe the beauty of the Trees depends abſolutely upon it; and the faults which are there made at the firſt, become afterwards irreparable: It being almoſt impoſſible to ſearch under
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61372:52"/>
the roots of a Tree, or to bring any ſoyl thither, when it is once planted: For this reaſon it is, that to prepare the ground well for great Plants, the holes muſt be opened greater or leſs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the ground hath more or leſſe need of being amended: In the richeſt ſoils they muſt be made ſix foot ſquare, &amp; if for Pear-trees, they muſt be digged two foot deep, for Apple-trees but one foot: for if the holes be made deeper, the roots will follow the good mould, and deſcend to the bottom, when being ſtraitned, and not finding ſufficient nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, they languiſh. whereas, being planted very high, &amp; their roots ſpread upon the ſurface of the Earth, which is alwayes the beſt, they profit with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and bring forth their fruit bigger, and better nouriſhed.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing, that in digging theſe holes, all the earth that is taken out of them is not equally good, and none but the beſt muſt be taken to fill them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, it is fit to be known, that the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt earth is alwayes the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellent,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61372:53"/>
not onely where ſtone, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, or galt, lie very near the ſword, but alſo even in the beſt grounds; becauſe the deeper earth having never felt the heat of the Sun, nor received that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant moiſture which the Rains bring with them, is, as it were, dead and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of production; and therefore muſt never be put again into the hole, where it would remaine unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>For the ſame reaſon, if ſuch as plant could have the patience to leave the holes open for a year; it is certain, that the ſoyl would thereby become the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that the earth, which was taken out of them, would be made more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of production, when it had, for that ſpace of time, received the heat and influences of the Sun. Theſe holes being thus digged, before you fill them, you muſt work the bottom well, and then put in of the beſt mould, the depth of a foot, and ſpread upon that half a foot of rotten or chopt dung, which muſt then be wrought together with the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61372:53"/>
mould twice or thrice over, untill they be well mixed; becauſe, if the dung ſhould remain all together, it would grow hot, and ſpoil the roots of the trees, inſtead of profiting them. You muſt afterwards put in a ſecond bed of earth, of the ſame depth with the firſt, and half a foot of dung upon it, mixing them likewiſe well together; and if there ſhall be need, you may alſo adde a third bed, and ſo fill the hole, till it be half a foot higher than the reſt of the ground, becauſe the dung ſettles as it rots.</p>
               <p>This order muſt be followed (as I have ſaid already) according as the earth hath more or leſs need of being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, but alwayes rather profuſely than covetouſly; but if a ſufficient quantity of dung cannot be procured, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make three beds, care muſt be taken, eſpecially to amend the bottom of the hole, becauſe, that after it is filled, and the tree planted, that can be come at no more, whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the upper part of the earth is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes eaſily dunged.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:61372:54"/>
In moiſt grounds, and ſuch as have no great depth, it is needleſs to make holes wherein to plant the Trees; but after that the ground is well digged and dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, according as there is need, it is beſt to ſet the Trees upon it, without ſinking them in, and to cover the roots with the mould of Turfs chopt very ſmall, a foot and half high, and for the breadth of five or ſix foot round about the ſtemm: And becauſe in ſuch places the roots ought to be hindred, as much as may be, from growing downwards towards the bottom, eſpecially thoſe of Pear-trees, it muſt be obſerved in the planting of them, that all the undermoſt roots, and ſuch as deſcend, are to be cut flat, not aſlope like a Hinds foot: Thoſe Trees which ſhall be thus planted above ground, may, after three years, in the moneth of <hi>November,</hi> be conveniently dunged upon the roots.</p>
               <p>To plant Trees well againſt a wall, a Trench muſt be opened of eight foot wide, and three foot deep; in the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging whereof, care muſt be had, not to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61372:54"/>
come near the wall by half a foot; and that ſide of the Trench alſo, that is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, muſt be cut aſlope, for fear of uncovering the Foundation, and cauſing the ruine of the Wall. Whileſt this Trench is in digging, the good mould muſt be ſevered from the bad, and all the ſtones and roots carefully taken out of it, if there be any, that it may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be filled in the ſame manner with the holes before ſpoken of; that is to ſay, the bottom of the Trench muſt be dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, then a foot deep of good mould put into it, and half a foot of very rotten dung upon it: Theſe muſt be well mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed, and the filling of the Trench conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the ſame manner with mould and dung, until it be half a foot higher than the reſt of the ground; and becauſe that Wall-fruits muſt be ſet with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care than other Trees, the Planter muſt be curious in cauſing better mould, ſuch as that of Turfs, cut ſmall, to be brought thither, if that which was taken out of the Trench be not good enough; and obſerve to put in a double proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61372:55"/>
of mould to that of dung. Such as cannot at the firſt make Trenches ſo large, muſt be content to open them at firſt but four foot wide, and two or three years after to inlarge them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Trees ſhall have need of it.</p>
               <p>When Dwarf-ſtanders are to be planted, ſometimes it is neceſſary to dig Trenches, and to fill them with the ſame care as thoſe for Wall-fruits; and ſometimes alſo, it is ſufficient to make holes of ſix foot ſquare, and to dung them well: This difference depends upon the quality of the ground, and the goodneſs of the ſoyl.</p>

                  <p>How the different ſorts of Fruits are to be diſpoſed, according to the ſeverall Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOr the well-diſpoſing of Trees in a Garden, there muſt be conſidered,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61372:55"/>
The quality of the Soyl, its poſition in order to the Sun, and its Situation in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Winds.</p>
               <p>After the reading of the Chapter where the different qualities of grounds are treated of, it is eaſie to judge, that ſuch Fruits as are tender, and full of moiſture, are to be planted in thoſe grounds that are moſt pleaſant and dry, and the bigger Fruits, ſuch as Pears and Apples, in thoſe grounds that are ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and moiſter: Becauſe the firſt (to be tender, and of a good taſt) do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a dryer ſoyl, and the others, nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a more plentifull nouriſhment, would have that which is more ſtrong and moiſt. Now, as in generall, all ſuch fruits as have ſtones, are more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than thoſe with kernels, it is better to plant them in a dryer and ſofter Earth: But, to be yet more exact, it muſt be obſerved, that among ſuch Fruits as have ſtones, ſome are more tender than others; and that of Fruits with kernels, ſome are dry, and others full of moiſture; and that they ought,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61372:56"/>
therefore, to be placed in grounds more or leſs dry, according to their different qualities. For this cauſe, ſuch Pears as are very ſull of moiſture, as the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-<hi>Bon Creſtien,</hi> the <hi>Beurré,</hi> the <hi>Berga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot,</hi> and the other <note n="a" place="margin">Soft and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Pears.</note> 
                  <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urrées,</hi> or <hi>Butter-Pears,</hi> are to be placed in the dryer grounds; and thoſe Pears which are very dry, as the <hi>Amadote,</hi> and others of the like nature, in thoſe grounds that are moiſt; becauſe by this means the quality of the ground corrects the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary fault of the Fruit.</p>
               <p>This is the reaſon why the ſame kinds of Fruit are better in one Garden than in another: And from hence the <hi>Bon Creſtien</hi> Pears are of a more tender ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and a higher taſt, when they grow in dry grounds, in which the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madote</hi> is not ſo good, becoming too dry and ſtony; which, on the contrary, is excellent in moiſt grounds, where the <hi>Bon Creſtien</hi> hath neither colour nor taſt, becauſe of the too much moiſture, which makes its ſubſtance more rude nd groſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:61372:56"/>
Some grounds there are of ſo juſt a temper, and ſo ſweet a conſtitution, that all ſorts of Fruits, be they dry or wateriſh, tender or groſs, do com to an equall perfection in them. In theſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Situations, the Obſervations which we have now made, are uſeleſs; ſuch as plant in theſe, can never commit an Errour; and therefore this advice is onely proper for thoſe grounds, which being without that excellent tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do approach to the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extreme, and are either too cold or too hot, too dry or too moiſt.</p>
               <p>Another thing neceſſary in the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of trees, is, to obſerve their poſition in order to the Sun, and that eſpecially in Wall-trees. Now there are four principall ſorts of theſe Poſitions: One towards the Eaſt, upon which the Sun ſhines from its riſing untill noon: The ſecond, contrary unto it, towards the Weſt, which receives the Sun from noon till night: The third is that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South, which is enlightened by the Sun from eight in the morning
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61372:57"/>
till 4 in the afternoon. The fourth, which hath the leaſt Sun of all, is that which looks towards the North, and which ſees not the Sun but for three hours in the morning, and as much in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, during the Summer Solſtice. All other kinds of Poſitions are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under theſe four principall ones, and differ no otherwiſe, than as they do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally partake of the Sun, and enjoy more or leſs of its heat.</p>
               <p>The beſt Poſition for Wall-fruits, is that which hath the Sun from eight or ten of the clock in the morning, untill the evening, or from the Sun-riſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till two or three in the afternoon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is the time of the greateſt heat of the day. The other Poſitions are better or worſe, according as they are more or leſs expoſed to the mid-day Sun; thoſe which have it onely riſing or ſetting, produce no effect but in very hot Countreys, where two hours of the Sun ripen Fruits more than four or five in theſe that are cold; for, the ripening of Fruits proceeds as well from the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61372:57"/>
Quality of the Ground, as from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Sun. From whence it may be known, that the ſeverall ſorts of Fruit are to be planted according to the Situation and Poſition of the Walls, and according to the Quality of the Ground.</p>
               <p>That Poſition which looks towards the Sun-riſe, and loſeth it not till two or three in the afternoon, is beſt for ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Fruits, ſuch as Peaches, Pavies, and Abricots, which in that ſite do ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily bear more Fruit, and that alſo bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and fairer coloured; it is alſo moſt proper for early and tender Pears, as the ſmall Muſcat-Pear; becauſe the heat of the riſing Sun being pleaſant and encreaſing proportionally untill noon, pierces the Fruit inſenſibly, and makes it more delicate.</p>
               <p>The ſame ſorts of Fruits prove not ſo well in the contrary ſituation, becauſe that all the morning they keep ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the moiſture and coolneſs of the night, and when the Sun begins to ſhine upon them about noon, paſſing upon a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61372:58"/>
ſudden from one extremity to another, they are too tender to reſiſt its violent heat, which ſcorches inſtead of ripening them. This comes ordinarily to paſs, eſpecially in very hot ſoyles. Seeing therefore the ſap of theſe ſorts of trees is more tender and delicate than that of others, it is better to plant them in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſituations, and to ſet no Fruits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Weſt, but ſuch as are ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, and Pear-trees rather than Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Such, nevertheleſs, as have ſtore of Walls, will not do amiſs in expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame ſorts of Fruits to different Sunnes, becauſe, that in blooming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time there do ariſe cold winds, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from one quarter, ſometimes from another, which ſpoyl and blaſt the blooms: from whence we ſee, that the ſame Fruits do take better ſometimes in one ſituation, ſometimes in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Walls which have the Sun from nine or ten in the morning, untill the evening, are the beſt for <hi>Bon Creſtien,</hi> and <hi>Bergamot</hi> Pear-trees, and all other
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61372:58"/>
ſorts of Pears that are full of moiſture; becauſe theſe fruits have need of a great heat to ripen them, and give them a good taſt.</p>
               <p>That Situation which ſees not the Sun, but from one or two in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, untill night, is good for no other fruit but Pears; out of which alſo the <hi>Bon Creſtien,</hi> and <hi>Bergamot,</hi> are to be excepted, which cannot come to ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in that Situation, unleſs in a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory extraordinarily hot. In this Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be planted ſome Abricot-trees, becauſe their fruit will there ripen more lateward, and have leſs colour, &amp; ſo will be more proper to be preſerved; but they bear but little, for the moſt part, when ſo placed.</p>
               <p>The beſt Situation of all for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricot-tree, is that which looks toward the Sun-riſing, for in that poſition it bears more than in any other. But yet, if from a Tree ſo placed, you would every year have good ſtore of Abricots, you muſt be carefull, ſo long as the Trees are in bloom, to have them covered e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61372:59"/>
night with Mats, or Linnen clothes to preſerve them from the froſt, and not to have them uncovered when the Sun ſhines hot, becauſe that heat ſcorches the blooms, being already made tender by the froſt and cold of the night. But in this covering of Abricot-trees, it muſt be obſerved, to put the Mats or Clothes at night upon the Tree, and to faſten them againſt the Wall, that they may be the better preſerved from the cold winds; but in the day-time, to put them at ſome distance from the Wall, that the air may paſs between.</p>
               <p>Experience teaching us, that this care of covering the Abricot-trees, preſerves their Fruit; every one may eaſily judge, that during the exceſſive heats of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, eſpecially ſuch as come upon a ſudden, it is very proper, to hinder the Sun from burning the Fruits, by cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the trees from ten of the clock till three, either with leavy boughes, or mats, and not to bring them nearer than a fathom from the tree, that the aire may paſs betwixt both. This care doth
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61372:59"/>
not onely preſerve the Fruit, but doth alſo keep the trees alwayes green and vigorous, and defends the young ſhoots from being dryed and ſcorched by the too great heat. For the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is, that in Countreys extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily hot, the Fruits muſt be left more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with leaves; and in <hi>March</hi> the ground being newly ſtirred at the foot of the trees, there muſt be ſpread ſome long coorſe dung without heat, five or ſix foot in breadth, and four inches thick, which muſt preſently be covered with a little mould, to hide it from ſight, that the beauty of the Walk be not ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
               <p>In the placing of great Plants, it is not enough to conſider the quality of the Soyl, but it muſt further be obſerved, how they are expoſed to the winds, that endeavours may be uſed to ſet them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhelter; for great winds do very much harm to trees: And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon trees prove better in valleys, (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they be not too moiſt) than upon hills, and high and open Situations,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61372:60"/>
where they are too much beaten with winds: Beſides that, in valleys the ſoil is alwayes better, becauſe that the fat, and beſt moiſture of the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, deſcends thither with the Rains.</p>
               <p>The Winds are to be feared, either for the Froſt in the Spring, when the trees are in bloom, or for the Fruits in Autumn: And therfore, becauſe Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Plumms, and other ſtone-fruits, are early in bloom, and more ſubject to Froſts, it is beſt to plant them under ſhelter from the North, and North-weſt winds, becauſe the South and the South-weſt winds being not ordinarily great, but in the Autumn, they cannot incommodate thoſe earlier Fruits. But ſeeing Pear-trees and Apple-trees put forth their blooms later, and do better reſiſt the Froſt; if in planting them they canuot be ſheltred, both from the North-weſt and Southern winds, it will be moſt convenient to keep them from the South-winds, that their Fruit may be the better preſerved, which is not gathered till Autumn.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the order and diſtance which is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in planting of Trees.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SInce that, neither all Soyls, nor all Situations are equally proper for all forts of Fruits, It may eaſily be known, that, to order Fruit-trees well, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſeparate them, and to make particular Plantations of Pear-trees, Apple-trees, Red-fruits, and Plumm-trees, to the end, that each of theſe kinds may be placed in that Soyl &amp; Situation, which is the moſt proper for it: Beſides, that all theſe ſorts of trees growing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally, and ſome of them coming to a greater bigneſs than others, they muſt of neceſſity be planted in divers places, and be ſet at different diſtances, for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be mixed together without hurting each other.</p>
               <p>An order yet more exact, may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the placing of trees, which is
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61372:61"/>
in every particular Plantation, to place all the trees of the ſame ſort of fruit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and in the ſame Row; as all the <note n="a" place="margin">A delicate ſmall Pear.</note> 
                  <hi>Rouſſellets,</hi> and ſo all other different kinds: In this, nevertheleſſe, every man may uſe his own diſcretion, and place them according to his fancy. The keeping of a more exact order in the placing of Wall-ſruit is likewiſe indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, ſo that the ſeverall ſorts be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly put in ſuch Situations, as are moſt proper for them. The ſame ſorts of Fruit may either be ſet all together, or elſe mixed with others: In this every one may follow their own inclination; Nevertheleſs, in making a great Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, I think it very convenient to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate ſuch Pears as are to be eaten raw, from the baking Pears, the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-fruits from the Winter, and to plant every kind by it ſelf; becauſe the ſeaſons of their growing ripe, being dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, they are more eaſily gathered, when ſet apart by themſelves; and in ſuch Plantations as are for Sider, it is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61372:61"/>
very convenient to ſeparate the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſorts of Apples, becauſe each ſort makes its particular Sider.</p>
               <p>Beſides this order, the Planter muſt be very carefull, be it in Wall-fruits or great Plants, to ſet the trees at a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient diſtance, according to their kinds, not too near, nor too far from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. That this may be done, he is to conſider of the goodneſs of the ground, becauſe the trees become larger, and grow further out in a ſtrong, than in a light ſoyl. He muſt alſo have a regard to the winds, becauſe, as the greater Plantations are more or leſs expofed to them, ſo muſt the trees be ſet cloſer or further from each other: For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that trees defend themſelves much better from the winds, when they are planted near together.</p>
               <p>In good grounds, which are deſigned to be kept in tillage, that other things may be ſown under the trees, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diſtance betwixt Pear-trees or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-trees ought to be betwixt eight or ten fathoms: But if the ground be left
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61372:62"/>
for Herbage four or five fathom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt each tree will be ſufficient; and in places expoſed to great winds, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance muſt not be above three or four fathomes, becauſe the trees being plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted cloſe do preſerve one another; In ſandy and ſtony grounds it is good to keep the ſame diſtance, of between three and four fathomes.</p>
               <p>For ſtone-Fruits; as Plumm-trees, Abricots, Cherry-trees, and <note n="a" place="margin">Hart-Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-trees.</note> 
                  <hi>Vigarro-tires</hi> graffed upon a <note n="b" place="margin">The ſmall, wild, bitter Cherry-tree.</note> 
                  <hi>Meriſier,</hi> be they High-ſtanders or Dwarfs, they muſt be planted at three fathomes from one another; but if the Cherry-trees be graffed upon Cherry-ſtocks taken from the roots of others, becauſe theſe increaſe not ſo much in wood, it is ſufficient to plant them at 12 or fifteen foot aſunder, according to the goodneſs of the ground.</p>
               <p>As for Peare-trees graffed upon Quince-ſtocks, planted for Dwarf-ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in any ſort of Alley or Walk, it is the cuſtome to ſet them at every twelve
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61372:62"/>
foot, except it be in wateriſh grounds, where they muſt be placed at 15 foot diſtance, to the end, that being further from each other, they may enjoy the more Air and Sun. Yet when they are planted in a ſingle row, they may be ſet between eight and nine foot from one another, becauſe that meeting thereby the ſooner, they do give a better ſhape unto the hedge; neither can they hurt each other, becauſe they have aire e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough on both ſides: But if they are to be plaſhed upon a Pole-hedge on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of a Walk from the wall, theſe trees muſt be placed at twelve foot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, and ordered in the ſame manner as thoſe againſt a wall.</p>
               <p>The diſtance of Dwarf Pear-trees, and Apple-trees graffed upon Tree-ſtocks (that is, ſuch as are raiſed from Kernels) ought, in light and ſandy grounds, to be eighteen foot, and twenty four foot in ſtronger grounds, the ſame as in great Plants; for there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, ſave that the one are tall, and have a high ſtemm, and the other
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61372:63"/>
lower, and without a ſtemm, ſhooting out their branches at a foot from the ground, and are more under ſhelter from the winds.</p>
               <p>As for Apple-trees graffed upon the Paradice-Apple, ſeeing that they grow very little in wood; the ordinary rule, when they are planted in many Rowes, is, to place them nine foot a ſunder: But when one row is to be planted alone, they may be placed at every ſixt foot.</p>
               <p>In the planting Wall-fruits; Peaches, Abricots, and Plumm-trees, muſt be ſet at fifteen foot from each other in light grounds, and at eighteen in thoſe that are ſtronger; for, all ſorts of Pear-trees, they are commonly planted at eight, ten, and twelve foot, according to the quality of the ſoyl.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that plant Wall-fruits, do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily mix Pear-trees and Peaches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſuppoſing by this diverſity to render them the more beautifull, becauſe by this means their walls will never be unfurniſhed: Indeed, the Peach-trees
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61372:63"/>
ſuddenly putting forth good ſtore of wood, do in ſhort time cover the wall, and then, when they begin to waſt and diminiſh, the Pear-trees ſucceed, inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly filling up that place, which the Peach-trees ſeem of their own accord to have quitted to make <hi>room</hi> for them; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, thoſe that are more curious have found by experience, that it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to plant all the Pear-trees by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to ſet the Peach-trees and Abricots together, without intermixing them; becauſe that the walls being ſet with trees that are equall, and of one and the ſame kind, are the more equally covered; and the trees themſelves do thereby become the more agreeable, and eaſier to be kept in order. Beſides that, Peaches and Abricot trees ſet upon a Plumm-ſtock do much eat out the earth, and rob the Pear-trees of their nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>Thoſe, notwithſtanding, who are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, till they ſee their walls covered, may plant their Pear-trees at a fathom diſtance; but yet with this reſolution,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61372:64"/>
to take away one betwixt every two af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter five or ſix years, when they begin to endammage one another. This manner of placing the trees at every ſix foot, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth the pleaſure of ſeeing the walls alwayes wel furniſhed, and alſo of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering much more fruit in the firſt years; but it muſt be obſerved, to ſet two Pear-trees of one kind of fruit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that when one is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, there may alwayes remain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in his place and order.</p>
               <p>Beſides this care of planting the Pear-trees together, and ſetting them at the diſtance before-mentioned; it is alſo very convenient to intermix ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall kinds of Pears, and to plant Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-pears amongſt the Summer ones, thoſe that are early among ſuch as are lateward, whereby the pleaſure may be had of ſeeing the walls alwayes furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with fruit.</p>
               <p>The ſame order may be kept in Wall-trees of Peaches and Abricots; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo when Pear-trees are planted in a Counter-hedge over againſt the wall;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61372:64"/>
except that in ſuch hedges, there muſt be planted neither the <hi>Bon Creſtien, Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamot,</hi> nor the <hi>Petit Muſcat,</hi> becauſe theſe ſorts prove not ſo well in a Hedge as againſt a Wall.</p>
               <p>One may alſo plant <hi>Muſcats</hi> againſt a wall, and betwixt them, at every fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen foot, a Peach-tree, having a ſtemm of four foot high, without branches, that they may be plaſhed above the Muſcat, and cover the reſt of the wall; but then care muſt be had of planting onely ſuch Peach-trees as are inoculated upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Peaches, or Almond-ſtocks; for ſuch as are ſet upon Plumm-ſtocks <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the planting of <hi>Avenues</hi> (leading to Houſes) and Walks, two things are to be obſerved; The largeneſs of the Allyes, and the diſtance betwixt the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61372:65"/>
trees. It is is a thing very difficult to give a certain rule for the largeneſs of Allies, becauſe it ought to be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their length, and the Situation of their Avenues. It depends, therfore, wholly upon the ingenuity and prudence of him that orders them.</p>
               <p>For the diſtance betwixt the trees, it muſt be different according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of their kind: Elms and Lime-trees muſt be planted two fathoms from each other: Cheſt-nuts, Walnut-trees, Apple-trees and Pear-trees, at four, five, and ſixe fathoms. As for Oaks and Beeches, wherewith they do ordinarily plant their Avenues in the Countrey of <hi>Caux,</hi> they muſt be ſet at no further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance than nine foot from one another. But Pines and Fir-trees at four fathoms aſunder, by reaſon of their ſpreading of their branches.</p>

                  <p>The manner of planting, and keeping Trees well.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TRees are not fit to be re-planted till their ſap be wholly ſpent; for if there be any in them, when they are taken up, having now no more nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they fade, and their bark, which is yet tender, grows riveld and dry, ſo that it is leſs capable of receiving the new ſap, when it begins to aſcend in the Spring.</p>
               <p>The Fall of the Leaves in all ſorts of trees informs us, when the ſap leaves them; for it is that, by which they are nouriſhed; and we ſee, that if trees grow yellow and ſick, having but ſmall store of ſap, they preſently caſt their leaves: Now ſeeing that the ſap fails ſooner in dry grounds, than in thoſe which are moiſt, it is certain, that in ſuch grounds, trees may both be taken
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61372:66"/>
up, and alſo re-planted earlier: But to ſpeak in generall, All Plantations are to be made in the moneths of <hi>November</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> and ſuch as are ſooneſt made are alwayes the beſt; except in ſuch grounds as are too moiſt and full of water, where you muſt ſtay till <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> to the end, that the roots of your Plants be not rotted by the water in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which having not yet taken again, are not ſtrong enough to reſiſt too much moiſture.</p>
               <p>A fair day (as I ſaid before, when I ſpake of Nurſeries) is alwayes to be choſen to plant in; becauſe the earth is ſhorter and better to be handled, when it is dry; and therefore, for this reaſon, Plantations are never to be made in the time of Rain or Snow; to both which, the moneth of <hi>January</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mo<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t ſubject, is therefore the moſt unfit to plant in.</p>
               <p>The firſt care which muſt be taken, before you begin to plant, is to take up the trees well, without ſpoyling any of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61372:66"/>
their roots, becauſe that all their vigour depends upon them; they muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be preſerved as whole and as entire as is poſſible. Care muſt alſo be had in taking up a tree out of a Nurſery, not to lay naked the whole root, for fear of harming thoſe trees that are about it: But after that ſome earth is taken away from about the foot of it, it may be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned downward half-way towards the ground, and drawn long-wayes gently by ſtrength of arms: For by this means the roots are preſerved entire from breaking, and the trees not endammaged that are left behind.</p>
               <p>The tree being thus taken up with care, you muſt, before it be re-planted, pare off the ends of all its roots (taking away onely ſuch as are too confuſed) and ſtrip well from them all their ſmall fibers or filaments, where there are too many of them, becauſe theſe, when the tree comes to be planted, would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe clogg together, and hinder the mould from falling eaſily between the principall roots, and ſo from filling up
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61372:67"/>
all their vacuities: For this reaſon the Gardiner cannot be too carefull in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the ſmall threds; for the greater and middle ſort of roots never fail of putting forth new ones; and thoſe which he leaves being too confuſed, do alwayes harm the tree more than they profit it; and the great roots muſt alſo in the paring of them be left as long as may be, and the cut muſt be at the end of the root, on the lower ſide of it, ſo that the cut may be upon the mould.</p>
               <p>The roots being all, on this manner, refreſhed and cleared, if it be a tree with a high ſtemm, and deſigned to be planted in the open air, the ſtemm of it muſt be pared off at ſeven foot high, and all the ſmall branches and buds, which remain upon it, muſt be taken off with exactneſs; for, thoſe ſhoots which open themſelves a paſſage in the bark, and come out of the body of the tree, do alwayes grow up with the greateſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour: But if the tree be deſigned for a Wall, or a Dwarf-tree, it muſt be left ſhorter or longer, according to the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61372:67"/>
ſtrength of its foot, the quantity of its roots, and the goodneſs of the ſoyl; the judgement whereof depends upon the prudence of the Gardiner: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, ſeeing it is neceſſary that ſuch trees ſhould put forth branches near the ground, to cover the lower part of the wall, in which the beauty of Wall-trees doth chiefly conſiſt, it will be beſt, if the foot be not well furniſhed with bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to cut it very ſhort, that it may put forth many: It is true, that a tree thus ſtopt, having no old wood remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon it, cannot ſo ſoon bear fruit: As for Peach-trees, they being very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to want boughs in the middle, muſt alwayes, when they are planted, be cut very ſhort.</p>
               <p>The tree being thus cut, muſt preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be planted, either in the hole, or in the trench prepared for it, and muſt not be ſunk into the ground above the depth of half a foot: Afterwards, all the roots muſt be handſomly extended, without forcing or conſtraining them: And if it be a Wall-tree, the foot of it muſt be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61372:68"/>
placed at ten or twelve inches from the wall; and ſo laid, that the upper part of the ſtemm or branches may come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two inches of it, that the new bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches may by that means be the more commodiouſly plaſh'd againſt it. When the tree is ſo placed, the roots muſt all be drawn outwards as much as may be, and brought from the wall, that they may thereby find the more nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be more plentifully watered with the rains during the Summer. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, the roots muſt be covered with good mould, ſoft and light, mixed with ſome other mould from a bed throughly rotten, if ſuch be to be had; for, this cauſeth them to take again the ſooner, and put forth a greater quantity of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brous roots: Care muſt alſo be taken to furniſh them well with mould, ſo as no void ſpace may remain betwixt the roots: To this end, after they are cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with earth, the tree muſt be lifted up a little, and ſhaken with your hand, that the mould (being ſhort and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable) may fall, and ſlip between the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61372:68"/>
roots, to fill up entirely all the holes.</p>
               <p>The Gardiner muſt, as I ſaid, obſerve in planting, not to ſink the trees into the ground more than half a foot; for the ground being alwayes better above than downwards, the roots do there find the more nouriſhment, and are not ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be rotted and ſpoyled by too much moyſture: Beſides that, being near the ſurface of the ground, they are more ſenſible of the heat of the Sun, and do likewiſe receive advantage by the dews and ſmall rains which fall in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; whereas, on the contrary, when the roots are ſunk too deep, they are never refreſhed by all thoſe Summer rains, which are neither of ſuch force or continuance to pierce into the earth more than a good half-foot; ſo that the earth which is beneath dries and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens it ſelf about the roots, and affords them no more nouriſhment: From whence it may eaſily be conjectured, that the moſt ordinary cauſe which makes trees to grow yellow, proceeds from their being ſet too deep in the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:61372:69"/>
But ſeeing the trees ſo planted near the ſurface of the earth, may, for the two firſt years, ſuffer from the great heat of the Sun, having their roots yet too tender to reſiſt it, it will be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to cover them, by making a bank of ordinary mould a foot high above them, for the wideneſs of four foot round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſtemm; the top whereof muſt be laid plain, that the waters may the better ſtop there, and pierce to the foot of the tree: It is further needfull in <hi>March,</hi> after this earth hath been well ſtirred, to ſpread upon it ſome long dung, that is not hot, the breadth of three foot about the ſtemm, and four inches thick: Or, if ſuch dung is not to be had, to lay ſome fern upon it at the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> ſo that the earth may be kept freſh, and the roots preſerved from the too great heat of the Sun; but if neither Dung nor Fern can be had whererewith to cover theſe banks of earth, then they muſt be ſtirred four or five times a year, onely the depth of half a ſpade-bit, for fear of harming the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61372:69"/>
Rootes; and theſe ſtirrings muſt bee continued untill the Trees be ſtrong, and ſo theſe banks of earth will by little and little be brought lower, by ſtirring them from year to year.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing that in trenches and holes filled up with good ſtore of dung, the earth ſettles in proportion as the dung rots and conſumes; It muſt be obſerved in planting, to ſet the roots of the trees level with the ordinary ground, becauſe the earth ſetling in the trench, ſinks lower, and carryes the tree along with it: This care muſt eſpecially be had in the planting of ſuch Pear-trees as are ingraffed upon a Quince-ſtock, and Apples upon a Paradiſe-Apple; becauſe if theſe two ſorts of trees be planted too low, ſo that the Graffs come to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ground, they will put ſorth roots, and thereby cauſe the trees inſenſibly to partake of the Graff, and ſo to change their nature.</p>
               <p>In cold and moiſt grounds, the tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches muſt be raiſed (be it for Wall-fruits,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61372:70"/>
or <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Contr'eſpalliers,</hi> Hedges on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of a Walk from the wall, made with poles, &amp; the trees plaſhed in them.</note> Counter-hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) 2 foot higher than the ordinary ground, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the trees are to be planted, to the end that being further from the water, their fruit may be better and fairer coloured; for they cannot have a good taſt growing in ſuch grounds as are alwayes moyſt and wet: For this reaſon it is, that the ſides of hills and higher Situations are the moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous for the goodneſs of fruits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the waters run from them with the more facility.</p>
               <p>There may likewiſe be laid in the bottom of the trench, a bed of ſtones, of a foot deep, or elſe ſo much ſtony and gravelly earth, to draw the waters to the bottom, and cauſe them to drain away; upon which it muſt be filled up with ſharp Sand, or Plaiſter-ſtone and Marl mixed with good mould, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the too aboundant moiſture, and make the trees to profit the more, and to bring forth their fruits of a better co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61372:70"/>
and taſt; it is alſo very good in ſuch moiſt ſoyls at the beginning of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> when the earth, at the foot of the Wall-trees, hath been ſtirred, to ſpread ſome Marl upon it half a foot deep, and ſix foot broad, which is to be buried at Spring, when the Winter-Froſts and Snowes have paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p>After that the trees are planted with the care above-mentioned, if the ſtems of the taller Plants be any thing feeble, it will be needful to ſtrike in a ſtake at the foot of each of them, which muſt be ſtrong, and of the length of five foot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ground, to keep the trees ſteddy, and hinder the winds from ſhaking them. But this ſtake muſt be ſhorter than the ſtemm of the tree, leſt it wry the branches that ſhoot forth.</p>
               <p>It is further neceſſary, in ſuch places where Beaſts are paſtured, to put thorns about each tree, to keep the Beaſts from coming near it, or rubbing themſelves againſt it: But becauſe theſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61372:71"/>
thorns may grate and hurt the bark, which is yet tender, and ſo breed Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in the trees, which kill them, their whole ſtemms muſt, before the thorns are put about them, be covered with long litter or fodder, and then be bound about with ſtraw.</p>
               <p>The ſame courſe muſt be taken with thoſe trees that have been bred in a Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, where, having been alwayes ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and covered from the Sun, their bark is ſo tender and delicate, that if it be on a ſudden expoſed to hard Froſts, and to the great heats of the Sun, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a ſoyl that is dry and hot, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes withered and baſe, whitiſh and moſſy: For this reaſon it is, that to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it neat and handſom, it muſt, for ſix years, be covered with ſtraw, untill the trees have gotten ſtrength, and are accuſtomed to the open air.</p>
               <p>Such as are curious, may further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, when they plant trees, whoſe bark is not well recovered again, to turn the back of the Graff towards the South,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61372:71"/>
and the cut towards the North, becauſe in that poſition it will the more eaſily recover; and if they remove ſuch kinds of trees as are tender and difficult to grow again, ſuch as are Fir-trees, and Pines, they muſt be carefull to ſet them in the ſame Situation, and ſo to turn them, that they may be expoſed to the Sun and Froſts, in the very ſame manner that they were before they were taken up; becauſe that by this means theſe tender trees, receiving the ſame impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the air, to which they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, are ſcarſely at all ſenſible of their change: For this reaſon, when they are taken up, they muſt be marked upon their ſtemm which fide ſtood North, and which South, that in re-planting them, they may be put again in the ſame Situation.</p>
               <p>The firſt care which muſt be taken, in the ordering of ſuch trees as are newly removed, is, to take off all the buds from the High-ſtanders when they begin to ſhoot forth, till you come to the heighth
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61372:72"/>
of a foot and half, above which no ſhoot is to be taken from them, untill the third year, when in the moneth of <hi>March</hi> they muſt be cleared of ſome of their branches, by cutting off ſuch of them as are weak and uſeleſſe: In do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, the ſtubs or ſtumps muſt be, cut to the quick, and ſmoothed, and then immediately capped over with clay, that the bark may recover with the more facility. But Wall-trees and Dwarfs muſt be let alone, and ſuffered to put forth their ſprouts at liberty, without taking any branch from them, during the firſt year; except that, if they ſhoot upwards too faſt, it will be neceſſary to ſtop them at a foot high, by pinching them once to make them grow big and ſtrong, and alſo to make them put forth ſuch other ſmall branches, as may furniſh the bottom of the Wall.</p>
               <p>The Earth, at the foot of Wall-trees, and ſuch as are planted in Counter-hedges over againſt Walls, muſt be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61372:72"/>
four times in a year, for the breadth of ſix foot, in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> to ſome depth; but in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> the depth of half a ſpade-bit onely, to kill the weeds, and to keep the mould ſhort and capable of receiving the Rain in Summer.</p>
               <p>In great Plantations, where Beaſts are paſtured, the Earth muſt be ſtirred four foot wide about the ſtemm of each tree four times a year: Bvt where the Beaſts come not, all the ground muſt be ploughed, or digged in ſuch places where the plough cannot paſſe, and ſown with Wheat or Oats, each other year one; and care muſt be taken to dung it well that year when it is to be ſown with Wheat, and to ſtir it four times in the year wherein it lies fallow: This courſe is to be continued until the trees be grown ſo big, that their ſhadow hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the profiting of the corn; then the tillage of the whole may be let alone, and uſed onely about the foot of the trees, according as there ſhall be need:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61372:73"/>
The often ſtirring of the ground hath this advantage, that it hinders richer grounds from chapping, and keeps thoſe alwayes freſh that are light and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>In Plantations, where the trees ſtand at the diſtance of eight or ten fathoms, (ſo placed, becauſe the ground may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be tilled and ſown) there is no further care to be taken, for that which is uſed about ordinary tillage, but onely that ſuch as plough them muſt take heed that the plough ſpoyl not the trees by coming too near them.</p>
               <p>For the well-ordering of Dwarf-ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, it is neceſſary to ſtir all the ground about them four times a year with a ſpade, or a forked pick-axe, not ſowing any grain upon it, ſave only in the midſt of the Alloys, where it may be ſown; and, nearer the trees, to the diſtance of four or five feet from them, may be made beds of Strawberries, and other ſmall Sallad-herbs; for, other herbs and flowers being planted in the tillage
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61372:73"/>
above their roots, do wrong the trees; except onely <hi>Anemone's</hi> and <hi>Ranunculus,</hi> which may be ſet at the foot of the Wall, becauſe they have but few leaves and roots: For the ſame reaſon there may be planted upon the border of the tillage, at ſix foot from the trees, a row of Strawberry-plants.</p>
               <p>Such as plant Pear-trees and Apple-trees in Avenues, along the wayes, or about the ſides of their grounds, ſhould put none there but ſuch as have a very high ſtem, ſuch as are the Apple-trees, which they call <hi>De Manerbe,</hi> and <hi>Haut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bois,</hi> or the Long-Apple-tree: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, theſe two kinds have alwayes a fair ſtemm; they do alwayes form their heads round, with tall and ſtrait boughes, ſo that loaden Carts cannot touch them; and their Fruit is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to fall, yet excellent for Sider. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother care muſt be, to plant there no Fruits which are good to be eaten in Summer, leſt inſtead of fruits they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing but a diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:61372:74"/>
For the well planting and ordering of Avenues, be they Elmes, Lime-trees, Cheſt-nuts, Wallnut-trees, Pear-trees, or Apple-trees, the ſame care muſt be had which is uſed in great Plantations of Fruit-trees; but as for Oaks and Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the manner is very different: for theſe muſt be planted whole, without heading them, ſo as you muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent onely to prune them, and to cut off their branches at two or three inches diſtance from the ſtemm, untill you come within three foot of the top; then you muſt put them in the ground with all their roots, and cover the foot of each with a bank of earth two or three foot high, riſing to a point towards the ſtemm, which muſt be preſſed cloſe, and beaten, to uphold the foot of theſe trees, and to hinder them from being ſhaken by the winds, becauſe, that being plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at twelve or fifteen foot high, with all their top, they are ſubject to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by them: For the ſame reaſon theſe banks of earth muſt not be taken
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61372:74"/>
away, nor ſtirred, till after five or ſix years, when the trees have taken a firm root; but it will ſuffice to open a ſmall trench about them, which may retain the waters to moiſten and nouriſh the roots.</p>
               <p>Fir-trees and Pines, being very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to take root again when they are removed, muſt of neceſſity be replanted while they are very young, when they are not above four or five foot high; their branches alſo muſt not be taken off, nor their roots be cut, unleſs ſuch as have been hurt; but they muſt, when they are planted, be banked with earth, as the Oaks and Beeches, &amp; not be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before they are grown very big: And even then you muſt obſerve, in the cutting any branch from them in the moneth of <hi>March,</hi> to rub the wound immediately with Hogs-dung or Cow-dung, to hinder the gumm from iſſuing out, becauſe that doth very much wrong theſe kinds of trees, and often cauſes them to dye.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:61372:75"/>
Such as have brought them up from ſeeds (as I have before mentioned) may, when they are three or four foot high, take them up with the earth about their roots, to ſet them where they are to grow: Or if they deſire to tranſplant them with more ſecurity, they muſt dig a trench at three or four foot diſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the tree, betwixt two and three foot deep, and in a hard froſt undermine this heap of earth, ſo as to take it up whole, and tranſport it ſo into the hole prepared for it. This is a moſt excellent way of tranſplanting trees, becauſe that ſo they may be planted again entire, it being needleſſe to cut any of their boughs.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How Trees are to be pruned and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe skill of Pruning and Plaſhing Trees well, be it againſt a Wall, in a Counter-hedge, or in Dwarf-trees, is that which is moſt conſiderable about them, becauſe that all their handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and their preſervation depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; it is a thing very rare among Gardiners, for the doing of it well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends more upon their ingenuity than upon their hand: It is alſo very hard to give inſtructions for it, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not in certain and generall Maxims, but varies according to the particular circumſtances of each tree, ſo that it depends abſolutely upon the Gardiners prudence, who ought of himſelf to judge what branches muſt be left, and which are fit to be cut away; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61372:76"/>
may be learned more eaſily by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience than by a Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>There are many different wayes of plaſhing: That which is performed with nails, and little pieces of leather or liſts of Cloth put about the branches, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be uſed but upon walls coated with Plaiſter, becauſe upon others the nails will not hold. This faſhion of plaſhing is of all others the moſt neat, by it the trees are beſt extended, and moſt hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly couched, making a kind of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtry of Greens very agreeable; it is alſo commodious, in aſmuch as by it the boughs are better conducted, with more caſe and leſs conſtraint: Nevertheleſs, it is better for Pear-trees than Peaches, becauſe the Pears having a long ſtalk, do bear off and ſeparate themſelves the better from the wall, ſo that they ripen very well: But the Fruit of Peach-trees, Pavies, and Abricot-trees, is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened ſo cloſe unto its branch, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains thereby ſo joyned to the wall, that it cannot ripen equally on all ſides.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61372:76"/>
Liſts of Cloth are better for this uſe than Leathers, for the Rain and Sun ſpoyl them not, nor cauſe them to ſhrink up. In this ſort of plaſhing, you muſt be carefull not to girt the liſt too cloſe about the branch, and to faſten the nayl beneath it: For the branch tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naturally upwards, and drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the top of the tree, batters and hurts it ſelf when it meets with the nail about it: This kind of plaſhing is both the moſt convenient and the handſomeſt of all others, but it is alſo much the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt in doing, and that which requires the greateſt care.</p>
               <p>Some few years ſince, an Invention hath been found out of faſtening into walls the bones of Sheeps feet, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the trees to them: This way is not ſo handſom as that with nailes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe bones alwayes appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the leaves.

forced before they can be faſtened to them; Thoſe that will make uſe of them, muſt faſten them ſo into the wall, that they appear not without it more than a full inch; and they muſt be placed at the diſtance of four or five inches from one another, that being ſo near, ſome of them may be found fit to faſten each bough unto without forcing it: This way of plaſhing hath this advantage, that it laſts long, and requires no coſt to be maintained, ſeeing there needs no more than a Bulruſh in Summer, and ſmall Oziers in Winter, to tye the branches to them: In thoſe Countreys where theſe bones are ſcarce and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be procured, they may be ſet at two foot diſtance from each other, and have little rods faſtened to them in the faſhion of a Lattice, upon which the boughes may be plaſhed: But in this caſe the bones muſt be ſet two full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches out of the wall, that the rods may with the more eaſe be tyed to them.</p>
               <p>The way of plaſhing upon ſquares
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61372:82"/>
made of round Poles, is not ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and ſightly as the reſt, and it coſts more; but then it hath this advantage, that the Fruits ripen well upon it; for being not at all kept cloſe to the wall, becauſe of the thickneſs of the Trellis, they do the better enjoy the heat and aire, which paſs eaſily behind the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Thoſe kind of Paliſſades muſt be often renewed, if they be not made of good wood, as of Oak, Cheſtnut-tree, or Aſh. In making this Trellis, all the bark of the Poles muſt be taken off care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully before they be uſed, becauſe ſo they will laſt the longer; beſides that, Ear-wigs, Caterpillers, and other ſmall Vermine, which ſpoyl both the bloſſoms and fruit, cannot there find any place to hide themſelves.</p>
               <p>The beſt invention of all, and that which is the moſt commodious, which laſts the longeſt, and is eaſieſt, and of leaſt coſt to be maintained by Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is, to make the Trellis of Laths of a full quarter of an inch ſquare, and of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61372:83"/>
nine or ten foot long, or more, if it may be, according to the heighth of the wall: Theſe laths muſt be placed in ſquares at nine inches diſtance, and tied with Iron or Braſs wire, and muſt be upheld by ſmall Iron hooks faſtned in the wall in a ſtrait line, at three ſoot and a half from each other, and two inches without the wall: This kind of Trellis is coſtly at firſt; but becauſe it laſts long, and is eaſily kept, it proves the beſt of all, and of leaſt charge.</p>
               <p>There are ſome, who, to make their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſades the handſomer, do cauſe wood to be ſawn two inches ſquare, and then have it cut and framed by a Joyner, in the faſhion of a Window-frame: But this Trellis laſts not ſo-long by much, as thoſe which are made of cleft wood, becauſe that wood which is ſawn moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and rots quickly.</p>
               <p>Before you begin to plaſh, you muſt, as I ſaid before, leave the trees to ſprout at full liberty for the firſt year, without taking off their buds, or ſtopping them,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61372:83"/>
and then ſtay till <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March</hi> of their ſecond year, before you being to cut them, or faſten them to the wall, becauſe their firſt ſhoots are ſo tender, that you cannot plaſh them without forcing them, which changes them very much: Notwithſtanding, when Peach-trees, Abricot-trees, and even Pear-trees, do ſprout too ſtrongly in their firſt year, you muſt nip the ends of their principall boughs which riſe too faſt, and then extend and faſten them to ſome of the laths, to preſerve them from the winds, and to give them their firſt ſhape.</p>
               <p>Trees may be pruned all the Winter long, but it is better to ſtay till the hard froſts be over, and not to begin till the end of <hi>February</hi> in the wane, and ſo from that time untill the end of <hi>March,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for weak and tender Trees, as Peaches and Abricots, which are very ſubject to the Froſts.</p>
               <p>Great Trees, ſtanding in the open air, may be pruned and cleared of their
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61372:84"/>
wood untill the end of <hi>April;</hi> but if any great boughs be cut from them, you muſt obſerve to cut them cloſe to the body of the Tree, and to cap or cover them preſently; for if the wood, where it is cut, remain uncovered, and open unto the air, it rots and cauſeth a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs in the body of the ſtemm, which increaſing by little &amp; little, gets at length into the heart of the Tree, and kills it.</p>
               <p>The ſame accident happens to bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ill cut, becauſe of the ſtumps there left, which hinder the recovering of the bark: Therefore the Gardiner cannot be too carefull in taking off branches from his Trees, to cut them all very ſmooth, and near the ſtemm, and if they be great, to cover them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately with Galt or Clay, wrought with Hay or Moſs, to keep them from the heat and ſcorching of the Sun, which hinders the ſap from coming to the cut; thoſe Chiſſels which Joyners uſe are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry commodious to cut off the greater boughs ſmooth and handſom, doing it
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61372:84"/>
much better than either Bill or Saw. The great trees being thus cleared and diſcharged of all their confuſed and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs boughes, do ordinarily put forth great ſtore of falſe ſprouts, which muſt every yeare be taken off with great care.</p>
               <p>To plaſh young trees planted againſt a wall, after that the uſeleſs branches are taken off, and ſuch as cannot well be brought unto the wall, you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the Maſter-bough, which muſt form the body of the tree: this muſt be placed ſtrait upwards, without leaning towards either ſide, and muſt be left ſhorter or longer at the top, according to the ſtrength of it, and of the tree: After which, all the reſt of the branches muſt be put in order on either ſide, and ſome of them laid, if it may be, within half a foot of the ground, to cover the lower parts of the wall: In plaſhing of theſe, you muſt guide them all, like the fingers of a mans hand when it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, or like the ribs of a Fan when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61372:85"/>
and care muſt be taken not to force or bend them, bowing like a Cats back, for if they be ſo forced, they make, as it were, an Elbow; where the ſap ſtopping alwayes puts forth a falſe ſhoot, which takes away all the ſtrength from the remainder of the bough, and hinders its growth: For this reaſon, the tops of the boughs muſt never be faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned lower than the place out of which they grow, but muſt ſtill be conducted along, ſomewhat aſcending.</p>
               <p>Obſerve likewiſe, that the branches muſt not be croſſed, nor paſſed one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove another, nor two faſtned in one place; but they muſt be ſeparated from each other, and ſet a convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance according to the number of them and the ſtrength of the Ttree.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, nevertheleleſs, the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinar is conſtrained, when the trees are old, and unfurniſhed with boughs in the middle, to turn the ſmaller bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches upwards, and to bring them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſtemm to preſerve the beauty
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61372:85"/>
of the tree, and hide ſuch places as are void and unfurniſhed: This want of boughs doth ordinarily befall to the tree, through the ignorance of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner, for want of his guiding them well at the firſt; or through his negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in pruning them, taking away their ſhoots, and plaſhing them in ſuch ſeaſons as are proper for them: For it is certain, that moſt trees become not unfurniſhed of boughs, but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have been neglected, or elſe cut and plaſhed inconveniently and out of ſeaſon: And Experience lets us ſee, that it is eaſie, with a little care and skill to keep them alwayes fair and well furniſhed with boughs, and to make them laſt a very long while, bearing fair fruit.</p>
               <p>In pruning and ſtopping the growth of the boughs, care muſt be taken fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to cut one ſhort betwixt two long ones, that being unequall when they come to ſpring, the middle of the tree may be the better furniſhed: In the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61372:86"/>
ſame manner muſt the branches of Dwarf-ſtanders be cut, becauſe that each branch, which is cut, doth put forth many more; and therefore being cut all of the ſame height, they cauſe a confuſion of branches on the top of the tree, and the midſt of it in the mean while remains unfurniſhed, becauſe the ſap deſires alwayes to aſcend, and runs more willingly into the higher boughs, than into thoſe that are lower: For which reaſon it muſt be ſtopped by this unequall cutting of the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p>The pruning depends principally upon the prudence of the Gardiner, which he ought diverſely to practiſe, according to the different qualities of the trees, &amp; according to their ſtrength: It being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that they muſt be cut more or leſs ſhort, according as their force is. I have ſeen ſome trees which the Gardiner durſt not cut nor ſtop very much, becauſe that being in very good ground, their ſap was ſo plentifull, that, if it were ſtopt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61372:86"/>
never ſo little, it would caſt it ſelf into the buds which would have born fruit, and make them grow into wood: For this cauſe the pruning muſt be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with skill and judgement, and not without great care; for it contributes very much, not onely to the fairneſs of the Fruit; but is further abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, for the keeping of the trees a long time ſtrong and vigorous.</p>
               <p>The importance of this care is not ſo viſible in the firſt years; becauſe at the firſt, the trees do alwayes ſpring with great force, and do appear fair, although they be not well ordered: But when this firſt vigour is paſt, men may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently begin to perceive a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; for they ſee ſuch as have been neglected, to diminiſh and come to nought in a ſhort time, and the others on the contrary, to maintain themſelves alwayes in their ſtrength; It being an effect of their cutting, which renews the trees by little and little from year to year.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:61372:87"/>
Pear-trees may be pruned all the Winter long; but the beſt ſeaſon of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, is (as I ſaid before) that of the Wane in <hi>February;</hi> This pruning is to be put in practiſe diverſly, according to the quality and condition of the trees; for ſometimes the boughs muſt be cut ſhort, when they ſhoot forth too abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly; ſometimes alſo, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to take off the young wood, and to preſerve the old, that they may bear the ſooner; and ſometimes it is not amiſs to cut off the old worn-out boughs, which have no ſtrength left, and to let the young ones grow in their places, that the trees may be renewed, and, as it were, made young again. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſometimes it is ſufficient to clear them, by taking away thoſe branches that are too confuſed.</p>
               <p>But that which the Gardiner, in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his trees, is principally to look after, is, that he leave neither the foot nor the body of the trees too much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſhed: For this reaſon he muſt cut
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61372:87"/>
them rather too ſhort, than leave the boughs too long, taking moſt from the higheſt branches, &amp; ſuch as are towards the top of the wall, becauſe theſe draw all the ſap to themſelves, and leave the bottom of the tree unfurniſhed: This is the cauſe that Peach-trees are ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be kept; Experience teaching us, that if the Gardiner do not perfectly underſtand the way of cutting them, and taking their ſprouts away, as they ought to be, they will be ruined in ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years, although, that being well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, they may laſt more than twenty years.</p>
               <p>Trees to be well pruned, muſt have their boughs every year refreſhed more or leſs, according to their force, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away the wood that ſprings, in the moneth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> (which being the ſhoot of the latter ſap cannot be ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) unleſs it be neceſſary to preſerve it for want of better, or that it be found to be ſtrong and well nouriſhed.</p>
               <p>Thoſe boughs alſo that ſhoot too faſt,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61372:88"/>
be ſtopped and kept ſhorter than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for they draw all the ſap to them, and wrong the reſt which are weaker: but the Maſter-bough muſt alwayes be preſerved, being that which grows ſtrait upwards; ſo ſtopping it from year to year, that it may always be the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, and maintain the ſhape of the tree. Thoſe boughes alſo which are weak and ſmall, muſt be ſhortened, and thoſe which are diſpoſed to bear fruit the year following; to the end, that they may grow ſtrong, and that their buds may be the better nouriſhed.</p>
               <p>It is further neceſſary, to prune thoſe branches that are full of fruit-buds, for the too great quantity of blooms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the trees: Beſides that, from thence the fruits do become leſs fair; but in the pruning of theſe, it muſt be obſerved, to cut them above a leaf-bud, and as near to it as may be, for two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: The firſt is, becauſe by that means the fruit will profit the more; for when it is not covered with leaves, it
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61372:88"/>
dries, and ſeldom arrives to its naturall perfection, or to be ſo good as others: The ſecond, becauſe ſo the branch will recover it ſelf that very year; whereas, if it be cut higher, and far from a leaf-bud, there will remain a little ſtump at the end of the twigg, which dries up, and cannot recover it ſelf in two or three years: As for ſuch boughs as are taken wholly off, they muſt (as I have often ſaid) be cut as near the ſtemm as may be, for ſo they will recover the ſooner, and that without making any knot.</p>
               <p>The pruning of Peach-trees muſt be the laſt of all, and then when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſpring, and are ready to flower; becauſe their young wood is ſo tender, that if it be cut it will be dried and ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon the leaſt froſt, from whence a great many of the ſmaller twiggs dye, and muſt oftentimes be cut again the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time.</p>
               <p>Dwarf-ſtanders, which are planted in open aire, muſt be pruned as thoſe that are planted againſt a wall; that is,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61372:89"/>
ſuch boughs as grow too faſt, muſt be ſhortened; thoſe that are vveak muſt be ſtopped, to make them grovv bigger; thoſe that are uſeleſs, muſt be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay; and if they ſhape not the tree vvell, they muſt, in their firſt years, be faſtened unto frames, to give unto the trees that roundneſs and faſhion vvhich you deſire.</p>
               <p>Some Gardiners there are, ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that they clip their Dvvarf-trees vvith ſhears, to ſhape them into a buſh, and to keep them the more neat, not knovving or conſidering, that by this means there is a confuſion of branches cauſed upon the tops of their trees, vvhich dravv all the ſap unto them, and leave the foot unfurniſhed; and that the ſame confuſion of branches ſo chokes up that little fruit vvhich they bear, that it can neither proſper, nor have a good taſt: For this reaſon theſe ſorts of trees muſt alvvayes be cut vvith a pruning-knife, thoſe boughs being kept lovv, vvhich do ſhoot up too much, and thoſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61372:89"/>
taken away, which are ſuperfluous, to preſerve thereby thoſe in the midſt of the tree, being thoſe that ordinarily do bear fruit.</p>
               <p>Plum-trees &amp; Cherry-trees muſt not be cut or ſtopped on the top, but onely cleared and diſcharged of their uſeleſs wood within the tree; and for this reaſon they are not proper to be kept as buſhes or dwarfs.</p>
               <p>The trees being thus pruned and plaſhed with care; as ſoon as the ſprouts begin to appear, and during the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths of <hi>May, June, July,</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> you muſt, in the Wane of the Moon, break the falſe ſhoots and ſprouts which come before and behind the ſtemm, and cut off thoſe that ſhoot upon the elbow of ſuch boughs as are bent, becauſe that theſe falſe ſhoots do carry away all the ſap of tree, and the nouriſhment of good boughs; you muſt likewiſe pinch ſuch as riſe too high, to make them fork, and furniſh the body of the tree; but then you muſt be carefull to do it ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61372:90"/>
before they be too long and too hard; for then they put ſorth ſpriggs onely at the ſecond or third laſt leaf-buds, and do not furniſh themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the foot; but if the Gardiner hath not been carefull to take off the falſe ſhoots from his trees in ſeaſon, ſo that they are now grown too hard, he muſt be content to cut them at two or three inches from the bough, to retain that ſap within the body of the tree, which theſe would carry away, and ſtay till the Winter following before he take them quite off; for ſo long as the tree is in its ſap, you muſt never, except in caſe of great neceſſity, cut off any branch from it, nor make the leaſt inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon it, for fear of harming it.</p>
               <p>The Gardiner muſt be carefull, as I have ſaid, in pruning his trees, &amp; taking off the ſhoots, not to leave them too naked; it being as dangerous to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way too much wood from them, as to leave them too confuſed; he muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſider the goodneſs of his
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61372:90"/>
ground, the force of the tree, and the manner of its ſpringing, whether it be with more or leſs vigour: It being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that if he pinch or ſtop thoſe too much, which are of great ſtrength, he deſtroys all their Fruit-buds, and makes them ſpring to wood; and, on the contrary, he alters and dries up thoſe that are weak and languiſhing.</p>
               <p>It is alſo of importance, that he take notice of the kind of the tree which he is to prune; for, as there are ſome ſorts of Pear-trees which do not ſo well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh themſelves with boughs as others, ſuch as the <hi>Rouſſelet,</hi> the <hi>Cuiſſe-Madame,</hi> and the <hi>Jargonelle,</hi> it is eaſie to be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that he muſt ſtop and pinch them ſhorter and oftener, to force them to put forth, and to furniſh themſelves with a greater ſtore of branches. He muſt further obſerve, in the ordering of Peaches and Abricots, that theſe kinds of trees, having very much ſap, become unfurniſhed in the middle, and come to ruine in a ſhort time, if he let them
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61372:91"/>
grow too far, or ſtay too long before he pinch them; for the great ſhoots which they put forth, do not only carry all the ſtrength of the foot to the top of the tree, but do alſo choke up the ſmaller branches that are behind, and thoſe which fill up the middle of the tree, and do hinder the fruit from having a good taſt or colour: He muſt therefore fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten, to the wall, all thoſe branches as they ſhoot, and plaſh the Peach-trees and Abricot-trees oftener, and with more care than the Pear-trees, becauſe that having more ſap, they put forth their ſhoots with more force.</p>
               <p>When the Wall-trees are grown to the top of the wall, and the Dwarfs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the heighth, which they ought to have, or if they grow crowned, and are worn out, they muſt be brought down, by cutting ſome of the principal boughs from the body of the ſtemm near unto ſome new ſhoot, that they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, and grow with young wood: This muſt eſpecially be practiſed upon
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61372:91"/>
ches and Pavies to make them young a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by little and little; for being whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly headed all at once, they dye, very ſeldome ſhooting again; except, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, common Peach-trees, and thoſe that grow of a ſtone, as thoſe that are planted in the Vineyards, which are renewed by lopping.</p>
               <p>Pear-trees and Abricot-trees, when they are paſt their ſtrength, and bear no more fruit, but ſuch as is ſmall and baſe, may have their heads cut off in the Wane of the Moon in <hi>February,</hi> at a foot above their diviſion, cutting them aſlope, with the cut towards the wall, that it may be ſhaded from the Sun, for ſo they will put forth new branches, vvhich in tvvo or three years do make a nevv tree, and bear fair fruit.</p>
               <p>If thoſe trees, vvhich ſtand in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen air, have their bark baſe, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vvith moſs, you muſt, in Winter, after a Rain, or in a miſty and moiſt ſeaſon, rub them vvith vviſpes of ſtravv or ſtubble, that are very rough,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61372:92"/>
and ſcrape off the moſs vvith knives of vvood, that it may fall off. After vvhich, you muſt, vvith a Bill, take avvay the old bark to the quick; for the trees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus cleared and diſcharged, do ſhoot forth vvith nevv ſtrength, bearing fairer and better nouriſhed Fruit.</p>
               <p>Sometimes alſo, trees may be renevv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by dunging &amp; laying ſoyl at the foot of them; But, as I have ſaid before, it muſt be onely vvhen they have need of it; for dung makes the fruit more rude and groſs: When you find it neceſſary to dung a tree, you muſt in <hi>November</hi> uncover the root of it, by taking avvay the earth half a foot deep, and four or five foot vvide about the ſtemm, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its bigneſs, ſo that the ſmalleſt part of the roots be laid bare, and then ſpread upon good, fat, half-rotten dung for the thickneſs of half a foot, till you come vvithin a foot of the ſtemm; for it can do no good to the greater roots, becauſe the tree dravvs its nouriſhment onely from the ſmall ones: aftervvards
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61372:92"/>
you muſt fling in the earth again upon the dung, and turf it on the top, that it may conſume in the Winter: When the trees are not to be dunged, it is needleſſe to open their roots every yeare, unleſſe it be in dry and hot grounds, where it is good to uncover them in <hi>November</hi> or <hi>December,</hi> and leave them ſo till Winter be paſt, that the Snow and Rain may the more moyſten the bottom of the ground: But in this caſe care muſt be had to leave the foot of the tree and the roots covered with a little earth, to defend them from the Froſt: In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoyles, if the Trees are not to be dunged, it will be ſufficient in <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> or <hi>November,</hi> to ſtir the ground well, four or five foot above the ſtemm.</p>
               <p>When it is neceſſary to dung Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-trees, Peach-trees, or Abricots, inoculated upon a Plumm-ſtock, or Pear-trees graffed upon a Quince, it is enough to ſpread the dung upon
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61372:93"/>
the ground ſix foot round about the ſtemm, and ſo to digg and work the Earth and it well together with a ſpade; for the roots of theſe ſorts of Trees ſpreading near the ſurface of the Earth, are eaſily ſenſible of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment.</p>

                  <p>The way of procuring fair Fruit.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALthough the beauty of Fruits de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends principally upon the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their kinds, and the vigour of the Trees; and though the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their taſt proceeds from the quality of the ſoyl, and their poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in regard of the Sun; yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not very fair. Fruits be had, unleſſe care be taken, when they are firſt knotted, to pluck off and disburthen
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61372:93"/>
the Trees of ſome of them, when they have too many; for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the ſap, ſpreading into too great a quantity of Fruits, cannot make them to grow great, or nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh them with ſuch abundance, as is neceſſary for their perfection: and therefore Fruit muſt never be left upon Trees but in proportion to their ſtrength.</p>
               <p>This care ſerves not onely to make the Fruits which remain, grow fairer and better; but it contributes very much alſo to the preſervation of the ſtrength of the Trees; and indeed we ſee, that ſuch Trees as bear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding full, and are not eaſed of their Fruit, do ſpend all their force, and ruine themſelves in two or three years: This courſe is principally to be taken with large Fruits, and Winter-Pears, becauſe they need much nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and hang a longer time upon the Trees.</p>
               <p>When there is too much Fruit upon
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61372:94"/>
the Trees, you muſt take off ſome of them at the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving to leave but few upon the weaker boughes, becauſe they have not ſap enough to nouriſh them: And for the ſame reaſon, there muſt no more be left upon the ſtronger boughs, but in proportion to their ſtrength, and not above one or two upon every knot, eſpecially upon the <hi>Bon Creſtien</hi> Pear-Trees; for by this means they become fairer without compariſon. But in the taking of the Fruits thus, you muſt be carefull to break off the Pears, or cut them in the middle of the ſtalk with ſhears, and to wring off the Abricots, Peaches, and Pavies, that you looſen not, nor harm the reſt.</p>
               <p>When the Fruits begin to grow ripe, if the heads be not too great, it is good to take away, or turn aſide the leaves that cover them, to make them better coloured: This muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly be practiſed upon the <hi>Winter-Bon
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61372:94"/>
Creſtien,</hi> Violet-Peaches, and Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Peaches, becauſe their Beauty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the brightneſs of their colour: But for this, the Gardiner muſt take a proper ſeaſon, and not uncover them but when it is convenient: For if he take away the leaves too ſoon, while the Fruit is yet tender, it dryes and burns away through the too great heat; and, on the contrary, if he ſtay too long, the Fruit remains without colour, and of a flatter taſt: This care is very neceſſary in cold and moiſt ſoyls, where the Fruit being more rude and groſs, hath need of a greater heat to ripen it well, and to give it a higher taſt.</p>
               <p>Every one may eaſily know the time that is the moſt proper for the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Summer-fruits: But for thoſe of the Autumn and the Winter, they muſt be left upon the tree as long as may be, becauſe ſo they will keep the better; Except, notwithſtanding, ſome of the Butter-pears, as the common
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61372:95"/>
                  <hi>Beurré,</hi> the <hi>Bergamot,</hi> the <hi>Summer Bon Creſtien,</hi> which muſt be gathered before they be fully ripe, for ſo they may be kept the longer, and are better, and leſs harſh.</p>
               <p>That Winter-fruits may keep well, they muſt be gathered in a fair ſeaſon, and carried into the room where they are to be kept; ſuch as are the beſt and moſt delicate, muſt be laid in rows upon the boards, and the reſt laid on heaps, and ſo left, the windows of the room being open for about a moneth, untill they have ſweat and caſt forth all their water; then the Fruits muſt be dryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, &amp; all the windows ſhut, &amp; opened no more untill all the Fruit be gone out: But as ſoon as the room is empty, it muſt be carefully cleanſed, and all the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows ſet open, that the air may carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and diſſipate the ſmell of the Fruit: The <hi>Winter Bon Creſtiens</hi> being well wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and dryed, muſt be laid without touching one another, in Preſſes cloſe ſhut, and care taken not to handle
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61372:95"/>
them, but by the ſtalk, leſt they grow black.</p>
               <p>A warm Fruit-chamber makes the Fruits to grow yellow and ripe the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; as on the contrary, when it is cold, they keep the longer, and ripen later: It ought to be ſo placed, that it freez not within it, no more than when O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range-trees are kept in Winter: But if the Fruits happen to be laid up in ſuch a place where the Froſt may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they muſt be covered with ſtraw when the Froſt begins, and wet Clothes be laid upon that, the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows cloſe ſhut, and not be touched till the Froſt and Thaw be wholly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the Fruits throughly dryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Concerning the Diſeaſes of Trees.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Diſeaſes of Trees do alwayes begin from their Roots, and are never cauſed but by the ill qualities of the Soyl which nouriſhes them; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſily judged that ſince from the ground they draw all their Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if that be good, they muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily profit; and, on the contrary, muſt languiſh, when that either wants moiſture, or elſe ſupplies them with ſuch as is bad: For this reaſon, when a tree droops, it may be concluded, that the ſoyl wherein it is planted is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for it; and therefore either its place muſt be changed, or the fault of the earth muſt be amended: I know very well, that the cauſe of the langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of a Tree proceeds ſometimes
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61372:96"/>
from the ill kind of plant upon which it is graffed, and ſometimes alſo from having been ill planted and ordered. But having already ſhown how good Plants may be choſen, and how Trees ought to be cultivated; I ſuppoſe, that he which plants, hath been carefull to chooſe none but good Trees, and that he orders them well, and therefore that they cannot be ſick but through the fault of the Soyl, which either hath not been enriched enough at the firſt, or elſe is now worn out.</p>
               <p>Trees do eaſily ſhew their maladies by their Leaves, which grow yellow; and by their Shoots, which are weak, languiſhing, and dry at the ends: Now ſeeing that Trees cannot ſuffer, but either from the too great drouth of the Earth, or elſe from its too much moyſture; it is eaſily known, that if they complain for being planted in too moiſt a Soyl, they muſt be kept dry, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſtones, or ſome other of the means heretofore mentioned: But, on
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61372:97"/>
the contrary, when they ſuffer in dry and hard grounds, it is neceſſary for their cure, that they have the earth ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them in <hi>November,</hi> and all their Roots being laid bare, muſt have Hoggs-dung, mixed with good Mould, ſpread upon them, becauſe this ſort of Dung, being cold, refreſheth and moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Ground, which is too dry, and takes away, conſequently, the cauſe of the Diſeaſe. Drooping Trees may alſo be helped by opening the Ground at the foot of them; and when the mould is well ſtirred, covering it with Pidgeons-dung, ſpread two or 3 inches thick over all the extent of the Roots: Which Dung muſt be left ſo ſpread untill <hi>March,</hi> and then be wrought in and mixed with the Mould; but none of this Dung muſt be ſpread within a foot of the Stemm. Yet this is not enough for the recovery of diſeaſed Trees, to have thus amended the Ground about their Roots, but it will be neceſſary likewiſe, in the months of <hi>February</hi> or
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61372:97"/>
                  <hi>March</hi> in the new Moon, to cut them very ſhort, and ſo let them ſhoot out all the Summer at full liberty, without pinching or plaſhing them, except it be very little, untill they be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recovered.</p>
               <p>When Trees grow dry, and die at the top, it is certain, that their evil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from their Roots, therefore muſt theſe be uncovered, and if they be yet ſound and ſtrong, the ends of each of them muſt be cut, and good Mould of Turfs, well mixed with Dung, muſt be laid upon them, and the top of the ſtemm muſt be cut off to the quick; for ſo the Tree having ſtrength remaining, &amp; not being as yet in its time of decay, ſhoots forth again, and renews it ſelf in a ſhort time: But if its Roots be rotten and ſpoyled, there is no other remedy but to ſtock it up, and to plant another in its place, after the Earth hath been changed and dunged, which cannot be otherwiſe than much vvorn out.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:61372:98"/>
Seeing that the end and perfection of Fruit-trees is to bear Fruit, it may be ſaid, that ſuch as are in their full ſtrength, and yet bear none, are defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive: This default comes either from their having bin inconveniently graffed, or elſe by reaſon of the too great plenty of nouriſhment, which makes them put forth nothing but Wood, and no Fruit; the remedy for which, is to weaken them by taking away from them this their too great vigour: To this end, the Earth muſt be taken from the foot of them in <hi>March,</hi> in the Wane of the Moon, and the half of ſome of their principall Roots muſt be cut off: And if they be great Trees, the ſtemms of them may be bored through the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with a Wimble near the ground, and the hole filled with a pin of dry Oak: For by tormenting the Trees on this manner, they loſe their too great force, and bear more; but the better and more aſſured vvay, vvhen theſe ſorts of Trees are capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61372:98"/>
graffed again, is, to re-graff them in a Cleft.</p>
               <p>There are ſome ſorts of Trees, as the <hi>Amadote,</hi> and ſome others, which do bear no Fruit, be it againſt a Wall, or as Dwarf-trees, untill they be old; I have taken notice, that the beſt way to make them bear, is when they are fit to be removed, to take them wholly up in <hi>November,</hi> in the Wane, and preſently to plant them again in the ſame, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place, with all their roots, onely a little refreſhing the ends of them, and cutting the tops of the boughs a little, as much as you would have done, had they not been taken up: Experience having taught me, that after this change they do, in a ſhort time, bear good ſtore of Fruit.</p>
               <p>There are ſome trees alſo, which are ſubject to a contrary fault to that now mention'd, which ruine and conſume themſelves within a few years, by too much bearing: To diminiſh this rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and mortal fruitfulneſs, their heads
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61372:99"/>
muſt be cut off, or their boughs ſhorte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the half, two or three dayes after the new Moon in <hi>March,</hi> and for two or three years all their Fruit-buds muſt be taken off; for by this means (provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that their roots be lively) they will grow much into wood.</p>
               <p>Trees are alſo ſubject to other Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as Cankers, which breed in their bark, and eat it, ſo that they cauſe the death of the bough whereon they are; Peach-trees and Abricot-trees are more ordinarily taken with this Diſeaſe than Pear-trees, becauſe of the too great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of their Sap; To heal them of it, you muſt, as ſoon as it appears, cut off all the bark which is eaten with it, and even the wood that is infected by it; and if it hath eaten round about, the bough muſt be cut off under-neath it to the quick, and the Cut muſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately be covered with freſh Cow-dung or Hogs-dung, and wrapped about upon that with Flax or Linnen, ſo that no air come to it: By this means will the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61372:99"/>
Canker be ſtopped from going fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the bough will recover.</p>
               <p>There are alſo certain Worms bred betwixt the Bark and the Wood of Trees, which do them much harm; when they are perceived, they muſt be followed, &amp; their track diſcovered with the point of the Pruning-knife, untill they be found: And if they be at the end of a bough, it muſt be cut off below them, and the opening which is made upon the bark, rubbed with Cow-dung or Hogs-dung, that it may the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily recover.</p>
               <p>Caterpillers are very hurtfull to Trees or Fruits; for which cauſe the Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners cannot be too carefull to take them away in the Winter, and to take heed that in Wall-trees no old leaf remain betwixt the Tree and the Wall, becauſe in ſuch they ſhelter themſelves: In the Spring, when the Trees begin to bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and grow green, an exact ſearch is very neceſſary to take away the Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillers, for then they run upon the bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61372:100"/>
and ſpoyl the Fruits as faſt as they knot; they are the cauſe of the unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs, which we ſee upon may Pears, for on that ſide where they have bitten or eaten them, the skin profits no more; ſo that the Pears increaſing, but upon one ſide, become hunch-back'd, and of an extravagant ſhape. The time of the day moſt proper for the taking away theſe Caterpillers, is betwixt nine and ten in the morning when the Sun ſhines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then they run upon the Blooms, and the new Shoots.</p>

               <head>A principall Advice concerning all Trees. The CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>IT would be to no purpoſe to have examined the nature of Trees with ſo much care, and to have given ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inſtructions for the well ordering of them, if I ſhould not conclude with that advice which I hold to be the principall
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61372:100"/>
and moſt important of all; ſhould I not ſhut up all with this truth, that, No man can have fair Plants, unleſs he love them: For it is neither the goodneſs of the Soyl, nor the quantity of Dung, nor the advantageous Situation, which make trees to grow well; but it is the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Maſter which animates them, and renders them ſtrong and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous. Thus we ſee, that if this Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be wanting, if they be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, though they be planted in the beſt Grounds, they languiſh and become unfruitfull. Men are no longer in the earthly Paradiſe, where they might eat the moſt admirable Fruits, without labour; they muſt till the Ground, they muſt cultivate the Trees, if they will gather the fruit of them. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture no longer yields any thing of her own accord, ſhe muſt be wooed and flattered, if vve vvould obtain vvhat vve deſire at her hands; vve muſt love Her, if vve vvould be loved by her. 'Tis this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which alone hath given me the skill I have in Plants: 'Tis that vvhich
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61372:101"/>
made me note thoſe faults I committed about them at the firſt: 'Tis that vvhich made me ſearch out the cauſes of them, and vvould give no repoſe unto my mind, till I had perfectly knovvn them. And therefore, if this love of Plants be not to be found in the heart of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or at leaſt in that of his Gardiner, I vvould not counſel him to plant, becauſe his labour vvill remain unprofitable, and vvithout Fruit; Nor have I vvritten theſe Memorials for others than thoſe that have this inclination, and are lovers of Plants; for having this affection, they need but ſmall aſſitance beſides, to do vvonders: And although I knovv vvell that my vvork is very rude, &amp; little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, I hope, notvvithſtanding, that it vvill prove uſefull for them in their vvork, by laying open unto them the vvay to nevv Knovvledge; ſo that being already good Gardiners, they may make uſe of it as a vvild-ſtock, upon vvhich they may put good Graffs, and gather from them excellent Fruits.</p>
