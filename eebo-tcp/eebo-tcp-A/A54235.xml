            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>JEHOVAH, the everlaſting Power, that ſpans out the
Heavens with his ſpan, and meaſures the Waters in
the hollow of his hand, before whom all Nations,
Tongues and People, are leſs than the drop to the
Ocean, or the Sand to the Sea ſhoar; who ſaid, Let all
things be, and they were, and by the ſame Word of his
Might, preſerves them to this very day, is Holy, Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and Juſt; and, as the moſt excellent part of the whole
Creation, made he Man, the Image of himſelf, by inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him with that Righteous Principle, and innocent Life,
which gave him Dominion and Authority over all his
works, allowing him to eat of every Tree, ſaving that of
Good and Evil, of which if he did eat, he ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
die. Happy had it been for <hi>Adam</hi> and his Poſterity,
had he obeyed Gods Commands; but tranſgreſſion by
diſobedience getting entrance, he ſoon died to his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
State, in which God created him, and became alive
in the Dominion ſin had over him, being now as one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Law, in whoſe fallen State all Nations have been, and
are, (let their Profeſſions ſeem never ſo great, and their
Sacrifices never ſo many) that live in the diſobedient Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and ſo ſtrangers to that Immortality and life Eternal,
the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> became dead and darkened to by his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
and which the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> raiſes to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and poſſeſſion of, by the power of his quickning
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93286:3"/>
Spirit; yet where the Devil (that ſubtile Serpent) hath
not totally extinguiſhed the notion of a God, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of his being worſhipped, it has been rather his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
than diſ-ſervice, to put the ſelfiſh part of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon ſacrificing, wickedly inſinuating that none can
be freed from ſin, and that the performing of Rites, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Ceremonies, is all God requires, and what is
neceſſary to procure acceptance with him. Thus 'twas
that murthering <hi>Cain</hi> became a Sacrificer, whoſe Sacrifice
God rejected, becauſe offered in the fallen unrighteous
and accurſed Nature. Such alſo were thoſe Generations
who drew near to God with their Lips, and to whom he
ſaid of old, <hi>What ſignifies the multitudes of your Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?

            <p>Therefore, O ye Princes, Prieſts, and People, the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
neceſſary, and weighty Queſtion I have to ask you all
in the dread &amp; fear of the everlaſting, Holy, Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
(by whoſe eternal Spirit the ſence of your preſent
State and Condition I perfectly have received) is this.
What Nature, what Heart, what Spirit, and what ground is
it in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> your Religions, Faiths, Works, Words and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
ſtand and grow? Is it the Divine, not the fallen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
It is the broken, not the ſtony Heart? Is it the
Contrite not the formal Spirit? Is it the Goſpel increaſing
good, not old <hi>Adams</hi> corrupt thorney Ground? For this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93286:3"/>
know, that no performances but by clean hands and a
pure heart, from whence evil doings are put away, can
give acceptance with the pure God.</p>
            <p>Come, anſwer me firſt, you <hi>Papiſts,</hi> whoſe Popes for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hundred years have ſat exalted in the hearts of Nations,
(God's Temple) above all that is called God: What Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
ever made a Pope, or gave authority to any one to
lord it over the Conſciences of others, ſince Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
that Chriſtians ſhould be Brethren? And by what
warrantable Tradition can be make, diſpoſe, and depoſe
Civil Empires? Whence came your Creeds but from facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and corrupted Councils, dyed in the blood of thoſe
who refus'd conformity? What Scriptures of the Holy
Prophets, and Apoſtles, or any Tradition for the firſt
three hundred years, mention a Maſs-Book, ſpeak of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
Chair, and a ſucceſſive Infallibility, or that ſay a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
is corporially the fleſh, blood and bones, which ſuffer'd
without <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> And where did they adore Images,
conſume many thouſands and millions in building, carving
and painting outward Temples, after <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> (the
Type) was deſtroyed, whilſt thouſands of poor Families
languiſhed through extream poverty? When did they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
Baby-Baptiſm, Churching of Women, Marrying by
Prieſts, Holy Water to frighten the Devil, hollowing of
Bells to ſcare evil ſpirits, making and worſhipping of
Croſſes, erecting of Altars? And where did they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Bowings, inſtitute Muſicks, appoint Holy Dayes,
Canonize Saints, chaffer and merchandize about Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,
pray for the Dead, preach or write for a Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
And what Book or Chapter in the Old or New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
mentions the degrees of Popes, Cardinals, Arch-Biſhops,
Deans, Prebeuds, Jeſuites, Franciſcans, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93286:4"/>
Urſelines, Capuchines, Benedictines, with
other ſuch like lazy Nuns and Fryars, for the edification
of Chriſts Church? But above all, when and where did
they authorize or indulge your Cruel, Perſecuting, Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
Racking, Inquiſition, Murdering Spirit? Whoſe
Popes, Faith, Church-Government, and whole Religion,
were founded, and are maintained by inhumane blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,

            <p>Thus have you <hi>Papiſts,</hi> through many Generations, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

who judgeth her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Come now, you that are called <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> however de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated

and that the Seals of blood they ſet to recommend their

openly affirm and declare; But that you of the Church of

Moſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 7. 52, 59.</note> and the <hi>Prophets, who crucified the Lord of Life,</hi>
is as poſitively diſowned: for as they were out of the Life
and Spirit of thoſe Holy Men, (though building and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
their Sepulchres, and making great profeſſion
with their words) inſomuch as that they ſlew thoſe whom
God ſent in the ſame Spirit to preach a farther Glory, and
to diſcover a more excellent way; ſo are you out of the
Power and Spirit your fore-Fathers lived and died in, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
their words, but perſecuting the ſame Spirit in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and crucifying it in your ſelves: No wonder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you have made ſo little progreſs ſince the firſt dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Reformation, being not yet got out of the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of <hi>Babylons</hi> form, and altogether in her luſtful, proud,
perſecuting and wicked Nature: For have not you <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi>
Princes condemned that in others, which you have
and do allow in your ſelves, contrary to your fore-Fathers
Proteſtations? Did you not return ſevere Perſecutions,
not onely upon the heads of the Roman Catholicks in
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, who eſteemed it Antichriſtian
in them; but even your fellow <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who through
zeal for God declared againſt your back-ſlidings? witneſs
