            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Creature,</hi> or on the contrary: As alſo to that <hi>Creation</hi> which is mediate, whether it be ſo in regard of the Efficient, or in regard of the Effect. And what abſurdity is there in all this?</p>

               <p>Indeed having poſitively determined that <hi>Matter</hi> is made by a Coalition of Clinging to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of <hi>Spiritual</hi> degenerate <hi>dull Monades</hi> or ſingle Beings, and that this Coalition is called Creation, I ſhould not ſpeak accurately if I ſhould ſay that Matter is made out of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But I ſhould aſſert that a Spirit is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced neither <hi>out of</hi> nothing, nor <hi>out of</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; becauſe the very Particle <hi>Ex (out of)</hi> reſpects a material cauſe, which is by no means admitted to be in Spirits. But the Inferences with which the firſt Axiom is load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do not touch my <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> But theſe Abſurdities, and Incongruities do flow from the vulgar Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Matter is Created by God out of nothing, viz.</hi> 1. That from a Being ſupreamly perfect, ſupreamly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66035:7"/>intelligent, ſupreamly free, having motion in and by it ſelf in the higheſt degree, ſupreamly penetrating, ſupreamly immutable, ſupream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſitive, ſupreamly living, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be produced a Being moſt abſolutely imperfect, in the higheſt degree void of all Science, Underſtanding and Knowledge; under the higheſt neceſſity and force imaginable, bound in the higheſt degree to the Laws of Paſſive Motion, and by conſequence deſtitute alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of <hi>all liberty</hi> and <hi>willing,</hi> wanting in it ſelf in the utmoſt degree <hi>all</hi> motion, and ſubjected only to the motions and impreſſions of others, and therefore of and in it ſelf in the higheſt degree quiet and immovable, wanting in it ſelf <hi>all</hi> penetration as well active as paſſive; moſt highly mutable, moſt highly privative, and deſpoiled of all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and the poſſeſſion of <hi>all real good,</hi> and therefore moſt <hi>highly dull, ſluggiſh</hi> and <hi>dead,</hi> and by conſequence enjoying <hi>nothing at all</hi> of thoſe things which are contained in the cauſe; whence alſo many have ſaid that <hi>nature</hi> is plainly contrary unto God: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as an efficient cauſe as it cannot produce any thing that is altogether like unto it <hi>ſelf:</hi> ſo neither can it produce any thing altogether
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66035:7"/>unlike unto it <hi>ſelf.</hi> 2. And yet this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſo <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>void,</hi> which is by us deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to occupy the leaſt part of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, is, notwithſtanding in this vulgar <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi> concluded to be co-extended, yea, co-exiſting, and co-ordinate with God, and therefore is lifted up into ſo high an eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>all</hi> the doctrine in the whole <hi>Pagan Philoſophy</hi> is exhauſted or drawn from this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>alone:</hi> which alſo is eſtabliſhed the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>all Theorems, Maxims,</hi> and <hi>Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> concerning <hi>Spirits,</hi> or concerning <hi>God;</hi> (which they call a Demonſtration <hi>a poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riori,</hi> that is, from effects, or <hi>poſterior Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations</hi>) whence it becomes an accurſed <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialiſm,</hi> and conſequently <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> 3.

The <hi>Creation</hi> of <hi>matter out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> doth directly and perfectly oppoſe, or is repugnant to the <hi>Wiſdom of God:</hi> inaſmuch as in the caſe thus ſtated, when he might have done that which was beſt, as for Example, he might have made every <hi>Creature</hi> a <hi>Spirit,</hi> yet <hi>ſome</hi> and <hi>ſo many</hi> he would <hi>make</hi> to be no <hi>Spirit,</hi> and not the beſt. 6.

               <p>The reſt fall of themſelves.
