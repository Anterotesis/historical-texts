            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And if a man should be mistaken in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to have deceived others also into a good opinion

               <hi>They</hi> are <hi>Theatre enough to one

            <p>And 'tis obvious enough to what good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses

is, in the design of it, wholly practical; Hath
little or nothing to do with disputation. If

'Tis indeed equally matter of complaint
and wonder, that men can find so much leasure
to direct from such things, wherein there is so
much both of importance and pleasure unto,
what one would think should have little of
temptation or allurement in it, contentions
jangling. It might rather be thought, its
visible fruits and tendencies should render
it the most dreadful thing to every serious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder.
What Tragedies hath it wrought in
the Christian Church! Into how weak and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
a condition hath it brought the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of professed Christians? Hence have risen
the intemperate preternatural heats and angers
that have spent its strength and spirits; and
make it look with so Meagre and Pale a face.
We have had a greater mind to dispute then
live; and to contend about what we know
not, then to practice the far greater things
we know: and which more directly tend to
nourish and maintain the Divine Life. The
Authour of that ingenious sentence<note n="*" place="margin">Pruritus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putandi sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies Ecclesia.</note> (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

their own offencive soreness, drain the

more disputable, the lesse it is necessary or
conducible to the Christian life. God hath
graciously provided, that what we are to live
by should not cost us so dear. And possibly as
there is lesse occasion of disputing about the
more momentous things of Religion, so there
may be somewhat more of modesty, and awe in
reference to what is so confessedly venerable

If a man be drawn forth to defend an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
truth against an injurious assault, it
were treacherous self-love to purchase his own
peace by declining it. Or if he did sometimes
turne his thoughts to some of our petite questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that with many are so hotly agitated, for
recreation sake, or to try his wit, and exercise
his reas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

disturbance of others or himself; here an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
divertisement, and the best purpose
that things of that nature are capable of
serving. But when contention becomes a mans
element, and he cannot live out of that
fire, strains his wit, and racks his inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to find matter of quarrel; is resolved,
nothing said or done by others shall please
him, onely because he means to please him in
dissenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>g. Disputes onely that he may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute,
and loves dissension for it self. This
is the unnatural humour that hath so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakably
troubled the Church, and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Religion, and filled mens Souls with
wind and vanity. Yea with fire and fury.
This hath made Christians gladiaters, and the
Christian World a clamorous Theater, while
men have equally affected to contend: and
to make ostentation of their ability so to
do.</p>
            <p>And surely as it is highly pleasurable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:48660:5"/>
others out of this noise and throng, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
silently and feed upon the known and
agree'd things of our Religion; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
lead to both the duties and delights
of it.</p>
            <p>Among which there are none more evident
and undoubted, none lesse intangled with
controversie, none more profitable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
then the <hi>future blessedness of the
righteous</hi> which this discourse Treats of.
The last end is a matter to little disput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that 'tis commonly thought (which is
elsewhere more distinctly spoken to) not to
be the object of election, and so not of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation
consequently, but of simple in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
onely, because men are supposed to
be generally agree'd as touching that. And
the knowledge and intention of it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
the very soul of Religion; animates,
direct, enlivens, and sweetens the whole there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Without which Religion were the vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
irrational and most unsavoury thing in
the World.</p>
            <p>And because the more clearly this our last
end is understood, the more powerfully and
sweetly it attracts and moves the Soul, this
Treatise endeavours to give as plain and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
a state and nation of it as the Text in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on, compared with other Scriptures
would afford to so weak an eye.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48660:6"/>
And because men are so apt to abuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the vain and self-contradicting
hopes of attaining this end without ever ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their spirits framed to it, or walking
in the way that leads thereto, as if they could
come to Heaven by chance, or without any
design or care of theirs. The proportion is
indeavoured to be shewn between that <hi>Divine
likeness</hi> in the vision and participation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
this Blessedness consists, and the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi>
that disposes and leads to it. Which
may it be monitory to the ungodly and profane,
who hate and scorn the likeness of God where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they hehold it. And let me tell such

            <head>THE
BLESSEDNESSE
OF THE
RIGHTEOUS.</head>
            <head type="sub">A Proemial Discourse to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Subject.</head>
            <p>THe continual mixture of Good, and
Evil, in this present state of things;
with its uncertain fluctuations, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to perpetual changes; do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
prompt a considering mind to the belief and
hope of <hi>another;</hi> that may be both more perfect,
and more permanent. For certainly it could
never be a design adequate (or any way agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able)
to the Divine Wisdom and goodness,
that the blessed God should raise such a thing, as
this lower Creation out of nothing; Only to give
<pb facs="tcp:48660:10"/>
himself the temporary pleasure of beholding
(the alternate Joys and Sorrows of the best part
thereof) his reasonable creature seated in it.
Nor a delight at all proportionable to an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
happy being; when he hath connaturalliz'd
such a creature to this sensible world; onely
to take notice how variously the passions he
hath planted in him may be mov'd and stir'd
by this variety of occasions, which he shal thence
be presented with. And what suddain, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
impressions may be made upon his easie
passive senses, by the interchanged strokes and
touches of contrary objects. How quickly he can
raise him into a transport of high contentment,
and pleasure; and then how soon he can again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
him to a very Paroxism of anguish and
despair. It would discover us to have very
vile and low thoughts of God, if we did not
judge it altogether unanswerable to his perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
to design no further thing in creating
this world, and placing such a creature as man
in it; then onely to please himself for a while
with such a spectacle, and then at last clear
the Stage, and shut up all again, in an eternal
Silent darkness. If we could suppose a <hi>man</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with such <hi>power,</hi> he would surely adde
little to the reputation of his being <hi>wise,</hi> or <hi>good</hi>
beyond other <hi>men,</hi> by a design so to use it.</p>
            <p>Much less, can we think it worthy of God to
<hi>perpetuate</hi> such a state of things as this; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
a succession of such persons and actions,
as we now behold in the world, through eternal
generations; onely to perpetuate to himself
the same pleasure, in the exercise of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
<pb facs="tcp:48660:10"/>
power, upon created natures; over
which he hath so infinite advantage.</p>
            <p>And indeed nothing can be more uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable,
then that the great Creatour and
Authour of all things, should frame a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of so vast comprehension, as the Spirit of
man, put into it a capacity of knowing, and
conversing with himself; give it some prospect
of his own glory and blessedness, raise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
in many, boundless unsatisfied desires after
him, and an unexpressible pleasure in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceived
hope of being received into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of that glory and blessedness; and yet
defeat and blast so great an expectation by the
unsuspected reducement of the very subject of
it again to nothing. Yea, and that he should
deal herein (as in that case he must) the most
hardly with the best; And that such souls,
whose meer love and devotedness to him, had
made them abandon the pleasures of this life,
and run thorough whatsoever difficulties for his
sake, should fare worse then the very worst,
were,<note place="margin">

and a thought which Pagan-reason
hath not known how to digest or entertain.
<q>If (saith one, and he speaks the sense of
many another, as well as his own) with the
dissolution of our bodies, the essence of the
Souls, whatsoever that be, should be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
too, and for ever cease to be any thing;
I know not how I can account them blessed,
that never having enjoyed any good, as the
reward of their vertue, have even perished
for vertue its self.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48660:11"/>
Wherefore it is consequent that this present
state is only intended for trial to the spirits of
men, in order to their attainment of a better state
in a better world. That is, that inasmuch, as the
infinitely wise and blessed God, had given being
to such a creature, as man, in which both
words (the material, and the immaterial)
did meet; And who, in respect of his Earthly,
and Spiritual natures, had in him somewhat
suitable to each. And whereas this Creature
had lost (with his interest) his very inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Spiritual Objects, and enjoyments
of the purer immaterial world (wherein alone
his true blessedness could consist) suffered a
vile depression of his Spirit unto this gross cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
world; and hereby brought himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a necessity of being miserable; his nobler
part having nothing now to satisfie it, but
what it was become unsuitable and disaffected
to.</p>
            <p>His merciful Creatour, being intent upon
his restitution, thought fit not to bring it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
by a suddain and violent hand (as it
were to catch him into Heaven against his
will:) But to raise his Spirit into its just
Dominion and Soveraignty in him, by such
gradual Methods, as were most suitable to a
rational, and intelligent nature. That is, to
discover to him, that he had such a thing as
Spirit about him; whence it was fall'n,
how low it was sunk, to what state it was yet
capable to be rais'd; and what he had design'd,
and done for its happy recovery. And hence
by the secret and powerful insinuations of his
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:48660:11"/>
own Light and Grace to awaken his drowsie
slumbering reason, and incline his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
and wayward will, to the consideration
and choice of such things, as that felicity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in; which that better world can afford,
and his better part enjoy.</p>
            <p>And while he propounds such things to him,
how reasonable and agreeable was it, that he
should keep him sometime under a just proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(yea, how much was there in it, of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and compassionate indulgence, often to
renew the trial? whether he would yet bestir
himself; and (having so great hopes before
him, and such helps and aids afforded him, and
ready to be afforded) apply, at last, his intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual,
and elective powers, to mind and close
with so gracious overtures, in order to his own
eternal advancement and blessedness.</p>
            <p>Nor was it an unreasonable expectation, that
he should do so. For, however the temporal
good, and evil that may constantly affect his
sensitive part and powers, be present and near;
but the eternal misery, or blessedness of his
Soul future, and remote: Yet inasmuch as
he is capable of understanding, the vast dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportions
of <hi>time</hi> and <hi>eternity;</hi> of a mortal
flesh, and an immortal Spirit: How prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous
a course were it, and unworthy of a
man; Yea, how dishonourable and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to his Maker; should he prefer the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
pleasures of narrow incapatious sence,
to the everlasting enjoyments of an inlarged
comprehensive Spirit? Or, for the avoiding the
<pb facs="tcp:48660:12"/>
pains and miseries of the former kind, incur
those of the latter?</p>
            <p>Whence also, the holy God doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
and require, onely that men should make
that wiser choice; But doth most justly lay the
weight of their eternal states upon their doing,
or not doing so. And in that day when he
shall <hi>render to every one according to their works;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2, 6, 7, 8, 9.</note>
make this the Rule of his final judgment. To
<hi>allot to them, who by a patient continuance in well
doing, seek for honour, glory, and immortality, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
life.</hi> To the rest, <hi>indignation and wrath,
tribulation, and anguish,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that whether
they be Jews, or Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it a new thing in the world, that
some among the children of men, should in
this comply with the righteous will of God,
and so judge, and chuse for themselves, as he is
pleased to direct and prescribe. 'Tis a course ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the concurrent suffrage of all them,
in all times and ages, into whose minds the
true light hath shined, and whom God hath
inspired with that wisdom, whereby he maketh
wise to salvation.</p>
            <p>That numerous Assembly of the perfected
Spirits of the just, have agreed in this common
resolution. And did in their several genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ere they had past this state of tryal,
with an Heroique magnanimity trample
this present World under their feet, and
and aspire to the glory of the world to
come. Relieving themselves against all the

can I better expresse its place, and reference

<hi>some better state in this life</hi> in comparison
whereof the Psalmist reckons his present state
but as a sleep; or the future state of blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
in the other life. There have been
some, who have understood it of the former,
and thought the Psalmist to speak onely of an
hoped freedom from his present temporal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
but then, that which will be imply'd
seems not so specious; that trouble and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

            <p>That Saints, at that <hi>time when</hi> this was writ,
had the knowledge of such a state (indeed a
<hi>Saint not believing a life to come,</hi> is a perfect
contradiction) no doubt can be made by any
that hath ever so little read and compared the
Old and New Testament.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> We are plainly
told that those excellent Persons mentioned

We know it was the more general belief of the

they have it, but from the Old Testament?
Thither our Saviour remits them to search it
out,<note place="margin">John 5. 39.</note> and the way to it. The Apostle Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> gives it as the common faith of the twelve
Tribes;<note place="margin">Act. 16. &amp; 6. 7. <hi>compared with the</hi> 8.</note> grounded upon the promise made to
their forefathers: and thence <hi>prudentially</hi> he
herein states the Cause, wherein he was <hi>now</hi>
engag'd; supposing it would be generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
that he should be call'd in question,
for avowing (onely) so known, and received
a truth. Sure, they were beholding to these
sacred Writings they had then among them,
for so common a belief: and since it is out
of question, from our Saviours expresse words,
they do contain the ground of that belief;
what cause have we to be so shy of so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
Scriptures, that have a fair aspect that
way?</p>
            <p>Is it, that we can devise to fasten here and
there another sence upon divers such? I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
what one text can be mentioned in all the
Old Testament to this purpose, wherein one
may not do so: and what then would be the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of this course, but to deny in <hi>all the
particulars:</hi> what, upon so clear evidence, we
are, <hi>in the general,</hi> forced to admit? and to
put <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> in a
lower classe, then <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> and
<hi>Plato.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I think, it would not be easie to find
one text in all that part of the Bible; where
both the words thereof, and the context, do
more fairly comply than in this, so as not only
to admit, but even to invite that interpretation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48660:17"/>
For the terme <hi>[awake]</hi> about which the
present enquiry is, how apt and obvious i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
the analogy between our awaking out of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
sleep, and the holy souls emerging out
of the darknesse and torpor of its present state,
into the invigorating light of Gods presence.
It is <hi>truely</hi> said so to <hi>awake,</hi> at its first quitting
these darksom regions, <hi>when</hi> it layes aside its
cumbersom night-vail. It doth so more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
in the joyful morning of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
day, when mortality is swallowed up in
life, and all the yet-hovering shaddows of it
are vanished and fled away. And how known
and usual an application this is of the meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical
terms of <hi>sleeping</hi> and <hi>awaking</hi> in holy
Writ, I need not tell them, who have read
the Bible. Nor doth this interpretation lesse
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itly accord to the other contents of this verse.
For to what state do the <hi>sight of Gods Face,</hi>
and <hi>satisfaction with his likenesse,</hi> so fully agree,
as to that of future blessednesse in the other
world.</p>
            <p>But then the contexture of discourse, in
this and the foregoing verse together, seems
plainly to determine us to this sense. For
what can be more conspicuous in them, then
a purposed comparison and opposition of two
States of Felicity mutually each to other?
<hi>That of the wicked,</hi> whom he calls <hi>Men of

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:48660:17"/>
Thirdly, it is further to be enquired, how we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
are here to understand [the likeness of God] I
doubt not but we are to understand by it, <hi>his
glory.</hi> And the only difficulty which it will be
necessary, at present, to consider, about it, is;
whether we are to take it <hi>objectively</hi> or <hi>subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively,</hi>
for the glory to be <hi>represented</hi> to the
blessed soul; or the glory to be <hi>imprest</hi> upon
it; the glory which it is to <hi>behold,</hi> or the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it shall <hi>bear.</hi> And I conceive the difference
is more easily capable of <hi>accommodation</hi> then of
a strict <hi>decision</hi> on either part.</p>
            <p>By [Face] is undoubtedly meant <hi>objective
glory,</hi> and that in its most perfect representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(the face being, as we know with men, the
chief seat of a spectable Majesty and Beauty.)
Hence when <hi>Moses</hi> desires to see Gods glory;
though he did vouchsafe some discovery of it,
yet he tells him his <hi>face</hi> cannot be seen. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
therefore, the next expression [thy like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness]
might the more plausibly be restrained
to <hi>subjective glory;</hi> So as to denote the Image
of God now in its most perfect impression on
the blessed souls.</p>
            <p>But that I insist not on; Supposing therefore,
that what is signified by [Face] be repeated o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
again in this word [likeness] yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the expression is not varied in vain, but
having more to say than only that he expected
a state of future <hi>Vision,</hi> viz. that he assured
himself of <hi>satisfaction</hi> too, another word was
thought fit to be used that might signifie also
<hi>somewhat</hi> that must intervene in order to
that satisfaction. 'Tis certain the meer
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48660:18"/>
objective representation and consequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition
of the most excellent, (even the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine)
glory, cannot satisfie a soul remaining
disaffected and unsuitable thereunto. It can
only satisfie, as <hi>being represented,</hi> it forms the
soul into the same image, and attempers it to
it self. <hi>q. d.</hi> I expect hereafter to see the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Face of God, and to be my self blessed or
satisfied by his glory, at once appearing to me
and transfusing it self upon me. In short
therefore, I understand by that tearm, <hi>the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God as transforming,</hi> or, <hi>as impressive of it
self.</hi> If therefore, <hi>Glory the Object of the soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Vision,</hi> shall by any be thought to be intended
in it, I contend not; Supposing only, that the
<hi>Object</hi> be taken not <hi>materially,</hi> or <hi>potentially</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for the thing visible in it self considered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but <hi>formally,</hi> and <hi>in esse actu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ti objecti:</hi> that is,
as now <hi>actually impressing it self,</hi> or as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting
such an impression upon the beholding
soul. For so only is it productive of such a
pleasure and <hi>satisfaction</hi> to it, as must ensue.
As in this form of speech [such a man takes
pleasure in knowledge] it is evident knowledge
must be taken there both <hi>objectively,</hi> for the
things known, and <hi>subjectively,</hi> for the actual
perception of those things; in as much as, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently,
<hi>both</hi> must concur to work him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
So it will appear, to any one that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively
considers it, <hi>glory</hi> must be taken in
that passage <hi>we rejoyce in hope of the glory of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom 5. 2.</note>
'Tis Divine glory both <hi>revealed</hi> and <hi>received.</hi>
His exhibition and communication of it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his <hi>immensity,</hi> and our participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48660:18"/>
of it, according to our <hi>measure</hi> that must
concurr to our eternal satisfaction. Herein
the Platonique adage<note n="†" place="margin">Voluptatis ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratio est ex in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiti &amp; finiti copulatione.</note> hath evident truth in
it. Pleasure is here certainly made up of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
finite and something infinite, meeting
together. 'Tis not (as the Philosopher speaks)
a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but a <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, not any thing separate
from the soul, but something it possesses that
can make it happy. 'Tis not happy by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
happiness, nor glorious by an
incommunicate glory. Indeed the discovery
of such a glory to an inglorious unholy soul

And in the foregoing words, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
assures Christs fellow sufferers that they
shall be <hi>glorified</hi> together with him. Surely the
notation of that word, the formall notion of
glorification cannot import so little as only,
<hi>to be a Spectator of Glory:</hi> it must signifie a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>made glorious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is the common and true Maxime other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
intelligible, that grace and glory differ
only in degree For certainly, it could never
enter into the mind of a <hi>sober</hi> man (though how
dangerously some speak that might possibly
have been so if too much learning had not
made them <hi>mad,</hi> will be animadverted in its
place) that <hi>objective glory, and grace in Saints,</hi>
were the same specifique (much less the same
numerical) thing.</p>
            <p>'Tis true that Scripture often expresses the
future blessedness by <hi>vision of God.</hi> But where
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48660:19"/>
that phrase is used to signifie it alone, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
(as within the lower region of grace,
words of knowledge do often imply affection,
and correspondent impressions on the soul)
it must be understood of affective transforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Vision, such as hath conformity to God
most inseparably conjunct with it. And, that
we might understand so much, they are else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
both expresly mentioned together, as
joynt-ingredients into a Saints blessedness; as
in those words so full of clear and rich sense.
<hi>When he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we
shall see him as he is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Text I take for a plain Comment
upon this; and me-thinks it should not easily
be supposeable they should both speak so near
the same words and not intend the same sense:
you have in both the same season <hi>When he shall
appear,</hi> when <hi>I shall awake,</hi> the same subject
the <hi>righteous</hi> person <hi>born of God,</hi> (compare
the close of the former Chapter with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of this) and <hi>I in righteousness,</hi> The same
Vision, <hi>We shall see him as he is, I shall behold
his face,</hi> The same Assimilation, <hi>We shall be
like him, I shall be satisfied with his likeness;</hi>
(concerning the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or habitude this vision
and assimilation mutually have to one another,
there will be consideration had in its place.)</p>
            <p>I therefore conceive neither of these No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the <hi>Divine likeness,</hi> do exclude the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
if it be enquired which is principally
meant, That needs not be determined; if the
latter, it supposes the former; if the former,
it infers the latter. Without the first, the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48660:19"/>
other cannot be, without this other, the first
cannot satisfie.</p>
            <p>If any yet disagree to this Interpretation of
this Text, let them affix the Doctrine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
from it to that other last mentioned
(which only hath not the expresse mention of
a consequent satisfaction as this hath, whence
therefore, as being in this respect fuller, my
thoughts were pitch'd upon this.)</p>
            <p>Only withal let it be considered how much
more easie it is, to <hi>imagine another</hi> sense, and
suppose it possible, than to <hi>disprove</hi> this, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
it <hi>impossible.</hi> How far probable it is,
must be left to the judgment of the indifferent:
With whom, it may not be insignificant to add,
that thus (mostly) it hath been understood by
Interpreters, (I might adventure to say the
generality) of all sorts: however the few an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed

               <p>A summary proposal of the Doctrine contained
in this Scripture. A distribution of it
into three distinct Heads of Discourse, viz.
1. The qualified subject. 2. The Nature.
3. The season of the blessedness here spoken

where the qualification righteousness

            <p>
               <hi>NOW the foregoing sense of the
words being supposed, It appears
that the proper Argument of this
Scripture is,</hi> The blessedness of the
righteous in the other life, consisting in the vision,
and participation of the Divine glory, with the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
that resulteth thence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:48660:20"/>
In which summary account of the Doctrine
here contained. Three general Heads of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
offer themselves to our view.</p>
            <p>The
<list>
                  <item>Subject,</item>
                  <item>Nature,</item>
                  <item>Season,</item>
               </list>of this Blessedness.</p>
            <p>Or to whom it belongs, wherein it consists,
and when it shall be enjoyed.</p>
            <p>First then, we begin with the consideration <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
of the subject, unto whom this blessedness ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains.
And we find it exprest in the Text,
in these only words [I; in righteousness]
which amount to as much as <hi>A Righteous person
as such.</hi> They represent to us, the subject of
this Blessedness in its proper qualification.
Wherein, our business is to consider his quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<hi>Righteousness,</hi> under which Notion
only he is concerned in the present Discourse.
And about which two things are to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

               <item>How it Qualifies.</item>
            </list>
            <p>First, What it imports. I take Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=""/>
here to be opposed to Wickedness in the
foregoing verse, (as was intimated before) and
so understand it in an equal Latitude: not of
<hi>particular,</hi> but of <hi>universal righteousness:</hi> That
is, not that particular vertue, which inclines
men to <hi>give</hi> every one their right (unless in
that <hi>every one,</hi> you <hi>would</hi> include also the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God himself, the Sovereign common Lord
of all) but an universal rectitude of heart and
life, comprehending not only equity towards
men, but piety towards God also. A <hi>confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:48660:21"/>
to the Law in general, in its <hi>utmost</hi> extent,
adequately opposite to <hi>sin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 1. 9.</note> (which is indeed of
larger extent than wickedness; and in what
different respects righteousness is commensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
to the one and the other, we shall see by
and by) as that is, <hi>generally,</hi> said to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,

                  </gap>.</note> such a comprehensive
Notion of righteousness as is inclusive of all
other vertues is not unknown. But in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it is, its much more ordinary acceptation.
To give instances, were to suppose too much
ignorance in the Reader, and to enumerate the
passages in which this term is taken in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive
sense, were too great an unnecessary
burden to the writer. It were indeed to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
a great part of the Bible. How familiar
is the opposition of righteous and wicked, and
righteous and sinner in sacred Language! And
how fully coextent righteousness is in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
Notion of it to the whole Law of God,
that one passage sufficiently discovers, Where
'tis said of <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> that
they were both <hi>righteous</hi> before God,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 5, 6.</note> walking
<hi>in all the commandments</hi> and <hi>ordinances</hi> of the
Lord blameless.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, that when the words <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi>
or <hi>holiness</hi> are in conjunction with this
tearm, its significancy is divided and shared
with them, so as that <hi>they</hi> signifie, in that case,
<hi>conformity to the will of God</hi> in the duties of the
<hi>first</hi> Table, and <hi>this</hi> is confined to those of
the <hi>second:</hi> Otherwise, being put alone, it
signifies the <hi>whole of man;</hi> as the other expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48660:21"/>
also do in the same case, especially the
latter of them.</p>
            <p>As it seems not to be within the present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of the Context to take notice of any <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
wickedness,</hi> of the opposite sort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
other than what was <hi>really in them,</hi> and
whereby they might be fitly characterized: so I
conceive, <hi>imputed righteousness</hi> is not here meant
that is inherent in the person of the Mediator,
but that which is truly subjected in a child of
God, and descriptive of him. Nor must any think
it strange, that all the requisites to our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are not found together in one Text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
The righteousness of Him, whom we
are to adore as made <hi>sin</hi> for us, that we might
be made the righteousness of God in him, hath
a much higher sphear peculiar and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
to it self. <hi>This</hi> of which we now speak,
in its own inferiour and subordinate place, is
necessary also to be, (both had and) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
            <p>It must be understood by viewing it in its
Rule, in conformity whereto it stands; which
must needs be some Law of God. There hath
been a twofold Law given by God to mankind,
as the measure of a <hi>universal</hi> Righteousness, the
one made for <hi>innocent,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> for <hi>lapsed</hi> man,
which are distinguished by the Apostle under
the names of the <hi>Law of works,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </note> and the Law of

            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48660:22"/>
The latter therefore is the onely measure
and rule of this Righteousness, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Law
of Faith;</hi> or that part of the Gospel-revelation
which contains and discovers our duty, what
we are to be and do in order to our Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
being, as to the matter of it, the whole
Moral Law, before appertaining to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

indulgency by the super-added precepts of
repentance and faith in a Mediator, with all the

            <p>This Rule, though it be in the whole of it

<hi>as being the standing obliging Law of
Christs mediatory Kingdom,</hi> yet according to
the different matter of it, its obligations and
annexed sanctions are different.</p>
            <p>As to its matter; it must be understood to
require</p>
            <p>1. The meer being and sincerity of those
gracious principles with their essential Acts (as
there is opportunity) expressed therein, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position

               </gap>uteable to such apprehensions as these, <hi>Viz.</hi>
That as it was not the Author of being to it
self, so it ought not principally to study the
pleasing and serving of it self, but him, who
gave it being: that it can no more conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
and perfect it self unto blessedness, than
it could create it self; and can therefore have
no expectation hereof, but from the same
Author of its being: And hence that it must
respect, and eye the great God, its Creator,
and Maker, as</p>

have any particular expectation of savours
from him, without knowing what he will
please to <hi>bestow:</hi> and is therefore obliged to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the revelations of his Will concerning
both these. It is therefore necessary, that he
eye him under a notion introductive, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient
to all the operations, that are to be
exerted towards him, under the two former
notions: <hi>i. e.</hi> as the <hi>Eternal never failing Truth,</hi>
safely to be depended on, as intending no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

is recovered, and he again becomes

            <p>That it was not agreeable to Gods wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
truth, and legal justice, to treat with
Man a <hi>Sinner,</hi> in order to his recovery, but

was pleased in wonderfull mercy, to consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute

which the Spirit of Man must alwayes have

this righteousness conduceth to life is exprest
by the same Praeposition as in the Text. In
this kind it is not at all causal of this blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but 'tis that which the free, and wise,
and holy Law-giver thought meet, by his set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
constitution (besides what necessity there
is of it upon another account) to make requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
thereto. The conformity of our Lord
Jesus Christ to that severer Law, under which
he is said to have been made, is that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
causes, merits, purchases this blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which yet is to be enjoyed, not by all
<hi>indiscriminatim,</hi> or without distinction; but by
such alone, as come up to the terms of the
<hi>Gospel,</hi> as he did fully satisfie the strict exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of that other rigid Law, by doing and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
for their sakes.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Naturally,</hi> or <hi>in genere Physico.</hi> In this
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48660:27"/>
kind it may be said to be some way causal, that
is, to be a <hi>causa materialis dispositiva,</hi> by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
positive influence, disposing the subject
unto this blessedness, which that it <hi>shall,</hi> yet,
enjoy, is wholly to be resolved into the
Divine good pleasure, but it is put by this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rectitude into that temper, and posture that
it <hi>may</hi> enjoy it, through the Lords gracious
vouchsafement; when without it, 'twere na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
impossible that any should. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
impure soul, is in a natural indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to <hi>see God</hi> or <hi>be blessed in him.</hi> That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
temper averts it from him, the steady
bent of its will is set another way, and 'tis a
contradiction that any (<hi>in sensu composito) should</hi>
be happy against their wills, <hi>i. e.</hi> while that
aversion of will yet remains. The unrighteous
banish themselves from God, they shun, and
hate his presence. Light and darkness cannot
have communion. The Sun doth but shine,
continue to be it self, and the darkness vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,
and is fled away. When God hath so
determined that only <hi>the pure in heart shall see
him,</hi> that <hi>without holiness none shall;</hi> he layes
no other Law upon unholy souls than what
their own impure natures lay upon themselves.
If therefore it should be enquired, Why may
not the unrighteous be subjects of this blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>See God,</hi> and <hi>be satisfied with his likeness,</hi>
as well as the righteous; the question must be
so answered, as if it were enquired, Why doth
wood admit the fire to passe upon it, suffer its
flames to insinuate themselves till they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
its proper form, and turned it into
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48660:28"/>
their own likeness: but we see water doth not
so, but violently resists its first approaches and
declines all commerce with it? The natures
of these agree not. And is not the contrariety
here as great? We have then the qualified
subject of this blessedness; and are next to
consider <hi>This Blessedness it self.</hi>

               <p>The nature of this Blessedness propounded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

1. Vision of Gods Face. 2. Assimilation

2. Relatively in their mutual respects to

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> NOW for <hi>the Nature of this Blessedness;</hi>
or the inquiry wherein it lyes, so
far as the Text gives us any account
of it, we are invited to turn our
thoughts and discourse to it. And we have it
here represented to us in all the particulars
that can be supposed to have any nearer interest
in the business of Blessedness, or to be more
intimate and intrinsical thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:48660:28"/>
For (the beatifique Object supposed) what
more can be necessary to actual, compleat for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
blessedness, than <hi>the sight of it,</hi> and <hi>adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
or assimilation to it</hi> (which is nothing else
but its being actually communicated and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
to the soul, its being united and made as
it were one with it) and the <hi>complacential fruition</hi>
the soul hath of it so communicated, or having
so transformed it into its self?</p>
            <p>And these three are manifestly contained in
the Text (the beatisique Object being involved
with them) the first in the former clause, <hi>I
shall behold thy face,</hi> the second and third in the

<hi>being made like to God</hi> hath been discovered to be
supposed, &amp; the <hi>satisfaction,</hi> the pleasant content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

            <p>We shall therefore have stated the entire

these three things.</p>

               <item>Vision of the Face of God.</item>

            <p>Therefore first, in the absolute considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:48660:29"/>
1. <hi>The Face of God</hi> (the Object of this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion)
which is his glory represented, offered
to view. And <hi>this objected or exhibited glory</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
twofold.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Sensible,</hi> such as shall incurr and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
(after the resurrection) the bodily eye.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Intellectual,</hi> or <hi>intelligible:</hi> that <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
glory</hi> that only comes under the view and
contemplation of the glorified mind.</p>
            <p>1. A sensible glory, (to begin with what is
lower) is fitly in our way to be taken notice
of; and may well be comprehended (as its
lesse-principal intendment) within the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficancy
of the expression <hi>the Face of God.</hi> So
indeed it doth evidently signifie, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 11.
And if we look to the <hi>notation</hi> of the word, and
its frequent use as applied to God, it may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously
enough and will often be found to
signifie, in a larger and more extended sense,
any <hi>aspect</hi> or <hi>appearance</hi> of God: And though
it may be understood verse 23. of that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to signifie an overcoming spiritual glory,
as the principal thing there intended, such as
no soul dwelling in flesh, could behold, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
renting the vail and breaking all to pieces;
yet, even there also, may such a degree of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
glory be secondarily intended, as it was
not consistent with a state of mortality to be
able to bear.</p>
            <p>And supposing the other expression [Thy
likeness] to signifie, in any part, the <hi>objective
glory</hi> Saints are to behold, it is very capable of
being extended so far, as to take in a sensible
appearance of glory also, which it doth in these
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48660:29"/>
words, <hi>The similitude of the Lord shall he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi>
(yet even that glory also was transforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and impressive of it self:<note place="margin">Numb. 12. 8. to Ezek 1. 28.</note> Moses so long

               </note> of converse with men, as you
know the story relates.)</p>
            <p>Such a glory as this, though it belong not
to the being of God, yet it may be some

            <p>And in as much as that spiritual Body (<hi>the

               </note> resined to that degree, as may be

A faculty without an object is not possible
in Nature; and is altogether inconsistent with
a state of Blessedness. The bodies of Saints will
be <hi>raised in glory—fashioned like Christs glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

and this will connaturalize them to a
Region of glory, render a surrounding sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
glory necessary, and natural to them,
their own element: they will as it were not
be able to live but amidst such a glory. Place
is conservative of the body placed in it, by
its suitableness thereto. Indeed every created
being (inasmuch as it is not self-sufficient,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48660:30"/>
and is obliged to fetch in continual refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
from without) must alwayes have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
suitable to it self to converse with, or it
presently languishes. By such an harmony of
actives and passives the world consists and
and holds together. The least defect thereof,
then, is least of all supposeable in the state of
blessedness.</p>
            <p>The rayes of such a glory have often shone
down into this lower World. Such a glory
we know, shewed it self upon Mount <hi>Sinal:</hi>
afterwards often about the Tabernacle, and in
the Temple, Such a glory appeared at our
Saviours Birth, Baptism, and Transfiguration;
and will do at his expected appearance, which
leaves it no unimaginable thing to us; and
shewes how facile it is to God to (do that
which will then be, in some sort necessary)
creat a glory meet for the entertainment, and
gratification of any such faculty, as he shall
then continue in being. But,</p>

Glory,</hi> in the proper Notion of it, being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but resplendent excellency, the

conspicuous. Yet as there is an excellency
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48660:33"/>

whereof it is the splendor and brightness;
so we must conceive a peculiar excellency of

               <hi>As to the nature of this glory,</hi> 'tis nothing else

We can only guide our present concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of it, by the discovery God hath already
given us of himself, in those several excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of his Being, the great <hi>Attributes</hi> that are

The Notion therefore we can hence form
of this glory, is only such as we may have of
a large volume by a brief Synopsis or Table;
of a magnificent fabrick, by a small Module or

which the blessed God assumes to
himself; and whereby he describes to us his
own Being: and can in our thoughts <hi>attribute</hi>
them all to him, though we have still but low
defective conceptions of each one. As if we
could at a distance, distinguish the Streets and
Houses of a great City; but every one appears
to us much lesse than it is; we can apprehend

diminish and limit the holy one: Yet so far as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48660:35"/>
our apprehensions can correspond to the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
he affords us of his several excellencies,
we have a present view of the Divine glory. Do
but strictly and distinctly survey the many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
comprehended in his name, then ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
them up and consider how glorious he is!
Conceive <hi>one glory</hi> resulting from substantial

conspicuous glory. Whose trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
beams are productive of the <hi>glory im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest;</hi>
the next ingredient into this blessedness,
which will presently come to be spoken of, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we have given you some short account of</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Act of beholding:</hi> the <hi>vision</hi> or <hi>intuition</hi>
it self, by which, intervening, the impression
is made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Glory</hi> seems to carry in it a peculiar respect
to the <hi>visive power</hi> (whether corporal, or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;
as it is it self of the one kind or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
'tis something to be <hi>contemplated,</hi> to be
lookt upon. And being to transmit an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:48660:36"/>
and consequent <hi>pleasure</hi> to another sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
it must necessarily be so, it can neither
<hi>transform,</hi> nor <hi>satisfie</hi> but as it is beheld.</p>
            <p>And here the <hi>sensitive intuition,</hi> I shall not
insist on, as being less intended in the Text,
and the discourse of it lesse suitable to such, as
with a spiritual mind and design, set themselves
to enquire into the nature of the Saints blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Yet, as <hi>this</hi> is the most noble, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive,
quick, and sprightly <hi>sense,</hi> so is the
<hi>Act</hi> of it more considerable, in the matter of
blessedness, than any other of the outward man,
and the most perfect imitation of the act of the
mind, whence also <hi>this</hi> so often borrows the
name of the <hi>other,</hi> and is called <hi>seeing.</hi> 'Tis an
act indeed very proper and pertinent to a state
of glory. By how much more any sensible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is glorious (supposing the <hi>sensorium</hi> to be
duely disposed and fortified, as must be here
supposed) so much is it the fitter object of
<hi>Sight;</hi> hence when we would express a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
object, we call it <hi>conspicuous,</hi> and the lesse
glorious, or more obscure any thing is, the
less visible, and approaches the nearer to invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility,
whence that saying in the common

               <hi>To see blackness is to see nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatsoever a glorified eye, replenished
with a heavenly vitality and vigor, can fetch
in from the many glorified objects that encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
it, we must suppose to concurr to this
blessedness. Now is the <hi>eye satisfied with seeing,</hi>
which before never could.</p>
            <p>But, 'tis intellectual sight we are chiefly to
consider here, that whereby we see him that is
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48660:36"/>
invisible, and approach the <hi>inaccessible Light.</hi>
The word here used,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> some Criticks tell us,
more usually signifies the sight of the mind.
And <hi>then,</hi> not a casual, superficial glancing at
a thing, but <hi>contemplation,</hi> a studious, designed
viewing of a thing, when we solemnly compose
and aplly our selves thereto, or the vision of
Prophets or such as have things discovered to
them by divine Revelation (thence called
<hi>Chozim,</hi> Seers) which imports (though not a
previous design, yet) no lesse intention of mind
in the act it self.</p>
            <p>And so it more fitly expresses that knowledge
which we have, not by discourse and reasoning
out of one thing from another, but by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
intuition of what is nakedly, and at once
offered to our view, which is the more proper
knowledge of the blessed in heaven. They
shall have the glory of God so presented, and
their minds so enlarged, as to comprehend
much at one view, in which respect they may
be said, in a great degree, <hi>to know as they are
known,</hi> in as much as the blessed God compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
all things at once, in one simple act of
knowing. Yet that is not to be understood as
if the state of glory should exclude all <hi>ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
more than our present state doth all <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition</hi>
(for first and indemonstrable principles
we see by their own light, without illation or
argument) nor can it be inconvenient to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
that while the knowledge the blessed have
of God is not insinite, there may be use of
their discursive faculty with great fruit and
pleasure. Pure intuition of God, without any
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48660:37"/>
mixture of reasoning, is acknowledged (by
such as are apt enough to be over-ascribing to
the creature) peculiar to God alone.<note place="margin">Cognoscere deum clarè &amp; intuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vè est proprium &amp; naturale so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li deo sicut est proprium ig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AND now, upon this Vision of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
face of God, next follows, in the
order of discourse, The souls perfect
assimilation unto that revealed glory,
or its participation thereof, (touching the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the things themselves have to one another,
there will be consideration had in its proper
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48660:37"/>
place) and this also must be considered as a
distinct and necessary ingredient into the state
of blessedness we are treating of.</p>
            <p>Distinct it is, for though the vision now spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, doth include a certain kind of assimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
in it, as all vision doth, being only a
reception of the species or likeness of the
Object seen: This assimilation we are to speak
of, is of a very different kind. <hi>That</hi> is such
as affects only the visive or cognitive power,
and that not with a <hi>real</hi> change, but <hi>intention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
onely, nor for longer continuance than the
act of seeing lasts; but <hi>this</hi> is <hi>total, real,</hi> and
<hi>permanent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And surely it is of equal necessity to the
souls blessedness, to <hi>partake</hi> the glory of God,
as to <hi>behold</hi> it; as well to have the divine-like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>imprest</hi> upon it as <hi>represented</hi> to it. After
so contagious and over-spreading a depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as sin hath diffus'd through all its powers:
it can never be happy without a change of its
very <hi>crasis</hi> and temper throughout. A diseased
ulcerous body would take little felicity in gay
and glorious sights: no more would all the
glory of heaven signifie to a sick, deformed,
self-loathing soul.</p>
            <p>It must therefore be all glorious within,
have the Divine nature more perfectly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
the likeness of God transfus'd and
wrought into it. This is the blessed work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
in Regeneration; but how far it is from
being perfected, we may soon find by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
how far short we are of being satisfied
in our present state, even in the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48660:38"/>
of the highest and most excellent Objects.
How tasteless to our souls are the thoughts of
God! How little pleasure do we take in view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over his glorious Attributes! the most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
and adorable excellencies of his
Being! And whereto can we impute it but to
this, that our spirits are not yet sufficiently
connaturallized to them? Their likeness is
not enough deeply instamped on our souls:
nor will this be, <hi>till we awake;</hi> when we see
better, we shall become better: <hi>When he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
we shall be like him, for we shall see him as
he is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But do we indeed pretend to such an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation?
Can we think what God is, and what
we are in our present state, and not confesse
these words to carry with them an amazing
sound, <hi>we shall be like him!</hi> How great an hope
is this! How strange an errand hath the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
into the world! How admired a design!
to transform men and make them like God!
Were the dust of the earth turned into stars in
the firmament, were the most stupendous po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etical
transformations assured <hi>realities,</hi> what
could equal the greatness and the wonder of
this mighty change? Yea, and doth not the
expectation of it seem as presumptious, as the
issue it self would be strange? Is it not an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
bold desire? too daring a thought? a
thing <hi>unlawful</hi> to be <hi>affected,</hi> as it seems <hi>impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
to be <hi>attained?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It must be acknowledged there is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of high arrogance in aspiring to this,
<hi>to be like God.</hi> And the very wish or thought of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48660:38"/>
being so, <hi>in all respects,</hi> were not to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
without horror: 'Tis a matter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that requires some disquisition and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
wherein that impressed likeness of God
consists, which must concur to the Saints bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness.
In order here unto then take the
following Propositions.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>There is a sense wherein to be like God is

there are some things so peculiarly appropriate to
God, as that, in respect of them, there can be

                  </gap>ffront</hi> him. And here is
the great controversie between the glorious
God, and the degenerous Children of Men.
Every man would catch at a God-head, and
either assume it to himself, or cast it, many
times upon other creatures, viler and more
ignoble than himself. Snatch the reins of
Government out of Gods hand; and exalt
their own wills into an absoluteness as liable to
controul from none; place and settle their
dependence on their own wit, power, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
industry; or, if that be a more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
course (for they often find an entire God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
too much for one creature, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
constrained to parcell it out among
many) place their confidences, and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in something else without them: do, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
that ridiculous thing, so worthy to be
hooted at, make the congested dirt of the earth
their trust (the righteous shall laugh at him,
and say,<note place="margin">Psal. 52. 6, 7.</note> Lo! this is the man that trusted in
riches) their wealth, their strong Tower;
which onely the name of the Lord is to his
Righteous ones. Yet, all the while, self is
the center, and end in which all must meet,
and terminate. This at last carries away the
assumed fictious Deity. And this thing, that
is thus now made <hi>like God,</hi> is an <hi>Idol</hi> (which
indeed signifies so much) and this imitation
of him wicked Idolatry, than which nothing
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48660:42"/>
more debases a reasonable soul, or devests
man of himself,<note place="margin">Isa. 46. 8.</note> that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ill they redress this they

            <p>This <hi>assimilation</hi> of our selves to God is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
remote then from being a perfection; it
is a most reproachfull deformity, as we know
imitations, if they be visibly affected, and strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
too far, are alwayes thought ridiculous by
Wise men.</p>
            <p>9. Though, in respect of these incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
things, there cannot be a proper, formal,
immediate similitude to God: Yet, there ought to
be a correspondency which must be measured, and
estimated by the consideration of his state, and ours;
whence it will appear, that what so properly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to him, and what ought to correspond thereto
in us, do agree to each; upon one and the same
intervening reason.</p>
            <p>For instance, is he <hi>absolutely Supream,</hi> in as
much as he is the first Being? the correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
impression with us, and upon the same
reason, must be a most profound, humble
self-subjection, disposing our souls to constant
obedience to him. Again, is he <hi>simply inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent,</hi>
as being self-sufficient and <hi>all in all?</hi>
the impression with us must be <hi>a nothingness;</hi>
and self-emptiness, ingaging us to quit our
selves, and live in him.</p>
            <p>This is the only conformity to God, which,
<hi>with respect to his incommunicable excellencies,</hi>
our creature state can admit; It may be also
stil'd <hi>a likeness to him,</hi> being a real conformity
to his Will concerning us: and his very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as it respects us. We may conceive of it,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48660:43"/>
as of the likeness between a Seal, and the stamp
made by it; Especially, supposing the inequality
of parts in the Seal, to be by the <hi>protuberancy</hi>
of what must form the signature. In that case
there would be a likeness, <hi>aliquatenus,</hi> that is,
an exact correspondency, but what would
then be <hi>convexe</hi> or bulching out in the Seal,
would be, as we know, <hi>concave,</hi> or <hi>hallow</hi> in
the impression. Such is the proportion between
<hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Subjection,</hi> between self-fulness
and self-emptiness. Whereas <hi>a similitude to
God, in respect of his communicable perfections,</hi> is
as that between the <hi>face</hi> and its <hi>picture;</hi> where
no such difference is wont to appear.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> 10. <hi>Assimilation, or conformity to God in
both these respects composes that excellent frame of
moral perfection, which the divine glory, beheld,
impresses upon the soul; and which immediately
conduces to its satisfaction and blessedness.</hi> I say,
<hi>moral perfection,</hi> because that only is capable of
being imprest by the intervening ministry of
our own understanding: <hi>viz.</hi> by its Vision,
intimated, as was formerly observed, in that
of the Apostle, <hi>We shall be like—for we shall see
him, &amp;c.</hi> Its <hi>natural perfections</hi> are antecedent,

for, as we cannot form an intire <hi>Idea</hi> of God,
without taking in, together, his perfections
of both sorts, <hi>communicable,</hi> and <hi>incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>

circumstance) is yet the very substance and
true notion of the thing it self (to the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
whereof I now passe) under the word
held forth to us.</p>
            <p>For this <hi>satisfaction</hi> is the <hi>souls rest in God.
Its perfect enjoyment</hi> of the <hi>most perfect good.</hi> The
expletion of the whole capacity of its will; the
total filling up of that vast enlarged appetite;
the perfecting of all its <hi>desires</hi> in <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>joy.</hi>
Now delight or joy (for they differ not, save that
the latter word is thought something more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
to reasonable nature) is more fitly
defined <hi>the rest of the desiring faculty in the thing
desired</hi>

acts of <hi>Love,</hi> diversified, only, by the distance,
or presence of the same Object; which, when
'tis distant, the soul, acted and prompted by
love, desires, moves towards it, pursues it;
when present, and attained, delights in it, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes
it, staies upon it, satisfies it self in it (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the measure of goodness it finds
there) <hi>Desire,</hi> is therefore, <hi>love in motion;
Delight,</hi> is <hi>love in rest:</hi> and of this latter <hi>delight</hi>
or <hi>joy,</hi> Scripture evidently gives us this Notion,
<hi>He will rejoyce over thee with joy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zeph. 3. 17.</note> (unto which is
presently added as exegetical) <hi>he will rest in his
love:</hi> Which, <hi>resting</hi> can be but the same
thing with <hi>being satisfied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This satisfaction then is nothing else but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and rest of the soul amidst infinite delights.</hi>
Its peaceful acquiescence, having attained the
ultimate tearm of all its motions, beyond
which it cares to go no further; the solace it
finds in an adequate full good; which it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48660:44"/>
enough for it, and beyond which, it
desires no more; reckons its state as good as it
can be, and is void of all hovering thoughts
(which perfect rest must needs exclude) or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to change.</p>
            <p>And so doth this <hi>being satisfied,</hi> not only ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
signifie the soul to be at <hi>rest;</hi> but it
specifies that <hi>rest;</hi> and gives us a distinct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the nature of it. As that it is not a
<hi>forced violent rest;</hi> such as proceeds from a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled
ignorance, a drowsie sloth, a languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
weakness, or a desire and hope of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
by often frustrations bafled into <hi>despair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
(to all which, the native import and propriety
of that word <hi>[satisfaction]</hi> doth strongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne.)</p>
            <p>But it discovers it to be a <hi>natural rest.</hi> I
mean, <hi>from an internal principle;</hi> the soul is
not held in its present state of enjoyment by a
strong and violent hand; but rests in it by a
connaturalness thereunto, is attempered to it,
by its own inward constitution and frame. It
rests not as a descending stone, intercepted
by something by the way, that holds and stops
it, else it would fall further; but as a thing
would rest in its own centre, with such a rest as
the earth is supposed to have in its proper
place; that, being hung upon nothing, is yet
unmoved (<hi>ponderibus librata suis</hi>) equally bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced
by its own weights every way.</p>
            <p>It is a <hi>rational judicious rest,</hi> upon certain
knowledge that its present state is simply <hi>best,</hi>
and not capable of being changed for a <hi>better:</hi>
The soul cannot be held under a perpetual
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48660:45"/>
cheat, so as alwayes to be satisfied with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
It may be so befool'd for a while, but
if it remain satisfied, in a state that never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of change; that state must be such as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
it self to the most throughly informed
reason and judgement.</p>
            <p>It is hence a <hi>free voluntary chosen rest:</hi> Such

            <p>It is a <hi>complacential rest,</hi> wherein the soul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides

            <p>THUS far have we view'd the parts or
necessary concurrents of which the
blessedness of the Saints must be
composed <hi>absolutely,</hi> and <hi>severally</hi>
each from other. We proceed</p>
            <p>Secondly, to consider them <hi>relatively,</hi> viz.
in the <hi>mutual respects,</hi> they bear one to another;
as they actually compose this blessed state,
wherein we shall shew particularly,</p>
            <p>1. The relation (by way of in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            </p>
            <p>2. Between both these and the <hi>satisfaction</hi>
that insues: Which latter I intend more to

dwell upon; and only to touch the former, as
a more speculative and lesse improvable subject
of Discourse, in my way to this.)</p>
            <p>1. First, It may be considered, what rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
there may be <hi>between vision of God,</hi>
and assimilation, or <hi>being made like to him;</hi> and
it must be acknowledged (according to what
is commonly observed of the <hi>mutual action</hi> of
the <hi>understanding</hi> and <hi>will</hi>) that the <hi>sight of God,</hi>
and <hi>likeness to him,</hi> do <hi>mutually</hi> contribute,
each towards other. The sight of God assimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
makes the soul like unto him; that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
more disposes it for a continued renewed

For righteousness (which we have shewn qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies

            </p>
            <p>From whence also, and from the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing, we may fitly state the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the first of these to the second, to
be that of a cause to its effect. <hi>Sight</hi> begets
<hi>likeness,</hi> is <hi>antecedent</hi> to it, and <hi>productive</hi> of
it.</p>
            <p>That is <hi>the face or glory of God seen;</hi> that
<hi>glory,</hi> in conjunction with our <hi>vision of it:</hi> for
the vision operates not; but according to the
efficaciousness of the thing seen, nor can that
glory have any such operation, but by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention
of vision.</p>
            <p>Tis therefore the <hi>glory of God seen,</hi> as seen,
that assimilates, and impresses its likeness up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the beholding Soul: and so its causality it is
that of an <hi>objective cause</hi> (which whether it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the efficient or final, I shall
not here dispute) that <hi>operates</hi> onely as it is
<hi>apprehended:</hi> so introducing its own form, and
similitude into the subject it works upon.
Such a kind of cause were <hi>Jacobs</hi> streaked rods
of the productions that ensued; and such a
cause is any thing whatever that begets an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon an apprehensive subject by the
mediation and ministry, whether of the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
or understanding. This kind of causality
the word hath in its renewing transforming
work; and the Sacraments wherein they are
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
               </hi> of <hi>real physical</hi> mutations on the Subjects
of them. So much of the Image of God as
is here imprest upon souls by Gospel dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48660:47"/>
so much is imprest of his glory. The
work of grace is glory begun.</p>
            <p>And now as glory <hi>initial,</hi> and <hi>progressive</hi> in
this life enters at the eye— (beholding as in
a glasse the glory of the Lord,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> we are changed)
so doth perfect, and consumate glory in the
other life. For we have no reason to imagine
to our selves any alteration in the natural or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the powers of the soul have towards
each other, by its passing into a state of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Object</hi> seen is unspeakably <hi>efficacious;</hi> the

            <p>And here pretermitting those which are

            </p>
            <p>How pleasant will the contemplation be of the

in that glasse, that <hi>speculum aeternitatis,</hi> we shall
have the lively view of all that truth, the

and grateful to our natures; and <hi>in his light,

that <hi>increased knowledge increases sorrow!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the other notion of it;</hi> how can it be
lesse grateful to behold the wisdom that made,
and govern'd the world? that compast so great
designs; and this, no longer in its effects, but
in it self? Those <hi>works</hi> were honourable and
glorious, sought of all them that have pleasure
in them. What will be the glory of their
<hi>cause?</hi> It would gratifie some mens curiosity
to behold the unusual motion of some rare
<hi>automaton;</hi> but an ingenious person would,
with much more pleasure, prie into the secret
Springs of that motion; and observe its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
frame, and parts, and their dependence,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48660:51"/>
and order each to other. 'Tis comely to behold
the exterior oeconomy of a well govern'd
people; when great affairs are, by orderly
conduct, brought to happy issues; but to have
been at the helm, to have seen the pertinent,
proper application of such and such maximes to
the incident cases; to have known all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of state, heard debates, observ'd, with
what great sagacity, inconveniencies have been
foreseen, and with what diligence prevented;
would much more gratifie an inquiring Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</p>
            <p>When the Records of Eternity shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

it transport! when it shall be discern'd, lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thus were the designes laid, here were the apt
junctures and admirable dependencies of
things, which, when acted upon the stage of

full of mysterious intricacy?</p>
            <p>If Saint <hi>Paul</hi> were so ravisht at those more
obscure appearances of divine wisdom, which
we find him admiring, <hi>Rom. 11. 33. O the

               <hi>The exceeding greatness of power
that wrought in them that believed,</hi> &amp;c. what
made hearts love God, imbrace a Saviour,
what it was that overcame <hi>their own,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 110. 3.</note> and made

            <p>How delightful a contemplation to think,

with so inlarged an understanding of the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible

            <p>And yet how pleasant to think not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the extents, but of the restraints of this
power, and how, when none could limit, it
became <hi>ordinate,</hi> and did limit it self; that,
since it could do so much, it did no more;
turned not sooner a degenerous world into

            <p>3. And what do we think of the ravishing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
aspects of his Love! when it shall now be <hi>open
fac'd,</hi> and have laid aside its vail; when his
amiable smiles shall be chekered with no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled

(as <hi>Moses</hi> was when the <hi>sight</hi> of his <hi>face</hi> could

will this appearance of God be (we now
hear something of the <hi>glory of his grace</hi>) and
how satisfying the intuition of that glory!<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 6.</note>
Now is the proper season for the full exercise
and discovery of Love. This day hath been
long expected and lo now 'tis dawned upon the
awaking soul: It's now called forth; its sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
unbound, all its powers inspirited, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
for love visions and enjoyments, 'tis now
to take its fill of loves. The Apostles extatical
prayer is now answered to the highest degree
possible with respect to such a one.<note place="margin">Eph. 3. 16. 17. 18. 17.</note> He is now
<hi>according to the riches of divine glory, strengthened
with might by the Spirit in the inner man—to
comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth,
and length, and depth, and height; to know the love
that passeth knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. He shall now no
longer stand amazed spending his ghesses <hi>What
manner of love this should be</hi> and expecting ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
discoveries, further effects of it, <hi>that did
not yet appear;</hi> but sees the utmost, all that his
soul can bear or wish to see. He hath now
traced home the rivulets to their fountain, the
beams to the very Sun of Love. He hath got
the prospect, at last, into that heart, where
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48660:53"/>
where the great thoughts of love were lodg'd
from everlasting? where all its counsels and
designs were formed. He sees what made
God become a man? what cloathed a Deity
with humane flesh? what made Eternity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the birth of time (when come to its
parturient <hi>fulness</hi>) what mov'd the heart of
the Son of God to pitch his Tabernacle among
men?<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4.</note> what ingaged him to the enterprize of
redeeming sinners? what mov'd him so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
to contest with a perishing world?
led him at last to the Cross, made him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to become a sacrifice to God, a spectacle
to Angels and men in a bitter reproachful
death, inflicted by the Sacrilegious hands of
those whom he was all this while designing to
save. The amazed soul now sees into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of this design; understands why it self
was not made a prey to Divine revenge;
whence it was that it perish't not in its enmity
against God; that he was not provoked, by
the obstinacy of its disobedience, and malice
of its unbelief, beyond the possibility of an
atonement; why he so long suffered its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
neglects of him, and unkind repulses
of a merciful Saviour; and perswaded till at
last he overcame, made the averse heart yield,
the careless disaffected soul cry out, Where is
my God? now a Christ or I perish? All this is
now resolved into <hi>love;</hi> And the adoring soul
sees how well the effects agree to their cause,
and are owned by it. Nothing but heaven it
self that gives the <hi>sense,</hi> can give the <hi>notion</hi> of

4. <hi>Nor will the glory of holiness,</hi> be less re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splendent,
that great Attribute which even in
a remote descent from its original, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
mentioned with the adjunct of <hi>beauties.</hi>
What loveliness will those <hi>beauties</hi> add to this
<hi>blessed face!</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 110. 3. &amp;c.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Not here to insist (which is besides my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
upon the various notions of holiness.
<hi>Real holiness</hi> Scripture states in <hi>purity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 1.</note> an alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
from sin, 'tis set in opposition to all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness
to all moral impurity, and in that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it best agrees to God, and comprehends
his <hi>righteousness,</hi> and <hi>veracity,</hi> and indeed,
whatever we can conceive in him under the
notion of a moral excellency.</p>
            <p>This may therefore be styl'd a transcenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
attribute, that as it were runs through the
rest, and casts a glory upon every one. 'Tis an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
of attributes; Those are fit predications,
<hi>holy power, holy truth, holy love,</hi> &amp;c. And so it is
the very lustre, and glory of his other perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.<note place="margin">Exod. 15. 11.</note>
               <hi>He is glorious in holiness.</hi> Hence in
matters of greatest moment, he is sometimes
brought in <hi>Swearing by his holiness</hi> (which he
is not wont to do by any one single attribute)
as though it were a fuller expression of himself,<note place="margin">Psal. 89. 35. Amos 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.</note>
(an <hi>adaequalior conceptus) than</hi> any of the
rest.</p>
            <p>What is of so great account with him, will
not be of least account with his holy ones,
when they appear in his glorious presence.
Their own holiness is a conformity to his, the
likeness of it. And as their beholding it
forms them into that likeness: so that likeness
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48660:54"/>
makes them capable of beholding it with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
Divine holiness doth now more <hi>ravish</hi>
than <hi>affright.</hi> This <hi>hath</hi> been the language of
sinful dust,<note place="margin">1 Sam 6.</note> 
               <hi>Who can stand before this holy God?</hi>
when holiness hath appeared arm'd with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
guarded with flames, and the Divine
Majesty been represented as a consuming fire.
Such apprehensions sin and guilt naturally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get.
<hi>The sinners of Sion were afraid.</hi> But so
far as the new man is put on, created after
God, and they who were darkness, are made
light in the Lord, he is not under any notion
more acceptable to them, than as he is the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one.</hi> They love his <hi>Law,</hi> because <hi>holy;</hi> and
love <hi>each other,</hi> because <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>hate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
because they are no more so. Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
hath still a pleasing aspect when they find
it in an Ordinance, meet it in a Sabbath, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
glimpse of it is lovely. But with what tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
hath the holiness of God himself been
celebrated even by Saints on earth?<note place="margin">Exod. 15 11.</note>

            <p>To the altogether unlearned it will hardly

When God hath been pleased to afford disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
in that way of Vision to men in the body
(his Prophets, &amp;c.) he hath usually bound up
all their senses by sleep, or trances; sense
hath had no part or lot in this matter, unto
believing it must necessarily concurr.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>More affective.</hi> What we see, even with
our external eye, much more powerfully
moves our heart, than what we onely give
credit to upon hearsay. The Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi>
much admired no doubt <hi>Solomons</hi> famed splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
and magnificence, while she only heard
of it, but when she saw it, it puts her into an
extasie, it ravish'd away her soul, <hi>she had no
more spirit, &amp;c.</hi> What would the sight of the
Divine glory do, if God did not strengthen
<hi>with all might;</hi> were there not as well <hi>glorious
power</hi> to <hi>support,</hi> as <hi>powerful glory</hi> to <hi>transform!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> had <hi>heard of God, by the hearing of the
ear,</hi> but when <hi>once his eye saw him</hi> (whether
that were by the appearance of any sensible
glory, which is probable enough, for 'tis said,
<hi>the Lord answered him out of the whirlewind,</hi> or
whether by a more immediate revelation, 'tis
less-material (what work did it make in his
soul?</p>
            <p>The Devils <hi>believe,</hi> and tremble; so impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
are the pre-apprehensions of Judgment to
come, and the consequents thereof with them;
yet their present torment, thence, is no tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in comparison (<hi>art thou come to torment
us before the time?</hi>) of what they expect. Let
wicked men consider this (they will have
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48660:61"/>
their intuitions in hell too) were your belief,
and terror thereupon, with reference to the
eternal Judgment, and the impendent wrath
of God, equal to what the Devils themselves
have, upon the same account; actual sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will make you more exceed your selves in
point of misery, than the Devils do now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
you. There is, no doubt, a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
difference between the impressions of
present faith, and future vision, with holy
souls. Now, <hi>not seeing, yet believing, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
with joy unspeakable:</hi> their present joy
cannot be <hi>spoken;</hi> their future then cannot be
<hi>thought!</hi> Experience daily tells us, how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
sensible, present objects have the advantage
upon us, beyond those that are spiritual and
distant, though infinitely more excellent and
important. When the tables are turned, the
<hi>now</hi> sensible things disappear, a new scene of
things invisible and eternal, is immediately
presented to our view; the excellency of the
objects, the disposedness of the subjects, the
nature of the act, shall all multiply the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
on this part, How affective will this
vision be; beyond what we have ever found
the faint apprehensions of our so much disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged
faith to amount to? A kind message
from an indulgent Father to his far-distant
Son, informing of his welfare, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
love will much affect, but the sight of
his Fathers face will even transport and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
him with joy.</p>
            <p>But further consider this intuition a little
more particularly and absolutely in it self.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48660:62"/>
So you may take this somewhat distincter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it in some few particulars, correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to those by which the object (the glory
to be beheld) was lately characterized.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>It will be a vigorous efficacious intuition;</hi>
as that which it beholds is <hi>the most excellent,
even the divine glory;</hi> such an object cannot be
beheld but with an eye full of lively vigour; a
sparkling, a radient eye; A weak eye would
be struck blind, would fail, and be closed up
at the first glance. We must suppose, then,
this Vision to be accompanied with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
vitality, the strongest energy: A mighty
plenitude of Spirit, and Power, no lesse than
the divine; nothing but the <hi>divine power</hi> can
sufficiently fortifie the soul to behold <hi>divine
glory.</hi> When the Apostle speaks only of his
desire of glory, <hi>he that hath wrought us to this
self same thing</hi> (saith he) <hi>is God;</hi> he that hath
moulded us, suitably framed us for this thing
(as the word signifieth) is God; 'tis the work
of a Deity to make a Soul desire Glory; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
then 'tis his work to give the power of
beholding it, and by how much the more of
<hi>power,</hi> so much the more of <hi>pleasure,</hi> in this
Vision. <hi>Weak sight</hi> would afford but <hi>languid
joy.</hi> But when the whole soul animated with
divine power and life shall seat it self in the
eye: when it shall be as it were <hi>all eye,</hi> (as one
said of God, whom now it perfectly imitates)
and be wholly intent upon Vision; apply it
self thereto with all its might as its only busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,<note place="margin">S. Hye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what satisfying joyes doth it now taste!

it now as it were prey upon glory, as the eye
of the Eagle upon the beams of the Sun! we
meet with the expression of <hi>aures bibulae,</hi> here
will be <hi>oculi bibuli,</hi> thirsty eyes. A soul ready
to drink in glory at the eye. If vision be by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission,

in glory, feeding upon glory: If by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramission,

forth the soul at every look to embrace the

            <p>There is a great power that now attends
<hi>reallizing thoughts</hi> of God; whether it appear
in the consequent working of the soul directly
towards God, or by way of reflection upon it
self. If directly towards God, how mightily

observable, how in our present state, we are
prejudiced by our partial conceptions of him,
and what an <hi>inequality</hi> they cause in the temper
of our Spirits.</p>
            <p>For wicked men, <hi>the very notion they have of
God,</hi> proves fatal to their souls; or is of a most
destructive tendency, because they compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
not <hi>together</hi> what God hath revealed of

few thoughts of God they have only to his
mercy, and that exclusively, as to his holiness,
and justice; hence their vain and mad pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.
The notion of an <hi>unholy</hi> (or a not-holy,
and not-just) God what wickedness would
it not induce? <hi>Thou thought'st I was altogether
such a one as thy self:</hi> A God after their own
hearts: then the reigns are let loose. More
rarely, when the conscience of guilt hath ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested
the self-condemned wretch; God is
thought of under no other notion, than of an
irreconcileable enemy, and avenger; as one
thirsting after the blood of Souls, and that will
admit of no atonement; so without all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and so slatly contrary to all his discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of himself, do men dare to affix to him
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48660:63"/>
black and horrid characters, forged only out,
the radicated and inveterate hatred of their
own hearts against him. (That never takes up
good thoughts of any one) only because they
have no mind to acquaint themselves with him;
and that they may have some colour for their
affected distance; and so, perhaps, never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
but perish under an horrid, wilful des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair.</p>
            <p>And even the people of God themselves are
too apt, sometimes, so wholly to fix their eye
upon <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>grace;</hi> that they grow into an
unbecoming, uncreaturely familiarity, while
the thoughts of Infinite Majesty, adorable
greatness, and glory are asleep sometimes,
possibly, apprehend vindicative justice, the
indignation and jealousie of God against sin,
(precluding, meanwhile, the consideration of
his indulgent compassions towards truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and penitent souls) to that degree of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightment,
and dread, that they grow into
an unchildlike strangness towards him; and
take little pleasure in drawing nigh to
him.</p>

<hi>even,</hi> and <hi>Symmetral;</hi> Its notions <hi>uniform,</hi>

Nothing seasonable omitted, for want of a

as to <hi>exclude</hi> all degrees of its contrary; and
<hi>include</hi> all degrees of it self. There will now
be no longer any colluctation with contrary
principles; no law in the members warring
against the law of the mind, No lustings of
the flesh against the Spirit. That war is now
ended in a glorious victory, and eternal peace.
There will be no remaining blindness of mind,
nor errour of iudgement, nor perverseness of
will, nor irregularity or rebellion of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
No ignorance of God, no aversation
from him, or disaffection towards him. This
likeness removes all culpable <hi>dissimilitude</hi> or
<hi>unlikeness.</hi> This communicated glory fills up
the whole soul, causes all clouds and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

            <p>And it is it self <hi>full.</hi> The Soul is replenish't

in as much as the Text speaks of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

cumulated glory, glory added to glory. Here
'tis growing progressive glory; we are changed
into the same image from glory to glory. It

hand to this glorious Image, added to it its
ultimate accomplishments. Now, a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to Christ, even in the resurrection from
the dead, in his glorious state is fully attained.
That prize of the high calling of God is now
won. And the humble sense of not having
<hi>attained as yet,</hi> and of not being <hi>already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
in which humility, the foundations of the
temple of God in a Saint is laid, and the
building raised, is turned into joyful accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
<hi>Grace, Grace</hi> for the laying on of the
top stone, the finishing of this glorious
work.</p>
            <p>And when this Temple is filled with the
glory of the Lord, the soul it self replenished
with the divine fulness, will not its joy be
full too? For here is no sacrifice to be offered,
but that of praise, and joy is the proper sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
for that sacrifice.</p>
            <p>Now the new creature hath arrived to <hi>the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48660:72"/>
measure of the stature</hi> of a perfect man in
Christ Jesus. The first formation of this
Spiritual (as well as of the natural) man was
hidden and secret, it was curiously wrought,
and in a way no more liable to observation,
than that of framing the Child in the Womb;
as that is as hidden as the concoction of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
or precious stones in the lower parts of
the earth; (no secrets of Nature can outvie the
the Mysteries of godliness) Its <hi>growth</hi> is also by
very insensible degrees; as it is with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
of nature; but its arrival to perfection
is infinitely more strange, than any thing in
nature ever was, how sudden and wonderful
is the change; when in the twinkling of an
eye, the blessed soul instantly awakes out of
drowsie languishings, and miserable weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
into perfect strength, and vigour!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As a man is,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 19.</note> 
               <hi>so is his strength;</hi> and as his
strength is, so is his joy, and pleasure. The
Sun is said to go forth <hi>as a strong man, rejoicing
to run his race.</hi> When a man goes in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his strength upon any enterprize,
how do blood and spirits triumph beforehand,
no motion of hand, or foot is without a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
delight. The strength of a mans Spirit is
unspeakably more than that of the outward
man: Its faculties and powers more refined
and raised; and hence are rational or intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
exercises and operations, much more
delightful than corporal ones can be.</p>
            <p>But (still as the man is, so is his strength)
'tis an incomparably greater strength that
attends the <hi>heaven-born man.</hi> This man <hi>born
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48660:73"/>
of God,</hi> begotten of God after his own like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
This <hi>Hero,</hi> this Son of God, was
born to Conflicts, to Victories, to Triumphs.
While he is yet but in his growing age, <hi>he
overcomes the world:</hi> (as <hi>Hercules</hi> the Serpents
in his Cradle) overcomes the wicked one,
and is at last more than Conquerour. A migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
power attends godliness, <hi>a Spirit of power,
and of a sound mind:</hi> but how much this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
creature grows, so much the more like
God, and being perfect, Conflicts cease:
(he had overcome, and won the Crown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.)
And now all his strength runs out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
acts of pleasure. Now, when he shall go
forth in his might to love God (as we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to love him now with all our might)
and every act of <hi>praise</hi> shall be an act of <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi>
done with a fulness of strength (as 'tis
said their praises at the bringing home of the
Ark, were with all their might) O! what
will the pleasure be that shall accompany this
state of perfection. Perfect power, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

their imperfect state; our feeble, spiritless
duties, weak, dead prayers, they have no more
sweetness than strength; no more pleasure,
than power in them. Therefore we are listless,
and have no mind to duties, as we find we are

            <p>As it imports (which it doth most evidently)
a self-annihilation. A pure nullifying of self.
'Tis a continual recognition of my own no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingness.
A momently, iterated confession,
that my whole being is nothing but a meer
puff of precarious breath, a bubble rais'd
from nothing by the arbitrary fict of the great
Creator, reducible, had he so pleased, any
moment to nothing again. These are true and
just acknowledgments; and to a well-tempered
soul infinitely pleasant, when the state of the ca
is throughly understood (as now it is) and it
hath the apprehension clear, how the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is sustained, how, and upon what terms
its own being, life, and blessedness are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to it; that it is, by its self, nothing, and
that it is every moment determinable upon the
constancy of the Creators Will, that it is not
<hi>simply nothing.</hi> 'Tis not possible that any thing
should hinder this consideration from being
eternally delightful; but that diabolical un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaturely
<hi>Pride,</hi> that is long since banisht
Heaven, and banisht its very subjects thence
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48660:75"/>
also. Nothing can sute that temper but <hi>to be a
God;</hi> to be wholly independent; to be its own
sufficiency. The thoughts of living at the will
and pleasure of another, are grating; but
they are only grating to a proud heart, which
here hath no place. A soul naturallized to
humiliations, accustomed to prostrations, and
self-abasements, trained up in acts of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and that was brought to glory, through
a continued course, and series of self-denyall:
That ever since it first came to know it self was
wont to depend for every moments breath, for
every glimpse of light, for every fresh influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
(<hi>I live yet not I</hi>—) with what pleasure
doth it now as it were vanish before the Lord!<note place="margin">Gal 2. 20.</note>
what delight doth it take to diminish it self;
and as it were <hi>disappear</hi> to contract and shrivel

that it may be <hi>all in all.</hi> Things are now <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant</hi>
(to the soul, <hi>in its right-mind</hi>) as they are
<hi>sutable;</hi> as they carry a comliness and congrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in them. And nothing <hi>now</hi> appears more
<hi>becoming,</hi> than such a self-annihilation. The

are now better understood than ever. And
the soul by how much it is now come <hi>nearer</hi> to

And such a frame, and posture doth hence
please it best, as doth most fitly correspond
thereto. Nothing is so pleasing to it as to be
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48660:75"/>
               <hi>as it ought.</hi> That temper is most <hi>grateful</hi> that

as it is <hi>a self-nullifying thing.</hi> And yet it
is, in this respect, pleasing, but as a means to
a further end. The pleasure that attends it
<hi>is higher</hi> and more intense, according as it
more <hi>immediately</hi> attains that end, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The magnifying and exalting of God;</hi> which is
the most connatural thing to the holy soul. The
most fundamental and deeply <hi>imprest</hi> Law of
the New Creature. <hi>Self gives</hi> place that God
may take it, becomes <hi>nothing,</hi> that he may be
<hi>all.</hi> It vanishes, that his glory may shine the

            <p>Dependence gives God his <hi>power glory.</hi>
'Tis the peculiar honour and prerogative of a
<hi>Deity,</hi> to have a world of Creatures hanging
upon it, staying themselves upon it: to be the
<hi>fulcrum,</hi> the <hi>centre</hi> of a lapsing Creation. When
this dependence is <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>intelligent,</hi> it
carries in it a more explicite owning ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment

this is the distinct and actual sense of my soul:

the joy of such raptures! when the
soul shall have no other notion of it self, than
of an <hi>everlasting sacrifice,</hi> always ascending to
God in its own <hi>flames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this devotedness, and subjection speak
not barely, an <hi>act,</hi> but a <hi>state.</hi> A <hi>Being to the
praise of grace.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note> A <hi>Living to God.</hi> And tis no
mean pleasure that the sincere soul finds in the
imperfect beginnings, the first Essayes of this
life; the enitial breathings of such a Spirit,
its entrance into this blessed state; when it
makes the first tender, and <hi>present</hi> of it self to
God (as the Apostle expresses it) when it
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48660:77"/>
first begins to esteem it self an <hi>hallowed thing;</hi>
separate, and set apart for God. Its first act
of unfeigned self-resignation; when it tells
God from the very heart, <hi>I now give up my self
to thee to be thine.</hi> Never was marriage cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
made with such pleasure, with so compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cential
consent. This quitting claim to our
selves, parting with our selves upon such terms,
to be the Lords for ever: O the peace, the
rest, the acquiescence of Spirit that attends
it! When the poor soul that was weary of it
self, knew not what to do with it self, hath
now on the sudden found this way of disposing
it self to such an advantage! there is pleasure
in this Treaty. Even the previous breakings
and relentings of the soul towards God
are pleasant. But, O the pleasure of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent!<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 13.</note>
of <hi>yielding our selves to God,</hi> as the
Apostles expression is: when the Soul is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,

That <hi>yielding</hi> is subjection, self-devoting; in

And never did any man enrol himself, as a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
to the greatest Prince on earth, with
such joy. What pleasure is there in the often
iterated recognition of these transactious: in
multiplying such bonds upon a mans own soul

            <p>A Soul cast into such a mould, formed into
an obediential subject frame, what sweet peace
doth it enjoy! how pleasant rest! every thing
rests most composedly in its proper place. A
bone out of joynt knows no ease, nor lets the
body enjoy any. The creature is not in its
place but when 'tis thus <hi>subject,</hi> is in this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
to God. By flying out of this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
the world of mankind is become
one great disjoynted body; full of weary tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
unacquainted with ease, or rest. That
soul that is but in a degree reduc't to that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

so great, and happy a change doth it now feel
in it self. But when this transformation shall

to <hi>chuse</hi> (those so many profitless uneasines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses)
but only the favour to receive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and the meekness to obey them.</q> How

will of the blessed God, when our wills
shall also be perfectly attempered and conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there unto!<note place="margin">Perfectifli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum in suo genere est mensura reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quorum.</note> Therefore are we taught, Thy

            <p>3. <hi>Love.</hi> This is an eminent part of the
image or likeness of God in his Saints; As it
is that great Attribute of the divine being that
is,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 8, 16.</note> 
               <hi>alone,</hi> put to give us a notion of God. <hi>God
is love.</hi> This is an excellency (consider it
whether in its original, or copie) made up of
pleasantnesses. All love hath complacency
or pleasure in the <hi>nature,</hi> and most <hi>formal no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of it. To search for pleasure in love, is
the same thing as if a man should be solicitous
to find water in the Sea, or light in the body
of the Sun. <hi>Love to a friend</hi> is not without
high pleasure, when especially he is actually
present, and injoye'd. <hi>Love to a Saint</hi> rises
higher in nobleness, and pleasure, according
to the more excellent qualification of its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48660:80"/>
'Tis now in its highest improvement,
in both these aspects of it, where whatsoever
tends to gratifie our nature, whether as <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi>
or <hi>holy,</hi> will be in its full perfection.
Now doth the soul take up its stated dwelling
in Love, even in God who is Love; and as he
is Love; 'tis now enclosed with Love, encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas'd
with Love, 'tis conversant in the proper
region, and element of Love. The Love of
God is now perfected in it: That Love which
is not only participated from him but termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
in him,<note place="margin">1 John 4.</note> That <hi>perfect Love</hi> casts out tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
Fear. So that here is pleasure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mixture. How naturally will the blessed
soul now dissolve and melt into pleasure! It is
new fram'd on purpose for Love-imbraces, and
injoyments. It shall now love like God, as
one composed of Love. It shall no longer be
its complaint and burden that it cannot reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate
in this kind; that being beloved it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
love.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Purity.</hi> Herein also, must the blessed
soul resemble God, and delight it self. Every
one that hath this hope (viz. <hi>of being hereafter
l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ke God, and seeing him as he is</hi>) purifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as he is pure. A God-like purity is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
connext with the <hi>expectation</hi> of future
blessedness, much more with the <hi>fruition.
Blessed are the pure in heart;</hi> besides the reason
there annext [for they shall see God] (which
is to be considered under the other head, the
pleasure unto which this likeness disposes)
that proposition carries its own reason in it
self. It is an incomparable pleasure that <hi>purity</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:48660:80"/>
carries in its <hi>own nature;</hi> As sin hath in its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
nature (besides its consequent guilt and

Whatsoever defiles doth also disturb.
Nor do any but pure pleasures deserve the
name. An Epicurus himself will tell us, there
cannot be <hi>pleasure</hi> without <hi>wisdom, honesty,</hi> and
<hi>righteousness.</hi> 'Tis least of all possible there
should, when once a person shall have a right

when they see what hideous deformed mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
their own wickedness hath made them.
Here the gratifications of sense that attend it,
bribe and seduce their judgments into another
estimate of sin; but <hi>then,</hi> it shall be no longer
thought of under the more favourable notion
of a <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, they shall taste nothing but
the gall and wormwood.</p>
            <p>'Tis certainly no improbable thing, but that
reason, being now so fully rectified, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceived,
vizors torn off, and things now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in their own likeness; so much will
be seen, and apprehended of the intrinsique
evil and malignity of their viliated natures,
as will serve for the matter of further torment;
while yet such a sight can do no more to a
change of their temper than the Devils faith
doth to theirs; Such sights, being accompanied
with their no hope of ever attaining a better
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48660:81"/>
state, do therefore no way tend to mollifie, or
demulce their Spirits, but to increase their
rage and torment.</p>
            <p>It is however out of question, that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of heaven will infinitely inhance the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of it; For 'tis more certain the intrinsical
goodness of holiness (which term I need not
among these instances, in as much as the thing
admits not of one entire notion, but lies partly
under this head, partly under the second,
<hi>that of devotedness to God</hi>) will be fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood

will it not be much more pleasing to find it

such a state of the notion of liberty as may
render it really a perfection. Which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it would be a wickedness to impute to
God, and an impossibility to partake from
him.</p>
            <p>I here speak of the <hi>moral liberty</hi> of a <hi>Saint</hi> as
such, not of the <hi>natural liberty</hi> of a <hi>man,</hi> as a

of Saints on earth.</p>
            <p>And therefore the intricate controversies

            <p>The nearest approaches therefore of the
soul to God; Its most intimate union with him,
and intire subjection to him, in its glorified
state, makes its liberty consummate. Now is
its deliverance compleat, its bands are fallen
off, tis perfectly disentangled from all the
snares of death, in which it was formerly held;
'tis under no restraints, opprest by no weights,
held down by no cloggs. It hath the free ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of all its powers; hath every faculty and
affection at command. How unconceivable
a pleasure is this! With what delight doth
the poor prisoner entertain himself, when his
manacles and fetters are knockt off! when he's
enlarged from his loathsom dungeon, and the
house of his bondage, breaths in a free air!
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48660:83"/>
can dispose of himself, and walk at liberty
whither he will. The bird escaped from
his Cage; or freed from his Line, and Stone,
that resisted its ruine and too feeble strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
before, how pleasantly doth it range,
(with what joy doth it clap its wings, and
take its slight! A faint Emblem of the joy,
wherewith that pleasant chearful note shall,

feels it self <hi>free</hi> from all confinement; nothing
resists its will; as its will doth never resist the
will of God. It knows no limits, no restraints;

which nearer approach is not in respect of

            <p>Holy souls <hi>begin,</hi> herein, to imitate him;
as soon as they first give themselves up to his
wise and gracious conduct. 'Tis enough that
he is wise for himself and them. Their hearts
<hi>safely</hi> trust in him. They commit themselves
with unsollicitous confidence, to his guidance,
knowing he <hi>cannot</hi> himself be mis-led, and that
he will not mis-lead them. As <hi>Abraham</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him, not knowing whether he went: and
thus by <hi>faith,</hi> they enter into his rest.</p>
            <p>They do, now, in their present state, only
<hi>enter</hi> into it; or hover about the borders.
Their future assimilation to God in this; gives
them a stated settlement of Spirit in this rest.
They <hi>before</hi> did owe their tranquillity to their
<hi>faith, now</hi> to their actual <hi>fruition.</hi> Their <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
acquiescency, and sedate temper was
hence, that they believed God <hi>would</hi> deal well
with them at last; their <hi>present,</hi> for that he
<hi>hath</hi> done so. Those words have now their
fullest sense (both as to the <hi>rest</hi> it self, which
they mention; and the <hi>season</hi> of it) <hi>Return to
thy rest,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 116.</note> 
               <hi>O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
with thee.</hi> The <hi>occasions of trouble,</hi> and a
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48660:85"/>
               <hi>passive temper of Spirit,</hi> are ceased together.
There is now no fear without, nor terror
within. The rage of the world is now allay'd,
it storms no longer. Reproach and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
have found a period. There is no more
dragging before Tribunals, nor haling into
Prisons; no more running into dens, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts;
or wandring to and fro in Sheep-skins,
and Goat-skins. And with the cessation of the
external occasions of trouble, the inward dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
thereto are also ceased: All infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Spirit, tumultuating passions, unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
corruptions, doubts, or imperfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the love of God, are altogether va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
and done away for ever.</p>
            <p>And indeed, that perfect cure, wrought
within, is the souls great security, from all
future disquiet. A well tempered Spirit hath

               <p>The Pleasure arising from knowing or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering

2. Comparatively, or respectively to the

            </argument>
            <p>2. <hi>HEre is also to be considered,</hi> the pleasure
and satisfaction involv'd in this assimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to God, as it is known, or refl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cted on, or
that arises from the <hi>cognosci</hi> of this likeness.</p>
            <p>We have hitherto discoursed of the pleasure
of <hi>being like God,</hi> as that is apprehended, <hi>by a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
sensation,</hi> a feeling of that inward recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
that happy pleasure of souls now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
restored? We have yet to consider a
further pleasure, which acrews from the souls
animadversion upon it self; its contemplating
its self thus happily transformed. And though
that very sensation be not without some ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversion
(as indeed no sensible perception
can be performed without it) yet we must
conceive a consequent animadversion, which
is much more explicite, and distinct; and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48660:86"/>
which therefore yields a very great addition of
Satisfaction and delight. As when the blessed
soul shall turn its eye upon it self, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly
compose, and set it self to consider
its present state and frame, the consideration
it shall now have of it self, and this likeness
imprest upon it,
may be either
<list>
                  <item>Absolute, or</item>
                  <item>Comparative &amp; respective.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. Absolute. How pleasing a spectacle will
this be, when the glorified soul shall now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively
behold its own glorious frame?
When it shall dwell in the contemplation of it
self? view it self round on every part, turn
its eye from glory to glory, from beauty to
beauty, from one excellency to another; and
trace over the whole draught of this image;
this so exquisite piece of divine workmanship,
drawn out in its full perfection, upon it self.
When the glorified eye, and divinely enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and inspirited mind shall apply it self to
criticize, and make a judgment upon every
several lineament, every touch and stroke,
shall stay it self, and scrupulously insist upon
every part? view at leisure every character
of glory the blessed God hath instamp't upon
it; how will this likeness now satisfie! And
that expression of the blessed Apostle (taken
notice of upon some other occasion formerly)
[The glory to be <hi>revealed</hi> in us] seems to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
in it a reference to such a self intuition.
What serves <hi>revelation</hi> for, but in order to <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?</hi>
What is it but an <hi>exposing things to view?</hi>
and what is revealed <hi>in us,</hi> is chiefly exposed to
<hi>our own view.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:48660:87"/>
All the time from the the Souls first conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
till now, God hath been as it were at work
upon it.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 5.</note> (<hi>—He that wrought us to,</hi> &amp;c.) hath
been labouring it, shaping it, polishing it,
spreading his own glory upon it, inlaying, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameling
it with glory; now at last the whole
work is revealed, the Curtain is drawn aside;
the blessed Soul awakes. Come now saith God,
<hi>behold my work;</hi> see what I have done upon
thee; Let my work now see the light, I dare
expose it to the <hi>censure</hi> of the most curious eye,
let thine own have the <hi>pleasure</hi> of beholding
it. It was a work carried on in a Mystery se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
wrought (as in the lower parts of the
earth, as we alluded before) by a Spirit that
came, and went no man could tell how. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
that in the general only, we knew <hi>we
should be like him,</hi> it did not yet appear what
we should be, <hi>now it appears.</hi> There is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of this glory. O the ravishing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of its first appearance! and it will be a
glory always fresh and flourishing (as <hi>Job's</hi>
expression is, <hi>my glory was fresh in me</hi>) and
will afford a fresh, undecaying pleasure for
ever.</p>
            <p>2. The blessed soul may also be supposed to
have a comparative and respective considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this impressed glory. That is, so as to
compare it with, and refer it to several<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> things
that may come into consideration with it: and
may so heighten its own delight in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
thereof.</p>
            <p>1. If we consider this impression of glory in
reference to <hi>its former loaths<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me deformities</hi> that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48660:87"/>
were upon it; and which are now vanished and
gone. How unconceivable a pleasure will
arise from this comparison? when the soul
shall consider at once <hi>what it is,</hi> and what once
it was, and thus bethink it self. I that did
sometimes bear the accursed image of the
<hi>Prince of darkness,</hi> do now represent and partake
of the holy pure nature of the <hi>Father of lights.</hi> I
was a meer Chaos, an hideous heap of Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 6.</note>
Confusion and Darkness; <hi>But he that made
light to shine out of darkness, shined into me to give
the knowledge of the light of his own glory in the
face of Jesus Christ,</hi> and since, made my way
<hi>as the shining light shining brighter and brighter
unto this perfect day.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18.</note> I was an habitation of
Dragons, a Cage of noisom lusts; that as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
and Vipers were winding to and fro
through all my faculties and powers; and
preying upon my very vitals. Then was I
hateful to God, and an hater of him; sin, and
vanity had all my heart. The charming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations,
and allurements of grace were as
musick to a dead man; to think a serious
thought of God, or breath forth an affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
desire after him, was as much against my
heart, as to pluck out mine own eyes, or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
violence to mine own life.</p>
            <p>After I began to live the Spiritual new life;
how slow, and faint was my progress and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
towards perfection? how indisposed
did I find my self to the proper actions of that
life? To go about any holy spiritual work,
was, too often, as to climb an Hill, or strive
against the stream; or as an attempt to fly
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48660:88"/>
without wings. <hi>I</hi> have sometime said to my
heart; <hi>Come now lets go pray, love God, think of
heaven;</hi> but O how listless to these things!
how lifeless in them! Impressions made, how
quickly lost! gracious frames, how soon
wrought of and gone! characters of glory
rac'd out, and overspread with earth and dirt!
Divine comeliness hath now at length made
me perfect. <hi>The glory of God</hi> doth now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath
me, they are his ornaments I now wear.
He hath made me, that, lately, <hi>lay among the
pots, as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and
her feathers with yellow gold,</hi> he hath put ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nature into me; the true likeness of his
own holy divine nature; He hath now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
master'd and wrought out the enmity of
my heart against him. Now to be with God is
my very element. Loving, admiring, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him are as natural, as breathing once was.
I am all Spirit and life, I feel my self disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened,
and unclogg'd of all the heavy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive
weights that hung upon me. No <hi>body
of death</hi> doth now incumber me, no deadness
of heart, no coldness of love, no drowsie
sloth, no aversness from God, no earthly
mind, no sensual inclinations or affections, no
sinful devisions o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> heart between God and
Creatures. He hath now the whole of me.
I injoy and delight in none but him, O bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
change! O happy day!</p>
            <p>2. <hi>If in contemplating it self, cloathed with
this likeness it respect the state of damned souls.</hi>
What transpor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s must that occasion! What
ravishing resentments! When it compares
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48660:88"/>
humane nature in its highest perfection, with
the same nature in its utmost depravation? An
unspeakably more unequal comparison than that
would be of the most amiable lovely person,
flourishing in the prime of youthful strength
and beauty, with a putrified rotten carcasse,
deformed by the corruption of a loathsome
grave. When glorified Spirits shall make such
a reflection as this. Lo here we shine in the
glorious brightness of the divine Image; and
behold yonder deformed accursed souls. They
were as capable of this glory as we. Had the
same nature with us; the same reason, the
same intellectual faculties and powers; but
what monsters are they now become? They
eternally hate the eternal excellency. Sin and
death are finished upon them. They have each
of them an hell of horror and wickedness in
it self. Whence is this amazing difference!
Though this cannot but be an awful wonder,
it cannot also, but be temper'd with pleasure
and joy.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>We may suppose this likeness to be considered
in reference to its pattern;</hi> and in comparison
therewith, which will then be another way of
heightning the pleasure that shall arise thence.
Such a frame and constitution of Spirit is full
of delights in it self: but when it shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to its <hi>original,</hi> and the correspondency
between the one, and the other be observ'd
and view'd; how exactly they accord, and
answer each other as face doth face in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
this cannot, still, but add pleasure to
pleasure, one delight to another. When the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48660:89"/>
blessed soul shall, interchangeably turn its
eye to God, and it self; and consider the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of <hi>glory,</hi> to <hi>glory;</hi> the several <hi>derived</hi>
excellencies to the <hi>original.</hi> He is wise, and
so am I, holy and so am I. I am now made
perfect as my heavenly Father is; this gives a
new relish to the former pleasure. How will
this likeness please under that notion, <hi>as it is
his;</hi> a likeness to <hi>him.</hi> O the accent that will
be put upon those appropriative words to be
made partakers of [His] holiness, and of the
[divine] nature. Personal excellencies, in
themselves considered, cannot be reflected on
but with some pleasure; but to the ingenuity
of a child, how especially, grateful will it
be, to observe in it self, such and such grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
deportments, wherein it naturally imitates
its father. So he was wont to speak, and act,
and demean himself: how natural is it <hi>unto
love,</hi> to affect, and aim at the imitation of the
person loved: So natural it must be, to take
complacency therein; when we have hit our
mark, and atchiev'd our design. The pursuits
and attainments of love are proportionable,
and correspondent each to other.</p>
            <p>And what heart can compass the greatness
of this thought, <hi>to be made like God!</hi> Lord,
was there no lower pattern than thy self, thy
glorious blessed self according to which to
form a worm! This cannot want its due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments
in a glorified state.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>This transformation of the blessed soul into
the likeness of God, may be viewed by it, in reference
to the way of accomplishment;</hi> as an <hi>end,</hi> brought
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48660:89"/>
about by so amazing stupendous means; which
will certainly be a pleasing contemplation.
When it reflects on the method and course
insisted on, for bringing this matter to pass,
views over the work of redemption, in its ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to this end,<note place="margin">Phil. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7.</note> 
               <hi>The restoring Gods Image in
souls;</hi> Considers Christ manifested <hi>to us,</hi> in
order to his being revealed and formed <hi>in us.</hi>
That God was made in the likeness man, to
make men after the likeness of God. That he
partook with us of the <hi>humane nature,</hi> that we
might with him partake of the <hi>divine;</hi> that he
assumed our flesh, in order to impart to us his
Spirit. When it shall be considered for this
end had we so <hi>many great and precious promises;</hi>
for this end did the glory of the <hi>Lord shine upon
us through the glass of the Gospel;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4.</note> 
               <hi>that we might
be made partakers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> &amp;c. <hi>That we might be changed,</hi>
&amp;c. Yea, when it shall be called to mind,
(though it be far from following hence, that
this is the only or principal way wherein the
life and death of Christ have influence in order
to our eternal happiness) that our Lord Jesus
lived for this end, that we might learn so <hi>to
walk, as he also walked,</hi> that he dyed that we
<hi>mught be conformed to his death; that he rose again,</hi>
that we might with him <hi>attain the resurrection
of the dead;</hi> that he was in us the <hi>hope of glory,</hi>
that he might <hi>be in us</hi> (that is, that same Image
that bears his Name) our final consummate
glory it self also. With what pleasure will
these harmonious congruities, these apt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondencies,
be look'd into at last!</p>
            <p>Now may the glorified Saint say, I here see
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48660:90"/>
the end the Lord Jesus came into the world
for. I see for what he was <hi>lift up,</hi> made a
spectacle; that he might be <hi>a transforming one.</hi>
What the effusions of his Spirit were for; why
it so earnestly strove with my way-ward heart.
I now behold in my own soul, the fruit of the
travel of his Soul. This was the project of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming
love, the design of all-powerful
Gospel grace. Glorious atchievement! bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
end of that great, and notable under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking!
happy issue of that high desin!</p>
            <p>5. <hi>With reference to all their own expectations
and indeavours.</hi> When it shall be considered
by a Saint in glory; the attainment of this
perfect likeness to God, was the utmost mark
of all my designs, and aims; the term of all my
hopes and desires. This is that <hi>I</hi> long'd, and
laboured for, that which I pray'd and waited
for; which I so earnestly breath'd after, and
restlestly pursu'd. It was but <hi>to recover the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
image of God. To be again made like him,
as once I was.</hi> Now I have attained my end;
I have the fruit of all my labour and travels;
I see now the truth of those (often) incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
words, <hi>Blessed are they that hunger, and
thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.
Be not weary of well doing, for ye shall reap, if ye
faint not.</hi> What would I once have given for
a steady abiding frame of holiness, for an heart
constantly bent and biassed toward God; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
serious, constantly tender, lively,
watchful, heavenly, spiritual, meek, humble,
chearful, self-denying. How have I cryed
and striven for this to get such an heart! such
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48660:90"/>
a temper of spirit! how have I pleaded with
God, and my own soul in order hereto. How
often over have <hi>I</hi> spread this desire before the
Searcher and Judge of hearts; <hi>Turn me out of
all my worldly comforts, so thou give me but such
an heart; Let me spend my dayes in a Prison, or
a Desert, so I have but such a heart; I refuse
no reproaches, no losses, no tortures, may I but
have such a heart.</hi> How hath my soul been
somtimes ravisht with the very thoughts of such
a temper of Spirit, as hath appeared amiable
in my eye, but I could not attain? and what a
torture again hath it been that I could not?
What grievance in all the world, in all the
dayes of my vanity; did I ever find compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to this; <hi>To be able to frame my self by
Scripture, and rational light and rules, the Notion
and Idea of an excellent temper of spirit, and
then to behold it, to have it in view, and not be
able to reach it,</hi> to possess my soul of it? What
indignation have I sometimes conceived against
mine own soul, when I have found it wandring
and could not reduce it; hovering, and could
not fix it; dead, and could not quicken it;
low, and could not raise it! How earnestly
have I expected this blessed day, when all
those distempers should be perfectly healed,
and my Soul recover an healthy, lively spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
frame? What fresh ebullitions of joy
will here be, when all former desires, hopes,
indeavours, are crowned with success and
fruit! This joy is the joy of Harvest. <hi>They
that have sown in tears,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal 126. 6.</note> 
               <hi>do now reap in joy. They
that went out weeping, bearing precious seed; now
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48660:91"/>
with rejoycing bring their sheaves with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. <hi>In reference to what this imprest, likeness shall
for ever secure to it: an everlasting amity and
friendship with God, that it shall never sin, nor he
ever frown more. 1. That it shall sin no more.</hi>
The perfected image of God in it, is its se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
for this; for 'tis holy throughout; in
every point conformed to his nature and will.
There remains in it nothing contrary to him.
It may therefore certainly conclude it shall
never be liable to the danger of doing any
thing but what is good in his sight; and what
solace will the blessed soul find in this! If <hi>now</hi>
an Angel from Heaven should assure it, that
from such an hour it should sin no more, the
world would not be big enough to hold such a
soul. It hath now escaped the deadliest of
dangers, the worst of deaths (and which even
in its present state, upon more deliberate
calmer thoughts it accounts so) the sting of
death, the very deadly head of death; the
Hell of Hell it self. The deliverance is now
compleat which cannot but end in delight and
praise.</p>
            <p>2. That God can never frame more. This
'tis hence also assured of: How can he but
take perfect everlasting complaceny in his
own perfect likeness and image; and behold
with pleasure, his glorious workmanship,
now never liable to impairment, or decay?
how pleasant a thought is this! The blessed
God never beholds me but with delight. I
shall alwayes behold his serene countenance;
his amiable face, never covered with any
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48660:91"/>
clouds, never darkened with any frown. <q>I
shall now have cause to complain no more;
my God is a stranger to me, he conceals
himself, I cannot see his face, lo he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compast
with Clouds and darkness, or with
flames and terrours.</q> These occasions are
for ever ceased. God sees no cause either to
<hi>behold</hi> the blessed soul with displeasure, or with
displeasure to avert from it, and turn off his eye.
And will not this eternally satisfie! when God
himself is so well pleased, shall not we!</p>
            <p>2. The pleasure it disposes to. Besides that
<hi>the inbeing, and knowledge of this likeness,</hi> are so
satisfying: It disposes, and is the souls quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
for a yet further pleasure. That <hi>of
closest union, and most inward communion with the
blessed God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Union.</hi> Which (what it is more then
relation) is not till now compleat. Besides
<hi>relation</hi> it must needs import <hi>presence;</hi> not <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical,</hi>
or <hi>Local,</hi> for so nothing can be nearer
God, then it is but moral, and <hi>cordial,</hi> by which
the holy soul with <hi>will and affections,</hi> guided by
rectified reason, and judgment, closes with,
and imbraces him, and he also upon wise
forelaid counsel, and with infinite delight, and
love imbraceth it: so friends are said to be
one (besides their relation as friends) by an
union of hearts. An union between God
and the creature, as to kind and nature high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than this, and lower than Hypostatical or
personal union I understand not, and therefore
say nothing of it<note n="*" place="margin">I would fain know what the <hi>Tertium</hi> shall be, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting from the Physical union some speak of.</note>.</p>
            <p>But as to the union here mentioned; as, till
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48660:92"/>
the image of God be perfected, it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated;
so it cannot but be perfect then;
When the soul is perfectly formed according
to Gods own heart; and fully participates the
divine likeness, is perfectly like him; that
likeness cannot but infer the most intimate
union that two such natures can admit. That is
(for nature) <hi>a love-union;</hi> such as that which our
Saviour mentions, and prayes to the Father to
perfect between themselves, and all believers,
and among believers mutually, with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 11.</note>
Many much trouble themselves about this
Scripture;<note place="margin">ver. 11.</note> but sure that can be no other then
<hi>a love-union:</hi> For, (1.) 'Tis such an union as
Christians are capable of among themselves,<note place="margin">Ver. 21.</note>
(for surely he would never pray that they
might be one with an union whereof they are
not capable.) (2.) 'Tis such an union as may
be made visible to the world. Whence 'tis an
obvious corollary, <hi>that the union between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Son, there spoken of, as the pattern
of this, is not their union or oneness in essence,</hi>
(though it be a most acknowledged thing, that
there is such an essential union between them)
for who can conceive that Saints should be one
among themselves, and with the Father, and
the Son, with such an union as the Father, and
the Son are one themselves, if the essential
union between Father and Son were the union
here spoken of? But the <hi>exemplary or pattern-union,</hi>
here mentioned, between Father and
Son, is but an union in mind, in love, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
and interest; wherein he prayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
Saints on earth might <hi>visibly</hi> be one with them
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48660:92"/>
also, <hi>that the world might believe, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis yet a rich pleasure that springs up to
glorified Saints from that <hi>love-union</hi> (now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected)
between the blessed God and them.
'Tis mentioned and shadowed in Scripture,
under the name and notion of marriage-uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
in which the greatest mutual compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
is always supposed a necessary ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 16.</note>
To be thus joyned to the Lord, and
made, as it were, one Spirit with him; For the
eternal God to cleave in love to <hi>a nothing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
as his likeness upon it ingages him to do,
is this no pleasure, or a mean one?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Communion,</hi> unto which that union is
fundamental, and introductive; and which
follows it upon the same ground, from a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
propensity <hi>of like to like:</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
now to hinder God, and the holy soul
of the most inward fruitions and injoyments;
no animosity, no strangeness, no unsutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
on either part. Here the glorified Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the just have liberty to so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
amidst the rivers of pleasure at Gods
own right hand, without check or restraint.
They are pure, and these pure. They touch
nothing that can defile, they defile no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
they can touch. They are not now
forbidden the nearest approaches to the
(<hi>once</hi>) inaccessible Majesty, there's no Holy
of Holies into which they may not
enter, no dore lockt up against them: They
may have free admission into the innermost
secret of the divine presence, and pour forth
themselves in the most liberal effasions of <hi>love
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48660:93"/>
and joy,</hi> as they must be the eternal subjects of
those infinitely richer communications from
God, even of <hi>immense and boundless love and
goodness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do not debase this pleasure by low thoughts;
nor frame too daring <hi>positive</hi> apprehensions of
it. 'Tis yet a secret to us. The eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses
of the King of glory, with glorified Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
are onely known to himself and them.
That expression (which we so often meet in
our way) <hi>It doth not yet appear what we shall be;</hi>
seems left, on purpose, to check a too curious
and prying inquisitiveness into these unreveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
things. The great God will have his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
of glory, of love, of pleasure for that
future state. Let him alone a while, with
those who are already received into those man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of glory, those everlasting habitations.
He will find a time for those that are yet pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
and wandring exiles to ascend and enter
too.</p>
            <p>In the mean time what we know of this
communion may be gathered up into this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
account, <hi>The reciprocation of loves;</hi> the
flowing and reflowing of everlasting love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the blessed soul and its infinitely blessed
God; Its egress towards him, his illapses in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it.</p>
            <p>Unto such pleasure doth this likeness dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and qualifie: You can no way consider
it, but it appears a most pleasurable satisfying
thing.</p>
            <p>Thus far have we shewn the <hi>qualification</hi> for
this blessedness, and the <hi>nature</hi> of it, <hi>What it
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48660:93"/>
prerequires,</hi> and <hi>wherein it lyes,</hi> and how highly
congruous it is that the former of these should
be made a prerequisite to the latter, will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
appear to any one, that shall, in his
own thoughts, compare <hi>this righteousness</hi> and
<hi>this blessedness</hi> together. He will indeed plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
see, that the natural state of the case, and
habitude of these each to other, makes this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
unalterable, and eternal; so as that it
must needs be simply impossible to be <hi>thus
blessed,</hi> without being <hi>thus righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For what is this righteousness other than
<hi>this blessedness begun,</hi> the seed and principle of
it? And that with as exact proportion (or
rather sameness of Nature) as is between the
grain sown, and reaped, which is more than
intimated in that of the Apostle,<note place="margin">Gal. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8.</note> 
               <hi>Be not deceived,
God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap: For he that soweth to his
flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption:</hi> (there is
the same proportion too) <hi>but he that soweth to
the Spirit, shall of the Spirit, reap life everlasting:</hi>
Which though it be spoken to a particular case,
is yet spoken from a general rule and reason
applicable a great deal further.</p>

               <p>The season of this satisfaction, which is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold;
at
<list>
                     <item>Death.</item>
                     <item>Resurrection.</item>
                  </list>
The former spoken to, wherein is shewn,
That this life is to the soul (even of a
Saint) but as a sleep. That at death it
awakes. As to the latter, that there is a
considerable accession to its happiness at the
resurrection.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>3. <hi>THe season of this blessedness,</hi> comes
next to be considered, which (as
the words [when I awake] have
been concluded here to import)
must in the general be stated beyond the <hi>time</hi>
of this present life.</p>
            <p>Holy souls are here <hi>truly</hi> blessed, not <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,</hi>
or their present blessedness is perfect
only in <hi>nature and kind,</hi> not in <hi>degree.</hi> 'Tis <hi>in
this respect,</hi> as far short of perfection, as their
holiness is. Their hunger and thirst are <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi>
their being filled is yet <hi>future.</hi> The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of Saints in their best state on
earth, their desires, their hopes, their sighs,
and groans do sufficiently witness they are not
<hi>satisfied,</hi> or if they be, in <hi>point of security,</hi> they
are not in point of <hi>enjoyment.</hi> The completi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this blessedness is reserved to a better
state, as its being the <hi>end, of their way,</hi> their
<hi>rest,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>from their</hi> labours, <hi>the reward of their work</hi>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:48660:95"/>
doth import, and require. Therefore many
Scriptures, that speak of their present <hi>rest,
peace, repose, satisfaction,</hi> must be understood in
a comparative, not the absolute highest
sense.</p>
            <p>More particularly <hi>in that other state;</hi> the
season of their blessedness is twofold, or there
are two terms from whence (in respect of
some gradual, or modal diversifications) it
may be said severally to commence, or bear
date. <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The
time <list>
                  <item>Of their <hi>entrance upon a blessed immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
when they shall have laid down
their earthly bodies <hi>in death.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Of <hi>their consummation therein,</hi> when they
receive their bodies glorified, in the
general resurrection.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Both these may not unfitly be signified by
the Phrase in the Text <hi>[when I awake]</hi> For,
though Scripture doth more directly apply
the term of <hi>[awaking]</hi> to the latter; there
will be no violence done to the Metaphor, if
we extend its signification to the former also.
To which purpose, it is to be noted, that it is
not <hi>Death,</hi> formally, or the <hi>disanimating of
the body,</hi> we would have here to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by it (which indeed sleeping would
more aptly signifie than awaking) but (what is
co-incident therewith in the same period) the
exuscitation, and revival of the soul. When
the body falls asleep, then doth the Spirit
awake, and the eye-lids of the morning, even
of an eternal day do now first open upon it.</p>
            <p>1. Therefore we shall not exclude from this
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48660:95"/>
season the introductive state of blessedness,
which takes its beginning from the blessed
souls first entrance into the invisible state. And
the fitness of admitting it will appear by clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these two things.</p>
            <p>1. That its condition in this life, even at
the best, is in some sort but a sleep.</p>
            <p>2. That when it passes out of it into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
Regions, 'tis truly said to awake.</p>
            <p>1. Its abode in this mortal body, is but a
continual sleep; its senses are bound up,
a drowsie slumber possesses, and suspends all its
faculties and powers.</p>
            <p>Before the renovating change, how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
doth the Scripture speak of sinners as
men a sleep?<note place="margin">1 Thes. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.</note> 
               <hi>Let not us sleep as do others. Awake
thou that sleepest,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes 5. 14.</note> 
               <hi>and stand up from the dead,</hi> &amp;c.
They are in a dead sleep, under the sleep of
death. They apprehend things as men asleep.
How slight, obscure, hovering notions have
they of the most momentous things? and
which it most concerns them to have thorough,
real apprehensions of. All their thoughts of
God, Christ, Heaven, Hell, of Sin, of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
are but uncertain, wild guesses, blind
hallucinations, incoherent phansies; the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity,
and inconcinnity whereof, they no
more reflect upon then men asleep. They
<hi>know not</hi> these things, but only <hi>dream of them.</hi>
They put darkness for light, and light for
darkness, have no senses exercised to discern
between good and evil. The most substantial
realities are with them meer shadowes, and
chemaera's, <hi>Phansied, and imagined dangers</hi> startle
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48660:96"/>
them (as 'tis wont to be with men in a dream)
<hi>real ones,</hi> though never so near them, they as
little fear, as <hi>they.</hi> The creature of their own
imagination, the Lion in the way, which they
dream of in their slothful slumber, affrights
them; but the real roaring Lion that is ready
to devour them, they are not afraid of.</p>
            <p>And conversion doth but relax, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;
it doth not totally break of this sleep; It,
as it were, attenuates the consopiting fumes,
doth not utterly dispel them. What a difficulty
is it to watch but one hour? There are some
lucid, and vivid intervals, but of how short
continuance? how soon doth the awakened
soul close its heavy eyes, and fall asleep again?
how often do temptations surprize <hi>even such,</hi>
in their slumbring fits, while no sense of their
danger can prevail with them <hi>to watch and pray</hi>

            <p>I conceive my self here not concern'd, <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously</hi>
to insist in proving that the souls of
Saints sleep not in the interval, between death

of a practical discourse, which rather intends
the propounding and improvement of things

then the discussing of things dubious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversible.

And so little is the alliance between <hi>a thought,</hi> and any bodily thing, even those very finest Spirits themselves; that I dare say whoever sets himself closely and strictly to consider, and debate the matter with his own faculties, will find it much more easily apprehensible, how the acts of intellection, and volition may be performed <hi>without</hi> those very corporeal Spirits then <hi>by them.</hi> However suppose them never so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensably necessarie to those more noble operations of the soul, it may easilie be furnisht with them, and in greater plentie, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie from the ambient aire (or aether) than from a dull torpid body; with some part of which air, if we suppose it to contract a vital union; I know no rational principle that is wronged by the supposition (though neither do I know any that can necessarily infer it.)</p>
                  <p>As therefore the doctrine of the souls activitie out of this earthly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, hath favour and friendship enough from Philosophers; so I doubt not but upon the most strict and rigid disquisition, it would be as m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Yea and most evident it is from those Texts;
not only that holy souls sleep not, in that state
of separation; but that they are awaked by
it (as out of a former sleep) into a much
more lively, and vigorous activity, than they
enjoyed before: And translated into a state,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48660:99"/>
               <hi>as much better then their former,</hi> as the <hi>tortures
of a Cross,</hi> are more ungrateful, then <hi>the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of a Paradise; these joyes</hi> fuller of vitalitie,

the end of its <hi>race</hi> (as the words import

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48660:101"/>
toyling in a <hi>tiresome way,</hi> it languished un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
many imperfections. And it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
that in the three former Scriptures, that
phrase <hi>of being with Christ,</hi> or <hi>being present
with him,</hi> is the same which is used by the
Apostle, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 17. to express the state
of blessedness after the resurrection, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
plainly the <hi>sameness</hi> of the blessedness
before, and after. And though this phrase be
also used to signi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie the present injoyment saints
have of Gods gracious presence in this life
(which is also in <hi>nature, and kind</hi> the same)
yet it is plainly used in these Scriptures (the
two latter more especially) to set out to us
<hi>such a degree</hi> of that blessedness, that in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
thereof our <hi>present being with Christ,</hi> is
<hi>a not being with him;</hi> our <hi>presence</hi> with him, now,
<hi>an absence from him. While we are at home in
the body, we are absent from the Lord;</hi> and <hi>I
am in a strait betwixt two, desiring to depart</hi> (or
having a desire unto desolution) <hi>and to be
with Christ,</hi> &amp;c. How strangely mistaken, and
disappointed had the blessed Apostle been,
had his absence from the body, his dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
his release, set him further off from
Christ, or made him less capable of converse
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48660:101"/>
with him, then before he was! And how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
would it be; to say the <hi>spirits of the just
are perfected,</hi> by being cast into a stupifying
sleep; yea, or being put into any state, not
better then they were in before? But their
state is evidently far better. The body of
death is now laid aside, and the wights of sin,
that did so easily beset, are shaken off; flesh and
sin are laid down together; the soul is rid of
its burdensome bands, and shackles; hath
quitted its filthy darksome prison (the usual
place of lasiness, and sloth, is come forth of
it's drowsie dormitory, and the glory of God
is risen upon it. 'Tis now come into the <hi>world
of realities;</hi> where things appear <hi>as they are,</hi>
no longer as in a drean, or vision of the night.
The vital quickning beams of divine light, are
darting in upon it, on every side, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it into their own likeness. The shadows
of the evening are vanished, and fled away.
It converses with no other objects but what are
full themselves, and most apt to replenish it
with energy and life. This cannot be but a
joyful awakning; a blessed season of satisfaction
and delight, indeed, to the enlightned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
soul. But</p>
            <p>2. It must be acknowledged the further,
and more eminent season of this blessedness
will be, <hi>the general resurrection day,</hi> which is
more expresly signified in Scripture, by this
term of [awaying] as is manifest in many
plain Texts,<note place="margin">Dan 12 2</note> where 'tis either <hi>expresly</hi> thus
used,<note place="margin">Joh. 14 12.</note> or implyed to have this meaning in the
opposite sense of the word sleep.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 15.</note>

               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:48660:102"/>
               <hi>What</hi> addition shall then be made to the
Saints blessedness, lyes more remote from our
apprehension; in as much as Scripture states
not the degree of that blessedness which shall
intervene. We know, by a too sad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
experience, the calamities of our
present state, and can therefore more easily
conceive, wherein it is capable of better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by the deposition of a sluggish, cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersome
body, where those calamities mostly
have their spring: but then we know less
where to fix our foot, or whence to take our
rise, in estimating the additional felicities of
that <hi>future state,</hi> when both the states to be
compared are so unknown to us.</p>
            <p>But <hi>that</hi> there will be great additions is plain
enough. The full recompence of obedience,
and devotedness to Christ, of foregoing all for
him, is affixed by his promise, <hi>to the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the just;</hi> The <hi>judgment day</hi> gives
every one his portion <hi>according to his work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>
Then must the holy, obedient Christian hear
from its Redeemers mouth, <hi>Come ye-blessed of
my Father, inherit the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. Till then,
the Devils think their <hi>torment to be before their
time.</hi> 'Tis <hi>when he shall appear, we shall be

the day of <hi>being presented faultless with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And divers things there are, obviously
enough to be reflected on, which cannot but
be understood to contribute much to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
and improvement of this inchoate

well be conceived to add, considerably, to
their felicity. A natural congruity, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
is now answered, and satisfied, which
did either lie dormant, or was under some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

The whole assembly of Saints so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly

momentous a truth to the affecting

the Lord shall so far vouchsafe his assistance and

difficulty, and excellency, and unto which all
that hath been done hitherto is but subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,

What is here written, is designed for thy help,

Lord keep me from trifling with the things of
Eternity. Charge thy soul to consider, that
what thou art now reading must be added to
thy account against the great day. 'Tis ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
to think with what vanity of mind the
most weighty things of Religion are entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
amongst Christians. Things that should
swallow up our souls, drink up our Spirits,
are heard as a tale that is told, disregarded by
most, scorned by too many. What can be
spoken so important, or of so tremendous
consequence, or of so confessed truth, or with
so awful solemnity, and premised mention of
the sacred name of the Lord, as not to find
either a very slight entertainment or contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
rejection? and this by persons avowing
themselves Christians! We seem to have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or no advantage in urging men upon their
own principles, and with things they most
readily and professedly assent to. Their hearts
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48660:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are as much untouch't, and void of impression
by the Christian Doctrine, as if they were of
another Religion. How unlike is the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
world to the Christian Doctrine! The
seal is fair and excellent, but the impression
is languid or not visible. Where is that serious
godliness, that heavenliness, that purity, that
spirituality, that righteousness, that peace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which the Christian Religion is most aptly
designed to work and form the Spirits of men?
we think to be saved by an empty name, and
glory in the shew and appearance of that, the
life and power whereof we hate and deride.
'Tis a reproach with us not to be <hi>called a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi>
and a greater reproach <hi>to be one.</hi> If such
and such Doctrines <hi>obtain not,</hi> in our professed
Belief, we are Hereticks or Infidels: if they
<hi>do,</hi> in our practice, we are precisians, and
fools. To be so serious, and circumspect, and
strict, and holy, to make the practice of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
so much our business, as the known and
avowed principles of our Religion do plainly
exact from us (yea though we come, as we
cannot but do, unspeakably short of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
measure) is to make ones self a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
derision and scorn. Not to be professedly
religious is <hi>barbarous,</hi> to be so in good earnest
<hi>ridiculous.</hi> In other things men are wont to act
and practise according to the known Rules of
their several Callings, and Professions; and
he would be reckon'd the common fool of the
neighbour-hood, that should not do so. The
Husbandman that should sow when others
reap, or contrive his Harvest into the depth of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48660:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Winter, or sow Fitches, and expect to reap
Wheat; The Merchant that should venture
abroad his most precious Commodities in a
leaky bottom, without Pilot, or Compass; or
to places not likely to afford him any valuable
return. In Religion only it must be counted
absurd to be, and do according to its known
agreed Principles, and he a fool that shall but
<hi>practise</hi> as all about him professe to <hi>believe.</hi>
Lord! whence is this apprehended inconsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
between the profession and practise of
Religion! what hath thus stupify'd, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man'd
the world! that seriousness in Religion
should be thought the character of a fool!
that men must visibly make a mockery of the
most Fundamental Articles of Faith, onely to
save their reputation, and be afraid to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
least they should be thought mad!

the Scripture Doctrine (the whole entire Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem

if it were not designed to sanctifie and

not reluctate, were easily receptive of its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
our work were as soon done, as such
a Doctrine were nakedly proposed. But the
state of the case in these respects is known and
evident. The tenour and aspect of Gospel
truth speaks its end; and experience too
plainly speaks the oppositeness of mens Spirits.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. <hi>True Blessedness consists not in any sensual
injoyment.</hi> The blessedness of a man can be
but <hi>one; Most onely one.</hi> He can have but one
highest and best good. And its proper chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
is that it finally satisfies and gives rest to
his Spirit. <hi>This the face and likeness of God
doth;</hi> his glory beheld and participated.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48660:108"/>
Here then alone his full blessedness must be
understood to lye.</p>
            <p>Therefore as this might many other wayes
be evinced to be <hi>true,</hi> so it evidently appears
to be the proper issue of the <hi>present truth;</hi> and
is plainly proved by it. But alas! it needs a
great deal more to be <hi>pressed</hi> than <hi>proved.</hi> O
that it were but as much <hi>considered,</hi> as it is
<hi>known.</hi> The experience of almost 6000. years
hath (one would think sufficiently) testified
the incompetency of every worldly thing to
make men happy, that the present pleasing of
our senses, and the gratification of our animal
part is not blessedness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that men are still left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied
notwithstanding. But the practice and
course of the world is such, as if this were
some late, and rare experiment: which (for
curiosity) every one must be trying over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
Every age renews the inquiry after an
earthly felicity; the design is intail'd (as the
Spanish designs are said to be) and reinforc'd
with as great a confidence, and vigor from age
to age, as if none had been baffled, or defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in it before; or that it were very likely to
take at last. Had this been the alone folly of
the <hi>first age,</hi> it had admitted some excuse, but
that the world should still be cheated by the
same so oft-defeated impostures, presents us
with a sad prospect, of the deplorable state of
mankind.<note place="margin">Psal. 49.</note> 
               <hi>This their way is their folly, yet their
posterity approve, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>wearied wits</hi> and <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
estates,</hi> laid out upon the Philosophers stone,
afford but a faint defective representation of
this case. What Chymistry can extract <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:48660:109"/>

blessedness spring and grow out of this cold
earth? If all created nature be vext and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
never so long, who can expect this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixir?
Yet after so many frustrated attempts
so much time, and strength, and labour lost,
men are still as eagerly and vainly busie as
ever. Are perpetually tossed by unsatisfied

They walk but in a vain shew, disquieting
themselves in vain; their dayes flee away as a

sorrow; while they rise up early, and lye
down late, to seek rest in trouble, and life in

The notion and nature of blessedness must sure
be changed, or the temper of their Spirits.
Either they must have new hearts created, or a
new Heaven, if ever they be happy. And
such is the stupid dotage of vain man, he can

that, at least, I fall not below it, and rest not

necessary to my entring into the
Kingdom of God?</p>
            <p>I professedly wave controversies, and 'tis

should ever have been incumbred with

not degress so far as to undertake a <hi>particular</hi>
and <hi>distinct</hi> handling, here, of this work of
God upon the soul, yet) I shall propound
something in general, touching the <hi>change</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
previous to this blessedness, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that necessity is evidenceable from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of this blessedness, which is the business I
have in hand) that, I hope, will pass among
Christians for acknowledged truth, not liable
to dispute, though the Lord knows it be little
considered. My design being rather to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
souls to the consideration of <hi>known</hi> and
agreed things, than to perplex them about <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.</hi>
Consider therefore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First; that the holy Scriptures, in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>and other like passages, do plainly hold forth
the necessity of a</hi> real change, <hi>to be made in the
inward temper, and dispositions of the soul; and
not a</hi> relative only, <hi>respecting its state.</hi> This
cannot be doubted by any, that acknowledge
a <hi>real, inherent depravation,</hi> propagated in the
nature of man. No, nor denyed by them that
grant such a corruption to be general, and
continued among men; whether by imitation
only, or what way soever. And willing I am,
to meet men upon their own principles, and
concessions, however erroneous, or short of
the truth they may be, while they are yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable
to their own advantage. Admit that
<hi>regeneration,</hi> or the <hi>new birth</hi> includes a <hi>change
of our relation and state God-ward;</hi> doth it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>exclude</hi> an intrinsique subjective change of
the inclinations and tendencies of the Soul?
And if it did yet other termes, are more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48660:117"/>
appropriate to, and most expressly point
out, <hi>this very change alone;</hi> As that of <hi>conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
or of <hi>turning to God; of being renewed in the
spirit of the mind;</hi> of <hi>putting off the old man that
is corrupt by</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and putting on the new man which
is created in righteousness, and true holiness</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of
partaking the Divine nature;</hi> It matters not if
this or that expression be understood, by some,
more principally in another sense, the <hi>thing it
self,</hi> of which we speak, is as clearly expressed,
and as urgently pressed (as there was cause) as
any other matter whatsoever throughout the
whole Book of God. But men are slower of
belief, as to the great Article of the Christian
Doctrine, then to most (I might say, <hi>any</hi>) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This Truth more directly assaults the
strong holds of the Devil, in the hearts of men;
and is of more immediate tendency to subvert
his Kingdom; Therefore they are most unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to have it <hi>true,</hi> and most hardly believe it.
Here they are so madly bold, as to give the
lie to all Divine Revelations; and though they:
are never so plainly told <hi>without holiness none
shall see God,</hi> they will yet maintain the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
belief, and hope; till, <hi>go ye cursed,</hi> vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
the Truth of God, and the flames of
Hell be their Eternal confutation. Lord! that
so plain a thing will not enter into the hearts
of men; that so urgent inculcations will not
yet make them apprehend, that their Souls
must be renewed, or perish! That they will
still go dreaming on, with that mad conceit that
(whatever the Word of God says to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
they may yet with unsanctified hearts get to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48660:117"/>
Heaven! How deplorable is the case, that when
men have no other hope left them, but that the
God of truth will prove false, &amp; belie his word;
yea, and overturn the nature of things, to save
them in their sins! Thou that livest under the
Gospel, hast thou any pretence for thy (seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
ignorance in this matter? couldst thou ever
look one quarter of an hour into the Bible, and
not meet with some intimation of this truth?
What was the ground of thy mistake? What
hath beguiled thee into so mischievous a delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
How could such an imagination have place
in thy soul; that <hi>a Child of wrath by nature,</hi> could
become a Child of God without <hi>receiving a new
nature?</hi> That so vast a change could be made in
thy state, without any at all in the temper of thy
Spirit?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> consider, <hi>That this change is, in its own</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>nature, and the design of God, who works it, disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the soul for blessedness.</hi> 'Tis sufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
from the consideration of the state it self,
of the unrenewed soul, that a change is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for this end; such a soul in which it is not
wrought when once its drowsie, stupifying slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is shaken off, &amp; its reflecting power awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
must needs be a perpetuall torment to it self.
So far it is remov'd from blessedness, it is its own
Hell, and can flie from misery &amp; death no faster
then from it self. Blessedness composes the soul,
reduces it to a consistancie; it infers (or rather is)
a self-satisfaction; a well-pleasedness and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
with one self; in rich't, and fill'd with
the divinefulness.<note place="margin">

                  </gap>.</note> Hence 'tis <hi>at rest;</hi> not as
being pent in, but contentedly dwelling
with it self; and keeping within its own
bounds of its own accord. The unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48660:118"/>
soul can no more contain it self within
its own termes, or limits; is as little self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent,
as a raging flame, or an impetuous
tempest. Indeed its own lusts perpetually (as
so many vultures) rend and tear it; and the
more, when they want external objects. Then
(as hunger) their fury is all turned inward;
and they prey upon intestines; upon their own
subject; but unto <hi>endless torment,</hi> not <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</hi>
In what posture is this soul for rest
and blessedness.</p>
            <p>The <hi>nature of this change,</hi> sufficiently speakes
its own design. 'Tis an introduction of (the

thy self to prevent and suppresse what, in

tends to the accomplishment of thy own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

               <hi>consists in the satisfactory sight, and participation

its becoming</hi> holy <hi>or</hi> godly, <hi>or in the alteration of
its dispositions and inclinations, as to God.</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the design, and end of it is not attained.
We are required to <hi>follow peace with all men</hi>

the possibility of attaining this blessedness;</hi> to speak
of any other changes that fall short of, or are
of another kind from, the right disposition of

God our last end, and highest good; and towards
Christ, our only way</hi> (since the Apostacy) of
attaining and injoying it. To rest therefore in
any other good dispositions, or indowments

Thou art but in a delirious dream till

pleasure dost thou take in retiring thy self with
God? what care to redeem time <hi>onely</hi> for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse

to chuse an object for thy thoughts, do they
not naturally fall upon any thing rather then
God! Nor do thou think to shift off this, by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing

it should be so, but Scripture, and experience

revolt, and decline all converse with
that blessed object! Toward other objects it
freely opens, and dilates it self, as under the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48660:120"/>
benign beams of a warm Sun: there are placid,
complacential emotions; amicable sprightly
converses and imbraces. Towards God only,
it is presently contracted, and shut up. Life
retires, and it becomes as a stone, cold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rigid,

what is required (which also those very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
do plainly imply) 'tis alive to sin, to the
world,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 11.</note> to vanity, but crucified, mortified, dead
to God, and Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>The natures of many men that are harsh,
fierce, and savage, admit of various cultivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and refinings; and by moral precept, the
exercise, and improvement of reason, with a
severe animadversion, and observance of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they become mild, tractable, gentle,
meek. (The story of the <hi>Physiognamists</hi> guess
at the temper of <hi>Socrates</hi> is known) but of all
other, the disaffected soul is least inclinable
ever to become <hi>good natur'd</hi> towards God,
wherein grace, or holiness doth consist. Here
'tis most unperswadable, never facile to this
change. One would have thought no affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
should have been so natural, so deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought
into the spirit of man, as an affection
towards the Father of Spirits; but <hi>here,</hi> he

                  </gap>ffection,</hi> surely here is a sad proof, that
such affection doth not ascend.</p>
            <p>The whole duty of man as <hi>to the principle of
it,</hi> resolves into <hi>love. That is the fulfilling of
the Law.</hi> As <hi>to its object;</hi> the two Tables de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
it between God, and our neighbour. And
accordingly divide that love. Upon those two
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48660:121"/>
Branches whereof; <hi>love to God,</hi> and <hi>love to our
neighbour,</hi> hang all the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
            <p>The wickedness of the world hath kil'd
this love at the very root; and indisposed the
nature of man to all exercises of it, either way,
whether towards God, or his neighbour. It
hath not only rendred man unmeet for <hi>holy
communion</hi> with God; but in a great measure
for <hi>civil society with one another.</hi> It hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
good nature; made men false, envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
barbarous; turn'd the world (especially
the dark places of the Earth, where the light
of the Gospel shines not) into habitations of
cruelty. But who sees not the enmity, and
disaffection of mens hearts towards God is the
more deeply rooted, and less superable
evil?</p>
            <p>The beloved Apostle gives us a plain and
sad intimation how the case is, as to this; when
he reasons thus. <hi>He that loveth not his brother
whom he hath seen; how can he love God, whom he
hath not seen?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He argues from the less to the greater; and
this is the ground upon which his argument is
built: <hi>That the loving of God is a matter of
greater difficulty, and from which the Spirit of
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n is more remote, then the loving of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi>
And he withall insinuates an account
why it is so; Gods remoteness from our sense,
which is indeed <hi>a cause,</hi> but no <hi>excuse.</hi> For
is our so gross sensuality no sin? that nothing
should affect our hearts but what we can see
with our eyes? as if <hi>our sense</hi> were the onely
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48660:121"/>
measure or judg of excellencies. We are not all
flesh, what have we done with our souls? if we
cannot see God with our eyes, why do we not
with our minds? at least so much of him we
might, as to discern his excellency above all
things else: How come our souls to lose their
dominion, and to be so slavishly subject to a
ruling sense? But the reason less concerns our
present purpose; that whereof it is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
that implyed assertion, <hi>that men are in a
less disposition to the love of God then their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi>
is the sad truth we are now considering.
There are certain homilitical vertues, that
much adorn and polish the nature of man;
Urbanity, Fidelity, Justice, Patience of Injuries,
Compassion towards the Miserable, &amp;c. and,
indeed, without these, the world would break
up, and all civil societies disband; if, at least,
they did not in some degree obtain. But in
the mean time men are at the greatest distance
imaginable from any disposition to society
with God. They have <hi>some love for</hi> one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
but <hi>none for</hi> him. And yet it must
be remembred that love to our neighbour,
and all the consequent exertions of it, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dutie by the Divine Law; ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
as acts of obedience to God; and
therefore ought to grow from the stock and
root of a Divine Love; I mean <hi>love to God.</hi>
They are otherwise but Spurious Vertues,

            <p>Yea, when there <hi>seems at least to</hi> have been
a reconciliation wrought, are treacheries,
Covenant-breakings, revolts, strangeness, so
frequent among men towards one another, as
from them towards God? How inconsistent
with friendship is it, according to common
estimate, to be alwayes promising, never
performing: upon any, or no occasion to break
off intercourses, by unkind alienations, or
mutual hostilities; to be morose, reserv'd each
towards other. To decline<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or disaffect each
others converse. To shut out one another
from their hearts, and thoughts. But how
common, and unregretted are these carriages
towards the blessed God? It were easie to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate
on this Argument, and multiply In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of this greater disaffection. But in a
word, what observing person may not see,
what serious person would not grieve to see,
the barbarous sooner putting on civility; the
riotous, sobriety; the treacherous, fidelity;
the morose, urbanity; the injurious, equity;
the churlish, and covetous; benignity, and
charity; then the ungodly man piety, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere

wound and distemper sin hath infected
the nature of man with: Though he have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

prejudic'd in regard of his habitude, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency

duties of the first Table. Here the breach is
greatest, and here is greatest need of repair.
True it is an inoffensive winning deportment
towards men, is not without its excellency,
and necessity too. And it doth indeed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferably
reproach Christianity, and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Disciple of Christ; yea it discovers a
man not to be led by his Spirit, &amp; so to be none
of his, to indulge himself in immoral deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
towards men; to be undutiful towards
Superiors; unconversable towards equals;
oppressive towards Inferiors; unjust towards
any. Yet is an holy disposition of heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, most earnestly, and in the first
place to be indeavoured (which will then
draw on the rest) as having in it highest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity

that man?</hi> Notwithstanding such a subdued;
ineffectual love to God, such a one shall be
denominated, and dealt with as an enemy.
'Tis not likely any man on earth, hates God so
perfectly, as those in Hell. And is not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
quality not yet perfect in its kind, and that
is yet growing more, and more intense; in the
mean time allayed by some degree of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary?
Yet that over-mastered degree deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates
not its subject, nor ought a man from
such a supposed love to God, have the name of
a <hi>

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48660:126"/>
of denominating the man, that is prevalent
and practical, that hath a governing influence
on his heart, and life. He in whom the love
of God hath not such power and rule, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
his fainter inclinations may be, is an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, methinks these several conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
compared, and weighed together,
should contribute something to the settling of
right thoughts in the minds of secure sinners,
touching the <hi>nature and necessity</hi> of this <hi>heart-change;</hi>
and do surely leave no place for the
forementioned vain pretences that occasioned
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For (to give you a summary view of what
hath been propounded in those foregoing
considerations) It now plainly appears,</hi> that
the holy Scripture requires in him that shall injoy
this blessedness; a mighty change of the very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of his soul, as that which must dispose him
thereto; and which must therefore chiefly consist,
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the right framing of his heart towards God;
towards whom it is most fixed averse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not easily susceptible of such a change. <hi>And
that any</hi> slighter, or more feeble inclination toward
God, will not serve the turn; but such onely where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the soul is prevalently, and habitually <hi>turned
to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then what can be more absurd, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savory?
what more contrary to Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
or common Reason? then instead of
this necessary heart-change to insist upon so
poor a Plea, as that mentioned above, as the
onely ground of so great a hope. How empty
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:48660:126"/>
and frivolous will it appear in comparison of
this great Soul-transforming change, if we
severally consider the particulars of it.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Orthodoxie indoctrinals,</hi> 'tis in its self
an highly laudible thing, and in respect of the
<hi>Fundamentals</hi> (for therefore are they so called)
indispensibly necessary to the blessedness. As
<hi>that</hi> cannot be without <hi>holiness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 17. 17.</note> so nor <hi>holiness</hi>
without <hi>truth.</hi> But (Besides that this is that
which every one pretends to) is every thing
which is <hi>necessary, sufficient?</hi> As to <hi>natural ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi>
(which is that we now speak to) <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
an <hi>intellectual nature,</hi> are also necessary;
shall therefore all men, yea, and Devils too be
saved?</p>
            <p>Besides, are you sure you believe the grand
Articles of the Christian Religion? consider
a little, The

            <p>First, its grounds, every <hi>assent</hi> is as the
grounds of it are. Deal <hi>truly</hi> here with thy
soul. Can you tell wherefore you are a
Christian? what are thy inducements, to be
of this Religion? are they not such as are
common to thee with them that are of a false

description of the posture and tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of such a soul (even of a sanctified, holy
Soul; which had therefore undergone this
blessed change) towards this state of blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
I shall (saith he) be satisfied with
thy likeness, <hi>q. d.</hi> I cannot be satisfied other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
We have seen how great a change is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to dispose the Soul to this blessedness,
which being once wrought, nothing else can
now satisfie it. Such a thing is this blessedness
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48660:130"/>
(I speak now of so much of it as is previous,
and conducing to satisfaction, or of blessedness
materially considered, the Divine Glory to be
beheld, and participated.) 'Tis of that nature
it makes the Soul restless, it lets it not be quiet,
after it hath got some apprehension of it, till
it attain the full enjoyment. The whole life
of such a one, is a continual <hi>seeking Gods face.</hi>
So attractive is this glory of a subject rightly
disposed to it. While others crave <hi>Corn and
Wine,</hi> this is the summe of the holy Souls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,<note place="margin">Psal. 4.</note>
               <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,

               <note place="margin">Psal. 27.</note> This is now its <hi>one
thing,</hi> the request insisted on, to behold the
beauty <hi>of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> and while in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
it doth so, yet 'tis still looking for this
blessed hope, still hoping to be like him, see
him as he is; the expectation of satisfaction
in this state implies the restless working of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
till then, for what is this satisfaction, but
the fulfilling of our <hi>desires;</hi> the perfecting of
the souls <hi>motions,</hi> in a complacential <hi>rest.</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and <hi>rest</hi> do exactly correspond each to
other. Nothing can <hi>naturally</hi> rest in any place,
to which it was not before <hi>naturally</hi> inclin'd to
move; and the rest is proportionably more
compos'd, and steady, according as the motion
was stronger, and more vigorous. By how
much the heavier any body is, so much the
stronger and less resistible is its motion down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and then accordingly, it is less move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
when it hath attained its resting place.

'Tis therefore a vanity, and contradiction to

state which it shall ultimately and eternally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesse
in (with a rest that must therefore be
understood to be most composed and sedate)
towards it must it needs move with the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and most unsatisfied desire, a desire that
is supreme, prevalent, and triumphant over all
other desires, and over all obstructions to it
self, least capable of diversion, or of pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon any thing short of the terme aimed
at. Ask therefore the holy Soul, <hi>What is thy
Supreme desire?</hi> and so far as it understands it
self, it must answer; <hi>to see, and partake the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
glory; to behold the blessed face of God; till
his likeness be transfused through all my powers,
and his entire image be perfectly formed in me;
present to my view what else you will, I can be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in nothing else but this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore this leaves a black note upon
those wretched souls, that are wholly strangers
to such desires; that would be better satisfied
to dwell always in dust; that shun the blessed
face of God as Hell it self; and to whom the
most despicable vanity is a more desirable
sight, then that of divine glory. Miserable
souls! consider your state, can that be your
blessedness which you desire not? or do you
think God will receive any into his blessed
presence, to whom it shall be a burden? me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
upon the reading of this, you should
presently doom your selves, and see your sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
written in your breasts, compare your

hearts with his holy mans: See if there be any
thing like this, in the temper of your Spirits;
and never think well of your selves till you find

               <note place="margin">Inference.</note>

Surely, if the perfect vision, and percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>'Tis obvious hence, to collect who are in this

more unusual violent temptations hinder

even those that have most of the clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying

most of his image (indeed Scripture on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vouchsafes the name to such sights of God,
<hi>he that doth evil hath not seen God</hi>) Such as

and conformed to God.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 6.</note> These are the most
contented persons in the world. Content is
part of the gain that attends godliness; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring,
renders the other a great gain.
<hi>[—godliness with contentment]</hi> the form of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
discovers how connatural content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is to godliness; as if they were not to
be mentioned apart. Godliness, as if he had
said, is a very gainful thing, but if you would
comprehend the gainfulness of it fully, do not
abstract too curiously, take in with it, that
which is of so near an alliance, that you will
hardly know how to consider them apart; let
its inseparable adjunct <hi>contentment,</hi> go along
with it; and you will find it againful thing
indeed.</p>
            <p>The true <hi>knowledge</hi> of God so directly tends
to holiness, and that to <hi>contentation,</hi> that it
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48660:132"/>
may be too evidently concluded, that a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
person, hath little of the one or the
other, not much knowledge, and less grace;
he is so far from being like God, that in the
Apostles language above we may say, <hi>he hath
not seen him.</hi> Doth that person know God,
or hath ever seen him, that falls not into the
dust, admiring so glorious a Majesty? that
subjects not himself to him, with Loyal affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
accounting it his only grand concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to please, and serve him? But the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
person takes upon him, as if he were
God alone, and as if he expected every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to do him homage, and thought the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were made for the pleasure and service of
none but him. Hath that person ever seen
God, that acknowledges him not a sufficient
portion? a full, all-comprehending good.
Hath he seen him, that sees not reason to trust
him; to commit all his concernments to him.
Hath he seen him that loves him not, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
not in his love? Hath he seen him that
quits not all for him, and abandons not every
private interest to espouse his; and how evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
do these things tend to quiet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the soul? Discontent proceeds from ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing
thoughts of our selves; 'tis rooted in
self-conceit, in self-dependence, self-love,
self-seeking, all which despicable Idols (or
that one great Idol, <hi>Self,</hi> thus variously ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and Idolized) one <hi>sight</hi> of the Divine
Glory would confound and bring to nothing.
The sights of God melt the heart, break it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a sense of sin, and hence compose it to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48660:133"/>
a meek, peaceful humility; but the discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
spirit is an unbroken, proud, imperious
spirit. The sights of God purifie the soul,
refine it from the dross of this vile world, make
it daily aspire to a conformity unto the pure
and Spiritual nature of God. But a discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
spirit, is a sensual, terrene spirit (for
what, but such objects are the usual matter of

rather create new heavens every moment,
then not satisfie: but it hath now done it to the

it might be satisfied with nothing less. Great
love may sometimes be signified by a glance;
the offered view of a willing face. Thus our

The <hi>legal necessity</hi> of it, arising from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

excluded: who by Gods rule (according to
which the supreme judgment must be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged)
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48660:137"/>
shall be found unrighteous. Those
that come not up to the tearms of the Gospel
Covenant; never accepted the offers, nor sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the commands of it. And that
hence consequently are unrelated to Christ,
and ununited to him; no way capable of
advantage by his most perfect and all-sufficient
righteousness, that alone fully answers all the

by the Old Law, and the New; the

too.</p>
            <p>There is the same necessity these should be
excluded, as that God should be just and true.
The word is gone forth of his mouth in
righteousness and cannot return. He did

            </p>
            <p>I have thought sometimes, with much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
of the stupid folly of unsanctified hearts,
they are even confounded in their own wishes;
and would have (in order to their security)
they know not what. Were the question faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
put to the very heart of such a one, what
wouldest thou have done in order to thy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
safety from divine wrath and vengeance?
would not the answer be, O that God would
recall those severe constitutions he hath made,
and not insist <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o strictly, on what be hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in the Gospel, in order to the salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48660:137"/>
on of sinners. But foolish wretch, dost thou
know what thou sayst? wouldst thou have God
repeal the Gospel that thou mayest be the
more secure? in what a case art thou then?
Hast thou no hope if the Gospel stand in force?
what hope wilt thou have if it do not? Must
the hopes of all the world be ruin'd to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
thine? and yet leave them involv'd in the
common ruine too? What, but the Gospel
gives the least hope to Apostate sinners?
There is now hope for thee in the Gospel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
if thou return to God. <hi>Let the wicked
forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
thoughts;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 55.</note> 
               <hi>and let him turn to the Lord, and he
will have mercy upon him; and to our God, and
he will abundantly pardon.</hi> But take away the
Gospel and where art thou? Were it possible
for thee to repent, and become a new man,
what settles the connexion between Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and Salvation but the Gospel-promise?
Will the violated Law of works accept thy
Repentance instead of Obedience? Doth it
not expresly preclude any such expectation?
Doth it give any ground to look for any thing
but death after sin? Thou must therefore flye
to the Gospel or yield thy self lost; and know
it contains none but <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>true</hi> sayings,
that have more stability in them, than the
foundations of heaven and earth. Therefore
expect nothing to be altered for thy sake.
The Gospel-constitution was settled long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou wast born; Thou com'st too late
with thy Exceptions (if thou hadst any) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it. Remember, therefore, this is one
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48660:138"/>
of the unalterable determinations of this Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<hi>without holiness thou shalt never see God,</hi> or
(which amounts to the same) <hi>thou canst not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
his face but in righteousness.</hi> There is no
word in all the Bible of more certain truth
than this. In this also how apt are sinners
foolishly to intangle themselves. The Gospel
is true and to be believed, till they meet with
something that crosses them, and goes against
the hair, and then, they hope it is not so But
vain man! if once thou shake the truth of
God, what wilt thou stay thy self upon? Is
God true when he promises? and is he not as
true when he threatens? if that be a true
saying: <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y to the righteous it shall be well with
him</hi>—is not that as much to be regarded; <hi>wo
to the wicked it shall be ill with him. The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of the righteous shall be upon him, and
the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.</hi>
Are not these of equal authority? If thou
hadst any reason to <hi>hope,</hi> thou mayest be happy
though thou never be righteous; is there not
as much reason to <hi>fear</hi> thou might'st be mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
though thou be; since the one is as much
against the slat express word of God as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Let not thy love to sin betray thee out
of all Religion, and thy wits together.
Wherein wilt thou believe one upon the bare
value of his word, that will lie to thee in any
thing? Yea, and as it is the same authority
that is affronted in every command, whence
disobedience to one is a breach of all; so is the
same veracity denyed in every truth; and the
disbelief of one belies all, and wilt thou believe
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48660:138"/>
him in any thing, thou hast proclaimed a lier
in every thing? Therefore so little hast thou
gained by disbelieving the divine revelation in
this thing; that thou hast brought thy self to
this miserable <hi>Dilemma;</hi> if the word of God
be false thou hast no foundation of any Faith
left thee; if it be true, it dooms thee to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
banishment from his blessed face, while
thou remainest in thy unrighteousness. It will
not be thy advantage then to disbelieve this Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
record, but to consider it, and take it to
heart, 'twill prove never the lesse true,
at last for that thou wilt not believe it,
<hi>shall thy unbelief make the truth of God of none
effect?</hi> And if thou wouldest but reasonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the case; methinks thou shouldest soon
be convinc't. Since thou acknowledgest (as
I suppose thee to do) that there are two states
of men in the other World, <hi>a state of blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and <hi>a state of misery;</hi> and two sorts of men
in this World, the righteous, and the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.
Let thy reason and conscience now
judge, who shall be allotted to the one state,
and who to the other. Sure if thou acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
a righteous Judge of all the world, thou
canst non think he will turn men, promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
into Heaven, or Hell at random, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
distinction: Much less canst thou be so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
and mad, as to think all the unrighteous
shall be saved, and the righteous perish; and
then what is le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t thee to judge, but that which
I am now urging upon thee, that when the
righteous shall be admitted to the vision of Gods
blessed face; the unrighteous shall be driven
forth into outer darkness?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:48660:139"/>
It may be some here will be ready to say,
but to what purpose is all this, they were of
the same mind before; and cannot think that
any one would ever say the contrary.</p>
            <p>Nor do I think so either; but 'tis one thing
not to believe a conclusion to be true, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
to prosess a contrary belief. And one
thing to believe a conclusion, another to think
we believe it. Men often know not their
own minds. In practical matters 'tis best seen
what a mans belief is, by his practice. For
when any profess to believe this or that practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
truth, relating to their salvation, if they
believe is not practically, <hi>i. e.</hi> with such a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
as will command their suitable practice,
it matters not what belief they are of, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were of that judgment or no. Yea
it will prove in the issue, better for them they
had been of another, when their own profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
belief shall be urged against them. But
let us cosider a little how in practical matters
of less concernment we would estimate a mans
belief. You meet a Traveller upon the way
who tells you, the Bridge over such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

River is broken down, and that if you
venture, you perish; if you believe him you
return; if you hold on, he reasonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
you believe him not; and will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be apt to say to you, if you will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, you may make trial. Your Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
tells you a disease is growing upon you,
that in a short time will prove incurable, and
mortal; but if you presently use means, he
shall prescribe, 't<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s capable of an easie reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48660:139"/>
How would you your self have your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of your Phisitian judged of in this case;
would you expect to be believed, if you should
say, you do not at all distrust your Phisitians
integrity, and judgment, but yet you resolve
not to follow his directions? unless you would
have us believe too, that you are weary of your
life, and would fain be rid of it. There is
no Riddle or Mystery in this. How ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
would men make themselves if in matters
of common concernment they should daily
practice directly contrary to their professed
belief? how few would believe them serious,
or in their wits? But however, call this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
or what you will, we contend not
about the name, the belief of such a thing can
no further do you good, you can be nothing
the better for it, further then as it ingages
you to take a course suitable and consequent
to such a belief. To believe that there is a
Hell, and run into it, that unrighteousness
persisted in will damn you; and yet live in it.
To what purpose is it to make your boasts of
this Faith?</p>
            <p>But since you are willing to call this belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
all the foregoing reasoning is to ingage
you to <hi>consider what you believe.</hi> Do you believe
that <hi>unrighteousness will be the death of your soul?
will eternally separate you from God,</hi> and <hi>the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nce
of his glory?</hi> and when you have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd
the matter with your self, you find it to be
<hi>certainly so; should not such a thing be more deeply
pondered? The bare proposal of an evident truth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
present assent;</hi> but if I <hi>further</hi> bend my <hi>mind</hi>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:48660:140"/>
to reason out the same thing to my self. I am oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
to take notice of the grounds, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies,
the habitudes of it, what it rests upon, &amp;
whither it tends, and thence more discern its
importance, and of what moment it is; then
I should have done if upon first view I had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
only, and dismist it my thoughts. And
yet is it possible you should think this to be
<hi>true,</hi> and not think it a most <hi>important truth?</hi>
Is it a small matter in your account, whither
you shall be blessed, or miserable for ever?
whether you be sav'd, or perish eternally? Or
is it considered by you according as the weight
of the matter requires, that as you are found
righteous, or unrighteous, so will it everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
fare with you?</p>
            <p>You may possibly say, you already conclude
your self righteous, therefore no further im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
your thoughts about it.</p>
            <p>But methinks you should hardly be able
how ever to put such a thing out of your
thoughts; while as yet the final determination
is not given in the case. If a man have a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
yet depending concerning his life or
estate: though his business be never so clear,
he will hardly forget it, the trial not being yet
past. And though in this matter, you have
no reason to suspect errour, or corruption in
your Judge (through which many honest causes
may miscarry in an humane Judicature) yet
have you no reason to suspect your self? If the
holy Spirit hath <hi>assured you</hi> it hath not <hi>stupified
you,</hi> but as you have then the less of <hi>fear,</hi> you have
the more of <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>joy.</hi> Therefore you will not
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48660:140"/>
thence mind such a concernment the <hi>less,</hi> but
with the <hi>more delight;</hi> and therefore also, most
probably, with the more frequency, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.
What a pleasure will it be to review
evidences, and say, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o here are the <hi>Mediums</hi> by
which I make out my title to the Eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.
Such, and such characters give me
the confidence, to number my self among
Gods righteous ones. And do you lead that
heavenly raised life? do you live in those
sweet and ravishing comforts of the Holy
Ghost, that may bespeak you one whom he
hath sealed up to the day of redemption?</p>
            <p>If you pretend not to any such certainty,
but rely upon your own judgment of your case;
are you sure you are neither mistaken in the
notion of the righteousnesse required, nor in
the application of it to your own souls?</p>
            <p>Possibly you may think your self, because
in your ordinary dealings you wrong no man
(your self being judge) a very righteous
person. But evident it is, when the Scripture
uses this tearm as discriptive of Gods own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and to distinguish betweeen them that
shall be saved, and perish, it takes it in that
comprehensive sense, before explained. And
however, it requires, at least, much more of
thee under other expressions, as thou canst
hardly be so ignorant, but to know. And do
but use thy reason here a little, and demand
of thy self. Is he to be accounted a righteous
person that thinks it fit to avoid wronging a
man, but makes no conscience at all of wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God? More particularly. Is it righteous to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48660:141"/>
live all thy dayes in a willing ignorance of the
Author of thy being, never once to enquire
<hi>where is God my Maker?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 35.</note> Is it righteous to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
him, dayes without number, not to have
him from day to day in all thy thoughts? Is it
righteous to estrange thy self from him, and
live as without him in the world? while thou
liv'st, mov'st, and hast thy being in him? not
to glorifie him in whose hands thy breath is?
to be a lover of pleasure more then God? a
worshipper, in thy very soul, of the creature,
more then of the Creatour? Is it righteous to
harden thy heart against his fear and love? to
live under his power, and never reverence it,
his goodness, and never acknowledge it? to
affront his Authority, to belie his Truth,
abuse his Mercy, impose upon his Patience,
desie his Justice? to exalt thy own interest
against his, the trifling petite interest of a sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worm, against the great all comprehending
interest of the common Lord of all the world?
to cross his will, to do thy own? to please thy
self, to the displeasing of him? whence hadst
thou thy measures of Justice, if this be
just?</p>
            <p>Again, is it righteous to deny the Lord that
bought thee, to neglect that great salvation
which he is the Authour of? And whereas he
came to bless thee in turning thee from thine
iniquities, wilfully to remain still in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed
servitude to sin? <hi>when he was made
manifest to destroy the works of the Devil,</hi> still to
yield thy self <hi>a captive at his will?</hi> whereas he
died that thou might'st not <hi>any longer live to thy
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48660:141"/>
self, but to him that died for thee, and rose again;</hi>
and that he <hi>might redeem thee from thy vain
conversation,</hi> and that thou art so expresly told
that such as still lead sensual lives, mind earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, have not their conversation in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
are enemies to the Cross of Christ; Is
it no unrighteousness that in these respects thy
whole life, should be nothing else but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
contradiction to the very design of his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
a perpetual Hostility, a very Tilting at
his Cross? Is there no unrighteousness in thy
obstinate infidelity, that wickedly denies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
to his glorious Truths, acceptance of his
gracious Offers, subjection to his holy Laws?
no unrighteousness in thy obstinate, remorsless,
impenitency? thy heart that cannot repent?
that melts not while a crucified Jesus amid'st
his agonies, and dying pangs, cryes to thee
from the Cross, <hi>O sinner enough, thy hard heart
breaks mine! yield at last, and turn to God.</hi> Is
it righteous to live as no way under Law to
Christ? to persist in actual rebellion against
his just Government, which he died, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived,
and rose again to establish, over the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and the dead? yea, and that while thou
pretendest thy self a Christian? In a word; Is
it righteous to tread under foot the Son of
God, to vilifie his Blood, and despise his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?
Is this the righteousness that thou talkest
of? are these thy qualifications for the everlast-blessedness?</p>
            <p>If thou say, thou confessest thou art <hi>in thy
self,</hi> in these several respects, altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous;
but thou hopest the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48660:142"/>
of Christ, will be sufficient to answer for
all.</p>
            <p>No doubt Christs Righteousness is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
available to all the ends for which it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by the Father and Him; but it shall
never answer all the ends that a foolish
wicked heart will fondly imagine to it self.</p>
            <p>In short, it serves to excuse thy non perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of, and stands instead of thy perfect sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
obedience to the <hi>Law of works;</hi> but it
serves not instead of thy performance of
what is required of thee, as the <hi>condition of
the Gospel Covenant.</hi> That is, It shall never
supply the room of Faith, Repentance, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
Holiness, the loving of Christ
above all, and God in him; so as to render
these unnecessary, or salvation possible without
them. There is not one <hi>iota,</hi> or tittle in the
Bible, that so much as intimates, an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
person, an unbeliever, an impenitent,
or unholy person, shall be saved by Christs
righteousness; but enough to the contrary,
every one knows, that hath the least acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Vain Man what? is Christ devided, and
devided against himself; Christ without,
against Christ within? His suffering on the
Cross, and foregoing obedience, against his
Spirit and Government in the Soul? Did
Christ die, to take away the necessity of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christians? And must his death serve, not
to destroy sin out of the world, but Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
who hath taught thee so wickedly to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understand
the design of Christs dying? And
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48660:142"/>
when the Scripture so plainly tells thee,<note place="margin">Joh 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>That
God so loved the world, that he gave his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Son, that whosoever believeth in him, should
not perish, but have everlasting life.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb 5. 9.</note> And, <hi>That
he became the Authour of eternal salvation to them
that obey him, yea, and that he will come in flaming
fire to take vengeance on them that know, and obey
him not.</hi> What should induce thee to think thou
mayst be saved by him, whether thou belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,
and obeyest or no?</p>
            <p>No, if ever thou think to see God, and be
happy in him; thou must have a righteousness
in thee, resembling <hi>his:</hi> the very product the
thing wrought in the work of regeneration.
If ye know that he is righteous,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 29.</note> ye know <hi>that
every one that doth righteousness is born of him.</hi>
Whereupon follows the description of the
blessedness of such righteous ones in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the next Chapter.—<hi>They are sons—they
shall be like</hi> &amp;c. So that in a word,
without some sight of God here, there's no
seeing him hereafter; without some likeness
to him now, none hereafter. And such as are
destitute of that heart-conformity to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
wherein the Evangelical Righteousness
stands; are so far from it, that we may say to
them,<note place="margin">Joh. 5. 37.</note> as our Saviour to the Jews, <hi>Ye have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heard his voice, nor seen his shape,</hi> i. e. you
have never had right notion, or any the least

destitute of all Divine Impressions whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>8. We may further infer, <hi>from this qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the subject of blessedness. That righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48660:143"/>
is no vain thing.</hi> That is not in vain
that ends so well, and hath so happy an issue
at last. Scripture tells us, that the <hi>labour of
the righteous tendeth to life:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 10. 16.</note> and that we may
understand it of their labour, as they are

            <p>For as to the former of them, all the world
will agree without disputing the matter, that
the last end of man (<hi>i. e.</hi> which he ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

that he can design no further good to himself,

            <p>As to the latter, besides all that assurance

is that only likely way to happiness, and would
therefore desire to die, at least, the righteous

be like his. So is wisdom (I might call it

those whose more refined spirits (having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

God) prompt them to groan after something
beyond time, and above this Sublunarie
Sphere; of them, the Apostle there tell us,
<hi>that they are saved by hope.</hi> They (as if he should

hold out, were it not for their hope. And

him to be happy for an <hi>hour,</hi> or for any Space,

possible to him, to look back, and recount
with himself how happy he was once. Nor is

be; if he can but find he is upon safe tearms,
as to his future, and eternal state. As for me,
saith the Psalmist (he, herein, sorts, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

this point of wisdom should escape <hi>their</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice;

be resolved into nothing else but the <hi>Divine

Lord Jesus Christ is said to have <hi>rejoyced in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
(it even put his great comprehensive soul

               <hi>that thou hast hid these things
from the wise and prudent, and revealed them to
babes:</hi> Even so Father, <hi>because it pleased thee.</hi>
Here was a thing fit to be reflected on, as a piece
of Divine Royalty? a part, <hi>worthy the Lord of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth.</hi> And what serious spirit would
it not amaze, to weigh, and ponder this case
awhile; to see men excelling in all other
kinds of knowledge, so far excelled by those
they most contemn, in the highest point of
wisdom; such as know how to search into the
abstrusest Mysteries of <hi>Nature;</hi> that can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel,
or see through the most perplext in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues
of <hi>State;</hi> that know how to save their
own Stake, and secure their private Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests,
in whatsoever times; yet so little seen
(<hi>often;</hi> for not <hi>many</hi> wise) in the matters
that concern an eternal felicity! It puts me
in mind of (what I find observed by some)
the <hi>particular madness (adementia quoad hoc</hi>)
as 'tis called; when persons, in every thing
else, capable of sober, rational discourse;
when you bring them to some one thing (that
in reference to which they became distemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at first) they rave, and are perfectly mad.
How many that can manage a discourse with
great reason, and judgment, about other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who when you come to discourse with
them about the affairs of <hi>practical godliness,</hi>
and which most directly tend to that <hi>future
state of blessedness,</hi> they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

end; know not what to say. They savour not
those things. These are things not understood,
<hi>but by such to whom it is given.</hi> And surely
that <hi>given wisdom</hi> is the most excellent wisdom.
Sometimes God doth, as it were, so far gratifie
the world, as to speak their own language;
and call them wise that affect to be called so,
and that wisdom which they would fain have
go under that name; <hi>Moses</hi> 'tis said was skil'd
in all the <hi>wisdom of Egypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 7. 22.</note> &amp;c. but at other
times he expresly calls those wise men fools;
and their wisdom, folly, and madness; or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexes
some disgraceful adject, for distinction
sake; or applies those appellatives Ironically,
and in manifest derision. No doubt, but any
such person as was represented in the parable
would have thought himself to have done the
part of a very wise man in entertaining such
deliberation and resolvs,<note place="margin">Luke 12.</note> as we find he had there
with himself. How strange was that to his
ears, <hi>Thou fool, this night shall they require thy
soul, &amp;c.</hi> Their wisdom is sometimes said to be
<hi>foolish,</hi> or else called the <hi>wisdom of the flesh,</hi>
or <hi>fleshly wisdom,</hi> said to be earthly, sensual,
devillish, they are said to be <hi>wise to do evil;</hi>
while to do good, they have no understanding;
they are brought sometimes, as it were, upon
the stage with their wisdom, to be the matter
of divine triumph; where is the wise? and
that which they account foolishness is made to
confound their <hi>wisdom.</hi> And indeed do they
deserve to be thought wise; that are so busily
intent upon momentary trifles; and trifle
with eternal concernments; that prefer va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48660:151"/>
shadows to the everlasting glory? that
follow lying vanities, and forsake their own
mercies? Yea, will they not cease to be wise
in their own eyes also; when they see the issue,
and reap the fruits of their foolish choice? when
they find the happiness they preferred before
this eternal one is quite over; and nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
to them of it, but an afflictive remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.
That the torment they were told
would follow, is but now beginning; and
without end: when they hear from the mouth
of their impartial Judge; <hi>Remember you in
your life time had your good things, and my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

               <hi>now you must pine, and mourn, and

            <argument>
               <p>The second general Head of the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or use of the Doctrine propounded
from the Text, containing certain Rules
or prescriptions of duty connatural there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
Rule 1. That we settle in our minds
the true notion of this blessedness. Rule 2.
That we compare the temper of our own
spirits with it, and labour thence to discern
whether we may lay claim to it or no.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THus far we have the the account of
the <hi>Truths</hi> to be considered, and
weigh'd, that have dependence on the
Doctrine of the Text.</p>
            <p>Next follows the duties to be practis'd, and
done in reference thereto, which I shall lay
down in the ensuing <hi>Rules</hi> or Prescriptions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That we admit, and settle, the distinct notion of</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>this blessedness in our minds, and judgements.</hi>
That we fix in our own souls apprehensions
agreeable to the account this Scripture hath
given us of it. This is a counsel, leading,
and introductive to the rest; and which if it
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48660:152"/>
obtain with us, will have a general influence
upon the whole course of that <hi>practice,</hi> which
the Doctrine already opened, calls for. As
our apprehensions of this blessedness are more
distinct, and clear; it may be expected more
powerfully to command our hearts, and lives.
Hence it is in great part, the Spirits, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations
of Christians have so little
<hi>savour,</hi> and <hi>appearance</hi> of <hi>heaven</hi> in them.
We rest in some general, and confused notion
of it; in which there is little either of efficacy,
or pleasure; we descend not into a particular
inquiry, and consideration what it is. Our
thoughts of it, are gloomy, and obscure; and
hence is our Spirit naturally listless, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
towards it: and rather contents it
self to sit still in a Region all lightsome round
about, and among objects it hath some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
acquaintance with, then venture it self
forth as into a new world which it knows but
little of. And hence our lives are low and
carnal: they look not as though we were seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the heavenly Country; and indeed, who
can be in good earnest in seeking after an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
state? This is owing to our negligence,
an infidelity. The blessed God hath not been
shy, and reserv'd; hath not hidden, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
from us the glory of the other world;
nor lock't up Heaven to us; nor left us to the
uncertain guesses of our own imagination: the
wild fictions of an unguided phansie; which
would have created us a poetical heaven only,
and have mock't us with false <hi>Elysiums.</hi> But,
though much be yet within the vail, he hath been
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48660:152"/>
liberal in his discoveries to us. Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
are brought to light in the Gospel.
The future blessedness (though some refined
Heathens have had near guesses at it) is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
apprehensible by the measure onely of
Gods revelation of it. For who can deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
with certainty, of the effects of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>good pleasure ('Tis your Fathers good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to give you a Kingdom.</hi>) Who can tell,

               </gap> there is most fitly to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.)</p>
            <p>But this <hi>internal</hi> discovery is made by the
mediation, and interveniencie of the <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal:</hi>
Therefore having that before our eyes
we are to apply our minds to the study, and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48660:153"/>
consideration of it; and in that way, to expect
the free illumination of the holy Spirit. In
the mean time we must charge our ignorance,
and the darkness of our cloudy thoughts,
touching these things, upon our carelesness,
that we do not attend, or our incredulity, that
we will not believe what God hath revealed
concerning them: 'tis therefore a dutiful
attention, and reverential Faith that must
settle and fix the notion of this blessedness. If
we will not <hi>regard,</hi> nor <hi>give credit</hi> to what God
hath discovered concerning it, we may sit
still in a torpid, disconsolate darkness, which
we our selves are the authors of, or (which
is no less pernicious) compass our selves with
sparks beaten out of our own Forge; walk in
the light of our own fire, cheat our souls with
the fond dream of an imagined Heaven, no
where to be found, till we at length lye down
in sorrow. How perverse are the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men in this (as in reference to the <hi>way,</hi>

quite besides, and against the plain word

another kind of happiness; such as shall

'tis but a negative Heaven; they many times

               </gap>ertain in their thoughts (of which their

nothing shall offend, or incommodate the

               </gap>, or feel want; and when they have
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48660:153"/>
thus stated the matter in their own thoughts;
we cannot beat them out of it, but that they
<hi>desire to go to heaven (viz.</hi> the heaven of their
own making) when did they conceive it <hi>truly,</hi>
and <hi>fully,</hi> they would find their hearts to abhor
from it, even as hell it self.</p>
            <p>Therefore here we should exercise an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over our selves; and awaken conscience
to its proper work and business; and demand of
it, <hi>Is it not reasonable these divine discoveries
should take place with me?</hi> hath not God spoken
plainly enough? why should my heart any
longer hang in doubt within me, or look wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
towards future glory, as if it were an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth
thing? or is it reasonable to confront
my own imaginations to his discoveries?
Charge conscience with the duty it owes to
God in such a case; and let his revelations be
received with the reverence and resignation
which they challenge; and <hi>in them</hi> study and
contemplate the blessedness of awakened souls;
till you have agreed with your self fully how
to conceive it. Run over every part of it in
your thoughts, view the several divine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,
which you are, hereafter, to see, and
imitate; and think what every thing will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to the satisfaction and contentment of
your Spirits. This is a matter of unspeakable
consequence.</p>
            <p>Therefore, to be as clear as is possible, you
may digest what is recommended to you in
this <hi>Rule,</hi> into these more particular directions.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Resolve with your selves to make the divine
revelation of this blessedness the prime measure, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48660:154"/>
reason of all your apprehensions concerning it;</hi> Fix
that purpose in your own hearts, so to order
all your conceptions about it, that when you
demand of your selves, What do I conceive of
the future blessedness? and why do I conceive
so? the <hi>divine revelation</hi> may answer both the
questions. I apprehend what God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
and because he hath so revealed.
The Lord of <hi>heaven</hi> sure best understands it;
and can best help us to the understanding of
it. If it be said of the <hi>origen of this world</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 3.</note> it may much more be said of the

                  </gap>e of the other, we understand it by faith.</hi> That
must inform, and perfect our intellectuals in
this matter.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Therefore, reject and sever from the notion
of this blessedness, whatsoever is alien to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
Scripture gives us of it.</hi> Think not that
sensual pleasure, that a liberty of sinning, that
an exemption from the divine dominion, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and estrangedness from God (which by
nature you wickedl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> affect) can have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grediency
into (or consistency with) this state
of blessedness.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Gather up into it whatsoever you can find by
the Scripture-discovery to appertain or belong there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi>
Let your notion of it be to your uttermost,
not only <hi>true,</hi> but <hi>comprehensive,</hi> and <hi>full;</hi> and
as particular and positive, as Gods revelation
will warrant: Especially remember, 'tis a
spiritual blessedness; that consists in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining,
and perfecting of your Spirits, by the
vision and likeness of the holy God; and the
<hi>satisfying</hi> of them thereby for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:48660:154"/>
4. <hi>Get the notion of this blessedness deeply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
in your minds;</hi> so as to abide with you,
that you may not be alwayes at a loss; and
change you apprehensions every time you
come to <hi>think of it:</hi> Let a once-well formed
<hi>Idaea,</hi> a clear full state of it be <hi>preserv'd</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire:
and be (as a lively image) alwayes
before your eyes; which you may readily view
upon all occasions.</p>
            <p>2. That having well fixed the notion of this
blessedness in your minds,<note place="margin">2 Rule.</note> you seriously reflect upon
yourself, and compare the temper of your Spirit
with it: that you may find out how it is affected
thereto; and thence judge in what likelihood you
are of enjoying it.</p>
            <p>The general aversion of mens Spirits to this
so necessary work of <hi>self-reflection</hi> is one of the
most deplorable Symptoms of lapsed, degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
humanity. The wickedness that hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread
the nature of man, and a secret <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi>
and <hi>misgiving,</hi> hath made men afraid
of themselves, and studiously to decline all
acquaintance with their own souls; to shun
themselves as <hi>Ghosts and Spectives;</hi> they cannot
indure to <hi>appear</hi> to themselves. You can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impose a severer task upon a wicked man,
than to go retire an hour or two, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
with himself, he knows not how to <hi>face
his own thoughts:</hi> His own soul is a Devil to
him (as indeed it will be in hell, the most
frightful, tormenting Devil) Yet what <hi>power</hi>
is there, in man, more excellent, more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
to reasonable nature, than that of
<hi>reflecting,</hi> of turning his thoughts upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48660:155"/>
Sense must here confess it self out done.
The eye that sees other objects cannot see it
self. But the mind, <hi>a rational Sun,</hi> can, not
only project its beams, but revert them;
make its thoughts turn inward. It can see its
own face, contemplate it self. And how use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
an indowment is this to the nature of man?
If he err he might perpetuate his error, and
wander infinitely, if he had not this self-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
power, and, if he do well never
know, without it, the comfort of a rational
self-approbation. Which comfort Paganish
morality hath valued so highly, as to account it

be prized, and how fully attained? The Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
discovers, at the same time, the ugly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities
of a mans soul, and the means of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a true spiritual comliness; Yea it is it
self the instrument of impressing the divine
image, and glory upon mens Spirits; which
when it is in any measure <hi>done</hi> they become
most sociable, and conversable with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and when 'tis but <hi>in doing,</hi> it so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly

directly turns and strictly holds a mans eye,
intent upon himself; so powerfully urges, and
obliges the sinner to mind and study his own
soul; that, where it hath affected any thing,
been any way operative upon mens spirits,
<hi>they</hi> are certainly supposed to be in a good
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48660:156"/>
measure acquainted with themselves, whatever
others are. Therefore the Apostle bids the
Corinthians if they desire a proof of the <hi>power
and truth</hi> of his ministery; to consult them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<hi>[examine your selves]</hi> and presently sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns

               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 5.</note> intimating it
was an unsupposeable thing they should be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant;
What? Christians, and not know your
selves? Can you have been under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
so long, and be strangers to yourselves?
none can think it. Sure 'tis a most reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
thing; a thing full of ignonimy, and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,
that a man should name himself a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
and yet be under grosse ignorance
touching the temper, and bent of his own soul.
It signifies that such a one understands little of
the design and tendency of the very religion
he pretends to be of; Yet he was a Christian
by meer chance, that he took up, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
his profession in a dream. Christianity
aims at nothing; it gets a man nothing; if it
do not procure him a better Spirit? 'tis an
empty insignificant thing, it hath no design in
it at all, if it do not design this. It pretends
to nothing else. It doth not offer men se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
advantages, emoluments, honours, it
hath no such aim to make men in that sense,
rich, or great, or honourable, but to make
them <hi>holy,</hi> and fit them for God. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
loses all his labour, and reward, and shews
himself a vain trifler in the matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>that makes not this the scope and mark of his
Christian profession,</hi> and practice, and herein
he can do nothing without a constant self-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48660:156"/>
As it therefore highly <hi>concerns,</hi>
it well <hi>becomes</hi> a Christian under the Gospel,
to be in a continual observation, and study of
himself; that he may know to what purpose
he is a Christian; and take notice what (or
whether any) good impressions be yet made
upon his Spirit; whether he gain any
thing by his Religion. And if a man enter
upon an enquirie into himself; what more
important question can he put then this; <hi>In
what posture am I as to my last and chief end?</hi> how
is my Spirit framed towards it? This is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment
and business of the Gospel, <hi>To fit
souls for blessedness:</hi> and therefore if I
would enquire, what am I the better for the
Gospel? this is the sense and meaning of that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
question, is my soul wrought by it to any
better disposition for blessedness? Upon which
the resolution of this depends; <hi>am I ever like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to enjoy it, yea or no?</hi> That which may make
any heart, not deplorably stupid, shake, and
tremble; that such a thing should be drawn
into question; but the case, with the most, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
it, and it must be so. 'Tis that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I would fain here, <hi>awaken souls</hi> to, and
<hi>assist them</hi> in; that is, propound something
(in pursuance of the present direction) which
might both <hi>awaken them</hi> to move this great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<hi>and help</hi> them in discussing it. Both
which will be done in shewing the <hi>importance</hi>
of this latter <hi>ultimate question in it self,</hi> and then
the <hi>subserviencie of the former subordinate one, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the deciding it.</hi> These two things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall a little stay upon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:48660:157"/>
1. To shew and urge the requisiteness of
debating with ourselves, the likelihood, or
hopefulnesse of our enjoying this blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>2. To discover that the <hi>present habitude,</hi> or
disposedness of our Spirits to it, is a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
apt medium, whereby to judge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>First, As to the former of these; methinks
our business should do it self, and that the
very mention of such a blessedness, should <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally</hi>
prompt souls to bethink themselves,
<hi>doth it belong to me? have I any thing to do with
it?</hi> Methinks every one that hears of it should
be beforehand with me; and prevent me here.
Where is that stupid soul that reckons it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
thing to attain this blessed state, or
fall short of it? When thou hearest this is the
common expectation of Saints, <hi>to behold the face
of God, and be satisfi'd with his likeness, when they
awake;</hi> Canst thou forbear to say with thy self,
and what shall become of me when I awake!
what kind of awaking shall I have! shall I
awake amid'st the beams of glory, or flames of
wrath? If thou canst be perswaded to think
this no matter of indifferency; then stir up thy
drowsie soul to a serious inquirie, how 'tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to fare with thee for ever; and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
put thy conscience to it, to give a free, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
answer to these few Queries.</p>
            <p>1. Canst thou say, thou art already <hi>certain</hi>
of thy eternal blessedness? Art thou so <hi>sure,</hi>
that thou need'st not enquire. I know not
who thou art that now readest these lines,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48660:157"/>
and therefore cannot judg of thy confidence,
whether it be right or wrong; onely that thou
may'st not answer too hastily, consider a little;
that <hi>certainty of salvation is no common
thing:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 12.</note> not among (I speak you see of subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
certainty) the heirs of salvation them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
How many of Gods holy ones, that
cannot say they are <hi>certain,</hi> yea how <hi>few,</hi> that
can say they are? That exhortation to a
Church of Saints, <hi>Work out your salvation with
fear and trembling</hi> (they of whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
such confidence, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 6. over
whom he so glories, Chap. 4. 1.) implyes
this to be no common thing. So doth Christs
advice to his Disciples, <hi>Strive to enter in at the
strait gate;</hi> and St. <hi>Peters</hi> to the scattered
<hi>Jews</hi> (that he saith had obtained <hi>like precious
faith, &amp;c.) give diligence to make your calling
and election sure,</hi> with many more passages of
like import. Yea, how full is the Scripture
of the complaints of <hi>such</hi> crying out of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
bones, of festering wounds, of distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
by divine terrours. Now what shall we
say in this case, when so eminent Saints have
left us Records of the distresses and agonies
of their Spirits, under the apprehended dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
of God; may it not occasion us to
suspend a while, and consider; have we much
more reason to be confident then they? And
do we know none that lead stricter, and more
holy lives then we, that, are yet in the dark,
and at a losse in judging their Spiritual states?
I will not say that we <hi>must</hi> therefore think our
selves <hi>bound</hi> to doubt, because another possibly
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48660:158"/>
ter then we doth so. Unknown accidents may
much vary the cases. But, who would not
think that reason, and modesty had quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
the world, to hear (where the odds is
so vastly great) the vain boasts of the loose ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality,
compared with the humble, solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
doubts of many serious knowing Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans?
To see <hi>such</hi> trembling about their soul
concernments, who have walk't with God,
and served him long in prayers, and tears;
when multitudes that have nothing whereon
to bottom a confidence, but <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;</hi>
shall pretend themselves certain! If,
drawing breath a while, thou wilt suspect thou
have reason not to be peremptory in thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence;
thou wilt sure think thy self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to inquire further. Urge thy Soul
then with this question again and again, art
thou yet certain, yea or no.</p>
            <p>2. Is it a comfortable state to be <hi>uncertain,</hi>
or to have before thee apparent grounds of
a rational, and just doubt? For causeless
doubts may sooner vanish, when their cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness
is once discovered; and so they are
less likely to keep a person that is capable of
understanding his own case, under a stated dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort.
But I suppose thee, in order to the
answering the foregoing Querie, to have in
some measure considered thy case; and that,
with a preponderating apprehension of danger
in it, thou returnest it <hi>uncertain.</hi> Uncertain
man! and what, wilt thou remain uncertain?
wilt thou sit still so, till thou perish? shall thy
life hang in doubt, and thy soul be in jeopardy
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48660:158"/>
every hour, till the everlasting flames resolve
the doubt; and put the matter out of question
with thee? What course canst thou apply thy
self to, but to inquire, and search further into
thy own state, to avoid the torture of thy own
fears, the pangs, and dreadful expectations of a
palpitating misgiving heart; 'tis tru, that inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
diligent doubtfulness, hath hope, and
comfort in it. But doubtfulness, joyned with
a resolution of casting off all further care, is
utterly desperate, and disconsolate; what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
to thee in that case, but <hi>a fearful, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for a fiery indignation?</hi> how canst thou pass
an hour in peace, while thou apprehendest it
unlikely, thou see the face, and be satisfied with
the image of God, do not thy own thoughts
represent to thee the amazing sights, the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
images which shall for ever entertain, and
possess thy soul? Art thou not daily haunted
with Divine Horrors? when thou sayest at
night, thy <hi>bed shall refresh thee,</hi> art thou not
<hi>terrified with dreams, and affrighted with visions?</hi>
Dost thou not say in the morning, would to
God it were evening, and in the evening
say, would to God it were morning: And while
thou knowest not what else to do, meditate
onely changes instead of remedies. Or if
thou find no such trouble invading thy mind,
let me further ask.</p>
            <p>3. Is it <hi>reasonable</hi> to be secure in such a state
of uncertainty! Debate this matter a little
while, with thy self. Is it thy reason, or thy
<hi>sloth</hi> that makes thee sit still; and forbear to
look into thy Spiritual affairs? Is it any <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:48660:159"/>
consideration,</hi> or not rather the <hi>meer indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi>
of a Soul, affraid to know its own state,
that suspends thee from inquiring? what hast
thou to say that looks like a reason? Is it that
it will disturbe thy thoughts, interrupt thy
pleasures, fill thee with anxious cares and
fears, which thou art as loath to admit, as
burning coals into thy bosome? Is it that thou
canst not endure to look upon so dreadful an
object, <hi>as the appearing danger, or possibility of
thy being miserable to eternity?</hi> And art thou
therefore resolved to shut thine eyes, and cry
peace, peace? This is to avoid a present in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
by an eternal mischief (a gross
overstraining of the Paradox! for avoiding the
present fear of Hell, to run into it; as if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a man cannot bear the thoughts of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he should presently cut his own throat.
Vain man! canst thou not bear the thoughts
of eternal misery, how wilt thou bear the
thing? And how long-liv'd dost thou think
that peace shall be that thou purchasest upon
so dear, and hard tearms? canst thou promise
thy self an hour? may'st thou not lose thy
purchase, and price together the next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
canst thou <hi>defer</hi> thy misery by <hi>forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
it? or will thy judgment linger, and thy
damnation slumber, while thou securely lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerest,
and slumberest? canst thou wink Hell
into nothing; and put it out of <hi>being,</hi> by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it out of thy <hi>thoughts?</hi> Alas man! open thy
eyes, when thou wilt, thou shalt find thou

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48660:159"/>
past. The horrid image is still before thee.
This is not a phansied evil, which a man may
dream himself into, and (<hi>eadem operâ</hi>) with
as little difficultie, dream himself out of it
again: no, thy case is miserable and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
when thou composest thy self to sleep; if
thou awakest, thou wilt find it still the same;
onely thou did'st not apprehend it before, for
then thou wouldest not have slept. As the
Drunkard that kills a man, and after falls asleep
in his drunken fit; he awakes and understands
his wretched case. Would his sleeping on,
till the Officers arrest had awak't him, have
mended the matter with him?</p>
            <p>But thou wilt possibly say, is it not better,
here, to have a little quiet now, then to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
by <hi>sad thoughts here,</hi> and miserable by
<hi>actual suffering hereafter</hi> too? Is not one death
enough? why should one kill himself so often
over? and hasten misery as if it came on too
slowly?</p>
            <p>Better, man? an hard choice. Supposing
thou art to be <hi>eternally</hi> miserable; If thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand'st
that <hi>word eternity;</hi> The good or
evil of this little inch of time, will signifie so
little with thee, as hardly to weigh any thing
in the Scale of a rational judgment. But
what, art thou now <hi>dreaming,</hi> while thou thus
reasonest? Dost thou yet no better understand
thy case? Art thou not under the Gospel? Is
it not the day of thy hope, and of the Lords
grace, and patience towards thee? It was said
that sleeping would not better thy case; but it
was not said, that <hi>awaking</hi> would not; but all
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:48660:160"/>
that is here said, is designed to the awakening
of thee, that thou may'st know thy case, and
indeavour a redress. Dost thou think any
man in his sober wits, would take all this
pains thus to reason with thee, if that were
the acknowledged, and agreed state of thy
case; that it were already taken for granted
thou must perish? We might as well go preach
to Devils, and carry down the Gospel into
Hell. But dost thou think the holy merciful
God sent his Son, and his Ministers to mock
men; and to treat with them about their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
concernments, when there is no hope?
Were that thy case, thou hadst as good a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
as the Devil had, <hi>to complain of being tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented

rather it be not reasonable, to stir up thy soul to
consider in what posture thou art, towards the
attainment of this blessedness; that thou may'st
accordingly steer thy course in order to it? If
an Accusation, or a Disease do threaten thy
life; or a suspected slaw, thy Title, to thy
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:48660:160"/>
Estate, would'st thou not think it reasonable
to inquire into thy case? and is it not much

Whence let me further ask.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Canst thou pretend it to be impossible?</hi>
Hath God left thee under <hi>a necessitated igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
in this matter? or denied thee <hi>sufficient</hi>
means of knowing how 'tis with thee in respect
of thy Spiritual Estate? Though he have not
given thee <hi>a List,</hi> or told thee the Number,
or Names of his Sanctified ones; yet hath he
not sufficiently described the persons, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thee characters by which they may be
known? And hath he not furnish't thee with
a <hi>self reflecting power,</hi> by which thou art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to look into thy self? and discern whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou be of them or no? Doth he not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
and afford to serious, diligent souls, the
assisting light of his blessed Spirit to guide,
and succeed the inquirie? And if thou find it
difficult, to come to a speedy, clear issue, to
make a present, certain judgment of thy case;
ought not that to ingage thee to a patient,
continued diligence, rather then a rash, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairing
madness, to desist, and cast off all? In
as much as the difficultie, though great, is not
insuperable, and the necessity, and advantage
incomparably greater? And (though divers
other things do confessedly fall in) the principal

Thou art not put to traverse the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to climb Heaven, or dig through the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:48660:161"/>
Earth; but thy work lies nigh thee, in thy
own heart, and Spirit, and what is so nigh, or
should be so familiar to thee, as thy self? 'Tis
but casting thy eye upon thy own soul, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
which way 'tis inclin'd, and bent, thou
art urged to. Which is that we propounded

            <p>2. <hi>That we are to judge of the hopefulness of
our enjoying this blessedness, by the present habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
or disposedness of our spirits thereto.</hi> For
what is that righteousness which qualifies for
it, but the impress of the Gospel upon the
minds and hearts of men? The <hi>Gospel-revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is the onely <hi>Rule,</hi> and <hi>Measure</hi> of that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.
It must therefore consist <hi>in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
thereto.</hi> And look to the frame, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of the Gospel-revelation; and what doth
so directly correspond to it, as that very habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and disposedness of spirit for this blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
whereof we speak? Nothing so answers,
the Gospel, as a propension of heart towards
God (gratifi'd in part, now, and increasing,
till it find a full satisfaction) a desire of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, and of being like him. 'Tis the
whole design of the Gospel, which reveals his
glory in the face of Jesus Christ, to work and
form the spirits of men to this. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whose spirits are thus wrought, and framed,
<hi>are righteous</hi> by the <hi>Gospel-measure,</hi> and by <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

righteousness are evidently entituled,</hi> and fitted
for this blessedness. Yea that righteousness
hath in it (or rather is) the elements, the
first Principles, the seed of this blessedness.
There can therefore be no surer <hi>Rule,</hi> or <hi>Mark,</hi>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:48660:161"/>
whereby to judge our states, whether we have
to do with this blessedness, may expect it yea or
no, <hi>than this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>How stand we affected towards it, in what dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
are our hearts thereto?</hi> Those fruits of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
by which the soul is qualified to
appear without offence in the day of Christ;
the several graces of the Sanctifying Spirit;
are nothing else but so many holy Principles,
all disposing the soul towards this blessednesse,
and the way to it, <hi>Mortification, Self-denial,</hi>
and <hi>godly sorrow,</hi> take it off from other objects,
the World, Self, and Sin, <hi>Repentance</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>that
part of it which respects God) turns the
course of its motion towards <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>end.
Faith</hi> directs it, through Christ the way. <hi>Love</hi>
makes it more freely; <hi>desire,</hi> earnestly; <hi>joy,</hi>
pleasantly; <hi>hope,</hi> confidently; <hi>humility,</hi> even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<hi>fear,</hi> circumspectly; <hi>patience,</hi> constantly,
and perseveringly. All conspire to give the
Soul aright disposition towards this blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
The result of them all is <hi>heavenliness;</hi>
an <hi>heavenly temper of spirit.</hi> For they all (one
way, or other) as so many Lines, and Rayes,
have respect to <hi>a blessedness in God</hi> (which is
heaven) as the <hi>point,</hi> at which they aim; and
(the <hi>cuspis</hi>) the point in which they meet, in
order to the touching of that objective point
is <hi>heavenliness.</hi> This is the <hi>ultemate,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
disposition of heart, for this blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
the result (the <hi>terminus productus</hi>) of
the whole work of righteousness, in the Soul;
by which 'tis said to be as it were, <hi>gnota ad glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam,</hi>
begotten to the eternal inheritance,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48660:162"/>
Concerning this therefore, chiefly institute
thy inquiry. Demand of thy self, is my soul
yet made <hi>heavenly?</hi> bent upon eternal bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse
or no? And here thou mayest easily
apprehend of how great concernment it is,
to have the right notion of <hi>heaven;</hi> or future
blessedness, as was urged under the <hi>foregoing
Rule.</hi> For if thou take for it, another thing;
thou missest thy mark, and art quite beside thy
business. But if thou retain a right, and scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
state and notion of it; the Rule thou art
to judge by, is <hi>sure; They shall have heaven
whose hearts are intent upon it, and framed to
it.</hi> Scripture is every where pregnant, and
full of this.</p>
            <p>The Apostle plainly intimates; this will
<hi>be the rule of Gods final judgment.</hi> Certainly it
cannot be unsafe for us, to judge our selves
by the same Rule. He tells us, when <hi>God shall
judge every one according to his works</hi> (the great
business of the judgment day) <hi>eternal life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 6, 7.</note> shall
be the portion of them, <hi>who, by patient continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in well doing, sought glory, and honour,
and immortality,</hi> (which are but other expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the same thing) what can be more
plain. <hi>They shall have eternal life,
and glory that seek it;</hi> whose hearts are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it. Again, speaking of true Christians,

               <note place="margin">Matth. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19, 20, 21.</note> but <hi>in heaven;</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently

hearts be also.</hi> If thy treasure, thy great inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
thy precious, and most valuable good,
be above; that will attract thy heart, it will
certainly be disposed thitherward.</p>
            <p>Yet here it must carefully be considered;
that, in as much as this blessednesse is <hi>thy end,</hi>
i. e. thy <hi>Supream good</hi> (as the notion of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
also imports) Thy heart must be set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it <hi>above any other injoyment;</hi> else all is to no
purpose. 'Tis not a faint, slight, overmastered
inclination that will serve the turn; but (as
all the forementioned Scriptures import) such
as will bespeak it a mans business to seek hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
his main work; and give ground to say of
him, <hi>his heart is there.</hi> If two lovers solicit the
same person, and, speaking of them in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons
she say, <hi>this</hi> hath my heart; is it tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to understand her, as meaning him she
loves less? so absurd would it be to understand
Scriptures, that speak of such an intention
of heart heaven-ward; as if the faintest desire,
or coldest wish, or most lazie, inconstant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
were all they meant. No, 'tis a steady
prevalent, victorious direction of heart towards
the future glory, in comparison whereof, thou
despisest all things else (all temporal, terrene
things) that must be the (<hi>evidential</hi>) ground
of thy hope to enjoy it. And therefore
in this, deal faithfully with thy own soul,
and demand of it; Dost thou esteem this
blessednesse above all things else? Do the
thoughts of it continually return upon thee?
and thy mind and heart, as it were <hi>naturally,</hi>
run out to it? Are thy chie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est solicitudes, and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:48660:163"/>
cares taken up about it, least thou should'st fall
short, and suffer a disappointment? Dost thou
savour it with pleasure? hath it a sweet and
grateful relish to thy Soul? dost thou bend all
thy powers to pursue, and presse on towards
it? Urge thy self to give answer <hi>truly</hi> to such
enquiries; and to consider them <hi>seriously,</hi> that
thou may'st do so.</p>
            <p>Such whose Spirits are either <hi>most highly rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and lift up to heaven, or most deeply deprest,
and sunk into the earth,</hi> may make the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
judgment of themselves. With them that
are of a middle temper, the trial will be
more difficult; yet, not fruitless, if it be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with serious diligence; though no certain
conclusion or judgment be made thereupon.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>true design,</hi> and use of all such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,
and reflections upon our selves (which
let it be duly considered) is, <hi>not to bring us into
a state of cessation from further indeavours;</hi> as if
we had nothing more to do, (suppose we judge
the best of our state that can be thought) but
to <hi>keep us in a wakeful temper of Spirit;</hi> that we
may not forget our selves in the great business
we have yet before us; but go on with renewed
vigour, through the whole course of renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
indeavours, wherein we are to be still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant,
till we have attained our utmost mark,
and end. Therefore is this present enquiry di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,

in the following Rules, is yet to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>

               <p>Rule 3d. Directing such as upon enquirie
find, or see cause to suspect a total
aversation in themselves to this blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
to be speedy, and restlesse in their
indeavours, to have the temper of their
Spirits altered, and made suitable to it.
Doubts and Objections conconcerning the
use of such indeavours, in such a case,

this Direction propounded and
pressed.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>3.<note place="margin">Rule. 3.</note> THat if, upon such reflection, we find, or
suspect our selves, wholly diseffected,
and unsuitable to this blessedness, we
apply our selves to speedy, incessant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to get the temper of our Spirits changed,
and fitted thereto.</p>
            <p>The state of the case speaks it self, that there
is no sitting still here. This is no condition,
(Soul) to be rested in; unless thou art pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
to encounter the terrours of eternal
darkness, and endure the torture of everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
burnings. Yet am I not unapprehensive
how great a difficulty a carnal heart will
make of it, to bestir itself in order to any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
of so deplorable a case. And how real
a difficulty it is to say any thing, that will be
thought regardable to such a one. Our sad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:48660:164"/>
tells us, that our most efficacious
words are commonly wont to be entertained,
as neglected puffs of wind; our most convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
reasonings, and perswasive exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
lost (yea, and though <hi>they</hi> are managed
too in the name of the great God) as upon
the deaf, and dead. Which is too often apt
to tempt into that resolution, <hi>of speaking no
more in that name.</hi> And were it not that the
dread of that great Majesty retains us;
how hard were it to forbear such expostulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<q>Lord, why are we commonly sent upon
so vain an errand? Why are we required to
speak to them that will not hear? and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
thy sacred truths and counsels, to the
contempt of sinful worms? to labour day by
day in vain, and spend our strength for
nought.</q> Yea; we cannot forbear to
complain. <q>None so labour in vain as
we. Of all men, none so generally, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosperous,
and unsuccessful. Others are
wont to see the fruit of their labours, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the expence of strength in them.
But our strength is labour, and sorrow, (for
the most part) without the return of a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
fruit. The Husbandman ploughs in
hope, and sowes in hope, and is, commonly,
partaker of his hope; we are sent to plough,
and sow among Rocks, and Thorns, and in
the high Way; how seldom fall we upon
good ground! where we have any increase.
Yea Lord! how often are men the harder
for all our labours with them, the deader
for all indeavours to quicken them. Our
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:48660:165"/>
breath kills them, whom thou sendest us to
speak life to, and we often become to them a
a <hi>deadly savour.</hi> Sometime, when we think
somewhat is done to purpose, our labour,
all returns, and we are to begin again; and
when the duties we perswade to come di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to cross mens interests, and carnal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
they revolt and start back, as if
we were urging them upon flames, or the
swords point, and their own souls, and the
eternal glory are regarded as a thing of
naught. Then Heaven and Hell become
with them Phancies and Dreams, and all
that we have said to them false and fabulous.
We are to the most, <hi>as men that mock,</hi> in
our most serious warnings, and counsels, and
the <hi>word of the Lord is a reproach.</hi> We some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
fill our mouthes with Arguments, and
our hearts with Hope, and think, sure, they
will now yield, but they esteem our strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
reasonings (as <hi>Leviathan</hi> doth Iron, and
Brass) but as <hi>Straw,</hi> and <hi>rotten Wood,</hi> and
laugh at Divine threatnings; as he doth at the
shaking of the Spear. Yea, and when we
have convinc't them, yet we have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
though we have got their <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Consciences</hi> on our side, and their
own; their <hi>Lusts,</hi> onely, reluctate,
and carry all. They will <hi>now</hi> have their
way, though they perish. We see them
perishing under our very eye, and we cry to
them (in thy name, O Lord) to turn, and live,
but they regard us not. For these things some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>we weep in secret,</hi> and our eyes trickle
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48660:165"/>
down with tears, yea we cry to thee, O Lord!
and thou hearest us not; thy hand seems
shortened, that it cannot save; it puts not on
strength as in the days of old. It hath snatcht
souls by thousands, as firebrands out of the
fire, but now thou hidest and drawest it back.
Who hath believed our report, to whom is
the Arm of the Lord revealed. Mean while
even the Divels instruments prosper more
than we. And he that makes it his business to
tempt, and intice down souls to hell, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
more then we that would allure them
to heaven.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But we must speak, whether men will hear,
or forbear, though it concerns us to do it with
fear and trembling. Oh how solemn a business
is it to treat with souls! and how much to be
dreaded least they miscarry through our impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
or neglect! I write with sollicitude
what shall become of these lines; with what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
they will be read (if they fall into such

of those things wherein you state blessedness,
and they are without savour to us. If therefore the
notion you give us of blessedness be right, all the
work necessary to quallifie us for it, is yet to
be done; we yet remain wholly destitute of any prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of life, that may dispose us to such relishes
and injoyments. If the new Creature, (as you say)
consist in a suitable temper of Spirit unto such a state
as this, 'tis as yet wholly unformed in us. And is
there any thing to be done by a dead man in order to
life? Can a Child contribute any thing to its first
formation? or a Creature to its coming into being?</p>

and put fallacies upon yourselves in a

And what else are you now doing? For sure,

(the <hi>esse simpliciter</hi>) the <hi>meer being of any thing,</hi>
and (the <hi>esse tale) its being such, or such; by the

Though nothing could contribute to its <hi>one
being simply.</hi> Yet sure, when <hi>it is in being,</hi> it
may contribute to the bettering, or perfecting
of it self (as even the unreasonable creatures
themselves do) And if it be a creature <hi>natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
capable of acting with design,</hi> It may act de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly
in order to its becoming so or so qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified,
or the attaining of somewhat yet wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to its perfection. You cannot be thought
so ignorant, but that you know the <hi>new Creature</hi>
is onely an <hi>additional</hi> to your <hi>former being.</hi> And
though it be true, that <hi>it</hi> can do no more to its
own production, than the unconceived Child
(as nothing can act before it is) doth it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
follow, that <hi>your reasonable soul,</hi> in which

means in order to that blessed change? You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
act <hi>holily,</hi> as a Saint; but therefore can you
not act <hi>rationally,</hi> as a man! I appeal to your

            <p>Is it <hi>impossible</hi> to you to attend upon the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation

<hi>Well, I will now spend this hour in considering
my eternal concernments.</hi> When you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
so much of your self: set your thoughts
on work (you will find them voluble and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixt,
very apt to revolt, and fly off from things
you have no mind to) but use your authority
with your self. Tell your soul (or let it tell it
self) <hi>these things concern thy life.</hi> At least, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this prepared matter along with thee (that

think of these things, now actually suggested,
and offered to thy thoughts; as namely,</p>
            <p>Consider, that thou hast a reasonable immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
soul, which, as it is <hi>liable to eternal misery,</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o it is <hi>capable of eternal blessedness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this blessedness thou dost understand
to consist <hi>onely in the vision of the blessed God,</hi> in
<hi>being made like to him,</hi> and in the <hi>satisfaction</hi> that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s thence to result and acrue to thee.</p>
            <p>Consider (what thy very objection suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
that thou findest the temper of thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to be altogether indisposed, and averse to
such a blessedness. Is it not so? is not this thy
very case? feel now again thy heart, try is it not
at least coldly affected towards this blessed
state?</p>
            <p>Is it not then obvious to thee to consider that
the temper of thy Spirit must be changed, or
thou art undone? That, inasmuch as thy bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
lyes in God, this change mustly in the
alteration of thy dispositions and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48660:168"/>
of thy Spirit towards him. Further,</p>
            <p>Canst thou not consider the power, and
fixedness of thy aversation from God? and
with how mighty a weight thy heart is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and held down from him? Try, lift at thy
heart, see if it will be raised God-ward, and
Heaven-ward? dost thou not find it is as if
thou wert lifting at a Mountain, that it lies as
a dead weight, and stirs not? ponder thy case
in this respect. And then,</p>
            <p>Is it not to be considered, that thy time is
passing away apace? that if thou let thy self
alone, 'tis likely to be as bad with thee <hi>to
morrow,</hi> as <hi>this day,</hi> and as bad <hi>next day,</hi> as
<hi>to morrow?</hi> And if thy time expire, and thou
be snatcht away in this state, what will become
of thee? And dost thou not therefore, see a
necessity of considering what ever may be
most moving, and most likely to incline thy
heart God-ward, of pleading yet more
lowdly, and importunately with thy self?</p>
            <p>And canst thou not consider, and reason the
matter thus? <q>O my soul, what's the reason
that thou so drawest back, and hangest off
from thy God? that thou art so unwilling to
be <hi>blessed in him?</hi> that thou shouldest ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to run thy self upon eternal perdition
rather? what cause hath he ever given thee
to disaffect him? what is the ground of thy
so mighty prejudice? Hath he ever done
thee hurt? Dost thou think he will not accept
a returning soul? that is to give the lie to his
Gospel, and it becomes not a perishing
wretch so to provoke him in whom is all
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48660:168"/>
its hope. Is the eternal glory an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable
thing? or the everlasting burnings
tolerable? canst thou find a way of being for
ever blessed <hi>without God,</hi> or whether he will
or no? or is there a sufficient, present plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in thy sinful distance from God, to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh
Heaven and Hell? Darest thou ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon a resolution of giving God and
Christ their last refusal? or say, thou wilt
never hearken to, or have to do with them
more? or darest thou venture to do, what
thou darest not resolve? and act the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
thou canst not think of? scorn eternal
Majestie and love? spurn and trample a
bleeding Saviour.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Commune thus awhile with thy self, but if
yet thou find thy heart relent nothing. Thou
canst yet further consider, that it lies not in
thy power to turn thy own heart (or else how
comest thou thus to object?) And hence,</p>
            <p>Canst thou avoid considering, <hi>this is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
case?</hi> that thou art in great straits; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to perish (yea sure to do so, if thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in that ill temper of Spirit) and wholly
unable to help thy self. Surely thou canst not
but see this to be a most distressed case.</p>
            <p>I put it now to thy conscience; whether,
being thus led on, thou canst not go thus far.
See whether upon trial, thy Conscience give
thee leave to say; <hi>I am not able thus to do, or
think:</hi> and be not here so <hi>foolish,</hi> as to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the action of the <hi>first cause,</hi> and the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi>
in judging thy <hi>ability:</hi> Thou may'st say
no, I cannot think a good thought <hi>without
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:48660:169"/>
God;</hi> true, so I know thou canst not move
thy finger without God; but my meaning in
this appeal to thy Conscience, is, whether up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
trial, thou findest not an <hi>assistance sufficient</hi>
to carry thee thus far?</p>
            <p>Possibly thou wilt say yea; but what am I
the better: I am onely brought to see my self
in a dristressed, perishing condition, and can
get no further.</p>
            <p>I answer, 'tis well thou art got so far; if
thou do indeed see thy self perishing,
and thy drowsie soul awake, into any sense of
the sadness of thy case. But I intend not thus
to leave thee here. Therefore let me, further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
demand of me. What course would'st
thou take in any other distress, wherein thou
knowest not what to do to help thy self? would
not such an exigencie, when thou findest thy
self pinch't, and urg'd on every side, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

with calamities, and canst no way turn thy

                  </gap>s,</hi> that thou hast heard of
his great mercy, and pitty towards the spirits
of men, in their forlorn lapsed state. What a
blessedness he hath designed for them, what
means he hath designed to bring them to it.
Tell him thou only needest a temper of Spirit,
suitable to this blessedness he invites thee to.
That thou can'st not master, and change thy
sensual, earthly heart, thou know'st he easily
can; thou art come to implore his help, that
his blessed, and holy Spirit may descend, and
breath upon thy stupid, dead Soul; and may
sweetly encline, and <hi>move</hi> it towards him, that
it may eternally <hi>rest</hi> in him; and that thou
may'st not perish, after so much done, in order
to thy blessedness; onely for want of a heart
to entertain it. Tell him thou com'st upon
his gracious encouragement, having heard he
is as ready to give his Spirit, <hi>to them that ask
him,</hi> as Parents bread to their craving Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
rather then a stone. That 'tis for life
thou beggest. That 'tis not so easie to thee to
think of perishing for ever, that thou canst
not desist, and give up all thy hopes; that thou
shalt be in Hell shortly, if he hear and help thee
not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:48660:170"/>
Lastly, If thus thou obtain any communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of that holy blessed Spirit, and thou
find it gently moving thy dead heart, let me
once more demand of thee; Is it impossible
to forbear this or that external act of sin <hi>at
this time,</hi> when thou art tempted to it, sure
thou can'st not say, <hi>'tis impossible.</hi> What neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitates
thee to it? and then certainly thou
may'st as well, ordinarily, with-hold thy self
from running into such customary sensualities,
as tend to grieve the Spirit, debauch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
stupifie thy Soul, and hide God
from thee.</p>
            <p>And if thou canst do all this, do not fool thy
slothful soul with as idle a conceit, that thou
hast nothing to do, but to sit still, expecting till
thou drop into Hell.</p>
            <p>2. But have I not reason to fear I shall but
add sin to sin,<note place="margin">Doubt 2.</note> in all this? and so increase the
burden of guilt upon my own soul, and by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to better my case, make it far worse.</p>
            <p>Two things I consider,
that suggest to me this fear.
The
<list>
                  <item>Manner,</item>
                  <item>End,</item>
               </list>
of the duties you put me upon, as they will be done
by me in the case wherein I apprehend my self yet
to lie.</p>
            <p>1. Manner. (As to the positive actions you
advise to) I have heard the best actions of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
person, are sins through the sinfulness
of their manner of doing them, though as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the thing done, they be injoyned, and good.
And though it be true, that the regenerate cannot
perform a sinless duty, neither yet their persons,
and works being covered over with the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48660:170"/>
of Christ, are look't upon as having no sin in
them, which I apprehend to be none of my case.</p>
            <p>2. End. You put me upon these things in order
to the attaining of blessedness: and to do such
things with intuition to a reward, is to be (as
may be doubted) unwarrantably, mercenary, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ervile.</p>
            <p>1. First,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> as to this <hi>former reason</hi> of your
doubt, methinks the proposal of it answers it.
For as much as you acknowledge the matter
of these actions to be good, and duty (and
plain it is they are <hi>Moral duties,</hi> of common,
perpetual concernment to all <hi>persons,</hi> and <hi>times</hi>)
dare you decline, or dispute against your
<hi>duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sure, if we compare the evil of what is <hi>so
substantially in itself,</hi> and <hi>what is so circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially,</hi>
onely by the adherence of some <hi>undue
modus,</hi> or manner; it cannot be hard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
which is the <hi>greater,</hi> and <hi>more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
evil.</hi> As to the present case, shouldst thou,
when the great God sends abroad his Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of pardon and peace, refuse to attend
it; to consider the contents of it, and thy
own case in reference thereto; and there up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to sue to him for the life of thy own soul.
Dost thou not plainly see thy refusal must
needs be more provoking then thy defective
performance. <hi>This</hi> speaks <hi>disability,</hi> but that
<hi>rebellion,</hi> and <hi>contempt</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Therefore as to that form of expression [that such acts of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men are sins] that is a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techrestical piece of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick which being so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, is harmless, but to use it in property of speech, and thence to go about to make men believe that it's a sin to do their duty, is void both of truth &amp; sense, and full of danger unto the souls of men.</note>. Besides, dost thou
not see that thy objection lies as much against
every other action of thy life; the wise man
tells us, <hi>the ploughing of the wicked is sin,</hi> (i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
that be literally to be understood.<note place="margin">Prov. 21. 4.</note>) And
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:48660:171"/>
what would'st thou therefore sit still and do
nothing; Then how soon would that <hi>Idleness</hi>
draw on gross wickedness? and would not that
be a dreadful confutation of thy self, if thou
who didst pretend a scruple, that thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
not pray, read, hear, meditate, shalt not
scruple to play the glutton, the drunkard, the
wanton, and indulge thy self in all riot, and
excess. Yea, if thou do not break out into
such exorbitances, would any one think him
serious, that should say it were against his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to be <hi>working out his salvation, and stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to enter in at the strait gate.</hi> Seeking first
<hi>the Kingdom of God, &amp;c.</hi> would not this sound
strangely? and especially that, in the mean
time, it should never be against his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to trifle away his time, and live in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
neglects of God, in persevering A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism,
Infidelity, Hardness of heart, never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted
or striving against; as if these were
more innocent?</p>
            <p>And what thou say'st of the different case of
the <hi>regenerate,</hi> is impertinent; for as to this
matter, the case is not different, they that
take<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> themselves to be <hi>such,</hi> must not think that
by their supposed interests in the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ, their <hi>real sins</hi> cease to be <hi>such,</hi>
they only become <hi>pardoned sins;</hi> and shall they
therefore sin more boldly then other men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are surer of pardon?</p>
            <p>Secondly. <hi>As to the other Ground of this
Doubt,</hi> there can onely be a fear of sinning,
upon this account, to them, that make more
sins and duties then God hath made. The
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:48660:171"/>
doubt supposes <hi>Religion</hi> inconsistent with <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,</hi>
and that God were about to raze out
of the nature of man, one of the most radical,
and fundamental Laws written there, <hi>A desire
of blessedness.</hi> And supposes it, against the
expresse scope, and tenour of his whole Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-revelation.
For what doth that design,
but to bring men to blessedness? and how is it
a means to compass that design, but as it tends
to ingage mens spirits to design it too? unless
we would imagine they should go to heaven
blindfold; or be roll'd thither as stones, that
know not whether they are mov'd; in which
case the Gospel, that reveals the eternal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the way to it, were an useless thing. If
so express words had not been in the Bible,
as that <hi>Moses had respect to the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
yea, that our Lord Jesus himself for the
joy set before him, indured the Cross, &amp;c.</hi> this
had been a little more colourable, or more
modest.</p>
            <p>And what, do not all men in all the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
actions of their lives act, allowable enough,
with intuition to much lower ends? even
those <hi>particular ends,</hi> which the works of their
several callings tend to, else they should act as
bruites in every thing they do. And would
such a one scruple, if he were pining for want
of bread, to beg, or labour for it, <hi>for this end,
to be relieved.</hi> 'Tis the mistaking of the notion
of <hi>Heaven,</hi> that hath also an ingrediency into
this doubt (if it be really a doubt) what is
it a low thing to be <hi>filled with the Divine
fulness?</hi> to have his <hi>Glory replenishing our souls?</hi>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:48660:172"/>
to be perfectly freed from sin? in every
thing conformed unto this holy nature and
will? That our minding our interest in this,
or any affairs, should be the principal thing
with us, is not to be thought; our Supreme
end must be the same with his, who made all
things for himself, <hi>of whom, through whom, and
to whom all things are,</hi> that he alone might have
the glory. But subordinates need not quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.
A lower end doth not <hi>exclude,</hi> the
higher but <hi>serves</hi> it; and is, as to it, a means.
God is our end, as he is to <hi>glorified, and enjoyed
by us:</hi> our glorifying him is but the <hi>agnition of
his glory;</hi> which we do most in <hi>beholding, and
partaking it,</hi> which is therefore in direct sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
thereto.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>But it may further be doubted,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doubt. 3.</note> what if
it be acknowledged that these are both things pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and lawful; yet to what purpose will it be to
attempt any thing in this kind? O! what assurance
have I of success? is there any word of promise
for the encouragement of one in my case? or is
God under any obligation to reward the indeavours
of nature with special grace? wherefore, when I
have done all I can, he may with-hold his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,

to the weak strivings of a listless, distempered
spirit, not pleased with it self; aiming at a
better temper towards thee. I neglected
not thy prescribed means, onely that grace
which I could not challenge thou wast plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not to give; thou didst require what I must
confess my self to have owed thee; thou did'st
with-hold onely what thou owedst me not;
therefore must I yield my self a convicted
guilty wretch, and have nothing to say why
thy sentence should not pass. Or he that

hardenest thy heart to the most obstinate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
against his known Laws, did'st all the

was likely to become of thee, when thy place
on earth should know thee no more. Thou
might'st know thou wast at my mercy, thy
breath in my hand, and that I could easily
have cut thee off, any moment of that large
space of time, my patience allow'd thee in
the world. Yet thou never thought'st it
worthy the while to sue to me for thy life.
Destruction from the Lord was never a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
to thee. Thou would'st never be
brought upon thy knees, I had none of thy
addresses, never didst thou sigh out a serious
request for mercy: Thy soul was not worth so
much in thy account. Thy blood, wretch be
upon thy guilty head; <hi>Depart accursed into

Were it supposeable, that one who had done
as the former, should be left finally destitute of
Divine Grace, and perish. Yet, in which of

to be heard when they cry? <hi>But thou art a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
True, otherwise thou wert not without

would, at least, belong to thee. Yet experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

by promise onely; and that onely through Christ;
and how can it be communicated [thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

things are plain enough, if we make them not
intricate, or intangle our selves by foolish
subtilties. God promises sinners indefinitely
pardon, and eternal life for the sake of Christ,
on condition that they believe on him. He
gives of his good pleasure that grace whereby
he draws any to Christ, without promise <hi>dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
made to them,</hi> whether <hi>absolute,</hi> or <hi>conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;</hi>
though he give it for the sake of Christ
also. His discovery of his purpose to give such
grace to some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> indifinitely, amounts not to a
promise <hi>claimable by any,</hi> for if it be said to be
an <hi>absolute promise, to particular persons,</hi> who
are they? whose duty is it to believe it made
to him? If <hi>conditional,</hi> what are the conditions
upon which the first grace is <hi>certainly</hi> promised?
who can be able to assign them?</p>
            <p>But poor soul! thou need'st not stay to puzzle
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:48660:174"/>
thy self about this matter. <hi>God binds himself
to do what he promises; but hath he any
where bound himself to do no more?</hi> Did he
promise thee thy being; or that thou should'st
live to this day? did he promise thee the bread
that sustains thee, the daily comforts of thy life?
Yea, (what is nearer the present purpose)
did he promise thee a station under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel?
or that thou should'st ever hear the name
of Christ? if ever his Spirit have in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
mov'd upon thy heart, inclin'd thee at all
seriously to consider thy eternal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
did he beforehand make thee any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of that?</p>
            <p>A promise would give thee a <hi>full certainty of
the issue,</hi> if it were <hi>absolute</hi> out of hand? if <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional,</hi>
assoon as thou findest the condition
performed. But what, canst thou act upon no
lower rate then a <hi>foregoing certainty,</hi> a <hi>preassu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the event?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My friend, <hi>consider</hi> a little, (what thou canst not
but <hi>know already</hi>) that 'tis HOPE (built with
those that are rational, upon rational probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,

Sows; that the Crop will answer his cost, and
pains. Doth the Merchant <hi>foreknow,</hi> when
he Imbarques his goods, he shall have a safe,

the <hi>voluptuous, that his pleasures shall be always

they ever had a promise to ascertain them that
profaneness and sensuality would bring them
to Heaven? that an ungodly dissolute life
would end in blessedness? Here the Lord
knows men can be confident, and active
enough without a promise, and against many
an expresse threatning. Wilt thou not upon
the hope thou hast before thee, do as much
for thy soul, for eternal blessedness, as men
do for uncertain riches, short pleasures, an
airie soon-blasted name? yea as much as men
desperately do to damn themselves, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
their own swift destruction.</p>
            <p>Or canst thou pretend, though thou hast no
preassuming promise, thou hast no hope? Is
it nothing to have heard so much of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Nature? Is it suitable to the reports,
and discoveries he hath made of himself, to
let a poor wretch perish at his feet, that lies
prostrate there expecting his mercy? Did'st
thou ever hear he was so little a lover of
souls? Do his giving his Son, his earnest,

            <p>
               <q>How would'st thou judge of the like reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution?
If the Husbandman should say,

any took this course, and persisted with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
diligence, but they suceeded in it?</p>
            <p>What thou talkest of the <hi>freeness of Gods
grace,</hi> looks like an hypocritical pretence. Is
there no way to <hi>honour his grace,</hi> but by <hi>affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his authourity?</hi> but to sin, <hi>that grace may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound?</hi>
Sure grace will be better pleased by
obedience, than by such sacrifice. For a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
perishing wretch to use Gods means
to help it self, doth that look like merit? Is
the Beggar afraid thou should'st interpret his
coming to thy door, and seeking thy alms, to
signifie, as if he thought he had deserved them?
I hope thou wilt acknowledge thy self less then
the least of all Gods mercies, and that thou
canst not deserve from him a morsel of bread,
may'st thou not therefore, in thy necessity, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for thy living? least thou should'st in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench
upon the freeness of Divine bounty?
With as much wisdome, and reason, mightest
thou decline the use of all other means, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
thy life (which thou must owe always to
free mercy) to eat when thou art hungry, to
take physick when thou art sick, least thou
should'st intimate thy self to have merited the
strength, and health sought thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:48660:178"/>
Nor can I think of any rational pretence that
can more plausibly be insisted on, then these that
have been thus briefly discust. And it must needs
be difficult to bring any appearance of reason
for the patronage of so ill a cause, as the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
giving up of a mans soul to perish eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that is visibly capable of eternal blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
And certainly were we once apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
of the case, the attempt of disputing a
man into such a resolution, would appear
much more ridiculous, then, if one should
gravely urge arguments to all the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
to perswade them to burn their houses,
to put out their eyes, to kill their children, or
cut their own Throats. And sure, let all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
pretences be debated to the uttermost,
and it will appear that nothing with-holds
men from putting forth all their might in the
indeavour of getting a Spirit Suitable to this
blessedness, but an obstinately perverse, and
sluggish heart, dispoil'd, and naked of all shew
of reason, and excuse. And though that be a
hard task to reason against <hi>meer will,</hi> yet that
being the way to make men willing: and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

<hi>this direction:</hi> I shall recommend only some such
considerations as the Text it self will suggest,
for the stirring up, and perswading of slothful
reluctant hearts (chusing those as the most
proper limits, and not being willing to be
infinite, herein, as amidst so great a variety of
considerations to that purpose, one might.)</p>
            <p>That, in general, which I shall propose, shall

each <hi>consideration</hi> will be double, which I
shall now (rather glance at then) insist
upon.</p>
            <p>1. Consider then; if thou be found at last <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
unqualified for this blessedness; How wilt thou
bear it to be banish't eternally from the <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

thou. The wicked is driven away in his

            </p>
            <p>Again, what amazing Visions wilt thou have?
what gashly, frightful objects to converse with,
amidst those horrours of eternal darkness:
when the Devil, and his Angels shall be thy
everlasting associates! What direful images
shall those accursed, enraged Spirits, and thy
own fruitful parturient imagination for ever
entertain thee with, and present to thy
view?</p>
            <p>2. Is it a small thing with thee, to be desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of all those <hi>inherent excellencies,</hi> which the
perfected Image of God, whereof thou wast ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
comprehends? view them over in that
(too defective) account, some of the former
pages gave thee of them. Thou art none of
those bright stars, those sons of the morning,
those blessed glorified Spirits: Thou might'st
have been. But</p>
            <p>Consider, <hi>what art thou?</hi> what shalt thou
for ever be? what image or likeness shalt thou

bear; alas! poor wretch thou art now a Fiend!
conformed to thy hellish partners; thou bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<hi>their accursed likenesse.</hi> Death is now finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

reapest corruption.</hi> Thou art become a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Carcass; the Worms that never die, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in thy putrified, filthy soul. Thou hast
an Hell in thee. Thy venomous lusts are now
<hi>mature,</hi> are in their full grown state. If a
world of iniquity, a fulness of deadly poyson,
tempered by Hell fire, is <hi>here</hi> sometimes, to be
found in a <hi>little member,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 3. 6.</note> what will there then
be in all thy parts and powers;</p>
            <p>3. Consider, how blessed a satisfaction dost
thou lose? how pleasant, and delightful a <hi>rest,</hi>
arising both from the sight of so much glory,
and so peaceful a temper, and constitution of
Spirit? Here thou might'st have injoyed an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
undisturbed rest.</p>
            <p>But for <hi>rest,</hi> and <hi>satisfaction</hi> thou hast vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and endless torment, both by what thou
<hi>beholdest,</hi> and what thou <hi>feelest within thee.</hi> Thy
dreadful visions will not let thee <hi>rest;</hi> but the
chief matter of thy disquiet, and torment, is in
the very <hi>temper,</hi> and <hi>composition</hi> of thy soul. Thy
horrid lusts are fuller of poysonous energie,
and are destitute of their wonted objects,
whence they turn all their power, and fury up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thy miserable self. Thy inraged passions
would fly in the face of God, but they spend
themselves in tormenting the soul that bred
them. Thy curses, and blasphemies, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venom'd
Darts, pointed at Heaven, are rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated,
and driven back into thy own heart.
And therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:48660:179"/>
4. Consider what awaking hast thou? Thou
awakest not into the mild, and chearful light
of that blessed day, wherein the Saints of the
most High, hold their solemn, joyful triumph.</p>
            <p>But thou awakest into that great and terrible
day of the Lord (dost thou desire it for what
end is it to thee?) a day of darkness, <hi>and not
light;</hi> a gloomy, and a stormy day. <hi>The day
of thy birth</hi> is not a more <hi>hateful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> then this is a
<hi>dreadful</hi> day. Thou awakest, and art beset
with terrours, presently apprehended, and
drag'd before thy glorious, severe Judge: and
thence into eternal torments. O happy thou,
might'st thou never awake, might the grave
conceale, and its <hi>more silent darkness</hi> cover thee
for ever. But since thou must awake, then,
how much more happy wert thou, if thou
would'st suffer thy self to be awaken'd now.
What, to lose, and endure so much, because
thou wilt not now a little bestir thy self, and
look about thee? Sure thy Conscience tells
thee, thou art urg'd but to what is <hi>possible,</hi> and
<hi>lawful,</hi> and <hi>hopeful,</hi> and <hi>necessary,</hi> methinks, if
thou be a man, and not a stone; if thou hast a
reasonable Soul about thee, thou shalt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
fall to work, and rather spend thy days in
serious thoughts, and prayers, and tears, than
run the hazard of losing sotranscendent a glory,
and of suffering misery, which, as <hi>now</hi> thou art

of which the Apostle here speaks is (as may

What we expect should be one day perfect, we
must labour may be, in the mean time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
growing.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Our knowledge of God.</hi> The knowledge of
him I here principally intend is not <hi>notional,</hi>
and <hi>speculative,</hi> but (which is more ingredient
to our blessedness, both inchoate and perfect)
that <hi>of converse,</hi> that <hi>familiar knowledge,</hi> which
we usually express by the name of <hi>acquaintance.</hi>
See that this knowledge of him be encreased
daily; Let us now use our selves much with
God: Our knowledge of him must aim at
<hi>conformity to him,</hi> and how powerful a thing is
<hi>converse</hi> in order hereto? How insensibly is it
wont to transform men, and mould anew their
Spirits, Language, Garbe, Deportment?
To be remov'd from the <hi>solitude,</hi> or <hi>rudeness</hi>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:48660:181"/>
of the Country, to a <hi>City,</hi> or <hi>University;</hi> What

way to be <hi>heavenly,</hi> with <hi>God</hi> the way to be
<hi>God-like.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us therefore make this our present busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
much to <hi>acquaint our selves with God.</hi> We
count upon seeing him <hi>face to face,</hi> of being
alwayes in his presence, beholding his glory
that speaketh very intimate acquaintance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.

the glory of Gods face, &amp;c.</hi> 'tis easie to apprehend,
then <hi>his way</hi> must needs have in it a <hi>growing

(to us) an increase of light from it. We should

our selves to him. His Gospel aims at this to
make those that were <hi>afar off nigh.</hi> Far-distant

can give us little account of a person that hath
only seen him afar off; so God beholds the
proud afar off. That is, he will have no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with them. Whereas with the
humble he will be familiar,<note place="margin">Isa. 57. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>he will dwell,</hi> (as in

our own intimate acquaintance; when such

            <p>This you see is the initial leading thing in
this blessedness of heaven. So it must have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a prime ingrediency into our heaven on
earth. It is a part of celestial blessedness;
but it is not <hi>peculiar</hi> to it. The present bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
the righteous injoy here is a partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of heaven. It hath something in it of
every thing that is ingredient into that <hi>perfect
blessedness.</hi> Our present knowledge of God is
often exprest by <hi>vision,</hi> or sight, as we have
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:48660:184"/>
had occasion to observe in many passages of
Scripture. He hath given us such a visive
power and made it connatural to that heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
creature begotten of him in all the true sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of this blessedness.<note place="margin">1 John 5. 19, 20.</note> We know that we
are <hi>of God,</hi> and presently it follows, he hath
g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ven us an <hi>understanding to know him,</hi> that is
true. This new man is not born blind. The
blessed God himself is become liable to the
view of his regenerate intellectual eye, clarify'd
and fill'd with vigour and Spirit from himself.
He therefore that hath made (that hath new
formed) this eye shall not he be seen by it? shall
not we turn it upon him? Why do we not
more frequently bless our eye, with that sight?
This Object (though of so high excellency
and glory) will not hurt but perfect, and
strengthen it. They are refreshing vital beams
that issue from it. Sure we have no excuse
that we eye God so little, <hi>i. e.</hi> that we mind
him no more. Why have we so few thoughts
of him in a day? What, to let so much time
pass, and not spare him a look? a thought?
Do we intend to imploy our selves on eternity
in the visions of God, and is our present a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
from him, and intention upon vanity,
our best preparation thereto? This loudly
calls for redress. Shall God be waiting all the
day as on purpose to catch our eye? to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a look? and we studiously decline him,
and still look another way, as of choice? and
what is it but choice? can we pretend a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
to forget him all the day? How cheap
is the expence of a look? how little would it
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:48660:184"/>
cost us, and yet how much of duty might it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
how much of comfort and joy might it
bring into us?</p>
            <p>How great is our offence and loss that we
live not in such more constant views of God?
Herein we sin and suffer both at once (things
both very unsuitable to heaven.) Mindfulness
of God is the living Spring of all holy and
pleasant affections and deportments towards
him; sets all the wheels agoing, makes the
soul as the Chariots of <hi>Aminadab.</hi> These
wheels have their eyes also, are guided by a
mind, by an intellectual principle. Knowing
intelligent beings (as we also are by partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
and according to our measure) so act
mutually towards one another. We cannot
move towards God but with an <hi>open</hi> eye seeing
him, and our way towards him. If we close
our eyes, we stand still, or blindly run another
course, we know not whither. All sin is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
whether it be <hi>neglect of good,</hi> or <hi>doing of
evil.</hi> Its way is a way of darkness; as a course
of holy motion is <hi>walking in the light.</hi> Our
shutting our eyes towards God creates that
darkness; surrounds us with a darkness com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
of all sin. Now is every thing of
enjoyned duty waved, and any evil done, that
sinful nature prompts us to. Well might it be
said,<note place="margin">John 3. 11.</note> 
               <hi>He that sinneth hath not seen God.</hi> When
we have made our selves this darkness, we fall
of course under Sathans Empire, and are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
within his Dominions. He is the Prince
of darkness; and can rule us now at his will.
Perishing lost souls are such as in them the God
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:48660:185"/>
of this world hath blinded their minds.—To
open their eyes and turn them from darkness
to light, is to turn them also from the power
of Sathan unto God. What an hell of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
are we brought into in the twinkling of
an eye! We are without God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the world,
as if a man wink, though at noon-day, he hath
as it were put out the Sun, 'tis with him as if
there were no such thing. When we have
banished God out of our sight, and forgotten
him, 'tis with us as if there were <hi>no God.</hi> If
such a state grow habitual to us, (as we know
every sinful aversion of our eye from God
tends thereto) what wickedness is there that
will not lurk in this darkness? How often in
Scripture is <hi>forgetting God</hi> used as a <hi>character,</hi>
yea as paraphrase, a full (though summary)
expression of sin in general? As if the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the malignity, the very hell it self of <hi>sin,</hi>
were wholly included (and not connated only)
here. <hi>Now consider this</hi> (after so dreadful an
ennumeration, so black a Catalogue) <hi>all that
forget God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 50.</note> And (as deep calleth to deep, one
hell to another) <hi>The wicked shall be turned into
hell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 9.</note> 
               <hi>and all the people that forget God.</hi> That keep
that mass of wickedness, of pride, of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
cursing, blasphemy, deceit, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
all <hi>meet with one that hath not God in all
his thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But who is so hardy to look the holy God in
the face and sin against him? what an astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is it when he <hi>watches over</hi> present sin; or
brings forth <hi>former sins</hi> out of secret darkness
and sets them in the light of his countenance?
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:48660:185"/>
Who that understands any thing of the Nature,
and Majesty of God, dare call him for a witness
of his sinning? The worst of men would find
themselves under some restraint, could they
but abtain of themselves to sit down sometimes
and <hi>solemnly think of God.</hi> Much more would
it prove an advantage, (them whom I most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend)
to such as sin within the nearer call, and
reach of mercy; that sin not to the utmost lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
Even such as lead the strictest lives, and are
seldom found to transgress, are not their sins
found to begin with forgetting God? Did they
eye God more, would they not sin lesse fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
and with greater regret? You his
Saints that have made a Covenant with him by
Sacrifice, that profess the greatest love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votedness
to him, and seem willing your selves
to become sacrifices, and lay down your lives
for his sake; what is it a harder thing to give
him a look, a thought? or is it not too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
a thing, without necessity (and then not
without injury) to withhold these from him?
Let us bethink our selves, are not the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
distempers of our Spirits, and disorders yet
observable in our lives to be refer'd hither?
<hi>As to enjoyned services,</hi> what; should we venture
on omissions, if we had God in our eye? or
serve him with so declining backward hearts?
Should we dare to let pass a day, in the Even
whereof we might write down <hi>nothing done for
God this day?</hi> Or should we serve him as an hard
Master, with sluggish, despondent Spirits?
The Apostle forbids servants to serve with eye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
service, as men-pleasers, meaning they should
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:48660:186"/>
eye men less, and God more. Sure, <hi>as to him,</hi>
our service is not enough <hi>eye-service.</hi> We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably,
eye men more than we should, but we
do not eye Him enough. Hence such hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of hands, such feebleness of knees, such
laziness, and indifferency, so little of an active
zeal, and laborious diligence, so little <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency
of Spirit in serving the Lord.</hi> Hence also
such an aversion to hazardous services, such
fear of attempting any thing (though never so
apparent important Duty) that may prove
costly, or hath danger in it. <hi>We look not to him
that is invisible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as to forbidden things,</hi> should we be so
proud, so passionate, so earthly, so sensual,
if we had God more in view? Should we so
much seek our selves, and indulge our own
wills, and humors, drive a design with such
solicitude, and intention of mind, for our
private interests? should we walk at such a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and more consult our own inclination
than our rule, allow our selves in so much
vanity of conversation, did we mind God as we
ought?</p>
            <p>And do we not sensibly punish our selves
in this neglect? what a dismal Chaos is this
world while we see not God in it. To live
destitute of a divine presence, to discern no
beam of the heavenly glory. To go up and
down day by day, and perceive nothing of
God, no glimmering, no appearance; this is
<hi>disconsolate,</hi> as well as <hi>sinful</hi> darkness. What
can we make of Creatures, what of the daily
events of Providence, if we see not in them the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:48660:186"/>
glory of a Deity; if we do not contemplate,
and adore the divine wisedom, power, and
goodness, diffused every where. Our practical
Atheism, and inobservance of God makes the
World become to us the <hi>region and shadow of
death,</hi> states us as among Ghosts, and Spectres,
makes all things look with a ghastly face, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints
death upon every thing we see, encircles
us with gloomy dreadful shades, and with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
apparitions. To behold the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Spectacles alwayes in view, the violent
lusts, the rapine and rage of some, the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous
suffrings, the miseries, and ruines of
others, to hear every corner resounding
with the insultations of the Oppressor, and the
mournful groans of the oppressed, what a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
continuing death were it to be in the world
<hi>without God!</hi> At the best all things were but a
<hi>vanishing scheme,</hi> an Image seen in the dark.
The Creation, a thing, the fashion whereof
were passing away. The whole Contexture,
and System of Providence were meer confusion,
without the least concinnity or order. Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

What, <hi>to wink</hi> our selves into so much dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and desolation? And by sealing up our
eyes against the divine light and glory, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
so formidable miseries upon our own souls?
how dreadfully, shall we, herein, revenge our
own folly in nullifying him to our selves, <hi>who is
the All in All?</hi> Sure there is little of Heaven
in all this?</p>
            <p>But if now we open our eyes upon that all-comprehending
glory, apply them to a steady
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:48660:187"/>
intuition of God; how heavenly a life shall
we then live in the world! To have God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in view as the director and end of all our
actions. To make our eye crave leave of God;
to consult him ere we adventure upon any
thing, and implore his guidance, and blessing.
Upon all occasions to direct our prayers to him
and <hi>look up.</hi> To make our eye await his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
look, ready to receive all intimations
of his will; this is an angelical life. To be as
those ministers of his that are alwayes ready to
do his pleasure. To make our eye do him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
and expresse our dependence, and trust.
To approve our selves in every thing to him,
and act as alwayes in his presence, observing
still how his eye observes us; and exposing our
selves willingly to its inspection and search;
contented alwayes he should see through and
through us. Surely there is much of heaven
in this life, so we should endeavour to live

no evil. But so interprets and comments upon
his severer aspects, whether through his Law

            </p>
            <p>Certain it is, that the Sacred Oracles of the
Gospel set before us a more excellent pattern,
and speak things not less magnificent, but
much more modest, and perspicuous. With
less pomp of words, they give us a much clearer
account of a far more excellent temper of mind,
and prescribe the direct, and certain way of
attaining it (Do but view over the many passages
of Scripture occasionally glanc't at <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:48660:191"/>
But we grope as in the dark for blessedness,
we stumble at noon day, as in the night, and
wander as if we had no eyes; we mistake our
business, and lay the Scene of an happy state at
a great distance from us, in things which we
cannot reach, and which if we could, it were
to little purpose.</p>
            <p>Not to speak of grosser sensualists (whom
at present I have less in my eye.) Is there not
a more refined sort of persons, that neglecting
the great business of inspecting, and labouring
to better, and improve their spirits; are wholly
taken up about the affairs of another Sphere?
that are more solicitous for <hi>better times,</hi> for a
better world, then better spirits. That seem
to think all the happiness they are capable of
on earth, is bound up in this, or that exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
state of things. Not that the care of all
publique concernments should be laid aside.
Least of all a just solicitude for the Churches
welfare; but that should not be pretended,
when our own interest is the <hi>one thing</hi> with us.
And when we are <hi>really solicitous</hi> about the
Churches interests, we should state them
aright. God designs the afflictions of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for their Spiritual good, therefore that is
a much greater good, then their exemption
from suffering these evils; otherwise, his
means should eat up his end, and be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive
then <hi>that</hi> will countervail; which were
an imprudence, no man of tolerable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
would be guilty of. We should desire
the outward prosperity of <hi>Sion</hi> for, it is a <hi>real
good;</hi> but in as much as it hath in it the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:48660:191"/>
not of an <hi>end,</hi> but onely (and that but
sometimes neither) of <hi>a means;</hi> not a constant,
but a mutable goodness; not a principal, but a
lesser subordinate goodness; we must not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
it <hi>absolutely,</hi> nor <hi>chiefly,</hi> but with submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
limited desires. If our hearts are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to hear of the <hi>sufferings</hi> of the Church of
God in the world, but not of their <hi>sins;</hi> If
we more sensibly regret at any time, the
persecutions, and opressions they undergo,
than their spiritual distempers, their <hi>earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
pride, cold love to God, fervent animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
towards each other; It speaks an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
carnal mind. We take no right mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the interests of Religion, or the
Churches welfare, and do most probably mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
our selves, as much in judging of our
own; and measure theirs by our own mistaken
model.</p>
            <p>And this is the mischievous cheat many put
upon their own souls, and would obtrude (too
often) upon others too; that overlooking the
great design of the Gospel to transform mens
spirits, and change them into the Divine like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
they think 'tis Religion enough to espouse
a party, and adopt an Opinion; and then
vogue themselves friends to Religion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the measure of their zeal for their
own party or Opinion. And give a very pregnant
proof of that zeal by magnifying, or inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against the times, according as they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
or frown upon their empty, unspirited
Religion. It being indeed such (a secret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness
whereof they herein bewray) as
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:48660:192"/>
hath no other <hi>life</hi> in it, then what it owes to
external favour, and countenance. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all publique rebukes are justly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>mortal</hi> to it: whereas that <hi>substantial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
that adequately answers the design, and
is animated by the Spirit of the Gospel, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesses
the Souls of them that own it, with a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
confidence that it can live in any times,
and hold their Souls in life also. Hence they
go on their way with a free, unsolicitous chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness;
enjoying silently in their own bosomes
that repose, and rest which <hi>naturally</hi> results
from a sound, and well composed temper of
Spirit. They know their happiness depends

they are driven out of all other possessions.

            <p>They cannot live in bad times. They car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that about them that will make the worst
days good to them. Surely they can never be
happy in the best times, that cannot be so in
any. Outward prosperity is quite besides the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:48660:192"/>
purpose to a distempered Soul, when nothing
else troubles, it will torment it self. Besides,
we cannot command at pleasure, the benigne
aspects of the world, the smiles of the times;
we may wait a lifes time, and still find the same
adverse posture of things towards us from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.
What dotage is it to place our blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in something to us <hi>impossible,</hi> that lies
wholly out of our power: nd in order whereto
we have nothing to <hi>do,</hi> but sit down and wish;

We cannot change times, and seasons; nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the course of the world, create new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,

our selves mock't, if God should command us
these things, in order to our being happy?
'Tis not our business, these are not the affairs

and wrought into our own spirits, so as to have
the complacential rellish, and savour of its
Goodness, Excellency, and Pleasantness diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
thorow our souls. Where, remember,
this was written to such as were supposed Saints;
whence it must be understood of a continued,
progressive transformation, <hi>a renewing of the
inward man day by day</hi> (as is the Apostles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
elsewhere.) 'Tis a more perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the impress of God, revealing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:48660:193"/>
in the Gospel; the growth and tendency
of the New Creature, begotten unto the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
blessedness, towards its mature, and most
perfect state, and stature in the fruition
thereof.</p>
            <p>And 'tis this I am now pressing, in as much
as some account hath been already given (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as we can now imperfectly guesse at it,
and spell it out) what the constitution of the
holy soul is, in its glorified state, when it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
partakes the Divine likeness; that when
we find in our selves any principles, and first
elements of that blessed frame, we would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
the gradual improvement thereof;
and be making towards that perfection. This
therefore being our present work; let it be
remembred wherein that participated likeness
of God hath been said to consist; and labour
now the nearest approach to that pitch and
state. Your measures must be taken from
what is most perfect, come now as near it as
you can,<note place="margin">Epictet.</note> and as that <hi>Pagans</hi> advice is; <q>If yet
thou art not <hi>Socrates,</hi> however, live as one
that would fain be <hi>Socrates.</hi>
               </q> Though yet thou
art not perfect, live as one that aims at it, and
would be so.</p>
            <p>Onely, it must be considered, <hi>that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to God,</hi> of our <hi>present state, is in extent
larger,</hi> and more comprehensive, then that of
our <hi>future;</hi> though it be unspeakably less per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in degree. For there is no Moral Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
(that we have any present knowledge
of) belonging to our glorified state, which
is not in some degree, necessarily, to be found
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:48660:194"/>
in Saints on earth; But there are some things
which the exigency of our present state makes
necessary to us, <hi>here,</hi> which will not be so in the
state of glory. Repentance, Faith, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
the Mediatour; patience of injuries,
pity to the distressed, &amp;c. These things, and
whatsoever else, whose objects cease, must be
understood to cease with them. In short, <hi>here</hi>
is requisite all that Moral good, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
both our <hi>end,</hi> and <hi>way; there,</hi> what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
our <hi>end</hi> onely.</p>
            <p>Yet is the whole compass of that gracious
frame of spirit, requisite in this our present
state, all comprehended <hi>in conformity to God.</hi>
Partly, in as much as some of these graces which
will cease hereafter, in their exercise, as not
having objects to draw them forth into act;
have their pattern in some communicable At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
of God, which will cease also, as to
their denomination and exercise; their objects
then ceasing too; as his patience towards sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
his mercy to the miserable: Partly, in
as much as other of those graces now required
in us, though they correspond to nothing in
God that is capable of the same name, as <hi>Faith
in a Saviour,</hi> Repentance of sin (which can
have no place in God.) They yet answer to
something in this nature, that goes under other
names; and is the reason wherefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
such things in us. He hath in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that faithfulness, and All sufficient fulness
that challenges our faith; and that hatred of
sin, which challenges <hi>our</hi> repentance for it,
having been guilty of it. His very nature ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:48660:194"/>
him to require those things from us, the
state of our case being considered. So that the
summe even of our present duty lies in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this entire impression of the Divine like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
(in some part invariably, and eternally
necessary to us, in some part necessary with
respect to our present state) And herein is our
present blessedness also involved. If therefore
we have any design to better our condition in
point of blessedness, it must be our business
to endeavour after a fuller participation of all
that likeness, in all the particulars it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends.
You can pitch your thoughts upon
no part of it, which hath not an evident, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
tendency to the repose and rest of your
spirits. I shall recommend onely some few
instances; that you may see how little reason,
or inducement a soul conformed to the holy
will of God, hath to seek its comforts and
content elsewhere.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith</hi> corresponds to the <hi>Truth</hi> of God;

            <p>
               <hi>It corresponds to his goodnesse;</hi> as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects

us!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repentance</hi> is that by which we <hi>become like</hi>
the holy God; to whom our sin had made us
most unlike before; how sweet are kindly
relentings? penetential tears? and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of the Soul to its God? and to a right

to let our Souls dissolve here! and slow into

            <p>Our <hi>Fear</hi> corresponds to his <hi>Excellent
Greatnesse;</hi> and is not (as it is a part of the

passion; but a due respectfulness, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
of God; and there is no mean
pleasure in that holy, awful seriousness, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
or) the things wherein consists that our
conformity to the divine Nature and Will
which is proper to our present state. And now,
who can estimate the blessedness of such a soul?
Can (in a word) the state of that soul be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy?
that is full of the Holy Gost, full of
Love, Joy, Peace, Long-suffering, Gentleness,
Goodness, Faith, Meekness, Temperance, those
blessed fruits of that blessed Spirit. Blessedness
is connaturalized unto this soul: Every thing
doth its part, and all conspire to make it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
This soul is a <hi>Temple</hi> an habitation of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness:
here dwells a Deity in his glory. 'Tis
a Paradise, a Garden of God. Here he walks
and converses daily, delighted with its fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
fruitfulness. He that hath those things
and aboundeth is not barren or unfruitful in
the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus:
he is the Sun, and the knowledge of him, the
quickening beams that cherish and ripen these
fruits.</p>
            <p>But the soul that lacketh these things is a
Desart, a habitation of Devils. Here is stupid,
disconsolate infidelity, inflexible obstinacy,
and resolvedness for Hell; Hatred and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Sovereign Majesty; whom yet,
its secret misgiving thoughts tell it, will be
too hard for it at last. Here is swoln pride,
and giddy vain-glory, disguised hypocrisie,
and pining envy, raging wrath, and ravenous
avarice, with what you can imagine besides,
leading to misery and desolation.</p>
            <p>You have then some prospect of a happy

temper of Spirit.<note place="margin">Philosophia di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viditur in haec <hi>Scientiam,</hi> &amp; <hi>habitum ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi,</hi> unam <hi>illam</hi> qui didicit &amp; facienda ac vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanda percepit nondum sapiens est, nisi in ea quae didicit ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ejus trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuratus est. <hi>Sen.</hi> (ex A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippâ) <hi>Ep.</hi> 94.</note> It can now be no difficulty

            <p>1. Be very careful that this <hi>living Image</hi>
(such you have been formerly told it is) may
<hi>grow equally,</hi> in every part. See that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of this likeness be <hi>entire;</hi> that it be not
a maimed thing, if it be, God will never own
it as his production. <hi>Integrity</hi> is the glory of
a Christian: To be <hi>entire lacking nothing.</hi> This
is the <hi>soundness</hi> of heart that excludes a blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
consciousness, and misgiving; exempts it
from the fear of a <hi>shameful discovery.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 6. 80.</note> 
               <hi>Let my

<hi>by having respect to all Gods commandments;</hi> To
which is opposite, that being <hi>partial in the Law</hi>
spoken of by the Prophet<note n="*" place="margin">Mal. 2. 9.</note> by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
concerning the Priests of that time. A
thing hateful in the eye of God; and as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable

            <p>
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:48660:197"/>
And see that it be preserved entire by a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional,</hi>
and <hi>uniform growth,</hi> that fresh life
and motion may daily appear in every Limb of
this heavenly new Creature. How odious a
deformity is it, when a <hi>shew</hi> of <hi>moral vertues</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
<hi>Godliness?</hi> And how much more odious
(in as much as there is more impudent fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
in it, and more of dishonourable reflexion
upon God) when under an high pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ence of

<hi>immorality?</hi> What, to be oppressive, envious,

Person, that shall have no fairer representation
of Christianity, than such do give, would not
be ready to say rather, <hi>Sit anima mea cum Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophis;</hi>
If this be Christian Religion, give me
honest Paganism. A Christian that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the proper, uniform, entire impresse of
the Gospel of Christ, is the most meek, mild,
calm, harmless, quiet thing in the world. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
mention so venerable a name, if you will
not be very jealous of the honour of it; will
you give God occasion to charge you? <hi>Wretch
I never had had this dishonour, if thou h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dst never
been call'd a Christian; thou art a Christian to no
purpose, or to very bad; it does thee no good, and it
injures me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (which is more directly considerable as
to our present purpose) the neglect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
decay, of any gracious principle, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
a <hi>languor,</hi> a consumption, and enfeeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all. Any such perverse disposition
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:48660:198"/>
doth not affect that part only; is not onely an
impairment to the contrary gracious principle,
but (as a Cancer in some exteriour part of the

Can the love of God live and grow in an
unquiet, angry, uncharitable breast? Consider
<hi>Jam. 1. 26. 1 John</hi> 3. 17.</p>
            <p>2. Be constantly intent upon this business
of spiritual growth. Mind it as a design, make
a solemn purposed business of it, your great
daily business; you do not till your ground by
chance, as a casual thing; but you do it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously,
and of set purpose. The Apostle
speaking of his own method of pursuing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to Christ,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> tells us, he did first, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,
count all things else loss and dogs meat;
he threw every thing else aside.<note place="margin">8, 9, 10.</note> Then next he
recounts with himself <hi>how far short he was. N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as if I had already attained,</hi> &amp;c. (where, by the
way he intimates, that to stand still and give
over further endeavours, implyes that gross
absurdity, as if we thought our selves to have
attained already, to be already perfect; are
we not ashamed to seem so conceited of our
selves?)<note place="margin">V. 12, 13.</note> and then <hi>still, as he did attain in this
pursuit, he forgot it not;</hi> but held on his course
with fresh and constant vigor, still reaching
forth, and pressing onwards towards his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
mark.</p>
            <p>In this great business we (alas) seem to
dream. He that hath been observed ten or
twenty years ago to be proud, and covetous,
or passionate, still remains so, and we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
not the incongruity of it. What alwayes
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:48660:198"/>
learning, and yet never come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the truth? as it is in Jesus to the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off the old man, and putting on the new?
who would meddle with any profession upon
such tearms to be alwayes doing, and yet to do
nothing? Surely it must be imputed to this, we
design not; we do not seriously intend the
perfecting of holiness, to make a real progress
in our way and work, and to get still nearer
heaven, as we draw nearer to the end of our
dayes here on earth. We too contentedly
confine our selves within certain limits, and
aim not as we should, at a spiritual excellency.
This is the temper of many that have long
troden the path of (at least an external) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
they will go but their own pace, and

What is equally distant from being the
matter, either of praise or punishments is upon
no tearms to be accounted Vertue.</p>
            <p>At least we drive not on a design of growth,
and self improvement in our spiritual states
with that constancy we ought; we are off, and
on; our Spirits are not steadily intent. <hi>We
are unstable as water,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 49. 4.</note> 
               <hi>how can we excel?</hi> God
hath not put us, sure, upon so fruitless a task,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:48660:199"/>
wherein our utmost labour and diligence shall
profit nothing. Therefore strive more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously,
and pray with more earnest importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Consider, and plead it with God, that
he hath set before thee the hope of such a state,
when thou art to be perfectly like him; and
shalt thou (that must hereafter be like God)
be now like a clod of earth. Thou art now a
Child begotten of him, and though thou art
yet in thy minority, yet may not somewhat be
spared out of so fair an estate, hereafter design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for thee; as that thou mayest now live
worthy of such a Father, and suitably to thy
expected inheritance?</p>
            <p>3. And now, a contented satisfied temper
of Spirit, as I have told you, results from the
other two; and will therefore follow of
course, upon growing knowledge of God, and
conformity to Him, as the latter of these also
doth, upon the former. Yea, 'tis a part of our
conformity to God; but a part consequent to
the impression of the things mentioned under
the former head (as knowledge also is a part
previous and antecedent thereto) Tis in the
state of glory, we see something superadded.
The <hi>likeness</hi> imprest, is presupposed; <hi>Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
follows thereupon. The case is so too in
our present state, Contentment is spoken of as a
thing consequent and superadded. <hi>Godliness</hi>
with <hi>Contentment;</hi> a satisfied, contented Spirit,
when 'tis the result of Godliness (of the divine
image imprest) is indeed great gain. Yet</p>
            <p>As to this I shall only say these two things.</p>
            <p>1. Be distinct and explicite in the proposal
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:48660:199"/>
of it as an end. Religion doth not brutify men
but make them more rational. Its business is
to guide them to blessedness. It must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
pitch their eyes upon it, as the mark and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> they are to aim at, and hold them intent
there. 'Tis ingenuous, and honourable to God
that we should expresly avow it, we come to
Him for satisfaction to our Spirits, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whether else to apply our selves. We turn
our eyes upon Him, we lay open our souls to
receive impressions from Him, for this very
end. This is an explicit acknowledment of
Him as God; our highest, Soveraign good.</p>
            <p>2. Actually apply and accommodate divine
visions and communications to this purpose.
<q>Say, O my Soul; now come solace thy self
in this appearance of God; come take thy
allowed pleasure in such exertions of God as
thou dost now experience in thy self.</q> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
thy happiness; think how great it is;
how rich thou art, on purpose that thy Spirit
may grow more, daily, into a satisfied contented
frame. Often bethink thy self, <hi>What is the
great God doing for me! that he thus reveals, and
imparts himself to my soul; O how great things do
those present pledges presignisie to me!</hi> That thou
may'st still more and more like thy portion, and
account it faln in pleasant places, so as never
to seek satisfaction in things of another kind;
though thou must still continue expecting and
desiring more of the same kind.</p>
            <p>And remember to this purpose there cannot
be a greater participation of the misery of
hell before-hand, than <hi>a discontented Spirit
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:48660:200"/>
perpetually restless, and weary of it self;</hi> nor of
the blessedness of heaven, than <hi>in a well-pleased,

            <p>That is; that <hi>forgetting what is behind,</hi> we
reach forth not only to what is <hi>immediately</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us; the next step to be taken; but that
our eye and desire, aim forward at the ultimate
period of our race terminate upon the eternal
glory it self; and that not only as a <hi>measure;</hi>
according to which we would some way <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
our present attainments,</hi> but at the very
<hi>mark, which (it self) we would fain hit and reach

            <p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:48660:200"/>
And that this be not only the <hi>habitual bent,
and tendency of our Spirits;</hi> but that we keep
up such desires, in <hi>frequent</hi> (and as much as is
possible) <hi>continual exercise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, and that such actual desires be not only
faint, and sluggish wishes, but full of lively
efficacy, and vigour; in some measure propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to our last end, and highest good;
beyond, and above which we neither <hi>esteem,</hi>
nor <hi>expect</hi> any other enjoyment.</p>
            <p>Whatsoever we may possibly attain to here,
we should still be far from projecting to our
selves a state of <hi>rest</hi> on this side <hi>consummate glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
but still urge our selves to a continual as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;
so as to mount above, not onely all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
of any other kind, but all degrees
of enjoyment in this kind, that are beneath
perfection.</p>
            <p>Still it must be remembred, this is not the
state of our final rest. The Mass of Glory is
yet in reserve, we are not yet so high as the
highest Heavens.</p>
            <p>If we gain but the top of Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> we
are apt to say, <hi>'tis good to be here,</hi> and forget
the longer journey yet before us; loath to
think of a further advance; when, were our
spirits right, how far so ever we may suppose
our selves to have attained, it would be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of continual joy to us to think high perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are still attainable; that we are yet ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of greater things, then what we have
hitherto compast; our souls can yet compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
more. Nature intends what is most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in every Creature; methinks the Divine
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:48660:201"/>
Nature in the New Creature, should not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
lower, or cease aspiring, till it have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
its ultimate perfection, its culmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
point; till Grace turn into Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore Christians bestir our selves,
let us open, and turn our eyes upon the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
glory.</hi> Lets view it well, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of our own souls, why are our desires
so faint and slothful? why do they so seldom
pierce through the interveining distance, and
reach home to what they prefessedly level at?
so rarely touch this blessed mark? How can
we forbear to be angry with our selves, that so
glorious an end should not more powerfully
attract? that our hearts should not more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
find themselves drawn? and all the
powers of the soul beset on work, by the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
power of that glory?</p>
            <p>It certainly concerns us not to sit still, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
so manifest a distemper. But if the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal</hi>
of the object; the <hi>discourse</hi> (all this
while) of this blessed state, do not move us
to make some further trials with our selves, see
what urging and reasoning with our souls;
what rubbing and chasing our hearts will do.
And there is a two fold trial we may in this
kind make upon our spirits. What the sense
of <hi>shame</hi> will work with us, whether our hearts
cannot be made sensible to suppose how <hi>vile,</hi>
and wretched a temper it is <hi>to be undesirous of
glory.</hi> And then what sense of <hi>praise</hi> can effect, or
what impression it may make upon us to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>excellency,</hi> and worth, the high reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:48660:201"/>
of that temper, &amp; posture of soul, which
I am now perswading to <hi>[a continual desirous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of that blessed glorious state.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. As to the former. Let us bethink our
selves, can we answer it to God, or to our own
souls; that we should indulge our selves in a
continual negligence of our eternal blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
A blessedness, consisting in the Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Participation of the Divine Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?</p>
            <p>Have we been dreaming all this while, that
God hath been revealing to us this glorious
state? and setting this lovely prospect before
our eyes? Did it become us not to open our
eyes, while he was opening Heaven to us, and
representing the state which he designed to
bring us to? or will we say we have seen it,
and yet desire it not? Have we been deaf and
dead, while he hath been calling us into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
glory? have all our senses been bound up
all this while? Hath he been speaking all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to sensless Statues, to Stocks, and Stones,
while he expected reasonable, living souls
should have received the voice, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
an obedient, complying answer? And
what answer could be expected to such a call,
(a call to his Glory) below this. <hi>We desire it
Lord, we would fain be there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if, we say we have not been all this
while a sleep, we saw the light that shone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, we heard the voice that called to us;
wherewith shall we then excuse our selves, that
our desires were not mov'd? that our Souls
were not presently in a flame? was it then that
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:48660:202"/>
we thought all a meer fixion? that we durst not
give credit to his word, when it brought us
the report of the everlasting Glory? will we
avow this? Is this that we will stand by? or
what else have we left to say? have we a more
plausible reason to alledge, that the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of such a glory mov'd us not to desire it;
then that we believed it not? sure this is the
truth of our case. We should feel this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
fire alwayes burning in our breasts, If
our Infidelity did not quench the coal. If we
did believe, we could not but desire. But doth
not the thoughts of this shake our very souls,
and fill us with horrour, and trembling? We
that should be turn'd into indignation, and
ready to burn our selves with our own flame,
and all about us, if one should give us the lie;
that we should dare to put the lye upon the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Truth!</hi> upon him whose Word gave sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and being to the world, who made and
sustains all things by it. <hi>That awful Word!</hi> That
Word that shivers Rocks, and melts down
Mountains, that make the inanimate Creation
tremble, that cna in a moment blast all things,
and dissolve the frame of Heaven and Earth,
(which in the mean time it upholds) is that
become with us fabulous, lying breath? Those
God-breath'd Oracles, those Heavenly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
which discover, and describe this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
state, are they false and foolish Legends;
must that be pretended at last (if men durst)
that is so totally void of all pretence? what
should be the gain or advantage accrewing to
that Eternal, All-sufficient being. What
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:48660:202"/>
accession should be made to that infinite self-fulness
by deluding a Worm? Were it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with his <hi>Nature,</hi> what could be his <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi>
to put a cheat upon poor mortal dust? If
thou dare not impute it to <hi>him;</hi> such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
had a beginning, but what Author
canst thou imagine of it? or what end? did it
proceed from a <hi>good mind,</hi> or a <hi>bad?</hi> could a
good and honest mind form so horribly wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a design, to impose an universal delusion,
and lye upon the world, in the name of the
true and holy God? or could a <hi>wicked</hi> mind
frame a design so directly level'd against <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness?</hi>
or is there any thing so aptly and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
tending to form the World to sobriety,
holiness, purity of conversation, as the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of this future state of glory? and since
the belief of future felicity, is known to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>universally</hi> among men; who could be the
Author of so <hi>common</hi> a deception. If thou
had'st the mind to impose a lie upon all the
world, what course would'st thou take? how
would'st thou lay the design? or why dost thou
in this case <hi>imagine,</hi> what thou knowest not how
to <hi>imagine?</hi> And dost thou not without scruple
believe many things of which thou never had'st
so unquestionable evidence? or must <hi>that
Faith</hi> which is the foundation of thy Religion,
and eternal hopes be the most suspected sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
thing with thee? and have of all other the
least stability, and rootedness in thy soul; If
thou can'st not excuse thy <hi>infidelity,</hi> be ashamed
of thy so cold, and sluggish desires of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
state.</p>

With that wicked one thou complyest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

while thou neglectest to desire and pursue this
blessedness. This is thy debasement, and his
triumph; thy vile succumbency gives him
the day, and his will upon thee. He desires
no more, then that he may suppress in thee
all heavenly desires; and keep thee thus a
slave, and a prisoner (confin'd in thy Spirit to
this low, dark dungeon) by thy own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
While thou remainest without desire
after Heaven, he is secure of thee, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then thou wilt take no other way, but what
will bring thee unto the same eternal state
with himself in the end. He is jealous over
thee, that thou direct not a desire, nor glance
an eye Heaven-ward: while thou dost not so,
thou art entirely subject, and givest as full o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to him; as thy God requires to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,

And this being the state of thy case, what
more significant expression canst thou make of
thy contempt of Divine goodness? O the love
that thou neglectest, while the most glorious
issue, and product of it, is with thee an undesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
thing! Yea, this the thing it self speaks,
were there no such competition. What? that
when eternal love have conceived, and is tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
to bring forth such a birth? that when
it invites thee to an expectation of such glory
shortly to be reveal'd, the result of so deep
counsels, and wonderful works, this should
be the return from thee, I desire it not? Is this
thy gratitude to the Father of Glory? the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital
of the kindness, yea, and of the blood
of thy Redeemer? If this blessedness were
not desirable for it self; methinks the offerers
hand should be a sufficient endearment. But
thou can'st not so deride or abstract, it consists
in beholding, and bearing his Glorious like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
who invites thee to it, and therefore in
the neglect of it, thou most highly affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
him.</p>
            <p>Yea further, is it not a monstrous unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralness
towards thy self, as well as impiety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, not to desire that perfect, final
blessedness? Doth not every thing naturally
tend to its ultimate perfection and proper end?
what creature would not witness against thee, if
thou neglect, in thy own capacity and kind, to
aim at thine? Surely thou canst not allow thy
self to think any thing beneath <hi>this,</hi> worthy
to be owned by thee, under that notion, of thy
highest good, and thy last end. But that thy
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:48660:205"/>
Spirit should labour under an aversion towards
thy highest good, towards thy blessedness it
self, is not that a dismal token upon thee? If
thou did'st disaffect, and nauseate the things in
which thy present life is bound up, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which thou can'st not live, would'st thou
not think thy case deplorate? what dost thou
think will become of thy soul? whose everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
life is bound up in that very good, which
thou <hi>desirest not.</hi> Which cannot live that life
without that good, nor with it, if thou hast no
desire to it. O the Eternal Resentments, thy
Soul will have of this cruelty. To be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
from that, wherein its life lies? would'st
thou not judge him unnatural, that should kill
his Brother, assassine his Father, starve his
Child? what shall be said of him that destroys
himself? How may that soul lament, that ever
it was thine; and say, O that I had rather been
of any such lower kind, to have animated a
Fly, to have inspirited a vile Worm, rather
then to have serv'd a reasonable beast, that, by
me, knew the good it would never follow, and
did not desire! But if thou hast any such desires,
in a low degree, after this blessedness; as thou
thinkest may intitle thee to the name thou bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,

                  </gap>ast in it self,</hi> and <hi>for</hi> thee,
with so unproportionable, so slothful desires?
For the same reason thou dost desire it at all;
thou should'st desire it <hi>much,</hi> yea, and still more,
and more, till thou attain it, and be swallowed
up into it. Thy <hi>best,</hi> and <hi>last good,</hi> thou canst ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
desire too much.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:48660:205"/>
And let it be considered by thee, that the
temper thou thinkest thy self innocent of [an
habitual prevalent disaffection to the true ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
of Saints] may, <hi>for ought thou knowest,</hi>
be upon thee; while it <hi>appears,</hi> thou art so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
near the borders of it; and <hi>it appears not,</hi> with
such certainty, that thou partakest not in it. It
is not so easie a matter, critically to distinguish,
and conclude of the lowest degree (<hi>in Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesi,</hi>
or with application to thy own case) of
that desire, which is necessary to qualifie thee
for the <hi>enjoyment</hi> of this blessedness. And is it
not a matter both of shame, and terrour, that
thou should'st desire <hi>thy blessedness</hi> so faintly, as
not to know, whether thou truly desire it at all?
'Tis true, that a certainty, amongst such as may
be sincere, is very little common; but whence
proceeds it, but from their too common indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged
sloth; out of which all this is designed
to awaken thee. And the commonness where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
doth as little detract from the reproach, and
<hi>sinfulness,</hi> as from the danger of it? 'tis but a
poor defence, for what is <hi>intrinsically evil</hi> in it
self, that it is <hi>common.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But further, as the case is, this is so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful
a thing, even in common estimate,
[not to desire Heaven, and Eternal Glory, or
to desire it with very cold and careless desires]
that there are few will profess it, or own it to
be their temper, much fewer that will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to excuse, or justifie it. 'Tis so evilly
thought of, that among meerly sober &amp; rational
men, it can never find an advocate, or any that
will afford it Patronage. The generality pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:48660:206"/>
a desire of going to Heaven, and being
with God. If any be so observant of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as to know, and so ingenious, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
it, otherwise with them, they complain of
it as their fault, and say, they would fain have
it redrest, but are far from assuming that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to defend, or plead for it. Consider
then, wilt thou persist in such a temper and
disposition of mind, as all men condemn? and
be guilty of so odious a thing, as shall be censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
&amp; blamed by the common concurrent vote
and judgment of mankind? Thou would'st be
ashamed to stand forth, and profess openly to
men, that thou desirest an earthly felicity more
then a blessedness in Heaven: or at least, that
thou art so indifferent, and the scales hang even
with thee, that thou canst hardly tell which
way they incline most. And art thou not
ashamed that this should be thy usual temper,
how much soever thou conceal it from the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
and observation of the world?</p>
            <p>Moreover, how can it escape thy serious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection?
that if thou pretend it otherwise with
thee, 'tis but to adde one sin to another, and
cover thy Carnality with Hypocrisie, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation?
yea, while thou continuest in that
temper of Spirit, not to desire this blessedness
as thy Supreme end, the whole of thy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is but an empty shew, an artificial disguise;
it carries an appearance and pretence, as if
thou wast aiming at God and Glory, while
thy heart is set another way, and the bent of
thy soul secretly carries thee a counter-course.
Hath not <hi>Religion</hi> an aspect towards <hi>Blessedness?</hi>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:48660:206"/>
what mean thy Praying, thy Hearing, thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental
Communion; if thou have not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
for Eternal Glory? what makest thou in
this <hi>way,</hi> if thou have not thy heart set towards
this <hi>end?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it more dishonest and unjust; then it
is foolish and absurd, that the disposition, and
tendency of thy soul, should be directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the only design of the Religion thou
professest, and doest externally practice. Thy
profession and practice are nothing but self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.
Thou art continually running
counter to thy self; outwardly pursuing what
thou inwardly declinest. Thy real end (which
can be no other then what thou <hi>really
desirest,</hi> and settest thy heart upon) and thy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
way are quite contrary. So that while thou
continuest the course of Religion, in which
thou art engaged, having taken down from
before thine eyes, the end which thou should'st
be aiming at, and which alone Religion can
aptly subserve; Thy Religion hath no design,
or end at all (none at least which thou would'st
not be ashamed to profess and own.) Indeed
this temper of heart I am now pleading against,
an <hi>undesirousness,</hi> or <hi>indifferencie of Spirit</hi> towards
the eternal glory, renders Religion the vainest
thing in the world. For whereas all the other
actions of our lives have their stated proper
ends; Religion hath in this case none at all;
none to which it hath any designation in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or any aptness to subserve. This mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
absurdity it infers (and how strange is
it, that it should not be reflected on?) That,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:48660:207"/>
whereas, if you ask any man of common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<hi>what he doth this or that action for?</hi>
especially, if they be <hi>stated actions</hi> done by him
in an ordinary course, he can readily tell you
for such and such an end. But ask him why he
continues any practice of Religion; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
say (in this case) for what.</p>
            <p>For can any man imagine what other end
Religion naturally serves for, but to bring
men to blessedness? which being no other
thing then what hath been here described,
such, as are found not to desire it really, and
Supremely, as their end, can have no <hi>real at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable
end</hi> of their being religious at all. To
drive on a continued course, and series of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in a visible pursuit of that which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
not; and have no mind to, is such a piece
of folly, so fond and vain a trifling; that, as I
remember, <hi>Cicero</hi> reports, <hi>Cato</hi> to have said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the South-sayers of his time, <hi>he did
wonder they could look in one anothers faces, and
not laugh</hi> (being conscious to each others im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures,
and the vanity of their profession)
so one would as justly wander, that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of carnal men (who may shrewdly
guess at the temper of one anothers minds)
do not laugh at each other, that they are joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
engaged in such exercises of Religion, to
the design whereof the common and agreed
temper of their Spirits do so little corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond.
As if all were in very good earnest for
Heaven, when each one knows for himself,
and may (possibly with more <hi>Truth</hi> then <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>)
suppose of the rest, that if they might
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:48660:207"/>
alwayes continue in their earthly stations,
they had rather never come there. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that they desire it not <hi>Supremely,</hi> and so
not as their end at all; consider it then, that
thy no-desire of this blessed state quite dispirits
thy Religion, utterly ravishes away its Soul,
leaves it a dead, foolish, vain thing, renders it
an <hi>idle impertinency,</hi> not a <hi>mean</hi> to a valuable
end. <hi>This desire</hi> is that life of Religion, all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and exercises of piety are without it, but
empty Formalities, Solemn pieces of Pagean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.
Every service done to God, but the
<hi>Sacrifice of a Fool,</hi> if not animated by the desire
of final blessedness in him and be not part
of our way thither, a means designed to the
attainment of it. Which nothing can be, that
we are not put upon by the vertue of the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
end.</hi> Without this, Religion is not it self.
A continuance in well doing, is as it were the
body of it; and therein, <hi>a seeking honor, glory,
and immortality,</hi> the Soul and Spirit. <hi>The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi>
of an <hi>Heavenly Country,</hi> must run through
the whole course of our <hi>Earthly Pilgrimage:</hi>
It were otherwise a continued errour, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
wandring; no steady tending towards
our end. So that thou art a meer Vagrant, if
this <hi>desire</hi> do not direct thy course towards thy
Fathers house<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And methinks all this should
make thee even <hi>ashamed</hi> of thy self, if thou
canst not find this desire to have a settled
residence and a ruling power in thy Soul.

a mind and heart set upon <hi>that?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The blessed God puts a note of excellency
upon this temper of Spirit.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 16.</note> But they desire
a better Country, that is, an Heavenly, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <hi>who hath called them to his kingdom and

they been of low, terrene Spirits, he would
have accounted it a shame to him, to have
gone under the name and cognisance of their
God. But in as much as they desire the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Country, have learned to trample
this terrestrial world, cannot be contained
within this lower Sphere; nor satisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in earthly things; they now discover a
<hi>certain excellency of Spirit,</hi> in respect whereof
God is not ashamed to own a relation to them
before all the world to be called their God;
to let men see what account he makes of
such a Spirit.</p>
            <p>Yea, this is the proper genuine Spirit, and
temper of a Saint, which agrees to him as he
is such. He is begotten to the eternal inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.
A disposition (and therein a desire)
to it, is in his very nature (the new nature he
hath received) implanted there, from his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.
He is born Spirit of Spirit, and by that
birth, is not intituled onely, but <hi>adopted,</hi> and
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:48660:208"/>
suited also to that pure and Spiritual state of
blessedness. That grace by the appearance
whereof men are made Christians teaches, also
instructs, unto this very thing, to look for this
blessed hope the glorious appearing of the
great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ..
That which you know consummates that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness.

Tis the matter of the Apostles thanksgiving
unto God, on the behalf of the Thessalonians,
that they were called by his Gospel, to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:48660:209"/>
when the soul desires this glory, it obedient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
answers this call. This is a complyance and
subjection of heart to it. How Lovely and
becoming a thing is this, when God touches
the heart with a stamp and impress of glory, and
it forthwith turnes it self to that very point, and
stands directly bent towards the state of glory,
if not wayward or perverse, but here in yield
it self to God, and complyes with the divine
pleasure.</p>
            <p>Such desires have much in them of a child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
ingenuity. To desire the sight of a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
face;</hi> when this is this intimate sense of
the soul show me the Father and it suffices;
To desire the fullest conformity to his nature
and will, to be perfect as that heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is perfect, what doth better become a
child?</p>
            <p>They are generous desires, they aim at
perfection, the highest that created nature is
capable of, not contented to have had some
glances of divine glory, some stroaks and lines
of his image, but aspiring to full-eyd visions
a perfect likeness.</p>
            <p>They are victorious desires, they (as it were)
ride in triumph over the world and every sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunarie
thing, they must be supposed to have
conquered sensual inclinations to have got the
mastery over terrene dispositions and affections.
With what holy contempt and scorn of every
earthly thing doth that loftie soul quit thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
dirty world and ascend, that is powerfully
carryed by its own desire towards the blessed
state? The desire of such a knowledge of
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:48660:209"/>
Christ, as might transform into his Likeness;
and pass the soul through all degrees of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to him, till it attain the resurrection
of the dead, and become like a risen glorified
Jesus; Such a desire I say, if it make all things
seem as loss and dung in comparison (even a
formal Spirit less religion it self) will it not
render this world the most despicable dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill
of all the rest. Try such a soul if you
can, tempt it down to injoy a <hi>flattering kind
world,</hi> or to please it when <hi>angry and unkind.</hi>
When desires after this glory are once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakn'd,
into an active lively vigour, when
the fire is kindled, and the flame ascends
and this refined Spirit is joyfully ascending
therein; see if you can draw it back and
make it believe this world a more regardable
thing. Why should not all those considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
make thee in love with this blessed frame
of Spirit, and restless till thou find thy self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of being satisfied with any thing but
divine likeness,</p>
            <p>6. That while we cannot as yet attain the
mark and end of our desires,<note place="margin">Rule 6.</note> we yeild not to a
comfortless despondency in the way, but maintain
in our hearts a lively joy, in the hope that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
we shall attain it.</p>
            <p>We are not all this while perswading to the
desire and pursuit of an unattainable good.
Spiritual desires are also rational and do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
involve hope with them; and that hope
ought to <hi>infer</hi> and <hi>cherish</hi> joy. Hopeless desire
is full of torment, and must needs banish joy
from that breast which it hath not the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:48660:210"/>
of. Tis a disconsolate thing to desire
what we must never expect to enjoy, and are
utterly unlikely ever to compass. But these
desires are part of the <hi>new creature,</hi> which is not
of such a composition, as to have a principle of
endless trouble, and disquiet in it self, The
Father of mercies is not so little merciful to
his own child; to lay it under a necessity <hi>from
its very natural constitution,</hi> of being for ever
miserable by the desire of that which it can
never have. It had been very unlike the
workmanship of God, to make a creature to
which it should be <hi>necessarie to desire, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to enjoy</hi> the same thing.</p>
            <p>Not but as he hath given holy souls (as to
the present case) great <hi>incentives</hi> of desire,
so doth he afford them proportionable <hi>encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements</hi>
of hope also, and that hope inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening,
can very well reconcile desire and joy
and lodge them together in the same bosome.
So that as it is a thing capable of no excuse,
to hear of this blessedness, and not desire it,
so it would be to desire, and not expect it, to
expect it, and not rejoyce in it, even while we
are under that expectation. And it must be a
very raised joy that shall answer to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of so great things. If one should give
a stranger to Christianity an account of the
Christian hopes, and tell him what they
expect to be and enjoy erelong; he would sure
promise himself to find so many angells dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in humane flesh, and reckon, when he came
among them, he should be as amidst heavenly
Quire: every one ful of joy and praise. He
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:48660:210"/>
would expect to find us living on <hi>earth,</hi> as the
inhabitants of <hi>heaven,</hi> also many pieces of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
glory lately dropt down from above,
and shortly again returning thither. He would
look to find, every where, in the Christian world
incarnate glory, sparkling through the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaddowing
vail, and wonder how this earthly
sphere should be able to contain so many great
souls.</p>
            <p>But when he draws nearer to us, and observs
the course and carriage of our lives; when he
sees us walk as other men, and considers the
strange disagreement of our daily conversation,
to our so great avowed hopes, and how little
sense of joy, and pleasure we discover our
selves to conceive in them: would he not be
ready to say, sure some or other <q>(willing only
to amuse the world with the noise of strange
things) have composed a Religion for these
men, which they themselves understand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of. If they do adopt, and own it for
theirs, they understand not their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences;
they are taught to speak som big words,
or to give a faint, or seeming assent to such
as speak them in the names; but tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
they should be in good earnest, or
believe themselves in what they say, and
profess.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And what reply then should we be able to
make? for who can think that any who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
a God; and understand at all what
that name imports, should value at so low a
rate, as we (visibly) do; the eternal fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition
of his glory, and a present Sonship
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:48660:211"/>
to him, the pledge of so great an hope.</p>
            <p>He that is born Heir to great Honours, and
Possessions, though he be upon great uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties,
as to the enjoyment of them (for
how many interveniencies may prevent him?)
yet when he comes to understand his possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and expectancies; how big doth he look
and speak? what grandieur doth he put on?
His hopes form his Spirit and Deportment;
But is it Proportionably so with us? Do our
hopes fill our hearts with joy, our mouths with
praise, and clothe our faces with a cheerful
aspect, and make an holy alacrity appear in all
our conversations?</p>
            <p>But let not the design of this discourse be
mistaken. 'Tis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a presumptuous confidence
I would encourage, nor a vain ostentation, nor
a disdainful overlooking of others when we fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
our selves to excel. Such things hold no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
with a Christian Spirit. <hi>His</hi> is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest,
humble exaltation, a serious severe joy;
suitable to his solid, stable hope. His Spirit is
not puft up, and swol'n with air, 'tis not big by
an inflation, or a light and windy humour; but
'tis really fill'd with effectual pre-apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a weighty glory. His joy accordingly
exerts it self with a steady lively vigour, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
removed from vain lightness, and stupidity
from conceitedness, and insensibleness of his
blessed state. He forgets not that he is less
then the least of Gods mercies, but disowns
not his title to the greatest of them. He abases
himself to the dust, in the sense of his own vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
but in the admiration of Divine Grace,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:48660:211"/>
he rises as high as Heaven. In his humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he affects to equal himself with worms, in
his joy and praise with angels. He is never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to diminish himself, but affraid of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
any thing from the love of God, or the
issues of that love.</p>
            <p>But most of all he magnifies (as he hath
cause) this its last and most perfect issue.
And by how much he apprehends his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness,
he is the more rapt up into a
wondering joy; that such blessedness should be
his designed portion.</p>
            <p>But now how little do we find in our selves of
this blessed frame of spirit? How remote are we
from it? Let us but enquire a little into our own
Souls. Are there not too apparent Symptomes
with us of the little joy we take in the
forethoughts of future blessedness? For,</p>
            <p>First, How few thoughts have we of it?
what any delight in, they remember often. 'Tis
said of the same person,<note place="margin">Psal. 1. 2.</note> that his <hi>delight is in the
Law of the Lord, and that in his Law he doth me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
day and night.</hi> And when the Psalmist
professes his own <hi>delight in Gods statutes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 16.</note> he
adds, <hi>I will not forget thy Word.</hi> Should we
not be as unapt to <hi>forget</hi> Heaven, if our
<hi>delight</hi> were there? But do not dayes pass
with us, wherein we can allow our selves
no leasure to mind the eternal glory? when
yet vanities throng in upon us, without any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
or check?</p>
            <p>And (what is consequent hereupon) How
seldom is this blessed state the subject of our
discourse? How often do Christians meet,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:48660:212"/>
and not a word of Heaven? O heavy carnal
hearts! Our home and eternal blessedness, in
this, appears to be forgotten among us. How
often may a person converse with us e're he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
our relation to the Heavenly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?
If Exiles meet in a Forraign Land, what
pleasant discourse have they of home? They
suffer not one another to forget it. Such was
<hi>their remembrance of Sion,</hi> who sate together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning
themselves by the Rivers of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,
a making mention of it</hi> (as the Phrase is
often used.) And methinks (even as to this
remembrance) it should be our common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
too, <hi>If we forget thee, O Jerusalem;
If we forget to make mention of thee, O thou City
of the living God; Let our right hand forget her
cunning, our tongue shall sooner cleave to the roof
of our mouth;</hi> and so it would be, did we prefer
that Heavenly Jerusalem above our <hi>chief joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, how little doth it weigh with us? It
serves not to out-weigh the smallest trouble,
if we have not our eternal desire in every thing
gratified, if any thing fall out cross to our incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
this glory goes for nothing with us. Our
discontents swallow up our hopes, and joyes, and
heaven is reckon'd as a thing of naught. If
when <hi>outward</hi> troubles afflict, or threaten us,
we could have the certain prospect of better
dayes; <hi>that</hi> would <hi>sensibly revive,</hi> and please
us. Yea, can we not please our selves with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
uncertain groundless hopes of this kind,
without promise or valuable reason? But to be
told of a recompense, at the resurrection of the
just, of a day when we shall see the face of
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:48660:212"/>
God, and be satisfied, with his Likeness; this
is insipid and without favor to us; and affords us
but cold comfort. The uncertain things of
time signifie more with us, then the certain
things of eternity. Can we think tis all this
while well with us? can we think this a tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
evil, or suffer, with patience, such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
of Spirit? Methinks it should make
us ever weary of our selves, and solicitous for
an effectual speedy redress.</p>
            <p>The redress must be more in our <hi>own doing</hi>
(striving with our souls and with God for
them) then in what <hi>any man can say.</hi> Most
of the considerations under the foregoing rule
are with little variation applicable to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
purpose. I shall here annex only some
few subordinate directions; which may lead
us into this blessed state of life, and give us some
joyful foretasts of the future blessedness, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as our spirits shall comply with them.
But expect not to be cured by prescriptions
without using them: or that heavenly joy can
be the creature of mortal unregarded breath;
we can onely prescribe means, and methods
through which God may be pleased to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend,
and in which thou art diligently to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
and wait. And because I cannot well sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the ignorant where much is said to this
purpose; I shall therefore say little.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Possess thy soul with the apprehension that
thou art not at liberty in this matter;</hi> but that
there is a certain <hi>spiritual delectation,</hi> which is
incumbent on thee as indispensable duty.
Some whose moroser tempers do more estrange
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:48660:213"/>
them from delights, think themselves more
especially concern'd, to banish every thing
of that kind from their religion and phansie it
onely to consist in sowr and rigorous severities.
Others seem to think it arbitrary and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
or that, if they live in a continual sadness
and dejection of spirit, 'tis only their infeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
not their fault, and apprehend not the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
that is upon them, by a divine Law o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
to mannage and order their spirits.
But what then? are such words thought to be
spoken at random,<note place="margin">Prov. 3. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Her ways are ways of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness.
The Lord is the portion of mine Inheritance.
The Lines are fal'n to me in pleasant places</hi> (or

               <note place="margin">Psal. 34. 7.</note> with many more? Do all passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

or were they put in them by chance?<note place="margin">Phil. 4 4.</note> Is there

Do not think you are permitted so to
extinguish or frustrate so considerable a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of the Divine Life. Know that the due
exercise of it, is a part of the order and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of Gods Family. That it is a constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the divine Goodness and Wisdom both
to cherish his <hi>own,</hi> and invite in strangers to
him, yea that is the scope and aim of the whole
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:48660:213"/>
Gospel-revelation, that the word of life was

the serious, rational, regular, seasonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of delight and joy is matter of duty,
to be charged upon conscience, from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of God; and is an integral part in
the religion of Christians. And then sure
you will not think any object more proper
and suitable for it to be exercised upon, than
the foreseen state of blessedness,<note place="margin">Psalm. 16.</note> which is, in
it self,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> 
               <hi>a fulness of joy; The joy of our Lord.</hi> and
is in the pre-apprehensions of it a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable

affords us besides; and without relation
whereto we have no matter of rational

of it which <hi>unites</hi> it to God, through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.

               <hi>in believing;</hi> and we
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:48660:214"/>
are told how effectually (as to this) it supply'd
the place of sight. Such as had not seen
Christ (which was the priviledge of many
other Christians of that time) yet <hi>believing</hi>
did rejoyce,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 8.</note> with <hi>joy unspeakable and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Faith directly tends, in that double office
before mentioned, to excite and foment this
joy. As it assents to the truth of the Gospel-revelation
it reallizes the object,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 1.</note> is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and evidence of the invisible glory.
As it unites the soul with God through Christ
in a <hi>siducial</hi> and <hi>obediential</hi> closure, it ascertains
our interest therein, and is our actual accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of our blessedness it self; for when we
take God through Christ to be our God, what
is it? but to accept him as our eternal and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
portion, whom we are after fully to enjoy
in the vision and participation of his glorious
excellencies, and infinite fulness. Which
two acts of faith we have mentioned together
in one text.—They were <hi>perswaded</hi> of the
promises and <hi>embraced</hi> them; the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting
the <hi>truth</hi> of the promise, the latter the
<hi>goodness</hi> of the thing promised. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they confessed themselves (as it follows)
Pilgrims and Strangers on earth which abdicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the earth, as none of their country could
not be, but that, through their faith, they had
a joyous pre-apprehension of that better state.
That confession did manifestly involve in it a
lively joy, springing from the sight and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
of that more taking distant good; which
the promise presented them with; whence
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:48660:214"/>
they could not think it enough to be such to
themselves in their own thoughts, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of their minds; but they cannot forbear
(so overcoming were their sights and tasts)
to give it out, to speak, and look, and live, as
those that were carried up in their spirits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
this earth; and who did even disdain to
own themselves in any other relation to it,
then that of Forraigners and Strangers.</p>
            <p>Set thy Faith on work Soul, and keep it
a work, and thou wilt find this no riddle; it will
be so with thee too, we have much talk of Faith
among us, and have the name often in our
mouths, but how few are the real lively belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers?
Is it to be thought that such blessedness
should not more affect our hearts, nay would
it not ravish away our very souls, did we
throughly believe it? And were it our present
daily work to renew the bonds of a vital union
with the blessed God, in whom we expect
to be blessed forever, could that be without
previous gusts of pleasure? Tis not talking
of faith but living by it, that will give us the
experience of heavenly delights and joyes.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Take heed of going, in thy practice, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thy light, of persisting</hi> in a course of
known, or suspected sin, that states thee in a
direct hostility and rebellion against heaven;
and can never suffer thee to think of eternity
and the other world with comfort, will fill thy
mind with frightful apprehensions of God,
render the sight of his face, the most terrible
thing to thy thoughts, thou canst imagine;
and satisfaction with his likeness the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:48660:215"/>
thing. Let a good understanding and
correspondence be continued between God
and thee (which is not possible, if thou diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyest
the dictates of thy conscience and takest
the liberty to do what thou judgest God hath
forbidden thee) <hi>that this may be thy rejoycing
the testimony of a good conscience; that in sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 12.</note>
               <hi>and godly sincerity, not according to fleshly
wisdom, but the grace of God thou hast had thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation—.</hi>
Take God for a witness of thy ways
and walking; approve thy self to his jealous
eye, study to carry thy self acceptably towards
him; and unto all well pleasing. Let that be
thy ambition to stand right in his thoughts to
appear gracious in his eyes. Hold fast thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
that thy heart may not reproach
thee as long as thou livest, If iniquity be in
thy hand put it away, then shalt thou lift up
thy face without spot and without fear. Be a
faithful subject of that kingdom of God (and
here conscience rules under him) which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
<hi>first in righteousness,</hi> and then in peace, and
<hi>joy in the holy Ghost.</hi> Thou wilt so daily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the face of God in righteousness, and
with pleasure, but wilt most of all please thy
self to think of thy final appearance before
him, and the blessedness that shall ensue.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Watch and arm thy self against the too forcible
strokes and impressions of sensible objects</hi> Let not the
favor of such low vile things corrupt the pallate
of thy soul. A sensual earthly mind, and heart,
cannot tast. heavenly delights. <hi>They that are after
the flesh do savor the things of the Flesh, they that are
after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.</hi> Labor to be
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:48660:215"/>
throughly mortified towards this world,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 73 1.</note> and the
present state of things.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 17.</note> Look upon this scheme &amp;
pageant as passing away, keep natural appetites
under restraint (the world and the lusts of it
pass away together) sensuality is an impure
thing. Heavenly refined joy cannot live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid'st
so much filth. Yea, and if thou give
thy flesh liberty too far in things that are (<hi>in
specie;</hi>) lawful; it will soon get advantage to
domineer, and keep thy soul in a depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
servitude. Abridge it then, and cut it
short; That thy mind may be enlarged,
and at liberty; may not be throng'd, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possest
with carnal imaginations and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<q>Let thy soul (if thou wilt take this
instruction from a Heathen) look with a

                     </gap>.</note> nor born down
towards the Earth; but stopping its Ears,
and turning its Eyes, and all other Senses
back upon it self; and quite abolishing out
of it self, all Earthly Sighs, and Groans,
and Pleasures, and Glories, and Honours,
and disgrace; and having forsaken all
these; choose for the Guides of its way,
true Reason, and strong Love, the one
whereof will shew it the way, the other
make it easie, and pleasant.</q>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>Having voided thy mind of what is earthly,
and carnal, apply and turn it to this blessed Theam.</hi>
The most excellent and the vilest objects are
alike to thee, while thou mindest them not. Thy
thoughts possibly bring thee in nothing but
vexation and trouble, which would bring in
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:48660:216"/>
assoon joy, and pleasure, didst thou turn them
to proper objects. A thought, of the heavenly
glory is assoon thought as of an earthly Cross.
We complain the world troubles us, then what
do we there? why get we not up in our spirits
into the quieter Region? what trouble would
the thoughts of future glory be to us? How
are the thoughts and wits set on work for this
flesh? but we would have our Souls flourish,
as the Lilies, without any thing of their own
care. Yea, we make them toyl for torture,
and not for joy, revolve an affliction a thousand
times, before, and after it comes; and have
never done with it, when eternal blessedness
gains not a thought.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Plead earnestly with God for his Spirit. This
is joy in the Holy Ghost;</hi> or whereof he is the
Author. Many Christians (as they must be
called) are such strangers to this work of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring,
and calling in the blessed Spirit, as if
they were capable of adopting these words,
<hi>We have not so much as heard whether there be an
Holy Ghost.</hi> That name is with them as an empty
sound. How hardly are we convinc't of our
necessary dependance, on that <hi>free Spirit,</hi> as
to all our truly Spiritual operations? This Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is the very earnest of our inheritance. The
foretasts, and first fruits we have here of the
future blessedness; The joy and pleasure, the
complacential relishes, we have of it before
hand, are by the gracious vouchsafement and
work of this blessed Spirit. The things that
<hi>eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, and which have
not entred into the heart of man, are revealed by
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:48660:216"/>
this Spirit.</hi> Therefore doth the Apostle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
his Prayer on the behalf of the <hi>Ephesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
to the Father of this glory, <hi>that he would
give them this Spirit of wisdom and revelation,— to
enlighten the eyes of their understanding, that
they might know the hope of his calling, and the
riches of the glory of his inheritance in</hi> (or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong)
<hi>the Saints.</hi> And its revelation is such
as begets an impression; in respect whereof 'tis
said also to <hi>seal</hi> up to the day of redemption.
Therefore pray earnestly for this Spirit; not
in idle dreaming words of course, but as
being really apprehensive of the necessitie of
prevailing. And give not over till thou find
that sacred fire diffusing it self through thy
mind and heart, to enlighten the one, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
the other, and so prepossess <hi>both,</hi> of this
glory; that thy soul may be all turned into <hi>joy</hi>
and <hi>praise.</hi> And then let me adde here (without
the formality of a distinct head.) That it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
thee to take heed of quenching that
Spirit, by either resisting, or neglecting its
holy dictates, or as the same precept is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
given of <hi>grieving the Spirit;</hi> he is, by
Name and Office, the Comforter. The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians, 'tis said, walked in the
fear of God, and <hi>in the comfort of the Holy
Ghost.</hi> Is it equal dealing <hi>to grieve him,</hi> whose
business it is to <hi>comfort thee?</hi> or canst thou
expect <hi>joy,</hi> where thou causest <hi>grief? Walk in
the Spirit,</hi> adore its power. Let thy Soul do
it homage within thee. Wait for its holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences,
&amp; yield thy self to its ducture and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance;
so wilt thou go as the <hi>redeemed</hi> of the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:48660:217"/>
Lord, with <hi>everlasting joy upon thy head,</hi> till
thou enter that presence, where is fulness of
joy, and pleasures for evermore.</p>
            <p>Nor do thou think it improper, or strange, that
thou should'st be called upon to rejoyce in
what thou dost not yet possess. Thy hope is in
stead of fruition; 'tis an anticipated enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note place="margin">Rom. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

We are commanded <hi>to rejoyce in hope,</hi>
and Saints have profest to do so; to rejoyce
<hi>even in the hope,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 2.</note> the <hi>hope of the glory of God.</hi> Nor
is it unreasonable that should be thy present
highest joy. For though yet it be a distinct
thing, and indistinctly revealed, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the object makes compensation for
<hi>both,</hi> with an abundant surplusage. As any
one would much more rejoyce to be <hi>assured</hi>
by a great person, of ample possessions, he
would make him his heir to, (though he knew
not distinctly what they should be) then to see
<hi>a shilling,</hi> already his own, with his own

               <p>The addition of two Rules that more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

Rule 7. That we patiently wait for it

            </argument>
            <p>THere are yet two more Rules to be
superadded, that respect the season of
this blessedness: [when we awake]
<hi>i. e.</hi> not till we go out of time, into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity;
not till we pass out of the drowsie
darkness of our present state, till the night be
over with us, and the vigorous light of the
everlasting day do shine upon us. Hence
therefore it will be further necessary.</p>
            <p>7. That while the appointed proper season of this
blessedness is not yet come (<hi>i. e. till God shall
vouchsafe to translate us from our present earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
state</hi>) we compose our Spirits to a patient expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it.<note place="margin">Rule 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Upon a twofold account, the exercise of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
is very requite in the present case, <hi>viz.</hi>
both in respect of this very <hi>expectation</hi> it self,
and also in respect of the <hi>concomitant miseries
of this expecting state.</hi> In the <hi>former respect,</hi>
an <hi>absent good,</hi> is the matter of our patience;
in the <hi>latter, present and incumbent evil.</hi> It falls
more directly, in our way to speak to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:48660:218"/>
of patience upon the <hi>former account,</hi> yet
as to the latter (though it be more collateral
as to our present purpose) it cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable,
briefly to consider that also.</p>
            <p>First, Therefore, the <hi>very expectation it self of
this blessedness,</hi> renders <hi>patience</hi> very requisite
to our present state. Patience hath as proper
and necessary an exercise, in <hi>expecting the good</hi>
we want and desire, as in <hi>enduring the evil,</hi>
that is actually upon us. The direction (it
must be remembred) intends such onely, as
apprehend, and desire this blessedness as their
greatest good, whose souls are transported
with earnest longings, fully to enjoy what they
have foretasted. I am apprehensive enough
that others need it not. There is no use
of patience in expecting what we desire
not.</p>
            <p>But as to those who desire it most, and
who therefore are most concerned in this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
It may possibly become a doubt; how,
<hi>since there is sin in our present ignorance of God,
and unlikeness to him, this can be the matter of
any patience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We must therefore know, that as our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, and conformity to him are
both our <hi>duty,</hi> and <hi>blessedness;</hi> the matter both
of our <hi>endeavour,</hi> and of Gods <hi>vouchsafement.</hi>
So our ignorance of him, and unlikeness to
him, are both our <hi>sin,</hi> and our <hi>misery;</hi> which
misery, though God have graciously removed
it in part, yet also he continues it upon us in
part (as our sad experience tells us) by his
just, and wise dispensation, which we cannot
except against.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="375" facs="tcp:48660:218"/>
Now therefore, looking upon the defect of
our knowledge of God, and likeness to him,
under the <hi>former notion;</hi> Though we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon <hi>our selves</hi> with greater displeasure
and indignation; yet looking on them, in the
<hi>latter notion,</hi> we are to submit to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
dispensation of God, with a meek, unrepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
patience.</p>
            <p>By this patience, therefore, I mean; not a
stupid succumbencie under the remaining di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease,
and distemper of our Spirits, in this our
present state; a sensless indifferency, and osci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
cessation from continual endeavours of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
redress; but a silent and submissive vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Divine Wisdom, and Justice, and
Goodness, that are sweetly complicated in
this procedure with us; with a quiet peaceful
expectation of the blessed issue of it.</p>
            <p>This being premised, I shall briely shew.</p>
            <p>
               <list>
                  <item>That we have need of patience</item>
                  <item>That we have reason for it</item>
               </list> in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
case.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That we have need of it</hi> (supposing our
souls are <hi>intent upon glory;</hi> that we are in earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
in this pursuit) will appear upon sundry
accounts.</p>
            <p>First, The <hi>greatness of the thing we expect.
To behold the face of God, to be satisfied with his
likeness.</hi> What serious heart, apprehensive
of its own concerns, can without much pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
hold out under such an expectation?
How do Lovers, that expect the marriage day,
tell the hours, and chide the Sun that it makes
no more hast? But how can that soul contain
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:48660:219"/>
it self, that expects the most intimate fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Lord of glory!</p>
            <p>Again, consider, <hi>the continued representation,
and frequent inculcations of this glory.</hi> Its vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
powerful beams are, by often repealed
pulsations, continually beating upon such souls,
as are intent towards it. Life and Immortality
are brought to light in the Gospel; and they
are obliged, by command, and inclination, to
attend its discoveries. The eye that's once
smitten, looks again, and again, 'tis not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with seeing; and every renewed look
meets with, still, fresh raies of glory; They
have frequent foretasts, and prelivations, which
still give life to new desires. To lie under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
stroke of the <hi>power of the world to come,</hi> this
requires much patience, to sustain the burden
of such an expectation. Life it self were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a bitter, and a wearisome thing.<note n="*" place="margin">Canerem ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi angelicâ vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce throno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> And
the want of such foretasts (for alass they are
not constant) makes desire sometimes more
restless, and expectation more bitter and
grievous.</p>
            <p>Moreover consider <hi>the nature and Spring of
these desires,</hi> that work in heavenly souls to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
this glory. They are of a Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and Original; <hi>He that hath wrought us to
this self same thing is God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 5.</p>
            <p>Observe the tenour of this Proposition, God
is not the subject of predication, but the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.
The action is not predicated of God;
as it would in this form of words, God hath
wrought us, &amp;c. but God is predicated of this
agent, q. d. <hi>This is the work of a Deity;</hi> none
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:48660:219"/>
but God could be the Author of such desires.
That a Soul should be acted towards glory by
the alone power of an Almighty hand! here
needs a <hi>Divine Patience</hi> to sustain it, and make
it strong, and able to endure such a <hi>motion;</hi>
where there is <hi>Divine Power</hi> to act and move
it forward. The Frame could not hold it else,
it must desolve. The Apostle therefore pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Thes. 3. 5.</note> That <hi>God would direct
their hearts into the love of himself</hi> (which
could not but enflame their souls with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of a perfect vision, and injoyment) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
adds, and <hi>into the patient waiting for of
Christ.</hi> Where we cannot by the way but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon the admirable constitution, and
equal temper of the new Creature, as <hi>to the
principles,</hi> that are ingredient into the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of it, <hi>fervent desire;</hi> allayed with <hi>meek
submission, mighty love,</hi> with <hi>strong patience.</hi> If
we consider it in <hi>actu signato,</hi> or in its abstract,
<hi>Idea,</hi> this is its temperament; and of these
there is a gradual participation, where
ever you find it actually existing. God had
otherwise formed a creature (the prime of
his creatures) so as by its most intrinsecal
constituent principles to be a torment to it
self.</p>
            <p>Lastly, The <hi>tires<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

('tis true) pleasure (if it be <hi>hoping expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>)
with it; but not without a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture
of pain. It brings a kind of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

               <hi>Hope

            </p>
            <p>2. And as we have need of it, so <hi>we have
also reason for it,</hi> upon many accounts. 'Tis
no piece of rigorous severity to be put upon
the exercise of some patience, to be kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
in a waiting posture for the completion
of this blessedness. For</p>
            <p>First, <hi>The thing you expect is sure.</hi> You
have not to do in this matter with one who is
inconstant, or likely to change. If such a one
should make us large promises, we should
have some cause, never to think our selves se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
till we had them made good to us. But
since we <hi>live in the hope of eternal life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>which God
who cannot lie,</hi>

promised,</hi> we may be confident, and this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
should quiet our hearts. What a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
friend keeps for us, we reckon as safe
in his hands, as in our own. <hi>He that believes
makes not hast.</hi> And impatient haste argues an
unbelieving jealousie and distrust. <hi>Surely,</hi>
there is an end, and thy expectation will be
cut off.</p>
            <p>And then, <hi>'tis an happiness that will recompense
the most wearisome expectation.</hi> 'Twere good
sometimes to consider with our selves, what's
the object of our hope? are our expectations

               </gap>'t upon a valuable good? that will be

worth while to expect, so the Psalmist, <hi>what

been a long time full of great hopes, that at last
dwindle into some pettie trifle; but when we
know before hand the business is such as will

<hi>Surely</hi> I come quickly. <hi>q. d.</hi> What will you

the coming of the Lord;</hi> and presently he adds
<hi>be patient stablish your hearts for the coming of

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yea, and amidst the many troubles of that short
time of expectation, many present comforts are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt.</hi>
Heaven is open to us. We have
constant liberty of access to God. He disdains
not our present converse; We may have the
constant pleasure of the exercise of grace,
the heavenly delights of meditation. The joy
of the publique Solemnities, of worship. The
communion, and encouragement of fellow
Christians. The light of that countenance
whereof we expect the eternal vision. The
comforts of the Holy Ghost. The continual
prospect of glory all the way thither.
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:48660:221"/>
What cause have we of impatience or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint?</p>
            <p>Further, <hi>Saints of all ages have had their
expecting time.</hi> We are required to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of them, who through faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
have inherited the promises. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
himself waited a lifes time for his <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification.</hi>
I have (saith he) glorify'd thee on
earth; I have finished the work thou gavest me
to do. And now further glorifie me with thine
own self &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And while we are waiting (if it be not our
fault) our glory will be encreasing;</hi> we may be
glorifying God in the mean time, which is
the end of our beings, we need not live here
to no purpose.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>We were well enough content till God more
clearly revealed that other state to live always as
we do.</hi> Tis not now ingenuous to be impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
querulous about the time of our entring
into it. Tis his free vouchsafement we never
merited such a thing at his hands. Tis not
commendable among men, to be over quick
in exacting doubts; even where there was
an antecedent right, much less where the
right onely shall accrue by promise, not yet
suitable, would it not shame us to have God say
to us. <hi>Have patience with me and I will pay
you all?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And our former state should be often refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
on. If you had promised great things
to a wretch lately taken off the dunghil, and
he is every day impatiently urging you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o
an untimely accomplisheut, would you not
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:48660:221"/>
check his over bold hast, by minding him of
his original? It becomes not base and low
born persons to be transported with a prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous
over hasty expectation of high and
and great things.</p>
            <p>And if God bear with the sinfulness of our
present state,<note place="margin">James 1. 4.</note> is it not reasonable we should
bear with the infelicitie of it to his appointed
time?</p>
            <p>Besides that, we should much injure our selvs
by our impatiency; imbitter our present
condition, increase our own burthen, dissipate
our strength, retard our progresse towards the
perfection we profess to aim at; for patience
must have its perfect work, that we may be
perfect.</p>
            <p>And others that have had as clear appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
and vigorous desires (at least) of
the future state of glory as we can (with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty)
pretend to; have yet herein moderated
themselves so, as to intend their present worke
with composed spirits. Take that one instance
of the blessed Apostle; who, whilest, in this
earthly tabernacle, he groaned, being bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then'd
to be cloth'd, with glory, and to have
mortality swallowed up of life being sensible
enough, that during his abode, or presence
in the body, he was absent from the Lord;
yet notwithstanding the fervor and vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of these longings, with the greatest calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and resignation imaginable, (<hi>as to</hi> the
termination,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 9. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> or continuance of his present
state) he adds, that (though he had rather be
absent from the body to be present with the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:48660:222"/>
Lord) <hi>it was yet his chief ambition</hi> (as the word,
he uses signifies) <hi>whether present or absent</hi> (as,
if in comparison of that, to be present, or
absent were indifferent though otherwise out
of that comparison,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> he had told us he would
be absent rather) to be <hi>accepted</hi> to appear
grateful, and well pleasing in the eye of God;
such that he might delight, and take content in
(as his expression imports.) As if he had
said; though I am not unapprehensive of the
state of my case, I know well, I am kept out of
a far more desirable condition, while I remain
in this tabernacle; yet, may I but please and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
acceptable in the sight of God, whether
I be sooner dismist from this thraldom, or lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
continued in it, I contend not. His burden
here, that so sensibly prest him, was not a
present evil so much as an <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sent good.</hi> He
was not so burden'd by <hi>what he felt,</hi> and
could not remove, as by what <hi>he saw,</hi> and <hi>could
not enjoy.</hi> His groans accordingly were not
<hi>brutal;</hi> as those of a beast under a too heavy
load; but <hi>rational,</hi> the groans of an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
spirit panting after an alluring, inviting
glory; which he had got the prospect of, but
could not yet attain. And hence the same
spiritual reason which did <hi>exercise,</hi> did also at
once <hi>moderate</hi> his desires, so that as he saw there
was reason to desire, so he saw there was reason
his desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e emper of mind we find him in, when he

his confidence, <hi>that he should abide longer,</hi> and
therein discovers how well contented he was,
it should be so.</p>
            <p>Therefore, as in reference to this very expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
it self, there is great need of patience;
so the exercise of it in this case hath nothing
harsh, or unreasonable in it, or which the
spirit of a Saint may not well comport with.</p>

present expecting state.</hi> I need not insist to
shew how needfull it is, this being that which
our own sense will sufficiently instruct us in.
We are not to expect the future state of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
in a state of present ease and rest, in a
quiet friendly world; in a calm and peaceful
region under placide and benigne insluences
from men, and times; but amidst storms, and
tempests, and trouble on every side, under
frowns and displeasures, threats and dangers,
harsh and rough severities, ill and ungentle
usages, flouts and scornes, wrongs and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
dealings, wants and pressures in many
kinds. When the <hi>world is once forsaken</hi> by us,
it grows angry; If we disclaim it, and avow
our selves not to be of it, becomes confessed
strange and pilgrims in it, set our selves seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
and visibly to mind and design some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
above and beyond it, discover our selves
to be of them, that are <hi>called out of it,</hi> from
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:48660:223"/>
the same principle that it <hi>loves its own,</hi> it will
<hi>hate us;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John. 3. 1.</note> when once <hi>God calls us his sons, the
world well not know us.</hi> We see in this context
we are discoursing from what the Psal mist con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was, whilst, as yet he remained under
this blessed expectation. He found <hi>the men of
time,</hi> whose <hi>portion was in this life,</hi> to be deadly
enemies, wicked oppressors, proud insulters?
They were to him as greedy lions, as a blood
thirsty sword. His cryes to be delivered
from them, shew what he <hi>met</hi> with at their

can so raging enmity and hate ever cease to
meditate mischiefs and cruelties. The same

this prayer as so many hyperbolical strains, or

            <p>True it is indeed, that the very need we
have of patience, and the gain that would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue
by it, is it self a reason, why we
should labour to frame our spirits to it, for if
such evils must be undergone, how much better
is it to bear <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m alone,</hi> then to have the disease

an additional burden. <hi>The law of patience,</hi> is,
certainly, a most indulgent, merciful Law, a

               </gap>ctive
sufferings. As might at large be shewn, were
it suitable to fall into a discourse of patience
in it self considered; and to treat of that rest,
and pleasure, that liberty of Spirit, that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
and dominion of ones own soul, which it
carries in it. But that were two much a digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
It onely falls directly here in out way to
consider, that as we have many grievances and
pressures to undergo, while we are expecting
the future blessedness, which render the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of patience very requisite, so that there
is enough of weight, and worth, <hi>in that very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
(i. e.</hi> in what we expect) to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh
them all; and to render the exercise
thereof highly reasonable upon that acount.
<hi>I reckon</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>that the sufferings
of this present time, are not worthy to be comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:48660:224"/>
(saith he) <hi>I reckon,</hi> i. e. it is my stated, setled
judgment, not a suddain rash thought. When
I have reason'd the matter with my self,
weigh'd it well, consider'd the case, turn'd
it round, view'd it exactly on every side; bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanc'd
advantages, and disadvantages, ponder'd
all things, which are fit to come into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about it; <hi>this is the result,</hi> the final deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;
that which I conclude and judge
at last (judgment is the last product, and issue
of the most exquisite enquiry, and debate; the
ultimate, and most perfect act of reason) that
the <hi>sufferings of this now of time</hi> are of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue;
things not fit, as it were, to be mentioned
the same day, <hi>with the glory to be revealed, &amp;c.</hi> It
can therefore be no <hi>hard Law,</hi> no unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
imposition, that shall oblige us to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of patience, under such sufferings,
<hi>in the expectation of so transcendent glory.</hi> For,
consider,</p>
            <p>First, These sufferings are but from men;
(For the sufferings, of which the Apostle here
speaks, are such as wherein we suffer together
with Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> for his Name, and Interest, on
behalf of the Christian cause.) But this glory
is from God. How disproportionable must
the effects be of a created, and increated
cause.</p>
            <p>Again, These sufferings reach no further
then the bone and flesh. (<hi>Fear not them that
kill the body, and, after they have done that,</hi>
can do no more, &amp;c.) But this glory reaches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and transforms the soul. How little can a
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:48660:225"/>
clod of earth suffer, in comparison of what an
immortal Spirit may enjoy?</p>
            <p>And further, There is much mixture in our
present sufferings. The present state of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Saints</hi> is not a state of <hi>total misery.</hi> There
are, as it were Raies of Glory <hi>interlac't</hi> with their
present afflictions; but there will be nothing
of Affliction mingled with their future Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>Yea, and (what may not only convince, but
even transport us too) these sufferings are but
<hi>temporary</hi> (nay, but <hi>momentary.</hi>) This <hi>glory
eternal.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor 4. 17.</note> What heart is big enough to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the full sense of these words. <hi>Our light
affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us
a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi>
How might I dwell here upon every sillable,
<hi>light affliction,</hi> weighty glory [exceeding

of glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>O then, how unworthy is it of the Christian
name, and hopes, that we should have an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
resentment of this Method God fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
with us (as he did with our great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
and Lord) that we should suffer first,
and then enter into glory! Heaven were a poor
Heaven, if it would not make us savers. It
were high time for us to give over the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
profession, if we do not really account that
it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> reward, and hope do surmount its reproach,
and trouble; or do think its Cross more
weighty, then its Crown. Is the price, and
worth of eternal glory fal'n? It hath been
counted worth suffering for. There have been
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:48660:225"/>
those in the world, that would not accept deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
from these sufferings, that they might
obtain the better resurrection. Are we grown
wiser? or would we indeed wish God should
turn the Tables, and assign us our good things
here, and hereafter evil things? ungrateful
souls! How severe should we be to our selves?
that we should be so apt to <hi>complain,</hi> for what
we should <hi>admire</hi> and give thanks. What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
purer, and more refined Christianity in
our time, and in this part of the world, hath
had publick favour and countenance, can we
therefore not tell how to frame our minds to
the thoughts of suffering? Are <hi>Tribulation</hi> &amp; <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi>
antiquated names? quite out of date, and
use with us? and more ungrateful to our ears
and hearts, then heaven and eternal glory are
acceptable? And had we rather (if we were
in danger of suffering on the Christian ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count)
run a hazard, as to the <hi>latter,</hi> then adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
on the <hi>former?</hi> Or do we think it impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
we should ever come to the trial, or be
concern'd to busie our selves with such
thoughts? Is the world become so stable, and
so unacquainted with vicissitudes, that a state
of things less favourable to our profession can
never revolve upon us? It were however not
unuseful to put such a case by way of suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to our selves. For every sincere Christian
is in affection, and preparation of his mind a
Martyr. He that loves not Christ better then
<hi>his own life, cannot be his Disciple.</hi> We should,
at least inure our thoughts more to a suffering
state; that we may thence take some occasion to
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:48660:226"/>
reflect, and judge of the temper of our hearts
towards the Name and Cause of Christ. 'Tis
easie suffering indeed, <hi>in Idaea,</hi> and <hi>contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,</hi>
but something may be collected from
<hi>the observation,</hi> how we can relish and comport
with such thoughts. 'Tis <hi>as training</hi> in order
to sight; which is done, often, upon every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
supposition, that such occasions may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
fall out.</p>
            <p>Therefore what now do we think of it? If
our way, into the Kingdom of God, shall be
through many tribulations. If, before we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

entertained with the less pleasing sight of the
frowning aspect, and visage of an angry world.
If we first bear the image of a crucified Christ,
e're we partake of the likeness of a glorious
God? what, do we regret the thoughts of it?
Do we account we shall be ill dealt with, and
have an hard bargain of it? O how tender are
we grown in comparison of the hardiness
and magnanimity of Primitive Christians?
we have not the patience to <hi>think</hi> of what they
had the patience to <hi>endure.</hi> We should not
yet forget our selves, that such a thing belongs
to our profession, even in this way to testifie our
fidelity to Christ, and our value of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,

<pb n="392" facs="tcp:48660:227"/>
those of Faith. And is not this appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
the case with the Christians of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
age. Do not your thoughts run the same
course with theirs, that meditated nothing but
sitting on the right and left hand of Christ, in
an earthly dominion? while they never
dream't of drinking of his Cup, or being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
with his Baptism? How many vain
dreamers have we of golden mountains and (I

Prophesies about a (supposed) near
approaching prosperity to the Church on
earth, gain easier belief, or are more savory,
and taking with too many; then all that the
Sacred Oracles discover about its glorious
state in heaven? Hence are our shoulders so
unfitted to Christs yoke (like the unaccustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Heifer) and the business of suffering will
not enter into our hearts. Methinks the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
and expectation of such a state hereafter,
should make us even regardless of what we
see, or suffer here; and render the good, or
evil things of time, as indifferent to us. Yet

them, or a gross conceited ignorance,
misunderdanding the terms of the Gospel,
and thinking themselves to be in a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
as to eternity when the case is much
otherwise with them.</p>
            <p>Take heed thy willingness to dye be from
no such inducements; but a meer desire of
being with God, and of attaining his perfection
and blessedness, which he hath ingaged thee
in the pursuit and expectation of. And then,
having made sure it be right as to the rise and
principle. Be careful, <hi>It be not under in
point of degree.</hi> i. e. a cold intermittent vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leity
is too little on the one hand. And a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
precipitant hasting is too much on
the other. The middle and desirable temper
here is <hi>a complacential submission to the Divine
will in that affair,</hi> with <hi>a preponderating inclination
on our part, towards our eternal home, if the Lord
see good.</hi> For we have two things to attend in
this business, and by which our Spirits may be
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:48660:229"/>
sway'd this way or that. i. e. <hi>the goodnss of
the object to be chosen,</hi> and the <hi>will of God which
must guide and over-rule our choice;</hi> the former
whereof we are permitted to eye in subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to the Latter, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            <p>Now our apprehension of the desirableness
and intrinsique goodness of the object ought
to be such (we are Infidels else, if we have not
that account of it) that nothing we can eye
under the notion of <hi>a good to us,</hi> may be
reckon'd so eligible as that. viz. <hi>our final and
compleat blessedness in the other world,</hi> which
because, we know, we cannot enjoy without
dying, death also must be judged more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
then Life, that is, Our Blessedness
must be judged, <hi>eligible for it self,</hi> and <hi>Death
as requisite</hi> to make it <hi>present.</hi> So that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
object we are discoursing of, being <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Blessedness,</hi> Consider it in comparison
with any thing else, that can be lookt upon by
us, as a <hi>good which we our selves are to enj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y,</hi> it
ought to be preferr'd and chosen out of hand,
in as much as nothing can be so great <hi>a present
good to us,</hi> as that. And this ought to be
the proper habitual inclination of our Spirits,
their constant frame and bent, as they respect
onely <hi>our own interest and welfare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But considering Gods Dominion over us,
and interest in our Lives and Beings; and
that as well ingenuity, as necessity binds us
to be Subject to <hi>his pleasure,</hi> we should here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
patiently suffer our selves to be over-ruled
thereby, and not so abstractly mind our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:48660:230"/>
and contentment in this matter; as if
we were altogether our own; and had no
Lord over us. <hi>Plato</hi> who abounds in discourses
of the desirableness of dying, and of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
change it makes with them that are good.
Yet hath this apt expression of the subjection
<hi>we</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ght to be into the Divine pleasure as to this
matter. <q>That the soul is in the body as soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
in a garrison,<note place="margin">In Phaedone. Vid. &amp; N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

not withdraw themselves without his order
and direction who placed them there?</q> And
expostulates thus. <q>If (saith he) a slave of
yours should destroy his own Life, without
your consent would you not be displeas'd;
and, if there had been any place left for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
been apt enough to that too?</q> So he
brings in <hi>Socrates</hi> discoursing, and discovers
himself, herein to have had more Light in this
matter touching that subordinate interest only,
men have in their own lives, and the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of self murther (as he had in other things
too) then most heathens of the more refined
Sect ever arrived to.</p>
            <p>If therefore God would give us leave to dye,
we should, <hi>upon our own account,</hi> be much more
enclin'd to chuse it; but, while he thinks fit
to have it defer'd, should yeild to his will,
with an unrepining submission. Onely it ought
not to rest at all, <hi>on our part,</hi> or that, <hi>as to our
selves</hi> we find any thing more grateful to us in
this world, that we are willing to stay a day
longer in it. That <hi>for our own sakes,</hi> we should
affect a continuance here; would argue a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
sordid Spirit. But then such should be
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:48660:230"/>
our dutiful filial Love to the Father of our
Spirits, that in pure devotedness to his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests;
we would be content to dwel (if he
would have it so) a Methuselahs age in an
earthly tabernacle for his service; that is, that
we may help to preserve his memorial in a e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsed
world (over-run with Atheisme, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of its Maker) and win him hearts
and love (to our uttermost) among his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postate
disloyal creatures; and in our capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
be helpful to the encouragement of such as
he continues in the world, for the same purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
This is the very temper the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses,
when in that strait,<note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 1.</note> which way the
poise of his own Spirit enclin'd him, in the
consideration of his own interest; and what
was <hi>simply more eligible to him.</hi> He expresses
with High Emphasis; <hi>to be with Christ,</hi> saith,
he is <hi>more</hi> desirable to me (for there are two
comparatives in the Greek Text) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he professes his <hi>own desire</hi> in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
to be <hi>dissolved;</hi> but that <hi>private desire</hi> was
not so <hi>peremptory,</hi> and <hi>absolute,</hi> but he could
make it yeild, and give place to his duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, and his Church, as it follows. So
we know 'tis possible that, respects to a friend
may oversway a mans own particular inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and the inclination remain notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
but is subdued onely; otherwise had
any reason or argument, that did respect <hi>my self</hi>
perswaded me to change it; I should then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
but my own proper inclination still; and
so my friend hath nothing to thank me
for.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="400" facs="tcp:48660:231"/>
So it ought to be with us here; <hi>our inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
should preponderate towards a present
change of our state, onely our devotedness to
<hi>his</hi> interest and pleasure, <hi>whose</hi> we are, should
easily over-rule it. This is the Lovely temper
of a gracious Spirit, as to this thing, that <hi>to dye
might be our choice,</hi> and <hi>to live, in the mean time,
submitted to as our duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As an ingenuous son whom his father hath
employ'd abroad in a forrain Country, though
duty did bind him cheerfully therein, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with his fathers will and the necessity of
his affairs, yet, when his Father shall signifie to
him, that now he understands no necessity of
his longer continuance there, and therefore he
may, if he please, return but he shall have leave
to follow his own inclination, Tis not hard to
conjecture that the desire of seeing a Fathers
face, would soon determine the choice of such
a son that way.</p>
            <p>But how remote are the generality of them
that profess themselves God's Children from
that pious ingenuity. We have taken root in
the earth and forgotten our heavenly originals
and alliances. We are as <hi>inhabitants</hi> here, not
<hi>pilgrims;</hi> hardly perswaded to entertain with
any patience the thoughts of leaving our places
on earth; which yet, do we what we can, shall
shortly know us no more.</p>
            <p>In short then; that vile temper of Spirit
against which I professedly bend my self in
the following discourse is; when men, not out
of any sense of duty towards God, or sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
for their own Souls, but of a meer sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:48660:231"/>
love to the body, and affixedness of heart
to the Earth, and terrene things, cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the thoughts of dying. And that, which
I perswade to, is, That having the true pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of the future blessedness before our
eyes, and our hearts possest with the
comfortable hope of attaining to it, we
shake off our earthly inclinations; and expect
with desire and joy the time of our dismissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hence, that we may enjoy it, which is
the design of what was promised in the next
place. <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>The inforcement of this instruction;</hi> Suffer
we therefore our selves to be reason'd with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this matter. And let us consider whether
we can in good earnest think such an aversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as we discover, to our blessed translation
hence, an excusable, a tolerable temper; or
whether it be not highly reasonable, that we
should entertain the thoughts, at least, with
more content, and patience (if not with more
fervent desire) of our departure hence, and
introduction into that other state.</p>
            <p>Let me demand of thee; dost thou this regret
the thoughts of death, as being unwilling to
dye at all, or as being unwilling to dye as yet?
is it the thing it self, or only the circumstance
of time, that thou exceptest against? 'Tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thou wilt say that which will seem more
plausible, and so fix only on the latter; and
that thou wilt not profess to desire an <hi>eternity</hi>
on earth, but only <hi>more time.</hi> Well, let that
for present be supposed as it is a more <hi>modest,</hi>
so to be a <hi>true</hi> account of thy desires; Yet
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:48660:232"/>
what is the reason of this moderation with
thee herein? and that thou so limitest thy self?
Is it that thou believest the blessedness of the
other state will prove better then any thing
thou canst enjoy here? and that thou art not
willing eternally to be deprived of? but dost
thou not think it is <hi>now</hi> better also? And what
canst thou pretend, why, what is <hi>now</hi> the best,
and most desirable good, should not be <hi>now</hi> cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
and desired out of hand? or is it that thou
thinkest it unbecomes thee to cross the Supreme
will of him that made thee, who hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
<hi>that all men once shall die?</hi> And then,
how knowest thou but he hath also determined
concerning thee, that thou shalt die the next
day or hour? and 'tis only <hi>a present willingness
to die in subordination to the Divine Will,</hi> or <hi>upon
supposition of it,</hi> thou art perswaded to. Why
art thou not affraid, lest thy <hi>present unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
should cross <hi>his present will?</hi> Dost thou
not think that Soveraign power is as sufficient
to determine of the circumstance, as the thing
it self? And art thou not ashamed to pretend
an agreement with God about the <hi>thing it self,</hi>
and yet d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffer with him about a <hi>circumstance?</hi>
shall that be a ground of quarrel between him
and thee?</p>
            <p>But while thou onely professest that more
modest desire of more time in the world, what
security can'st thou give that when that desire
hath been liberally gratified, it shall at length
be laid down, and tumultuate no more? What
bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nds wilt thou fix to it, which thou darest
undertake it shall not pass? <hi>Art</hi> thou sure
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:48660:232"/>
when thou shalt have lain at the Worlds Breast
ten or twenty years longer, thou wilt then ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
thy self to have drawn it dry? or that then
thou shalt begin to nauseate the World, and
wish for Heaven? Or hast thou not reason
from thy former experience to suspect that the
longer thou dwellest on Earth, the more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
thou wilt grow; and that if thou be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed
to leave it this day, or year, thou wilt
be more so the next; and so thy desire be-become
boundless and infinite, which is to
desire to be here alwayes, the thing which
thou seem'dst so unwilling to own.</p>
            <p>And if that prove at last, the true state of
thy case, art thou then a Christian, or art thou
a Man, that thou harbourest in thy breast so
irreligious, and irrational, yea, so sordid a
wish?</p>
            <p>What, wish eternally to be affixt to a Clod
of Earth? Is that at length become thy God?
Or wilt thou say he is thy God, whom thou
never desirest to enjoy? or that thou hast alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
enough of him, but not of the world? And
yet that he is thy God? or would'st thou over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
the Laws of Nature; and subvert the
most Sacred, Divine Constitutions, abortive
the designes of Eternal Wisdom, and Love,
evacuate, and nullifie the great Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of thy merciful, and mighty Redeemer?
onely to gratifie a Sensual, Bruitish Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour?</p>
            <p>But evident it is, thou dost onely in vain dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
thy self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou canst not disturb the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
order of things. Eternal Laws are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealable
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:48660:233"/>
by a fond wish. Thou set'st that
dreadful thing <hi>Death,</hi> at nothing the further
distance, by thine abhorrency of it. It will
overtake thee whether thou wilt or no; and
methinks thine own reason should instruct
thee to a temper and forme thy self to what thou
can'st not avoid, and possess thee with such
thoughts and desires, as those of that discreet
Pagan, <q>Lead me, O God, (saith he) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou wilt,<note place="margin">Epictet</note> and I will follow thee willingly,
but, if I be rebellious, &amp; refuse, I shall follow
thee notwithstanding.</q> What we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,
'tis better to bear willingly, then with
a regret, that shall be both <hi>vain,</hi> and <hi>affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what hast thou hitherto met with in
the world, that should so highly endear it to
thee? Examine, and search more narrowly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy earthly comforts, what is there in them
to make them self-desirable, or to be so
for their <hi>own sakes?</hi> what is it to have thy flesh
indulged and pleased; to have thy sense gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified?
thy phansie tickled? what so great good,
worthy of an immortal reasonable Spirit, canst
thou find in Meats, and Drinks, in full Barns,
and Coffers, in vulgar Fame, and Applause,
that should render these things desireable for
themselves?</p>
            <p>And if there were any real felicity in these
things <hi>for the present,</hi> whil'st thou art permitted
enjoy them, yet dost thou not know that what
thou enjoyest to day, thou mayst lose to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and that such other unthought of evils
may be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>all thee; as may infuse a bitterness
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:48660:233"/>
into all thou enjoyest, which causes, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
the <hi>injoyment</hi> to cease, while the <hi>things
themselves</hi> remain, and will be equal to a total
loss of all?</p>
            <p>
               <q>And thus (as the Morallist ingeniously
speaks) thou wilt continually need ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
happiness to defend the former,<note place="margin">Sen. de brev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</note> and
new wishes must still be made on the behalf
of those which have already succeeded.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But canst thou indeed think it worth the
while, that the Maker of the Universe should
create a Soul, and send it down into the world
on purpose, to superintend these trivial affairs,
to keep alive a silly piece of well figured earth,
while it eats, and drinks; to move it to and fro
in chase of shadows; to hold it up, while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
bow the knee, and do it homage, if it
had not some higher work to mind in reference
to another state? Art thou contented to live
long in the world, to such purposes? what low
worthless Spirit is this, that had rather be so
imploy'd, then in the visions of this Makers
face? that chuses thus to entertain it self <hi>on
earth,</hi> rather then partake the effusions of
Divine glory <hi>above. That had rather creep with
Worms, then soar with Angels, associate with
Bruits, then with the Spirits of just men made
perfect,</hi> who can solve the <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> or give
a rational account why there should be such a
Creature as man upon the Earth, abstructing
from the hopes of another world? who can
think it the effect of an infinite wisdom? or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it a more worthy design, then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
of such a Scene of actions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:48660:234"/>
by Puppets on a Stage? for my part, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

life of man upon earth,</hi> that should render it

(supposing the free option given

            <p>Yea, and is there not enough obvious in

a future blessedness in another world, to

then what only toucheth our flesh and

reason to be so much in love with so unkind
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> world? Is it not strange our very <hi>Bridewel,</hi>
should be such a <hi>Heaven</hi> to us? But these things
are little considerable in comparison of the
more Spiritual grievances of Christians as
such, that is, those that afflict our Souls,
while we are (under the conduct of Christ)
designing for a blessed eternity; if we indeed
make that our business, and do seriously intend
our spirits in order thereto. The dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our beclouded minds! The glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ineffectual apprehension we have of the
most important things! the inconsistency of
our shattered thoughts, when we would apply
them to Spiritual Objects. The great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of working off an ill frame of heart, and
the no less difficulty of retaining a good! our
being so frequently tost as between Heaven
and Hell; when we sometimes think our
selves to have even attained, and hope to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
no more; and are, all on a suddain
plung'd in the Ditch, so as that our own
Clothes might abhor us, fall so low into an
earthly temper that we can like nothing
Heavenly, or Divine; and because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
are enforced justly, most of all to
dislike our selves. Are these things little
with us? How can we forbear to cry out of the
depths, to the Father of our Spirits, that he
would pity, and relieve his own Off-spring? yea
are we not weary of our crying? and yet
more weary of holding in? How do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
Temptations return again? and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
Corruptions, recover strength?
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:48660:235"/>
We know not when our work is done.
We are miserable that we need to be
always watching, and more miserable, that
we cannot watch, but are so often sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
and overcome of evil. We say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with our selves we will seek relief in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement;
but we cannot retire from our
selves, or in converse with Godly friends, but
they sometimes prove snares to us, and we
to them. Or we hear, but our own mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
repeated in their complaints, would
we pray? How faint is the breath we utter?
How long is it ere we can get our Souls pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest,
with any becoming apprehensions of
God, or lively sense of our own concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
Would we meditate? We sometimes
go about to compose our thoughts, but we may
as well assay to hold the Windes in our fist.
If we venture forth into the world, how do our
Senses betray us? How are we mockt with
their impostures? Their <hi>neerer</hi> objects become
with us, the onely realities, and eternal things
are all vanisht into airie shadowes. <hi>Reason</hi>
and <hi>Faith</hi> are laid asleep, and our <hi>Sense</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
to us what we are to believe, and do,
as if it were our only guide, and Lord. And
what are we not yet wearie? Is it reasonable
to continue in this State <hi>of our own choice?</hi>
Is misery become so <hi>natural</hi> to us, so much
our element, that we cannot affect to live out
of it? Is the darkness and dirt of a dungeon
more grateful to us then a free open air
and sun. Is this Flesh of ours so lovely
a thing that we had rather suffer so many
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:48660:235"/>
deaths in it; then one in putting it off and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
with it? While we carry it about us,
our Souls impart a kind of life to it, and it
gives them death in exchange. Why do we
not cry out more feelingly, <hi>O wretched
man that I am, who shall deliver me from this
Body of Death?</hi> Is it not grievous to us to
have so cumbersome a yoke-fellow, to be tied
(as <hi>Mezentius</hi> is said to have done) the living
and the dead together.</p>
            <p>Do not we find the Distempers of our Spirits
are mostly from these bodies we are so in love
with, either as the proper Springs, or as the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of them. From what cause is our
drowsy sloth, our eager passions, our aversion
to Spiritual objects but from this impure Flesh,
or what else is the Subject about which our
vexatious cares, or torturing fears, our bitter
griefs are taken up day by day.</p>
            <p>And why do we not consider that 'tis onely
our love to it that gives strength and vigour to
the most of our temptations as wherein it is
more immediately concern'd, and which makes
them so often victorious, &amp; thence to become our
after-afflictions. He that hath learn'd to mortifie
the inordinate love of the Body, will he make
it the business of his life to purvey for it? Will
he offer violence to his own Soul, to secure it
from violence? will he comply with mens Lusts
and humors for its advantage, and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
or yeild himself to the tyranny of his
own <hi>avarice</hi> for its future, or of his <hi>more-sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Lusts?</hi> for its <hi>present</hi> content? Will it not
rather be pleasing to him that his outward man
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:48660:236"/>
be exposed to perish while his inward man is
renewed day by day? He to whom the thoughts
are grateful of laying it down, will not (though
he neglect not duty towards it) spend his days
in its continual Service, and make his Soul an
hell, by a continual provision for the flesh, and
the Lusts of it. That is cruel Love that shall
enslave a man and subject him to so vile and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble
a servitude. And it discovers a sordid
temper to be so imposed upon. How low are
our Spirits sunk that we disdain not so base a
vassalage? God and nature have obliged us to
live in bodies for a time, but they have not
obliged us to measure our selves by them, to
confine our desires and designs to their compass,
to look no further then their concernments,
to entertain no previous joyes in the hope of
being one day delivered from them. No such
hard law is laid upon us. But how apt are we
to become herein, a most oppressive Law to our
selves; and not only to lodge in filthy earthen
cottage but to love them, and confine our
selves to them, loath so much as to peep out.
Tis the apt expression of a Philosopher upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
hat base low temper.<note place="margin">

It expresses nothing of the duty and ingenuity,
but much of the frowardness and folly of a
child. They sometimes cry vehemently in the

by the most indulgent Parent? or are they
fit to be imitated by us?</p>
            <p>We have no excuse for this our frowardness.
The Blessed God hath told us his gracious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
concerning us; and we are capable of
understanding him. What if he had totally
hidden from us our future state; and that we
know nothing, but of going into an eternal si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent-darkness?
The Authority of a Creator
ought to have awed us into a silent submission;
But when we are told of such a glory; that 'tis
but drawing aside this fleshly vaile, and we
presently behold it, methinks the Blessed hour
should be expected not with patience only but
with ravishing joy.</p>
            <p>Did we hear of a country in this world,
where we might live in continual felicity,
without toyl, or sickness, or grief, or fear, who
would not wish to be there; though the
passage were troublesome? have we not heard
enough of Heaven to allure us thither? Or is
<hi>the eternal truth</hi> of suspected credit with us?
Are Gods own reports of the future glory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
our belief or regard?</p>
            <p>How many, upon the credit of his word
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:48660:238"/>
are gone already triumphantly into glory?
<hi>That only seeing the promises afar off, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded

We are not the first that are to open
Heaven. The main Body of Saints is already
there, 'tis in comparison of their number,
but a scattering remnant, that are now alive u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the earth. How should we long to be
associated to that glorious Assembly? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
we should much more regret our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so long left behind.</p>
            <p>But if we should desire still to be so, why
may not all others as well as we? And as much
expect to be gratified as we? And then we
should agree in desiring, that our Redeemers
triumph might be defer'd, that his Body
might yet remain incompleat, that he might
still be debarr'd of the long expected fruit of
the travail of his Soul. that the name of God
might be still subjected to the blasphemy and
and reproach of an Atheistical world, who
have long ago said, with derision, where is the
promise of his coming? Would we have all
his Designs to be still unfinisht? and so
mighty wheeles stand still for us? while we
sport our selves in the dust of the earth? And
indulge our sensual inclination; which sure
this bold desire must argue to be very predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
in us, and take heed it argue not its ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual
prevalency.</p>
            <p>At least if it discover not our present <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality,</hi>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:48660:238"/>
it discovers our former <hi>Sloth,</hi> and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleness.
It may be, we may excuse our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versness
to dye, by our unpreparedness, that is
one fault with another (though that be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the case I am speaking of) what then have
we been doing all this while? What were the
affairs of thy Soul not thought of till now?
Take then thy repro of from a Heathen, that it
may convince thee the more. <q>No one, saith
he divides away his money from himself, but
yet men divide away their very life— but
doth it not shame thee (he after adds) to
reserve only the reliques of thy life to thy
self, and to devote that time only to a good
mind, which thou canst employ upon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing? How late is it to begin to live
when we should make an end? and deser all
good thoughts to such an Age as possible few
do ever reach to. The truth is (as he speaks)
we have not little time but we lose much
we have time enough were it well employ'd
therefore we cannot say we receive a short
life but we make it so, we are not indigent of
time, but prodigal, what a pretty contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is it to complain of the shortness of time,
and yet do what we can to precipitate its
course? to hasten it by that we call pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime.
If it have been so with thee art thou
to be trusted with more time?</q>
            </p>
            <p>But as thy case is I cannot wonder that the
thoughts of death be most unwellcome to thee,
who art thou that thou shouldst desire the
day of the Lord? I can onely say to thee
<hi>hasten thy preparation,</hi> have recourse to Rule 2.
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:48660:239"/>
and 3d. and accordingly guide thy self till
thou find thy Spirit made more suitable to this
blessedness; that it become savory and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to thy soul, and thy heart be set upon it.
Hence thou may'st be reconciled to the grave,
and the thoughts of death may cease to be a
terror to thee.</p>
            <p>And when thou art attained so far, consider
thy great advantage in being willing and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to dye upon this further account, that thy
desire shall now be pitch't upon a thing so
certain. Thine other desires have met with
many a disappointment. Thou hast set thy
heart upon other things, and they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
thy most earnest, thirsty expectations.
Death will not do so. Thou wilt now have
one certain hope. One thing in reference
whereto thou may'st say, <hi>I am sure.</hi> Wait
a while, this peaceful sleep will shortly seize
thy body, and awaken thy soul. It will calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
period all thy troubles, and bring thee to a
blessed rest.</p>
            <p>But now, if onely the meer terrour and
gloominess of <hi>dying,</hi> trouble thy thoughts, this
of all other, seems the most inconsiderable
pretence against a willing surrender of our
selves to death. <hi>Reason</hi> hath overcome it, <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
courage,</hi> yea, <hi>some mens Atheism,</hi> shall
not <hi>Faith?</hi> Are we not ashamed to consider
what confidence, and desire of death, some
<hi>Heathens</hi> have exprest? some that have had no
preapprehension, or belief of another state,
(though there were very few of them) and
so no hope of a consequent blessedness to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:48660:239"/>
them, have yet thought it unreasonable
to disgust the thoughts of death. What
would'st thou think if thou had'st nothing but
the Sophisms of such to oppose to all thy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
thoughts? I have met with<note n="*" place="margin">Epicurus in Gassend. Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tag.</note> one arguing
thus;—<q>Death which is accounted the most
dreadful of all evils, is nothing to us (saith
he) because while we are in being, Death
is not yet present, and when Death is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
we are not in being; so that it neither
concerns us, as living, nor dead; for while we
are alive, it hath not touch't us, when we
are dead, we are not—. Moreover (saith he)
the exquisite knowledge of this, that Death
belongs not to us, makes us injoy this mortal
life with comfort, not by adding any thing
to our uncertain time, but by taking away
the desire of immortality.</q> Shall they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
themselves upon so wretched a ground,
with a little Sophistry, and the hope of extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
all desire of immortality? and shall
not we, by cherishing the blessed hope of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
shortly an immortal glory?</p>
            <p>Others of them have spoken magnificently
of a certain contempt of this bodily life, and
<hi>a not onely not fearing,</hi> but <hi>desiring to dye,</hi> upon a
sixed apprehension of the distinct, and, purer and
immortal nature of the soul; and the precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved
hope of a consequent felicity. I shall
set down some of their words, added to what
have been occasionally mentioned (amongst
that plentiful variety wherewith one might fill

God should grant me to become a Child a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,<note place="margin">Cato in Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone de Senect.</note>
to send forth my renewed infant-cries
from my Cradle, and, having even run
out my race, to begin it again; I should most
earnestly refuse it; for what profit hath this
life? and how much toil?—Yet I do not
repent that I have lived, because, I
hope, I have not liv'd in vain. And
I now go out of this life, not as out of my
dwelling house, but my Inn. O blessed day,
when I shall enter into that Council and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of souls, and depart from this rude,
and disorderly rout, and crew, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I shall adde another (of a not much unlike

Heir of Divine things, (as being either not an open or
no constant friend to Christianity</hi>) <q>Saith, he cannot
be, who is in love with this animal, sensitive
life; but only that purest mind, that is inspired
from above, that partake of an Heavenly,
and Divine portion; that onely despises the
body, &amp;c. with much more of like import.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, so have some been transported with the
<hi>desire of immortality,</hi> that (being wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

not forbear doing violence to themselves.</p>

                  </gap>t. lib. 8.</note> two thousand years ago,
were a sort of wise men, as they were called,
that held it a reproach to dye of age, or a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:48660:241"/>
and were wont to burn themselves alive,
thinking the flames were polluted, if they came
amidst them dead.</p>
            <p>The story of <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> is famous,<note place="margin">Cicer. Quae Tuscul.</note> who hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Plato</hi> discourse of the immortality of
the soul, by the Sea side, leapt from him into
the Sea, that he might presently be in that
state. And 'tis storied that<note n="*" place="margin">Scil. Domiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus aliquoties sic dictas.</note> 
               <hi>Nero</hi> refused to
put <hi>Apollonius</hi> to death, though he were very
much incenst against him,<note place="margin">Philostr. in vit. Apoll. Tyanaei.</note> only upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
he had, that he was very desirous
to dye, because he would not so far gratifie
him.</p>
            <p>I onely make this improvement of all this,
Christian <hi>Principles, Rule</hi> do neither hurry,
nor misguide men; but the <hi>end</hi> (as we have it
revealed) should much more powerfully, and
constantly attract us. Nothing is more unsuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to <hi>Christianity</hi> our <hi>way,</hi> nor to that <hi>blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
the <hi>end</hi> of it, then a terrene Spirit. They
have nothing of the true light, and impress
of the Gospel, now; nor are they ever like to
attain the Vision of the blessed face of God,
and the impress of his likeness hereafter, that
desire it not above all things; and are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to quit all things else for it.</p>
            <p>And is it not a just exprobration of our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and carnality, if meer Philosophers,
and Pagans, shall give better proof then we,
of a spirit erected above the world, and aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from what is temporary, and terrene? Shall
their Gentilism outvy our Christianity? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
a generous indignation of this reproach
should inflame our souls, and contribute some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:48660:242"/>
to the refining of them to a better and
more Spiritual temper.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, O all you that name your
selves by that worthy name of <hi>Christians;</hi> that
profess the Religion taught by him, that was
not of the earth, earthly, but the Lord from
heaven; you that are partakers of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
calling. Consider the great Apostle
and High-priest of your profession; who only
took our flesh, that we might partake of his
Spirit; bare our earthly, that we might bare
his heavenly Image; descended, that he might
cause us to ascend. Seriously bethink your
selves of the Scope and end of his <hi>Apostleship</hi>
and <hi>Priesthood.</hi> He was <hi>sent</hi> out from God to
invite and conduct you to him, to bring you
into the Communion of his glory and blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
He came upon a Message and Treaty
of peace. To discover his Fathers love and
win yours. To let you know how kind thoughts
the God of love had conceived to you-wards.
And that, however you had hated him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cause, and were bent to do so without end;
he was not so affected towards you. To settle
a friendship and to admit you to the participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his eternal glory. Yea he came to give
an instance, and exemplifie to the world in
his own Person how much of heaven he could
make to dwell in mortal flesh: how possible he
could render it to live in this world, as unrela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to it, How gloriously the divine life could
triumph over all the infirmities of frail huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
And so leave men a certain proof and
pledge, to what perfections humane nature
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:48660:242"/>
should be improv'd by his grace and Spirit,
in all them that should resign themselves to
his conduct, and follow his steps. That hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth were not so far asunder, but he
knew how to settle a commerce and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
between them. That an heavenly life
was <hi>possible</hi> to be transacted here, and <hi>certain</hi>
to be gloriously rewarded hereafter.</p>
            <p>And having testifi'd these things, he seals
the Testimony; and opens the way for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of all by his death. Your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<hi>Apostle,</hi> becomes a <hi>Priest,</hi> and a <hi>Sacrifice</hi>
at once. That no doubt might remain among
men of his sincerity, in what, even dying he
ceased not to profess, and avow. And that by
his own propitiatory bloud a mutual reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
might be wrought between God and you;
that your hearts might be won to him, and
possest with an ingenuous shame of your ever
having been his enemies. And that his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
might for ever cease towards you, and
be turned into everlasting friendship and love.
That eternal redemption being obtained, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
might be opened to you, and you finally,
be received to the glory of God. Your hearts
being bent thitherward and made willing to
run through whatsoever difficulties of life or
death to attain it. Do not think that Christ
came into the world, and dyed to procure the
pardon of your sins; and so translate you
to heaven; while your hearts should still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
cleaving to the earth. He came, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to prepare a way for you? and then call,
not drag you thither. That by his Precepts,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:48660:243"/>
and Promises, and Example and Spirit, he
might form and fashion your Souls to that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
state. And make you willing to abandon
all things for it. And low now the God of all
grace is calling you by Jesus Christ unto his
eternal Glory. Direct then your eyes and
hearts to that marke, the Prise of the High
calling of God in Christ Jesus. 'Tis ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
by the common suffrage of the civiliz'd
world not to intend the proper business of our
Callings. To your Calling to forsake this
world, and mind the other, make hast then
to quit your selves of your entanglements, of
all earthly dispositions and affections. Learn
to live in this world as those that are not of
it; that expect, every day and wish to leave it
whose hearts are gone already.</p>
            <p>'Tis dreadful to dye with pain and regret;
To be forced out of the Body; To dye a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
death and go away with an unwilling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluctant
heart. <hi>The wicked is driven away in
his wickedness.</hi> Fain he would stay longer,
but cannot. <hi>He hath not power over the Spirit,
to retain the Spirit nor hath he power in death.</hi>
He must away whether he will or no. And
indeed much against his will. So it cannot
but be where there is not a previous knowledge
and love of a better state, where the Soul
understands it not, and is not effectually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered
and framed to it.</p>
            <p>O get then the lovely Image of the future
glory into your minds, keep it ever before
your eyes. Make it familiar to your thoughts.
Imprint daily there these words. <hi>I shall behold
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:48660:243"/>
thy face, I shall be satisfied with thy likeness.</hi>
And see that your souls be inrich't with that
<hi>righteousness,</hi> Have inwrought into them that
holy rectitude, that may dispose them to that
blessed state. Then will you dye with your
own consent, and go away, not driven, but
allur'd, and drawn. You will go, as the redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Lord, with everlasting joy upon their
heads. As those that know whether you go,
even to a state infinitely worthy of your desires,
and choice, and where 'tis best for you to be.
You will part with your souls, not by a forcible
separation, but a joyful surrender and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation.
They will dislodge from this earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Tabernnacle, rather <hi>as putting it off,</hi> then
having it rent and torn away.</p>
            <p>Loosen your selves from this body by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
as we do any thing we would remove
from a place where it sticks fast. Gather up
your spirits into themselves. Teach them to
look upon themselves, as distinct thing. Inure
them to the thoughts of a dissolution. Be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
as taking leave. Cross, and disprove
the common maxime; and let your hearts,
which they use to say, are wont to dye last, dye
first. Prevent death, and be mortifi'd towards
every earthly thing beforehand; that death
mave have nothing to kill but your body. And
that you may not die a double death in one
hour; and suffer the death of your body, and
of your love to it, both at once. Much less
that <hi>this</hi> should survive, to your greater (and
even incurable) misery.</p>
            <p>Shake off your Bands and Fetters, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:48660:244"/>
affections, that so closely confine you to the
house of your bondage. And lift up your
heads in expectation of the approaching Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee,
the day of your redemption; when you
are to go out free, and enter into the glorious
liberty of the Sons of God. When you shall
serve, and groan, and complain no longer. Let
it be your continual song, and the matter of
your daily praise; that the time of your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
deliverance is hastening on; that ete long
you shall be absent from the body, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with the Lord. That he hath not doom'd
you to an everlasting imprisonment within
those closs and clayie walls; wherein you have
been so long shut up from the beholding of
his sight and glory. In the thoughts of this,
while the outward man is sensibly perishing,
let the inward revive, and be renewed day by
day.<note place="margin">Max. Tyr. D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
