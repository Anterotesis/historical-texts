            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>TO what ill purposes soever Poetry has been abus'd, its true and genuine End is by universal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, the Instruction of our Minds, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of our Manners; for which 'tis furnish'd with so many excellent Advantages. The Delicacy of its Strains, the Sweetness and Harmony of its Numbers, the lively and admirable manner of its Painting or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation, and the wonderful Force of its Eloquence, cannot but open the Passages to our Breasts, triumph over our Passions, and leave behind them very deep Impressions. 'Tis in the power of Poetry to insinuate into the inmost Recesses of the Mind, to touch any Spring that moves the Heart, to agitate the Soul with any sort of Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and transform it into any Shape or Posture it thinks fit. 'Tis therefore no wonder that so wise a State, as that of <hi>Athens,</hi> should retain the <hi>Poets</hi> on the side of <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Government.</hi> The Stage there was set up to teach the People the Scheme of their <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and those Modes of Worship the Government thought fit to encourage, to convey to them such Ideas of their Deities, and Divine Providence, as might engage their Minds to a Reverence of superiour, invisible Beings, and to observe and admire their Administration of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Affairs. The <hi>Poets</hi> were look'd on as Divine, not only upon the account of that extraordinary Fury and Heat of Imagination, wherewith they were thought to be inspir'd, but likewise upon the account of their Profession and Imployment, their Business being to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
<pb facs="tcp:93441:3"/>
               <hi>Vice</hi> as the most odious, and <hi>Virtue</hi> as the most desirable thing in the World.</p>
            <p>Tragedy was at its first Institution a part of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Pagans Divine Service, when the <hi>Chorus</hi> which originally was so great a part, contain'd many excellent Lessons of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Morality,</hi> and was wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in rectifying their mistakes about the <hi>Gods,</hi> and their Government of the World, in moderating their Passions, and purging their Minds from Vice and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. This was the noble Design of the <hi>Chorus.</hi> And the Representation of great and illustrious Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, gradually afterwards introduc'd, their Impious, or their Generous Actions, and the different Event that attended them, was to deter Men from Vice and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, and encourage them to be Generous and Virtuous, by shewing them the Vengeance that at last overtook the one, and the Rewards and Praises that crown'd the other. The End of Comedy was the same, but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd in another way. The business of Comedy being to render Vice ridiculous, to expose it to publick Derision and Contempt, and to make Men asham'd of Vile and Sordid Actions.</p>
            <p>Tragedy design'd to Scare Men, Comedy to Laugh them out of their Vices. And 'tis very plain, that Satyr is intended for the same End, the Promotion of Virtue, and exposing of Vice; which it pursues by sharp Reproaches, vehement and bitter Invectives, or by a Courtly, but not less cutting Raillery. The Odes of the Lyric Poet were chiefly design'd for the Praises of their Gods, their Heroes and extraordinary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to draw Men to an Admiration and Imitation of them.</p>
            <p>But above all other kinds, <hi>Epick Poetry,</hi> as it is first in Dignity, so it mostly conduces to this End.
<pb facs="tcp:93441:3"/>
In an Epick Poem, where Characters of the first Rank and Dignity, Illustrious for their Birth or high Employment are introduc'd, the Fable, the Action, the particular Episodes are so contriv'd and conducted, or at least ought to be, that either Fortitude, Wisdom, Piety, Moderation, Generosity, some or other Noble and Princely Virtues shall be recommended with the highest Advantage, and their contrary Vices made as odious. To give Men right and just Conceptions of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> to aid their Reason in restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Exorbitant Appetites and Impetuous Passions, and to bring their Lives under the Rules and Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of true Wisdom, and thereby to promote the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good of Mankind, is undoubtedly the End of all Poetry.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, that one End of Poetry is to give Men Pleasure and Delight; but this is but a subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, subaltern End, which is it self a Means to the <hi>greater,</hi> and <hi>ultimate</hi> one before mention'd. A Poet should imploy all his Iudgment and Wit, exhaust all the Riches of his Fancy, and abound in Beautiful and Noble Expression, to divert and entertain others; but then it must be with this Prospect, that he may hereby engage their Attention, insinuate more easily into their Minds, and more effectually convey to them wise In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions. 'Tis below the Dignity of a true Poet to take his Aim at any inferiour End. They are Men of little Genius, of mean and poor Design, that imploy their Wit for no higher Purpose, than to please the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of vain and wanton People.</p>
            <p>I think these Poets, if they must be called so, whose Wit as they manage it, is altogether unuseful are justly reproach'd; but I am sure those others are highly to be condemned, who use all their Wit in <hi>Opposition</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:93441:4"/>
Religion, and to the <hi>Destruction</hi> of Virtue and good Manners in the World. There have been in all Ages such ill Men that have perverted the right Vse of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but never so many, or so <hi>bold</hi> or <hi>mischievous</hi> as in ours. Our Poets seem engag'd in a general <hi>Con'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy</hi> to ruin the End of their own Art, to expose <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> and bring <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Manners</hi> into Esteem and Reputation. The Poets that write for the Stage (at least a great part of 'em) seem deeply concern'd in this <hi>Conspiracy.</hi> These are the <hi>Champions</hi> that charge <hi>Religion</hi> with such desperate Resolution, and have given it so many deep and ghastly Wounds. The Stage was an Outwork or Fort rais'd for the Protection and Security of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but the Poets that kept it, have revolted, and basely betray'd it, and what is worse, have turn'd all their <hi>Force</hi> and discharg'd all their <hi>Artillery</hi> against the Place their Duty was to defend. If any Man thinks this an unjust Charge, I desire him to read any of our modern Comedies, and I believe he will soon be convinc'd of the Truth of what I have said.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Man of Sense</hi> and the <hi>Fine</hi> Gentleman in the <hi>Comedy,</hi> who as the chiefest Person propos'd to the Esteem and Imitation of the Audience, is enrich'd with all the Sense and Wit the Poet can bestow; this <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Person</hi> you will find to be a <hi>Derider</hi> of Religion, a great <hi>Admirer</hi> of <hi>Lucretius,</hi> not so much for his <hi>Learning,</hi> as his <hi>Irreligion,</hi> a Person wholly <hi>Idle,</hi> dissolv'd in Luxury, abandon'd to his Pleasures, a great Debaucher of Women, profuse and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant in his Expences, and in short, this <hi>Finish'd Gentleman</hi> will appear a <hi>Finish'd Libertine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Young Lady</hi> that must support the Character of a <hi>Vertuous, Well-manner'd Sensible</hi> Woman, the most
<pb facs="tcp:93441:4"/>
perfect Creature that can be, and the very Flower of her Sex, this <hi>Accomplish'd Person</hi> entertains the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with confident Discourses, immodest Repartees, and prophane Raillery. She is throughly instructed in <hi>Intreagues</hi> and <hi>Assignations,</hi> a great <hi>Scoffer</hi> at the prudent Reservedness and Modesty of the best of her Sex, She despises the wise Instructions of her Parents or Guardians, is disobedient to their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and at last, without their <hi>Knowledge</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> marries her self to the <hi>Fine Gentleman</hi> above mentioned. And can any one imagine, but that our Young Ladies and Gentlemen are admirably instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by <hi>such Patterns</hi> of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi>? If a Clergy-man be introduc'd, as he often is, 'tis seldome for any other purpose, but to abuse him, to expose his very <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Profession</hi>: He must be a <hi>Pimp,</hi> a <hi>Blockhead,</hi> a <hi>Hypocrite</hi>; some <hi>wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Figure</hi> he must make, and almost ever be so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd, as to bring his very <hi>Order</hi> into <hi>Contempt.</hi> This indeed is a very common, but yet so gross an Abuse of <hi>Wit,</hi> as was never endur'd on a Pagan Theater, at least in the ancient, primitive Times of <hi>Poetry,</hi> before its <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Simplicity</hi> became corrupted with the Inventions of after Ages. <hi>Poets</hi> then taught Men to reverence their <hi>Gods,</hi> and those who serv'd them. None had so little Regard for his <hi>Religion,</hi> as to expose it publickly, or if any had, their Governments were too wise to suffer the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of their Gods to be treated on the <hi>Stage</hi> with <hi>Contempt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In our <hi>Comedies</hi> the <hi>Wives of Citizens</hi> are highly encourag'd to despise their Husbands, and to make great Friendship with some such <hi>Vertuous Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93441:5"/>
and <hi>Man of Sense</hi> as is above describ'd. This is their Way of recommending <hi>Chastity</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.</hi> And that <hi>Diligence</hi> and <hi>Frugality</hi> may be sufficiently expos'd, tho' the two <hi>Virtues</hi> that chiefly support the <hi>Being</hi> of any State, to deter Men from being <hi>Industrious</hi> and <hi>Wealthy,</hi> the <hi>Diligent, Thriving</hi> Citizen is made the most Wretched, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Thing in the World: and as the Alderman that makes the best <hi>Figure</hi> in the <hi>City,</hi> makes the worst on the <hi>Stage,</hi> so under the Character of a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of Peace,</hi> you have all the <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> of the <hi>Country</hi> most unmercifully insulted over.</p>
            <p>And as these Characters are set up on purpose to ruin all Opinion and Esteem of Virtue, so the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct throughout, the <hi>Language,</hi> the <hi>Fable</hi> and <hi>Contrivance</hi> seem evidently design'd for the same <hi>Noble</hi> End. There are few Fine Conceipts, few Strains of Wit or extraordinary Pieces of Raillery, but are either <hi>immodest</hi> or <hi>irreligious,</hi> and very few <hi>Scenes</hi> but have some <hi>spiteful</hi> and <hi>envious</hi> Stroke at Sobriety and Good Manners, whence the Youth of the Nation have apparently receiv'd very bad Impressions. The <hi>universal</hi> Corruption of Manners and irreligious Disposition of Mind that infects the Kingdom, seems to have been in a great Measure deriv'd from the Stage, or has at least been highly promoted by it. And 'tis great Pitty that those in whose Power it is, have not yet restrain'd the <hi>Licentiousness</hi> of it, and oblig'd the Writers to observe more <hi>Decorum.</hi> It were to be wish'd that Poets, as Preachers are in some Countries, were paid and licens'd by the State, and that none were suffer'd to write in Prejudice of <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Government,</hi> but that all such Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
<pb facs="tcp:93441:5"/>
as <hi>publick Enemies</hi> of Mankind should be silenc'd and duly punish'd. Sure some Effectual Care should be taken that these Men might not be suffer'd by Debauching our Youth, to help on the <hi>Destruction</hi> of a brave Nation.</p>
            <p>Some of these <hi>Poets,</hi> to excuse their Guilt, alledge for themselves, that the <hi>Degeneracy</hi> of the <hi>Age</hi> makes their leud way of Writing necessary; they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the <hi>Auditors</hi> will not be pleas'd, unless they are thus entertain'd from the Stage; and to please they say is the chief business of the Poet. But this is by no means a just Apology; 'tis not true, as was said before, that the Poet's chief business is to please. His chief business is to instruct, to make Mankind Wiser and Better; and in order to this, his Care should be to please and entertain the Audience with all the <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Art,</hi> he is Master of. <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> and all their <hi>Criticks</hi> and <hi>Commentators,</hi> all Men of Wit and Sense agree, that this is the End of Poetry. But they say 'tis their <hi>Profession</hi> to Write for the <hi>Stage</hi>; and that Poets must Starve if they will not in this way humour the <hi>Audience.</hi> The <hi>Theater</hi> will be as <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented,</hi> as the <hi>Churches,</hi> and the Poet and the Parson <hi>equally</hi> neglected. Let the Poet then abandon his Profession, and take up some honest, lawful Calling, where joyning Industry to his great Wit, he may soon get above the Complaints of <hi>Poverty,</hi> so common among these ingenious Men, and lye under no necessity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting his Wit to any such <hi>vile</hi> Purposes as are here censur'd. This will be a course of Life more Profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Honourable to himself, and more <hi>useful</hi> to others. And there are among these <hi>Writers</hi> some, who think they might have risen to the highest <hi>Dignities</hi> in other Professions, had they imploy'd their Wit in those Ways.

'Tis a mighty Dishonour and Reproach to any Man, that is capable of being useful to the World in any <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral</hi> and <hi>Virtuous</hi> Profession, to lavish out his <hi>Life and Wit</hi> in propagating <hi>Vice and Corruption of Manners,</hi> and in battering from the Stage the strongest Entrenchments and best Works of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi> Whoever makes this his Choice, when the other was in his Power, may he go off the Stage unpity'd, <hi>complaining</hi> of <hi>Neglect</hi> and <hi>Poverty,</hi> the just Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his <hi>Irreligion</hi> and <hi>Folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis no dishonour to be a <hi>true</hi> Poet, if indeed a Man be one; that is, a noble <hi>Genius</hi> well cultivated, and employ'd in Writing in such a way, as reaches the End of his Art, and by discouraging Vice, promotes the Good of Mankind. But 'tis a <hi>mighty</hi> Dishonour and Shame, to employ excellent Faculties and abundance of Wit, to humour and please Men in their Vices and Follies. Such a one is more hateful, as an <hi>ill Man,</hi> than valuable, as a <hi>good Poet.</hi> The great Enemy of Mankind, notwithstanding his <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Angelick Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,</hi> is the most <hi>odious</hi> Being of the whole Creation.</p>
            <p>Nor is this Abuse confin'd to the Stage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the same Strain runs thro' the other kinds of Poetry. What mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous leud and irreligious Books of Poems, as they are call'd, have been of late days publish'd, and what is the greater wonder, receiv'd in a Civiliz'd and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Kingdom, with <hi>Applause</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi>? The sweetness of the Wit, makes the <hi>Poison</hi> go down with Pleasure, and the Contagion spreads without Opposition. Young Gentlemen and Ladies are generally pleasd and diverted with <hi>Poetry,</hi> more than by any other way of Writing; but there are few Poems they can fix on, but they are like to pay too dear for their Entertainment. Their Fancies are like to be fill'd with impure <hi>Ideas,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93441:6"/>
and their Minds engag'd in <hi>hurtful</hi> Passions, which are the more lasting, by being convey'd in lively Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, and all the Address of an artful Poet.</p>
            <p>For this End among others, I undertook the writing of this Poem, hoping I might be able to please and entertain, not only without hurting the Reader, but to his advantage. I was willing to make one <hi>Effort</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the rescuing the <hi>Muses</hi> out of the hands of these <hi>Ravishers,</hi> to restore them to their sweet and chast Mansions, and to engage them in an Employment suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their <hi>Dignity.</hi> If I succeed not my self in this good Design, I hope at least I shall awaken the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Compassion of some other <hi>brave Adventurers,</hi> that may more happily attempt this honorable Work.</p>
            <p>To write an Epick Poem is a work of that Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that no one for near seventeen hundred years past has succeeded in it; and only those two great Wits <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> before. That the modern Poets have been so unsuccessful, has not, I imagin, proceeded so much from want of <hi>Genius,</hi> as from their Ignorance of the Rules of writing such a Poem; or at least, from their want of attending to them. Tho' <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Rules of Poetry were early publish'd by <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> and soon after farther illustrated by the Comments of several <hi>Italian Criticks,</hi> yet we do not find that <hi>Ariosto</hi> or <hi>Tasso</hi> either, were very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to observe them. And indeed our <hi>modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> neither seem to have attended to those incomparable Rules, nor carefully to have consider'd the great <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> that <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> had left them. Some Readers that are not vers'd in this matter, imagin every thing written in <hi>Heroick Verse,</hi> is an <hi>Heroick Poem</hi>; but these have not consider'd the <hi>Nature</hi> of such a Work, nor look'd into the <hi>Criticks,</hi> who have written
<pb facs="tcp:93441:7"/>
on this Subject. I shall therefore give the <hi>Definition</hi> of an Epick or Heroick Poem, that those that have it not already, may now have a true Idea of its Nature.</p>
            <p>An Epick Poem is a feign'd or devis'd Story of an <hi>Illustrious Action,</hi> related in Verse, in an <hi>Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Probable, Delightful</hi> and <hi>Admirable</hi> manner, to cultivate the Mind with Instructions of Virtue. 'Tis a feign'd or devis'd Discourse; that is, a <hi>Fable</hi>; and so it agrees with <hi>Tragedy</hi> and <hi>Comedy.</hi> The word <hi>Fable</hi> at first signified indifferently a true or false Story, therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> for distinction, uses <hi>Fictas Fabulas</hi> in his Book <hi>de Finibus.</hi> But afterwards Custom obtain'd to use the word always for a feign'd Discourse. And in the first Ages, especially in the Eastern World, great use was made by Learned and Wise Men of these <hi>feign'd Discourses, Fables</hi> or <hi>Apologues,</hi> to teach the ruder and more unpolish'd Part of Mankind. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logians, Philosophers,</hi> and great <hi>Law-givers,</hi> every where fell into this way of instructing and cultivating the People in the Knowledge of Religion, Natural Philosophy, and Moral and Political Virtues. So <hi>Thales, Orpheus, Solon, Homer,</hi> and the rest of the great Men in those Ages have done, and the famous Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Socrates</hi> is by some affirm'd to be the Author of many of the Fables that pass under <hi>Aesop</hi>'s name. Most of them made their Fables in Verse, that by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Harmony</hi> and <hi>Numbers</hi> they might the better attain their End. <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this way of teaching the People; and these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons may be given for the usefulness of it. Naked Philosophical Precepts and Doctrines are of themselves <hi>harsh</hi> and <hi>dry,</hi> hardly attended to, and <hi>ungratefully</hi> entertain'd. If the Hearers are <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>course,</hi> or very <hi>vicious,</hi> there is no hope of gaining them by a
<pb facs="tcp:93441:7"/>
               <hi>grave</hi> and <hi>solemn</hi> Discourse of Virtue, and even the better and more civiliz'd Auditors are hardly kept at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to it. Man is naturally a lover of <hi>Pleasure,</hi> and if you would do him Good, it must be, by <hi>pleasing</hi> him; you must give him <hi>Delight,</hi> and keep his Mind in a constant agreeable Agitation, else he will not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the most useful <hi>Counsel</hi> and <hi>Instruction.</hi> He is pleas'd already with the <hi>Notions</hi> and <hi>Habitudes,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever <hi>false</hi> or <hi>vicious,</hi> that have the <hi>present</hi> Possession of him, and you must give him a great deal of <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Entertainment</hi> to engage him to hear you, when you would perswade him to the trouble, of becoming <hi>Wiser</hi> and <hi>Better.</hi> Now the first Wise Men that undertook to <hi>civilize</hi> and <hi>polish</hi> the barbarous World, found this way of <hi>Fables</hi> especially in Verse, to be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Acceptable</hi> to the People: The Contrivance gave them <hi>Delight,</hi> and the Novelty rais'd their <hi>Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> They could learn them perfectly, and repeat them often, by which means the Instructions of Virtue co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly contain'd in them, were inculcated on their Minds.</p>
            <p>And we find, that many Ages after <hi>Orpheus, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Homer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Divine Law-giver</hi> of the <hi>Christians</hi> thought fit to teach the People by <hi>Apologues, Parables</hi> or <hi>Fables,</hi> under which he cover'd and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd his Heavenly Instructions.</p>
            <p>The Action must be <hi>Illustrious</hi> and <hi>Important</hi>; Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious in respect of the Person, who is the Author of it, who is always some <hi>Valiant,</hi> or <hi>Wise,</hi> or <hi>Pious</hi> Prince or great Commander: But let his Character be what it will in other respects (for there is no Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity the <hi>Hero</hi> should be a good or a wise Person) 'tis always necessary he should have <hi>Courage</hi>; which sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Quality is sufficient to make the <hi>Hero.</hi> And the
<pb facs="tcp:93441:8"/>
Action must be <hi>important,</hi> both in respect of its <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> and its <hi>End.</hi> 'Tis the Action of some great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, about some <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>weighty</hi> Affair. 'Tis true, there are many other Persons concern'd, but tis the Action of the <hi>chief</hi> Person that gives the <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Denomination</hi> to the Poem. This Action must be but one; when it ceases, the Poem is ended; and if it be reviv'd, and taken up again, 'tis a new Poem be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins. Action is Motion; and if it ceases cannot be reviv'd, so as to be numerically the same. There are indeed many other Actions besides the <hi>Principal</hi> one, but they all depend on, and have relation to that which is Principal, with the <hi>Unity</hi> of which, the <hi>Unity</hi> of the Poem stands or falls. If this principal Action be <hi>broken,</hi> the Poem is <hi>broken</hi> too, if there be any other Action <hi>coordinate</hi> and <hi>independent</hi> on this, the Poem is <hi>monstrous,</hi> and has as many Heads, as there are found <hi>independent</hi> Actions. The Narration therefore of many Actions successively of one great Person, or the History of his Life related in Verse, is by no means an <hi>Heroick Poem,</hi> any one great Action being sufficient for that. That which makes the <hi>Unity</hi> of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the regular Succession of one <hi>Part</hi> or <hi>Episode</hi> to another, not only as <hi>Antecedents</hi> and <hi>Consequents,</hi> but as it were <hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>Effects,</hi> wherein the Reader may discern that the former <hi>Episode</hi> makes the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing necessary, and the <hi>Connection</hi> between them is such, that they <hi>assist</hi> and <hi>support</hi> each other, as the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of the Body do, no Episode being out of its place, of a <hi>disproportion'd</hi> size to the Rest, or that could be spar'd from its place, without <hi>maiming,</hi> or at least <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming</hi> the Whole. If this order of the Episodes be preserv'd, and there appears none but what <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> and <hi>probably</hi> results from the <hi>principal</hi> Action, then the Action may be look'd on as one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93441:8"/>The Action must be related in an <hi>Allegorical</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and this Rule is best observ'd, when as <hi>Divines</hi> speak; there is both a <hi>Literal</hi> Sense obvious to every Reader, and that gives him satisfaction enough if he sees no farther; and besides another <hi>Mystical</hi> or <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical</hi> Sense, not hard to be discover'd by those Readers that penetrate the matter deeper. <hi>Virgil</hi> seems most happy in this Conduct, whose Poem all along contains this double Sense, <hi>Homer</hi> has often only an <hi>Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Sense without the <hi>Literal,</hi> and therefore is not so well accommodated to this Age, as he was not to that of <hi>Augustus.</hi> But <hi>Ariosto</hi> and <hi>Spencer,</hi> however <hi>great Wits,</hi> not observing this judicious Conduct of <hi>Virgil,</hi> nor attending to any sober Rules, are hurried on with a <hi>boundless, impetuous</hi> Fancy over Hill and Dale, till they are both lost in a Wood of Allegories. Allegories so <hi>wild, unnatura
l,</hi> and <hi>extravagant,</hi> as greatly displease the Reader. This way of writing mightily offends in this Age; and 'tis a wonder how it came to please in any. There is indeed a way of writing purely Allegorical, as when <hi>Vices</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> are introduc'd as <hi>Persons,</hi> the first as <hi>Furies,</hi> the other as <hi>Divine Persons or Goddesses,</hi> which still obtains, and is well enough accommodated to the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> Age. For the <hi>Allegory</hi> is presently discern'd, and the Reader is by no means impos'd on, but sees it immediately to be an <hi>Allegory,</hi> and is both delighted and instructed with it. The devis'd Story must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in a <hi>probable</hi> manner; without this all things will be <hi>harsh, unnatural,</hi> and <hi>monstrous</hi>; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently most <hi>odious</hi> and <hi>offensive</hi> to the Iudicious. <hi>Probability</hi> must be in the <hi>Action,</hi> the <hi>Conduct,</hi> the <hi>Manners</hi>; and where humane means cannot, <hi>Machine
s</hi> are introduc'd to support it. Nothing is more necessary
<pb facs="tcp:93441:9"/>
then <hi>Probability</hi>; no Rule more chastly to be observ'd.</p>
            <p>An Epick Poem must likewise be <hi>delightful</hi> and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable</hi>; and to make it so, must concur sublime Thoughts, clear and noble Expression, Purity of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, a just and due Proportion, Relation, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance between the Parts, and a beautiful and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Structure and Connection discernable in the <hi>Whole.</hi> Without these it will not be capable of giving <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi> or raising <hi>Admiration. Admiration</hi> is the <hi>Formal Object</hi> of an Epick Poem, nothing is to be admitted there, but as it is <hi>admirable</hi>; and by this it is discriminated from all other sorts of Poetry. Every <hi>kind</hi> endeavours to <hi>please</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> but this only attempts to please by <hi>astonishing</hi> and <hi>amazing</hi> the Reader. In an Epick Poem every thing should appear <hi>great</hi> and <hi>wonderful,</hi> the Thoughts cannot be too much <hi>Elevated,</hi> the Episodes too <hi>Noble,</hi> the Expression too <hi>Magnificent,</hi> nor the Action too <hi>Wonderful</hi> and <hi>Surprising,</hi> if Probability be preserv'd. No Riches of <hi>Fancy,</hi> no <hi>Pomp</hi> of <hi>Eloquence</hi> can be laid out too much on such a Work where the <hi>Design</hi> is throughout to raise our <hi>Admiration.</hi> To render the Action the more <hi>Admirable, Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> have introduc'd the <hi>Gods,</hi> and engag'd them every where as <hi>Parties</hi>; and tho' I cannot say this is <hi>Essential</hi> and <hi>Necessary</hi> to an Epick Poem, yet 'tis evident, that interesting <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> in the matter, does mightily raise the Subject, and makes the Action appear more wonderful. The Pagan Poets had in this a great advantage, their <hi>Theology</hi> was such, as would easily mix it self with their Poems, from whence they receiv'd their greatest Beauties. <hi>Homer</hi> indeed to raise his Subject by his frequent <hi>Machines,</hi> seems to have debas'd his <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Virgil</hi>'s Conduct, in my Opinion, is more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb facs="tcp:93441:9"/>
and chast. But some of our <hi>modern Criticks</hi> have believ'd 'tis scarce possible for a <hi>Christian</hi> Poet to make use of this advantage, of introducing <hi>Superiour, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible</hi> Powers into the Action, and therefore seem to despair of seeing an <hi>Heroick Poem</hi> written now, that shall reach to the <hi>Dignity</hi> of those of the Pagans. They think the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> is not so well accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to this matter, as the <hi>Pagan</hi> was; and that if any Attempt be made this way, <hi>Religion</hi> will <hi>suffer</hi> more, than the <hi>Poem</hi> will gain by it. <hi>My Opinion</hi> has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways differ'd from these Gentlemen's, I believe a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Poet</hi> has as great advantages as the <hi>Pagan</hi> had; and that our <hi>Theology</hi> may enter into an Epick Poem, and <hi>raise</hi> the Subject without being it self <hi>debas'd.</hi> And this indeed was a second Reason why I undertook this Work, so full of <hi>Difficulty</hi> and <hi>Hazard.</hi> I was willing to give an Instance wherein it might appear, that the Assertion I have advanc'd, is <hi>actually</hi> true.</p>
            <p>In the Definition which I have given of an Heroick Poem, according to the Sense and Iudgment of the <hi>best Criticks,</hi> I have said, its End is to convey some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Virtue. But of this, I have discours'd at large at the beginning of this <hi>Preface,</hi> and there is no need of repeating it.</p>
            <p>'Tis not for me to proceed to Censure other Mens Performances of this Kind; whoever will be at the Pains to read the Commentators on <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi>'s Rules of Poetry; or that will but carefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider <hi>Rapin, Dacier,</hi> and <hi>Bossu,</hi> those great Masters among the <hi>French,</hi> and the Iudicious Remarks of our own <hi>excellent Critick Mr. Rymer,</hi> who seems to have better consider'd these matters, and to have seen farther into them, than any of the <hi>English Nation</hi>; will be soon able to see wherein the Heroick Poems that
<pb facs="tcp:93441:10"/>
have been publish'd since <hi>Virgil</hi> by the <hi>Italian, French,</hi> and <hi>English Wits</hi> have been defective, by comparing them with the <hi>Rules</hi> of Writing set down by those <hi>great Masters.</hi> Whether I have succeeded better, must be left to the determination of the Iudicious Reader.</p>
            <p>In this Work I have endeavour'd mostly to form my self on <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Model,</hi> which I look on, as the most <hi>just</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> and which is most easily accommodated to the present Age, supposing the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> in the place of the <hi>Pagan.</hi> I do not make any <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> for my <hi>Imitation of Virgil</hi> in so many places of this Poem; for the same <hi>great Master</hi> has imitated <hi>Homer</hi> as frequently and closely; and I do not find that any of his <hi>Criticks</hi> have condemn'd him for his doing so. Nor is it at all <hi>improbable,</hi> but that the <hi>Greek Poet</hi> himself imitated his Predecessors of the same Nation, tho' no doubt he wonderfully improv'd their Model. <hi>Homer</hi> was not the first Writer of an Epick Poem. We find <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Book of the Art of Poetry, makes mention of several before him: He tells us of an Epick Poem, intituled, <hi>The Little Ilias,</hi> and another the <hi>Cyprica</hi>; and censures them both, as containing many <hi>perfect, distinct,</hi> and <hi>independent</hi> Actions. The last of these Poems is likewise mention'd by <hi>Herodotus</hi> in <hi>Euterpe,</hi> by <hi>Athenaeus</hi> and <hi>Pausa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias.</hi> And 'tis likely many more such Poems were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before <hi>Homer</hi>'s time, who might be well suppos'd to have imitated them in what they had done well, as well as to have improv'd them in avoiding many of their Errors.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> have <hi>perform'd</hi> with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and universal Applause, I have <hi>attempted</hi>: What they have been <hi>able,</hi> I have been <hi>willing</hi> to do. If I have not succeeded, my disappointment will be the less,
<pb facs="tcp:93441:10"/>
in that Poetry has been so far from being my <hi>Business</hi> and <hi>Profession,</hi> that it has imploy'd but a small part of my Time; and then, but as my <hi>Recreation,</hi> and the Entertainment of my idle hours. If this Attempt succeeds so far, as to excite some other Person that has a <hi>noble Genius, Leisure,</hi> and <hi>Application,</hi> to Honour his Country with a <hi>just Epick Poem,</hi> I shall think the <hi>Vacancies</hi> and <hi>Intervals</hi> that for about two years past, I have had from the <hi>Business</hi> of my <hi>Profession</hi>; which notwithstanding was then greater then at any time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, have been very well imploy'd.</p>

               <l>Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> will advance, and mightier grow,</l>
               <l>Like rolling Balls, that gather up the Snow,</l>

               <l>The <hi>Britons</hi> led by ancient Prophecies,</l>

               <l>Something like this, our Augurs seem to fear,</l>
               <l>From Prodigies, and Signs that oft appear.</l>
               <l>Those hopes they all of <hi>Arthur</hi> now express,</l>

               <l>While this Belief, tho' false, the <hi>Briton</hi> warms,</l>
               <l>He grows less fearful of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Arms.</l>
               <l>He'll be more bold in Fight, while thus inspir'd,</l>

               <l>Heav'n's starry Arch with Acclamations rings,</l>

               <l>Is weaken'd, by the Numbers we have lost,</l>
               <l>When matchless <hi>Arthur</hi> did our Troops invade,</l>
               <l>What Havock his victorious Progress made.</l>
               <l>What wide Destruction in our Army rag'd,</l>

               <l>No stronger Champion travers'd yet the Field,</l>
               <l>To him or none the <hi>British</hi> Prince must yield.</l>
               <l>Kind Heav'n has sent a Man so great, and Brave,</l>
               <l>From <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Arms, our threatn'd State to save.</l>
               <l>I would not then his just Desire withstand,</l>
               <l>But let him know, you grant him his Demand.</l>
               <l>This Grant to such a Prince we must allow,</l>

               <l>And wisely thus th' attentive Peers bespoke.</l>
               <l>I once advis'd that to preserve the State,</l>
               <l>We should strict Friendship with Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> make.</l>
               <l>That we <hi>Britannia</hi> should between us share,</l>
               <l>And with the Princess Nuptials end the War.</l>
               <l>The Terms propos'd the <hi>British</hi> Hero please,</l>
               <l>And all things seem'd to promise lasting Peace.</l>
               <l>But when we were inform'd the <hi>British</hi> Host</l>
               <l>Had half their Force, by raging Sickness lost.</l>
               <l>Thinking we might with Ease, the Foe defeat,</l>
               <l>VVe from the Terms our selves propos'd, retreat.</l>
               <l>

               <l>With all our Force the <hi>Britons</hi> we assail,</l>
               <l>But <hi>Arthur</hi>'s unresisted Arms prevail.</l>

               <l>Against Prince <hi>Arthur's</hi> Arms, and prosp'rous Fate.</l>
               <l>True, <hi>Tollo</hi>'s Deeds give him a warlike Name,</l>
               <l>But much inferiour to the <hi>Briton's</hi> Fame.</l>
               <l>If we confiding in th' <hi>Albanian</hi>'s Sword,</l>
               <l>Fresh Triumphs to the <hi>Briton</hi> should afford:</l>
               <l>Who after, shall controuling Bounds oppose,</l>

               <l>Who then against the Torrent can contend,</l>
               <l>And from th' o'erflowing Flood, our Towns defend.</l>
               <l>We shall in vain our former Conquests boast,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Saxon</hi> sinks, and all <hi>Britannia's</hi> lost.</l>
               <l>All things well weigh'd, Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> looks to me</l>
               <l>As one supported by divine Decree,</l>
               <l>To Empire rais'd, by unchang'd Destiny.</l>
               <l>If so in vain all our Attempts are made,</l>
               <l>In vain we build our Hopes on <hi>Tollo</hi>'s Aid.</l>
               <l>We shall oppose inevitable Fate,</l>
               <l>And in our Ruin learn our Fault, too late.</l>
               <l>I would Prince <hi>Arthur's</hi> Temper sound, and strive</l>
               <l>Once more, the former Treaty to revive.</l>

               <l>Then <hi>Imerick</hi> he slew a valiant Chief,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Lodocan</hi> that rush'd to his Relief:</l>
               <l>One with his Fauchion, th' other with his Spear,</l>

               <l>His furious Dart did next at <hi>Ebald</hi> fly,</l>
               <l>Which thro' his Shield pierc'd deep into his Thigh:</l>

               <l>And his left Eye from out its Circle struck,</l>

               <l>And from the Wound a bloody Torrent sprung.</l>
               <l>Rolling in Gore upon the Field he lay,</l>

               <l>The Sea assail'd, and on the Billows prest</l>

                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:93441:160"/>Rolling in Dust his wounded Body bled,</l>
               <l>Away his Soul with Indignation fled.</l>
               <l>Convuls'd and quivering for a while he fetcht</l>
               <l>A dreadful Groan, and breathless out he stretcht.</l>
               <l>As when a Whirlwind with outrageous Force</l>
               <l>O'erturns a lofty Oak, that stops its Course,</l>
               <l>Its Roots torn up, the Tree's caught from the Ground,</l>
               <l>And with the furious Eddy carried round:</l>
               <l>Then falling from the Sky, his stately Head,</l>
               <l>And shady Limbs, the groaning Hill o'erspread.</l>
               <l>So by Prince <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Arms, King <hi>Tollo</hi> slain,</l>
               <l>Fell down, and lay extended on the Plain.</l>
