            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE AUTHOUR'S PREFACE <hi>To his much honour'd Friend</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> HOBS.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce you have done me the honour to allow this Poem a daily examination as it was wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, I will presume, now it hath attain'd more length, to give you a longer trouble; that you may yield me as great advantages by censuring the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, as by judging the Numbers and the Matter. And because you shall pass through this New Building with more ease to your disquisition, I will acquaint you what care I took of my materials, ere I began to work.</p>
            <p>But first give me leave (remembering with what difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the world can shew any Heroick Poem, that in a perfect glass of Nature gives us a familiar and easie view of our selves) to take notice of those quarrels, which the Living have with the Dead: and I will (according as all times have applied their reverence) begin with <hi>Homer,</hi> who, though he seems to me standing upon the Poets famous hill, like the eminent Sea-mark, by which they have in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95940:3"/>
former Ages steer'd; and though he ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from that eminence, lest Posterity should presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuously mistake their course; yet some (sharply observing how his Successours have proceeded no farther than a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of imitating him) say, that as Sea-marks are chiefly usefull to Coasters, and serve not those who have the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of Discoverers, that love to sayl in untry'd Seas; so he hath rather prov'd a Guide for those, whose satisfied Wit will not venture beyond the track of others; than to them, who affect a new and remote way of thinking; who esteem it a deficiency and meaness of mind, to stay and depend upon the authority of example.</p>
            <p>Some there are, that object that even in the likelyhoods of Story (and Story where ever it seems most likely, grows most pleasant) he doth too frequently inte<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mixe such Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as are objects listed above the Eyes of Nature; and as he often interrogates his Muse, not as his rational Spirit but as a <hi>Familiar,</hi> separated from his body, so her replies bring him where he spends time in immortal conversation; whilest supernaturally he doth often advance his men to the quality of Gods, and depose his Gods to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men.</p>
            <p>His Successour to fame, (and consequently to censure) is <hi>Virgil;</hi> whose toyls nor virtue cannot free him from the peevishness (or rather curiosity) of divers Readers. He is upbraided by some (who perhaps are affected Antiquaries, and make priority of time the measure of excellence) for gaining his renown by the imitation of <hi>Hom<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r:</hi> Whilest others (no less bold with that ancient Guide) say, He hath so often led him into Heaven and Hell, till by conversation with Gods and Ghosts, he sometimes deprives us of those natural probabilities in Story, which are instructive to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life: And others affirm (if it be not irreverence to record their opinion) That even in Wit, he seems defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent by many omissions; as if he had design'd a penance of gravity to himself and to posterity: And by their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving that continued gravity, me thinks they look upon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95940:3"/>
him, as on a Musitian composing of Anthems; whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence consists more in the solemness, than in the fancy; and upon the body of his Work, as on the body of a Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, whose force hath more of strength, than quickness, and of patience than activity.</p>
            <p>But these bold Censurers are in danger of so many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as I shall wise<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y shrink from them; and onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, That if any Disciples of unimitable <hi>Virgil</hi> can prove so formal, as to esteem Wit (as if it were levity) an imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Heroick Muse (by which malevolent word, <hi>Wit,</hi> they would disgrace her extraordinary heights) yet if those grave Judges will be held wise, they must endure the fate of Wise men; who always have but few of their society; for many more than consist of their number (perhaps not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the sullenness to be of it) are taken with those bold flights, and think, 'tis with the Muse (whose noble Quarry is men) as with the Eagle, who when he soars high, stoops more prosperously, and is most certain of his prey. And surely Poets (whose business should represent the Worlds true image often to our view) are not less prudent than Painters, who when they draw Landschaps, entertain not the Eye wholly with even Prospect; and a continued Flat; but (for variety) terminate the sight with lofty Hills, whose obscure heads are sometimes in the clouds.</p>

               <hi>Lucan,</hi> who chose to write the greatest actions that ever were allowed to be true (which for fear of contemporary witnesses, oblig'd him to a very close attendance upon Fame) did not observe that such an enterprize rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seem'd an Historian, than a Poet: for wise Poets think it more worthy to seek out truth in the Passions, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord the truth of Actions; and practise to describe Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, just as we are perswaded or guided by instinct, not particular persons, as they are lifted, or levell'd by the force of Fate, it being nobler to contemplate the general History of Nature, than a selected Diary of Fortune: And Painters are no more than Historians, when they draw eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (though they term that drawing to the life) but when
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95940:4"/>
by assembling divers figures in a larger volume, they draw Passions (though they term it but Story) then they increase in dignity and become Poets.</p>
            <p>I have been thus hardy to call him to account for the choice of his Argument, not meerly as it was Story, but because the actions he recorded were so eminent, and so near his time, that he could not assist Truth with such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments as Poets, for usefull pleasure, have allowed her, le<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And now I will leave to others the presumption of measuring his Hyperboles, by whose space and height they maliciously take the dimension of wit; and so mistake him in his boyling Youth (which had marvellous forces) as we disrelish Wine, when fuming in the Lee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Statius</hi> (with whom we may conclude the old Heroicks) is as accomptable to some for his obligations to <hi>Virgil,</hi> as <hi>Virgil</hi> is to others for what he owes to <hi>Homer;</hi> and more closely than <hi>Virgil</hi> waits on <hi>Homer,</hi> doth <hi>Statius</hi> attend <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> and follows him there also where Nature never comes, even into Heaven and Hell: and therefore he cannot escape such as approve the wisdom of the best Dramaticks; who in representation of examples, believe they prevail most on our manners, when they lay the Scene at home in their own Countrey; so much they avoid those remote Regions of Heaven and Hell: as if the People (whom they make civil by an easie communication with reason (and familiar reason is that which is call'd the civility of the Stage) were become more discreet than to have their eyes perswaded by the descending of Gods in gay Clouds, and more manly, than to be frighted with the rising of Ghosts in Smoke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tasso</hi> (who reviv'd the Heroick flame after it was many Ages quench'd) is held both in time and merit, the first of the Moderns; an honour by which he gains not much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the number he excells must needs be few, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords but one fit to succeed him; for I will yield to their opinion, who permit not <hi>Ariosto,</hi> no nor <hi>Du Bartas</hi> in this eminent rank of the Heroicks: rather than to make way
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95940:4"/>
by their admission for <hi>Dante, Marino,</hi> and others. <hi>Tasso</hi>'s honour too is chiefly allow'd him, where he most endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make <hi>Virgil</hi> his Pattern: And again, when we con<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ider from whom <hi>Virgil</hi>'s spirit is derived, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how rarely humane excellence is found; for Heroick Poesie (which, if it exact in it self, yields not to any other humane work) flow'd but in few, and even those streams descended but from one Grecian Spring; and 'tis with ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Poems, as with the Original Pieces of Painters, whose Copies abare the excessive price of the first Hand.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Tasso,</hi> though he came late into the world, must have his share in that Critical War, which never ceases amongst the Learned; and he seems most unfortunate, because his errours, which are deriv'd from the Ancients when exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, grow in a great degree excusable in them, and by being his admit no pardon. Such as are his Councel assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Heaven, his Witches Expeditions through the Air, and enchanted Woods inhabited with Ghosts. For though the elder Poets (which were then the sacred Priests) fed the World with supernatural Tales, and so compounded the Religion, of Pleasure and Mysterie, (two Ingredients which never fail'd to work upon the People) whilest for the eternity of their Chiefs (more refin'd by education) they surely intended no such vain provision.) Yet a Christian Poet, whose Religion little needs the aids of Invention, hath less occasion to imitate such Fables, as meanly illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate a probable Heaven, by the fashion and dignity of Courts; and make a resemblance of Hell, out of the Dreams of frighted Women; by which they continue and increase the melancholy mistakes of the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spencer</hi> may stand here as the last of this short File of Heroick Poets; Men, whose intellectuals were of so great a making, (though some have thought them lyable to those few Censures we have mentioned) as perhaps they will in worthy memory out-last, even Makers of Laws, and Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Empires, and all but such as must therefore live e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually with them, because they have recorded their names;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95940:5"/>
and consequently with their own hands led them to the Temple of Fame. And since we have dar'd to remember those exceptions which the Curious have against them, it will not be expected I should forget what is objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>spencer;</hi> whose obsolete Language we are constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to mention, though it be grown the most vulgar accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is laid to his charge.</p>
            <p>Language (which is the onely Creature of Man's crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) hath like a Plant, seasons of flourishing and decay; like Plants is remov'd from one soyl to another, and by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so transplanted, doth often gather vigour and increase. But as it is false husbandrie to graft old branches upon young stocks: so we may wonder that our Language (not long before his time created out of a confusion of others, &amp; then beginning to flourish like a new Plant) should (as helps to its increase) receive from his hand, new grafts of old wither'd words. But this vulgar exception, shall onely have the vulgar excuse; which is, that the unlucky choice of his <hi>Stanza,</hi> hath by repitition of Rhime, brought him to the necessity of many exploded words.</p>
            <p>If we proceed from his Language to his Argument, we must observe with others, that his noble and most artfull hands deserv'd to be employed upon matter of a more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and therefore of a more usefull kind. His allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Story (by many held defective in the connexion) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling (me thinks) a continuance of extraordinarie Dreams; such as excellent Poets, and Painters, by being over-studious, may have in the beginning of Feavers: And those moral visions are just of so much use to humane ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, as painted History, when with the cousenage of lights, it is represented in Scenes, by which we are much less informed than by actions on the Stage.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I have (perhaps) taken pains to make you think me malicious, in observing how far the Curious have look'd into the errours of others; Errours which the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural humour of imitation hath made so like in all (even from <hi>Homer</hi> to <hi>Spencer</hi>) as the accusations against the first
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95940:5"/>
appear but little more than repitition in every process a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the rest: and comparing the resemblance of errour in persons of one generation, to that which is in those of another age; we may find it exceeds not any where, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously, the ordinary proportion. Such limits to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of every thing (even of worthiness as well as defect) doth imitation give: for whilest we imitate others, we can no more excel them, than he that sayls by others Maps can make a new discovery: and to Imitation, Nature (which is the onely visible power, and operation of God) perhaps doth needfully enclineus, to keep us from exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. For though every man be capable of worthiness and unworthiness (as they are defined by Opinion) yet no man is built strong enough to bear the extremities of either, without unloading himself upon others shoulders, even to the weariness of many. If courage be worthiness, yet where it is over-grown into extreams, it becomes as wilde and hurtfull as ambition; and so what was reverenced for protection, grows to be abhorr'd for oppression: If <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (which is not Knowledge, but a continu'd Sayling by fantastick and uncertain winds towards it) be worthiness, yet it hath bounds in all Philosophers; and Nature that measur'd those bounds, seems not so partial, as to allow it in any one a much larger extent than in another: as if in our fleshly building, she consider'd the furniture and the room, alike, and together; for as the compass of Diadems commonly fits the whole succession of those Kings that wear them; so throughout the whole World, a very few inches may distinguish the circumference of the heads of their Subjects: Nor need we repine that Nature hath not some Favorites, to whom she doth dispence this Treasure, <hi>Knowledge,</hi> with a prodigious Liberality. For as there is no one that can be said vastly to exceed all mankind; so divers that have in learning transcended all in some one Province, have corrupted many with that great quantity of false gold; and the authority of their stronger Science hath often serv'd to distract, or pervert their weaker disciples.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:95940:6"/>And as the qualities which are term'd good, are bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, so are the bad; and likewise limited, as well as gotten by imitation; for amongst those that are extraordinary, either by birth or brain (for with the usual pride of Poets, I pass by common crowds, as negligently as Princes move from throngs, that are not their own Subjects) we cannot find any one so egregious (admitting cruelty and avarice for the chiefest evils; and errours in government or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to be the greatest errours) but that divers of former or succeeding times may enter the scales with them, and make the Ballance even; though the passion of Historians would impose the contrary on our belief; who in dispraise of evil Princes, are often as unjust and excessive, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People: for there was never any Monarch so cruel, but he had living subjects, nor so avaricious, but that his Subjects were richer than himself; nor ever any disease in government so extreamly infectious, as to make universal Anarchy, or any errour in Doctrine so strong by the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer, but that Truth (though it wrestled with her often, and in many places) hath at some season, and on some ground, made her advantages and successes apparent: Therefore we may conclude, that Nature, for the safety of mankind, hath as well (by dulling and stopping our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress with the constant humour of imitation) given limits to courage and to learning, to wickedness and to errour, as it hath ordain'd the shelves before the shore, to restrain the rage and excesses of the Sea.</p>
            <p>But I feel (Sir) that I am falling into the dangerous Fit of a hot Writer; for in stead of performing the promise which begins this Preface, and doth oblige me (after I had given you the judgement of some upon others) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent my self to your censure, I am wandering after new thoughts: but I shall ask your pardon, and return to my undertaking.</p>
            <p>My Argument I resolv'd should consist of Christian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; for since Religion doth generally beget, and govern manners, I thought the example of their actions would
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95940:6"/>
prevail most upon our own, by being deriv'd from the same doctrine and authority; as the particular Sects educated by Philosophers, were diligent and piiant to the dictates and fashions of such as deriv'd themselves from the same Master; but lazy and froward to those who convers'd in other Schools: Yet all these Sects pretended to the same beauty, <hi>Virtue;</hi> though each did court her more fondly, when she was dress'd at their own homes, by the hands of their acquaintance: And so Subjects bred under the Laws of a Prince (though Laws differ not much in Morality, or priviledge throughout the civil World; being every where made for direction of Life, more than for sentences of Death) will rather die near that Prince, defending those they have bin taught, than live by taking new from another.</p>
            <p>These were partly the reasons why I chose a Story of such Persons as profess'd Chaistian Religion; but I ought to have been most enclin'd to it, because the Principles of our Religion conduce more to explicable virtue, to plain demonstrative justice, and even to Honour (if Virtue the Mother of Honour be voluntary, and active in the dark, so as she need not Laws to compel her, nor look for witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to proclaim her) than any other Religion that e're as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled men to Divine Worship. For that of the <hi>Jews</hi> doth still consist in a sullen separation of themselves from the rest of humane flesh, which is a fantastical pride of their own cleanness, and an uncivil disdain of the imagined contagiousness of others, and at this day, their cantoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing in Tribes, and shyness of alliance with neighbours, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves not the term of mutual love, but rather seems a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial melancholy of herding in their own Walks. That of the Ethnicks, like this of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> consisted in the vain pride of Empire, and never enjoyn'd a Jewish separation, but drew all Nations together; yet not as their companions of the same species, but as slaves to a Yoke: Their sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was Honour, and their Honour onely an impudent cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, or dexterity in destroying. But Christian Religion hath the innocence of village neighbour-hood, and did
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95940:7"/>
anciently in its politicks rather promote the interest of Mankind than of States; and rather of all States than of one; for particular endeavours onely in behalf of our own homes, are signs of a narrow moral education, not of the vast kindness of Christian Religion, which likewise or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd as well an universal communion of bosoms, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of wealth. Such is Christian Religion in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and was once so in the practice. But I resolv'd my Poem should represent those of a former Age, perceiving 'tis with the servants of Christ, as with other servants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der temporal power, who with all cleanness, and even with officious diligence perform their duty in their Masters sight, but still as he grows longer absent, become more slothfull, unclean and false. And this, who ever compares the present with the Primitive times, may too palpably discern.</p>
            <p>When I consider'd the actions which I meant to describe, (those inferring the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) I was again perswaded rather to chuse those of a former Age, than the present; &amp; in a Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry so far remov'd, as might preserve me from their improper examinations, who know not the requisites of a Poem, nor how much pleasure they lose (and even the pleasures of Heroick Poesie are not unprofitable) who take away the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of a Poet, and fetter his feet in the shackles of an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian: For why should a Poet doubt in Story to mend the intrigues of Fortune by more delightfull conveyances of probable fictions, because austere Historians have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into bond to truth? an obligation which were in Poets, as foolish and unnecessary as is the bondage of false Martyrs, who lye in chains for a mistaken opinion: but by this I would imply, that Truth narrative and past, is the Idol of Historians, (who worship a dead thing) and truth operative, and by effects continually alive, is the Mistress of Poets, who hath not her existence in matter, but in reason.</p>
            <p>I was likewise more willing to derive my Theme from elder times, as thinking it no little mark of skilfulness to comply with the common Infirmity; for men (even of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95940:7"/>
best education) discover their eyes to be weak, when they look upon the glory of virtue (which is great actions) and rather endure it at distance than near; being more apt to believe, and love the renown of Predecessors, than of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries, whose deeds excelling theirs in their own sight, seem to upbraid them, and are not reverenc'd as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Virtue, but envi'd as the favours of Fortune: But to make great Actions credible, is the principal Art of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets; who though they allow the utilitie of Fictions, should not (by altering and subliming Storie) make use of their priviledge to the detriment of the Reader; whose incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie (when things are not represented in proportion) doth much allay the relish of his pitie, hope, joy, and other Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: for we may descend to compare the deceptions in Poesie to those of them that profess dexteritie of Hand, which resembles Conjuring, and to such we come not with the intention of <hi>Lawyers</hi> to examine the evidence of Facts, but are content (if we like the carriage of their feigned mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to pay for being well deceiv'd.</p>
            <p>As in the choise of time, so of place, I have comply'd with the weakness of the generalitie of men; who think the best objects of their own countrey so little to the size of those abroad, as if they were shew'd them by the wrong end of a Prospective: For man (continuing the appetites of his first Childhood, till he arrive at his second which is more froward) must be quieted with something that he thinks excellent, which he may call his own; but when he sees the like in other places (not staying to compare them) wrangles at all he has. This leads us to observe the crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Comicks,</hi> who are onely willing when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe humour (and humour is the drunkness of a Nation which no sleep can cure) to lay the Scaene in their own countrey; as knowing we are (like the Son of <hi>Noah</hi>) so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle distasted to behold each others shame, that we delight to see even that of a Father: yet when they would set forth greatness and excellent virtue, (which is the Theme of <hi>Tragedie</hi>) publickly to the people; they wisely (to avoid
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95940:8"/>
the quarrels of neighbourly envie) remove the Scaene from home. And by their example I travell'd too; and <hi>Italie</hi> (which was once the Stage of the World) I have made the Theatre, where I shew in either Sex, some patterns of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life, that are (perhaps) fit to be follow'd.</p>
            <p>Having told you why I took the actions that should be my Argument from men of our own Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and given you reasons for the choyce of the time and place design'd for those actions; I must next acquaint you with the Schools where they were bred; not meaning the Schools where they took their Religion, but Moralitie; for I know Religion is universally rather inherited than taught: and the most effectual Schools of Moralitie are Courts and Camps: Yet towards the first, the people are unquiet through envie; and towards the other through fear; and always jealous of both for Injustice, which is the natural scandal cast upon authoritie and great force. They look upon the outward glory or blaze of Courts, as wild Beasts in dark nights stare on their Hunters Torches; but though the expences of Courts (whereby they shine) is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming glory in which the people think their libertie is wasted (for wealth is their libertie and lov'd by them even to jealousie (being themselves a courser sort of Princes, apter to take than to pay) yet Courts (I mean all abstracts of the multitude; either by King, or Assemblies) are not the Schools where men are bred to oppression, but the Temples where sometimes Oppressours take sanctuarie; a safetie which our reason must allow them. For the ancient laws of Sanctuarie (derived from God) provided chiefly for actions that proceeded from necessitie; and who can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine less than a necessitie of oppressing the people, since they are never willing either to buy their Peace, or to pay for War?</p>
            <p>Nor are Camps the Schools of wicked Destroyers, more than the <hi>Inns of Court</hi> (being the Nurserie of Judges) are the Schools of Murderers; for as Judges are avengers of private men against private Robbers; so are Armies the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengers
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95940:8"/>
of the Publick against publick Invaders, either civil or forreign: and Invaders are Robbers, though more in countenance than those of the High way, because of their number. Nor is there other difference between Armies when they move towards Sieges or Battel, and Judges moving in their Circuit (during the danger of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie malefactors) with the guards of the Countie; but that the latter is a less Army, and of less Discipline. If any man can yet doubt of the necessarie use of Armies, let him studie that which was anciently call'd a Monster, the Multitude, (for Wolves are commonly harmless when they are met alone, but very uncivil in Herds) and he will not find that all his kindred by <hi>Adam</hi> are so tame and gentle, as those Lovers that were bred in <hi>Arcadia:</hi> or to reform his opinion, let him ask why (during the utmost age of Historie) Cities have been at the charge of defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Walls, and why Fortification hath been practic'd so long, till it is grown an Art?</p>
            <p>I may now believe I have usefully taken from Courts and Camps, the patterns of such as will be fit to be imitated by the most necessary men; and the most necessary men are those who become principal by prerogative of bloud, (which is seldom unassisted with education) or by greatness of mind, which in exact definition is Virtue. The common Crowd (of whom we are hopeless) we desert, being rather to be corrected by laws (where precept is accompanied with punishment) than to be taught by Poesie; for few have arriv'd at the skill of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> or at his good fortune, whom we may suppose to have met with extraordinarie Grecian Beasts, when so succesfully he reclaim'd them with his Harp. Nor is it needfull that Heroick Poesie should be levell'd to the reach of Common men: for if the examples it presents prevail upon their Chiefs, the delight of Imitation (which we hope we have prov'd to be as effectual to good as to evil) will rectifie by the rules, which those Chiefs establish of their own lives, the lives of all that behold them; for the example of life, doth as much surpass the force of Precept, as Life doth exceed Death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:95940:9"/>In the choice of these Objects (which are as Sea-marks to direct the dangerous voyage of life) I thought fit to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the rule of Coasting Maps, where the Shelves and Rocks are describ'd as well as the safe Channel; the care being equal how to avoid as to proceed: and the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of men (whose passions are to be eschew'd) I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from the distempers of Love or Ambition: for Love and Ambition are too often the raging Feavers of great minds. Yet Ambition (if the vulgar acception of the word were corrected) would signifie no more than an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary lifting of the feet in the rough ways of Honour, over the impediments of Fortune; and hath a warmth (till it be chaf'd into a Fever) which is necessary for every virtuous breast: for good men are guiltie of too little appetite to greatness, and it either proceeds from that they call con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedness (but contentedness, when examin'd, doth mean something of Lasiness as well as Moderation) or from some melancholy precept of the Cloyster; where they would make life (for which the world was onely made) more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant than Death: as if Nature, the Vicegerent of God (who in providing delightfull varieties, which virtuous greatness can best possess, or assure peaceably to others, implicitly commanded the use of them) should in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries of life (life being her chief business) though in her whole reign she never committed one error, need the counsel of Fryars, whose solitude makes them no more fit for such direction, than Prisoners long fetter'd are for a race.</p>
            <p>In saying this, I onely awaken such retir'd men, as eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate their strength of mind by close and long thinking; and would every where separate the Soul from the Bodie, ere we are dead, by perswading us (though they were both created and have been long companions together) that the preferment of the one must meerly consist in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting the other; teaching us to court the Grave, as if du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole lease of life, we were like Moles to live under ground; or as if long and well dying, were the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95940:9"/>
certain means to live in Heaven: Yet Reason (which though the most profitable Talent God hath given us, some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines would have Philosophers to bury in the Napkin, and not put it to use) perswade us, that the painfull activeness of Virtue (for Faith on which some wholly depend, seems but a contemplative boast till the effects of it grow exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary by action) will more probably acquire everlasting dignities. And surely if these severe Masters (who though obscure in Cells, take it ill if their very opinions rule not all abroad) did give good men leave to be industrious in getting a Share of governing the world, the Multitudes (which are but Tenants to a few Monarchs) would endure that subjection which God hath decreed them, with better order, and more ease; for the world is onely ill govern'd, because the wicked take more pains to get authority, than the virtuous; for the virtuous are often preach'd into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement; which is to the publick as unprofitable as their sleep; and the erroneousness of such lazy rest, let Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers judge; since Nature (of whose body man thinks himself the chiefest member) hath not any where, at any time, been respited from action (in her, call'd motion) by which she universally preserves and makes Life. Thus much of Ambition which should have succeeded some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I was saying of Love.</p>
            <p>Love, in the interpretation of the Envious, is Softness; in the Wicked, good men suspect it for Lust; and in the Good, some spiritual men have given it the name of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: And these are but te<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And in observation of the second, I have thought, that those horrid spectacles (when the latter race of <hi>Gladiaters</hi> made up the excesses of Romane feasts) did more induce the Guests to detest the cruelty of mankind, than increase their courage by beholding such an impudent scorn of Life.</p>
            <p>I have now given you the accomp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of such provisions as I made for this new Building; and you may next please (having examin'd the substance) to take a view of the form; and observe if I have methodically and with discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, dispos'd of the materials, which with some curiosity I have collected. I cannot discern by any help from read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or learned men, (who have been to me the best and briefest Indexes of Books) that any Nation hath in repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment of great actions (either by <hi>Heroicks</hi> or <hi>Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>) digested Story into so pleasant and instructive a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod as the English by their <hi>Drama:</hi> and by that regular species (though narratively and not in Dialogue) I have drawn the body of an Heroick Poem: In which I did not onely observe the Symmetrie (proportioning five Books to five <hi>Acts,</hi> and <hi>Canto's</hi> to <hi>Scenes,</hi> (the <hi>Scenes</hi> having their number ever govern'd by occasion) but all the <hi>shadowings,</hi>

               <hi>happy strokes, secret graces,</hi> and even the <hi>drapery</hi> (which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether make the second beauty) I have (I hope) exactly follow'd: and those compositions of second beauty, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in the <hi>Drama</hi> to be the under-walks, interweaving, or correspondence of lesser design in <hi>Scenes,</hi> not the great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the main plot, and coherence of the <hi>Acts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first <hi>Act</hi> is the general preparative, by rendering the chiefest characters of persons, and ending with something that looks like an obscure promise of design. The second begins with an introducement of new persons, so finishes all the characters, and ends with some little performance of that design which was promis'd at the parting of the first <hi>Act.</hi> The third makes a visible correspondence in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-walks (or lesser intrigues) of persons; and ends with an ample turn of the main design, and expectation of a new. The fourth (ever having occasion to be the longest) gives a notorious turn to all the under-walks, and a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-turn to that main design which chang'd in the third. The fifth begins with an entire diversion of the main, and dependant Plots; then makes the general correspondence of the persons more discernable, and ends with an easie untying of those particular knots, which made a contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the whole; leaving such satisfaction of probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with the Spectatour, as may perswade him that neither Fortune in the fate of the Persons, nor the Writer in the Representment, have been unnatural or exorbitant. To these <hi>Meanders</hi> of the English Stage I have cut out the Walks of my Poem; which in this description may seem intricate and tedious; but will, I hope (when men take pains to visit what they have heard describ'd) appear to them as pleasant as a summer passage on a crooked River, where going about, and turning back, is as delightfull as the delays of parting Lovers.</p>
            <p>In placing the Argument (as a <hi>Proem</hi>) before every <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>to,</hi> I have not wholly follow'd the example of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns; but averted it from that purpose to which I found it frequently us'd: for it hath been intended by others, as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95940:11"/>
the contents of the Chapter, or as a Bill of Fare at a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Feast; which is not brought before the meat to raise an expectation, but to satisfie the longing curiosity of the Guests. And that which I have call'd my Argument, is onely meant as an assistance to the Readers memory, by containing brief hints, such, as if all the Arguments were successively read, would make him easily remember the mutual dependancies of the general design; yet each ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mentions every person acting, than their actions: But he is very unskilfull that by Narratives before an Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Poem, prevents expectation; for so he comes to have as little success over the Reader (whom the Writer should surprize, and as it were keep prisoner for a time) as he hath on his Enemies, who commanding a party out to take them (and commonly Readers are justly Enemies to Writers) imparts openly the design ere he begins the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Or he may be said to be as unluckily officious as he that leads a wooing to a Mistress, one that already hath newly enjoy'd her.</p>
            <p>I shall say a little, why I have chosen my inter-woven <hi>Stanza</hi> of four, though I am not oblig'd to excuse the choice; for numbers in Verse must, like distinct kinds of Musick, be expos'd to the uncertain and different taste of several Ears. Yet I may declare, that I believ'd it would be more pleasant to the Reader, in a Work of length, to give this respite or pause, between every <hi>Stanza</hi> (having endeavour'd that each should contain a period) than to run him out of breath with continu'd <hi>Couplets.</hi> Nor doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate Rhyme by any lowliness of cadence, make the sound less Heroick, but rather adapt it to a plain and state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly composing of Musick; and the brevity of the <hi>Stanza</hi> renders it less subtile to the Composer, and more easie to the Singer; which in <hi>stilo recitativo,</hi> when the Story is long, is chiefly requisite. And this was indeed (if I shall not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray vanity in my Confession) the reason that prevail'd most towards my choice of this <hi>Stanza,</hi> and my division of the main work into <hi>Canto's,</hi> every <hi>Canto</hi> including a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient

accomplishment of some worthy design or action; for I had so much heat (which you, Sir, may call pride, since pride may be allow'd in <hi>Pegasus,</hi> if it be a praise to other Horses) as to presume they might (like the Works of <hi>Homer</hi> ere they were joyn'd together, and made a Volume by the Athenian King) be sung at Village-feasts; though not to Monarchs after Victory, nor to Armies before battel. For so (as an inspiration of glory into the one, and of valour into the other) did <hi>Homer</hi>'s Spirit, long after his bodies rest, wander in musick about <hi>Greece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you have the <hi>Model</hi> of what I have already built, or shall hereafter joyn to the same frame. If I be accus'd of Innovation, or to have transgress'd against the method of the Ancients; I shall think my self secure in believing, that a Poet who hath wrought with his own instruments at a new design, is no more answerable for disobedience to Predecessours, than <hi>Law-makers</hi> are lyable to those old Laws which themselves have repealed.</p>
            <p>Having describ'd the outward frame, the large rooms within, the lesser conveyances, and now the furniture; it were orderly to let you examine the matter of which that furniture is made: But though every Owner who hath the Vanity to shew his ornament, or Hangings, must endure the curiosity, and censure of him that beholds them; yet I shall not give you the trouble of enquiring what is, but tell you of what I design'd their substance; which is, <hi>Wit:</hi> And <hi>Wit</hi> is the laborious, and the lucky resultances of Thought, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving towards its excellence (as we say of the strokes of Painting) as well a happiness as care. It is a Web consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the subt'lest threds; and like that of the <hi>Spider,</hi> is considerately woven out of our selves; for a <hi>Spider</hi> may be said to consider, not onely respecting his solemness and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit posture (like a grave Scout in ambush for his Enemy) but because all things done, are either from consideration, or chance; and the work of Chance are accomplishments of an instant, having commonly a dissimilitude; but hers are the works of time, and have their contextures alike.</p>

               <hi>Wit</hi> is not onely the luck and labour, but also the dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of thought, rounding the world, like the Sun, with unimaginable motion; and bringing swiftly home to the memorie, universal surveys. It is the Souls <hi>Powder,</hi> which when supprest (as forbidden from flying upward) blows up the restraint, and loseth all force in a farther ascension to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven (the region of God) and yet by nature is much less able to make any inquisition downward towards Hell, the Cel of the Devil; but breaks through all about it (as far as the utmost it can reach) removes, uncovers, makes way for Light, where Darkness was inclos'd, till great bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are more examinable by being scatter'd into parcels; and till all that find its strength (but most of mankind are strangers to <hi>Wit,</hi> as <hi>Indians</hi> are to <hi>Powder</hi>) worship it for the effects, as deriv'd from the Deitie It is in Divines, Humilitie, Exemplariness and Moderation; in States-men, Gravitie, Vigilance, Benign Complacencie, Secrecie, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Dispatch; in Leaders of Armies, Valor, Painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Temperance, Bountie, Dexteritie in Punishing and Rewarding, and a sacred Certitude of Promise: It is in Poets, a full comprehension of all recited in all these; and an abilitie to bring those comprehensions into action, when they shall so far forget the true measure of what is of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est consequence to humanitie, (which are things righteous, pleasant and usefull) as to think the delights of Greatness equal to that of Poesie; or the Chiefs of any Profession more necessary to the world, than excellent Poets. Lastly, though <hi>Wit</hi> be not the envie of ignorant Men, 'tis often of evil States-men, and of all such imperfect great spirits, as have it in a less degree than Poets: for though no man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies the excellencie of that, which in no proportion he ever tasted, (as men cannot be said to envie the condition of Angels) yet we may say the Devil envies the Supremacie of God, because he was in some degree partaker of his glory.</p>
            <p>That which is not, yet is accounted, <hi>Wit,</hi> I will but sleightly remember; which seems very incident to imperfect

youth, and sickly age; Young men (as if they were not quite deliver'd from Childhood, whose first exercise is Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) imagine it consists in the Musick of Words, and believe they are made wise by refining their speech, above the vulgar Dialect; which is a mistake almost as great as that of the people, who think Orators, (which is a title that crowns at riper years those that have practis'd the dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of tongue) the ablest men; who are indeed so much more unapt for governing, as they are more fit for Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and it may be said of them as of the Witches of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> who can sell a Storm for a <hi>Dollar,</hi> which for Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand they cannot allay. From the esteem of speaking they proceed to the admiration of what are commonly call'd <hi>Conceits,</hi> things that sound like the knacks or toys of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie <hi>Epigrammatists:</hi> and from thence, after more conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation and varietie of objects, grow up to some force of <hi>Fancie;</hi> Yet even then, like young Hawks, they stray and flie far off, using their libertie as if they would nere return to the Lure; and often go at check, ere they can make a stedie view, and know their game.</p>
            <p>Old men, that have forgot their first Childhood and are returning to their second, think it lies in <hi>agnominations,</hi> and in a kind of an alike tinkling of words; or else in a grave telling of wonderfull things, or in comparing of times without a discover'd partialitie; which they perform so ill by favouring the past, that, as 'tis observ'd, if the bodies of men should grow less, though but an unmeasurable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in Seven years, yet reckoning from the <hi>Floud,</hi> they would not remain in the Stature of Frogs; So if States and particular persons had impair'd in government, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd in wickedness proportionably to what Old men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm they have done, from their own infancie to their age; all publick Policie had been long since Confusion, and the congregated World would not suffice now to people a Village.</p>
            <p>The last thing they suppose to be <hi>Wit,</hi> is their bitter Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, when they almost declare themselves Enemies to

And Beautie, though many call themselves her Friends, hath few but such as are false to her: Though the World sets her in a Throne, yet all about her (even her gravest Counsellors) are Traytors, though not in conspiracie, yet in their distinct designs; and to make her certain not onely of distress but ruin, she is ever pursu'd by her most cruel enemie, the great Destroyer, <hi>Time.</hi> But I will proceed no farther upon old men, nor in recording mistakes; lest finding so many more, than there be Verities, we might believe we walk in as great obscurity as the Egyptians when Darkness was their Plague.

me, that the engenderings of unripe age become abortive, and deform'd; and that after obtaining more years, those must needs prophesie with ill success, who make use of their Visions in Wine; That when the ancient Poets were valu'd as Prophets, they were long and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in watching the correspondence of Causes, ere they presum'd to foretel effects: and that 'tis a high pesumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to entertain a Nation (who are Poets standing Guest, and require Monarchical respect) with hastie provisions; as if a Poet might imitate a familiar dispatch of Faulkoners, mount his <hi>Pegasus,</hi> unhood his <hi>Muse,</hi> and with a few flights boast he hath provided a feast for a Prince. Such posting upon <hi>Pegasus</hi> I have long since forborn; and during my Journey in this Work, have mov'd with a slow pace; that I might make my survays as one that travelled not bring home the names, but the proportion, and nature of things: and in this I am made wise by two great exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; for the friends of <hi>Virgil</hi> acknoledge he was many years in doing honour to <hi>Aeneas</hi> (still contracting at night into a closer force, the abundance of his morning strengths) and <hi>Statius</hi> rather seems to boast, than blush, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses he was twice Seven in renowning the War between <hi>Argos</hi> and <hi>Thebes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next to the usefulness of Time (which here implies ripe age (I believ'd pains most requisite to this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking: for though painfulness in Poets (according to the usual negligence of our Nation in Examining, and their diligence to censure) seems always to discover a want of natural force, and is traduc'd, as if Poesie concern'd the World no more than Dancing; whose onely grace is the quickness and facilitie of motion; and whole perfection is not of such publick conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that any man can merit much by attaining it with long labour; yet let them consider, and they will find (nor can I stay long ere I convince them in the important use of Poesie) the natural force of a Poet more apparent, by but confessing that great forces

ask great labour in managing, than by an arrogant braving the World, when he enters the field with his undisciplin'd first thoughts: For a wise Poet, like a wise General, will not shew his strengths till they are in exact government and order; which are not the postures of chance, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Vigilance and Labour.</p>
            <p>Yet to such painfull Poets some upbraid the want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary fury, or rather <hi>inspiration,</hi> a dangerous word; which many have of late successfully us'd; and <hi>inspiration</hi> is a spiritual Fit, deriv'd from the ancient Ethnick Poets, who then, as they were Priests, were States-men too, and probably lov'd dominion; and as their well dissembling of Inspiration begot them reverence then, equal to that which was paid to Laws; so these, who now profess the same fury, may perhaps by such authentick example pretend authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie over the people; It being not unreasonable to imagine, they rather imitate the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets, than the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, since the later were inspir'd for the use of others; and these, like the former, prophesie for themselves. But though the ancient Poets are excus'd, as knowing the weak constitution of those Deities from whom they took their Priesthood; and the frequent necessitie of dissembling for the ease of Government: yet these (who also from the chief to the meanest are States-men and Priests, but have not the luck to be Poets) should not assume such saucie familiaritie with a true God.</p>
            <p>From the time and labour requir'd to my Poem, let me proceed to my Assistants; by which I shall not so much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test my own weakness, as discover the difficulties and greatness of such a work: For when <hi>Solomon</hi> made use of his Neighbours towards his Building, he lost no reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor by demanding those aids was thought a lesser Prince; but rather publish'd his Wisdom in rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the vast extent of his enterprise: Who likewise with as much glorie made use of Fellers of Wood, and Hewers of Stone, as of learned Architects: Nor have I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain'd to be oblig'd to men of any Science, as well mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical

as liberal: Nor when Memorie (from that various and plentifull stock, with which all observers are furnish'd, that have had diversitie of life) presented me by chance with any figure, did I lay it aside as useless, because at that instant I was not skilfull to manage it artfully? but I have staid and recorded such objects, till by consulting with right Masters I have dispos'd of them without mistake; It being no more shame to get Learning at that very time, and from the same Text; when, and by which, we instruct others; than for a froward Scout, discovering the Enemie, to save his own life at a pass, where he then teaches his Partie to escape.</p>
            <p>In remembring mine own helps, I have consider'd those which others in the same necessitie have taken; and find that Writers (contrarie to my inclination) are apter to be beholding to Books, than to Men; not onely as the first are more in their possessions (being more constant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions than dearest friends) but because they commonly make such use of treasure found in Books, as of other trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure belonging to the Dead, and hidden under ground; for they dispose of both with great secrecie, defacing the shape or images of the one, as much as of the other; through fear of having the original of their stealth or abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance discover'd. And the next cause why Writers are more in Libraries than in company, is, that Books are easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly open'd, and learned men are usually shut up, by a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or envious humour of retention, or else unfold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, so as we may read more of their weakness and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, than Wisdom; imitating the Holy-day-custom in great Cities, where the shops of Chaundrie, and slight wares, are familiarly open, but those of solid and staple merchandise are proudly lock'd up.</p>
            <p>Nor indeed can it be expected that all great Doctors are of so benign a nature, as to take pains in gaining treasure (of which Knowledge is the greatest) with intent to inrich others so easily, as if they stood every where with their Pockets spred, &amp; ready to be pickt: nor can we read of any

By this remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance of that usual parsimony in owners of Wit, towards such as would make use of their plenty, I lament the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of others, and may wish the Reader to congratulate mine; For I have found Friends as ready as Books, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate my conceptions, or make them more correct, easie and apparent. But though I am become so wise, by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my self, as to believe the thoughts of divers transcend the best which I have written; yet I have admitted from no man any change of my Design, nor very seldom of my sense: For I resolv'd to have this Poem subsist and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue throughout with the same complexion and spirit; though it appear but like a plain Family, of a neighbourly alliance, who marry into the same moderate quality and garb, and are fearfull of introducing strangers of greater rank, lest the shining presence of such, might seem to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid, and put all about them out of countenance.</p>

            <p>Men are chiefly provok'd to the toyl of compiling Books, by love of Fame, and often by officiousness of Conscience, but seldom with expectation of Riches: for those that spend time in writing to instruct others, may finde leasure to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themselves, how mean the provisions are which bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and studious minds can make for their own sedentary bodies: And Learned men (to whom the rest of the world are but Infants) have the same foolish affection in nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others minds, as Pelicans in feeding their young; which is, at the expence of the very subsistance of Life. 'Tis then apparent they proceed by the instigation of Fame, or Conscience; and I believe many are perswaded by the first (of which I am One) and some are commanded by the second. Nor is the desire of Fame so vain as divers have rigidly imagin'd; Fame being (when belonging to the Living) that which is more gravely call'd, a steddy and necessary reputation; and without it, hereditary Power, or acquir'd greatness can never quietly govern the World. 'Tis of the dead a musical glory, in which God, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of excellent goodness, vouchsafes to take a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al share; For the remember'd virtues of Great men are chiefly such of his works (mention'd by King <hi>David</hi>) as perpetually praise him: and the good fame of the Dead prevails by example, much more than the reputation of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95940:16"/>
the Living, because the later is always suspected by our Envy, but the other is chearfully allow'd, and religiously admir'd: for Admiration (whose Eyes are ever weak) stands still, and at gaze upon great things acted far off; but when they are near, walks slightly away as from familiar objects. Fame is to our Sons a solid Inheritance, and not usefull to remote Posterity; and to our Reason, 'tis the first, though but a little taste of Eternity.</p>
            <p>Those that write by the command of Conscience (think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves able to instruct others, and consequently oblig'd to it) grow commonly the most voluminous; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the pressures of Conscience are so incessant, that she is never satisfied with doing enough: for such as be newly made the Captives of God (many appearing so to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when they first begin to wear the Fetters of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science) are like common slaves, when newly taken; who terrified with a fancy of the severity of absolute Masters, abuse their diligence out of fear, and do ill, rather than appear idle. And this may be the cause why Libraries are more than double lin'd with Spiritual Books, or Tracts of Morality; the later being the Spiritual Counsels of <hi>Lay-men;</hi> and the newest of such great volumns (being usually but transcriptions or translations) differ so much from the Ancients, as later days from those of old; which difference is no more than an alteration of names by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Ethnicks</hi> to make way for the <hi>Saints.</hi> These are the effects of their labours, who are provok'd to become Authours, meerly out of Conscience; and Conscience we may again averre to be often so unskilfull and timorous, that it seldom gives a wise and steddy account of God; but grows jealous of him as of an Adversary, and is after me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy visions like a fearfull Scout, after he hath ill sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd the Enemy, who then makes incongruous, long, and terrible Tales.</p>
            <p>Having confess'd that the desire of Fame made me a Writer; I must declare, why in my riper age I chose to gain it more especially by an Heroical Poem; and the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95940:17"/>
Heroick, being by most allow'd to be the most beautifull of Poems, I shall not need to decide the quarrels of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets about Degrees of Excellence in Poesie: But 'tis no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> amiss ere I avow the usefulness of the Science in general (which was the cause of my undertaking) to remember the value it had from the greatest and most worthy spirits in all Ages: for I will not abstain (though it may give me the reputation but of common reading) to mention, that <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But as in this hasty Muster of Poets, and listing their confederates, I shall by omitting many, deprive them of that pay which is due from Fame; so I may now by the opinion of some Divines (whom notwithstanding I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence in all their distinct habits and fashions of the mind) be held partial, and too bold, by adding to the first num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (though I range them upon holy ground, and aside)

               <hi>Moses, David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> for their Songs, Psalms, and Anthems; the Second being the acknowledg'd Favorite of God, whom he had gain'd by excellent Praises in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Poesie. And I fear (since Poesie is the clearest light, by which they find the soul who seek it) that Poets have in their fluent kindness diverted from the right use, and spent too much of that spiritual talent in the honour of mortal Princes: for divine Praise (when in the high perfection, as in Poets, and onely in them) is so much the uttermost and whole of Religious worship, that all other parts of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion serve but to make it up.</p>

            <p>After this contemplation, how acceptable the voice of Poesie hath been to God, we may (by descending from
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95940:18"/>
Heaven to Earth) consider how usefull it is to Men; and among Men, Divines are the chief, because ordain'd to temper the rage of humane power by spiritual menaces, as by sudden and strange threatenings madness is frighted into Reason; and they are sent hither as Liegers from God, to conserve in stedfast motion the slippery joynts of Government; and to perswade an amity in divided Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: therefore to Divines I first address my self; and presume to ask them, why, ever since their dominion was first allow'd, at the great change of Religions, (though ours more than any inculca<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es obedience, as an easie Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine to cool the impatient and raging world into a quiet rest) mankind hath been more unruly than before? it being, visible that Empire decreas'd with the increase of Christianity; and that one weak Prince did anciently suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to govern many strong Nations: but now one little Province is too hard for thei<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> own wise King; and a small Republick hath Seventy years maintain'd their Revolt to the disquiet of many Monarchs. Or if Divines reply, we cannot expect the good effects of their Office, because their spiritual Dominion is not allow'd as absolute, then it may be ask'd them more severely, why 'tis not allow'd? for where ever there hath been great degrees of power, (which hath been often and long in the Church) it disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers (though worldly vicissitude be objected as an excuse) that the managers of such power, since they endeavour'd not to enlarge it, believ'd the increase unrighteous; or were in acting, or contriving that endeavour, either negligent or weak: For Power, like the hasty Vine, climbs up apace to the Supporter; but if not skilfully attended and dress'd, in stead of spreading and bearing fruit, grows high and naked; and then (like empty title) being soon useless to others, becomes neglected, and unable to support it self.</p>
            <p>But if Divines have fail'd in governing Princes (that is, of being entirely believ'd by them) yet they might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely have rul'd them, in ruling the People; by whom of late, Princes have been govern'd; and they might proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95940:18"/>
rule the People, because the heads of the Church (where ever Christianity is preach'd) are Te<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rarchs of Time; of which they command the fourth Division; for to no less the Sabbaths, and Days of Saints amount; and during those days of spiritual triumph, Pulpits are Thrones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the people oblig'd to open their Ears, and let in the ordinances and commands of Preachers; who likewise are not without some little Regency throughout the rest of the Year; for then they may converse with the Laity, from whom they have commonly such respect (and respect soon opens the door to perswasion) as shews their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations not deaf in those holy seasons, when speaking predominates.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding these advantages, the Pulpit hath little prevail'd; for the world is in all Regions revers'd, or shaken by disobedience, an Engine with which the great Angels (for such were the Devils, and had faculties much more sublim'd than Men) believ'd they could disorder Heaven. And it is not want of capacity in the lower Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory that makes Doctrine so unsuccessfull; for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not simple, since the Gentrie (<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>en of strongest education) lack sufficient defence against them, and are hourly surpriz'd in (their common Ambushes) their Shops: For on sacred Days they walk gravely and sadly from Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as if they had newly buried their sinfull Fathers; at night sleep as if they never needed forgiveness; and rise with the next Sun, to lie in wait for the Noble, and the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious. And though these quiet Co<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>seners are amongst the People, esteemed their steddy Men; yet they honour the courage, and more active parts of such disobedient Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as disdaining thus tamely to deceive, attempt bravely to rob the State; and the State they believe (though the Helm were held by Apostles) would always consist of such Arch-robbers, as who ever strips them, but waves the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious satisfaction which the Lasie expect from Laws, and comes a shorter way to his own.</p>
            <p>Thus unapt for obedience (in the condition of Beasts
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95940:19"/>
whose appetite is Liberty, and their Liberty a license of Lust) the People have often been, since a long, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious power hath continued with Divines; whom though with reverence we accuse for mistaken lenity, yet are we <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t so cruel to expect they should behave themselves to Sinners like fierce <hi>Phinehas,</hi> or preach with their Swords drawn, to kill all they cannot perswade: But our meaning is to shew how much their Christian meekness hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them in taming this wild monster, the People; and a little to rebuke them for neglecting the assistance of Poets; and for upbraiding the Ethnicks, because the Poets manag'd their Religion; as if Religion could walk more prosperously abroad, than when Morality (respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and bare-headed as her Usher) prepares the way: it being no less true, that during the dominion of Poesie, a willing and peacefull obedience to Superiours becalm'd the world; then that obedience, like the marriage yoak, is a restraint more needfull and advantagious than liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and hath the same reward of pleasant quietness, which it anciently had, when <hi>Adam,</hi> till his disobedience, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed Paradise. Such are the effects of sacred Poesie, which charms the People with harmonious Precepts; and whose aid Divines should not disdain, since their Lord (the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the World) vouchsaf'd to deliver his Doctrine in Parabolical Fictions.</p>
            <p>Those that be of next importance are Leaders of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and such I measure not by the suffrages of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who give them respect as Indians worship the evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, rather for sear of harm, than for affection; but esteem them as the painfull Protectours and Enlargers of Empire; by whom it actively moves, and such active motion of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire is as necessary as the motion of the Sea, where all things would putrifie, and infect one another, if the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were quiet: so is it with mens minds on shore, when that Element of greatness and honour, <hi>Empire,</hi> stands still; of which the largeness is likewise as needfull, as the vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Sea: For God ordain'd not huge Empire as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95940:19"/>
proportionable to the Bodies, but to the Minds of Men; and the Minds of Men are more monstrous, and require more space for agitation, and the hunting of others, than the bodies of Whales. But he that believes men such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Sheep, as that many are peacefully containd in a narrow Fold, may be better inform'd in <hi>America,</hi> where lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Kings never enjoy a harmless neighbourhood, unless protected defensively amongst themselves, by an Emperour that hath wide possessions, and priority over them, (as in some few places) but when restrain'd in narrow dominion, where no body commands and hinders their nature, they quarrel like Cocks in a Pit; &amp; the Sun in a days travel there, sees more battels (but not of consequence, because their Kings though many, are little) than in <hi>Europe</hi> in a Year.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Leaders of Armies,</hi> as to very necessary Men (whose Office requires the uttermost aids of Art and Nature, and rescues the sword of Justice, when 'tis wrested from su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Power by Commotion) I am now address'd, and must put them in mind (though not upbraidingly) how much their Mighty Predecessours were anciently oblig'd to Poets; whose Songs (recording the praises of Conduct and Valour) were esteem'd the chiefest rewards of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; And since Nature hath made us prone to Imitation (by which we equal the best or the worst) how much those Images of Action prevail upon our minds, which are delightfully drawn by Poets? For the greatest of the Grecian Captains have confess'd, that their Counsels have been made wise, and their Courages warm by <hi>Homer;</hi> and since Praise is a pleasure which God hath invited, and with which he often vouchsaf'd to be pleas'd when it was sent him by his own Poet; why is it not lawfull for virtuous men to be cherish'd, and magnify'd with hearing their Vigil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Valour, and good Fortune (the latter being more the immediate gift of Heaven, because the effect of an unknown Cause) commended and made eternal in Poesie? But perhaps the Art of praising Armies into great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant action, by singing their former deeds (an Art with
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95940:20"/>
which the Ancients made <hi>Empire</hi> so large) is too subtle for modern <hi>Leaders;</hi> who as they cannot reach the heights of Poesie, must be content with a narrow space of Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and narrow Dominion breeds evil, peevish, and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious minds, and a National self-opinion, like simple Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish arrogance; and the Jews were extraordinarie proud in a very little Countrey: For men in contracted governments are but a kind of Prisoners; and Prisoners by long restraint grow wicked, malitious to all abroad, and foolish esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of themselves; as if they had wrong in not enjoying eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing which they can onely see out of Windows.</p>
            <p>Our last application is to <hi>States-men,</hi> and makers of <hi>Laws;</hi> who may be reasonably reduc'd to one; since the second differ no more from the first, than Judges (the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of <hi>Law-makers</hi>) differ from their Originals: For Judges, like all bold Interpreters, by often altering the Text, make it quite new; and <hi>States-men</hi> (who differ not from Law-makers in the act, but in the manner of doing) make new Laws presumptuously without the consent of the people; but <hi>Legislators</hi> more civilly seem to whistle to the Beast, and stroak him into the Yoak: and in the Yoak of State, the people (with too much pampering) grow soon unruly and draw awrie; Yet <hi>States-men</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> (whose business is Governing, and the thing to be Govern'd is the People) have amongst us (we being more proud and mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken than any other famous Nation) look'd gravely upon Poetrie, and with a negligence that betray'd a Northerly ignorance; as if they believ'd they could perform the work without it. But Poets (who with wise diligence studie the People, and have in all ages by an insensible influence govern'd their manners) may justly smile when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that <hi>Divines, Leaders of Armies, States-men</hi> &amp; <hi>Judges,</hi> think <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Sword,</hi> or (which is unwritten <hi>Law,</hi> and a secret Confederacie of Chiefs) <hi>Policie,</hi> or <hi>Law</hi> (which is written, but seldom rightly read) can give with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of the <hi>Muses,</hi> a long and quiet satisfaction in government: For <hi>Religion</hi> is to the wicked and saithless
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95940:20"/>
(who are many) a jurisdiction against which they readily rebel; because it rules severely, yet promiseth no worldly recompence for obedience; obedience being by every hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Power invited with assurances of visible advantage. The good (who are but few) need not the power of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> to make them better, the power of <hi>Religion</hi> proceeding from her threatnings, which though mean weapons, are fitly us'd, since she hath none but base Enemies. We may observe too, that all Virtuous men are so taken up with the rewards of Heaven, that they live as if out of the World; and no government receives assistance from any man meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he is good; but as that goodness is active in temporal things.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sword</hi> is in the hand of <hi>Justice</hi> no guard to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but then when <hi>Justice</hi> hath an Army for her own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and Armies, if they were not pervertible by Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet are to Common-wealths like Kings Physitians to poor Patients; who buy the cure of their disorder'd bodies at so high a rate, that they may be said to change their Sickness for Famin. <hi>Policie</hi> (I mean of the Living, not of the Dead; the one being the last rules or designs govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Instant, the other those laws that began Empire) is as mortal as <hi>States-men</hi> themselves: whose incessant labours make that Hectick seaver of the mind, which insensibly dispatches the Bodie: and when we trace <hi>States-men</hi> through all the Histories of Courts, we find their Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons so unnecessarie to those that succeed at the Helm, or so much envi'd as they scarce last in authoritie till the Invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors are buried: and change of Designs in <hi>States-men</hi> (their designs being the weapons by which States are defended) grows as distructive to Government, as a continual change of various weapons into Armies; which must receive with ruin any sudden assault, when want of practice makes unactiveness. We cannot urge that the ambition of <hi>States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> (who are obnoxious to the people) doth much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order Government; because the peoples anger, by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual coming in of new Oppressours is so diverted in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95940:21"/>
those whom their Eyes but lately left, as they have not time enough to rise for the Publick: and evil suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors to power are in the troubled stream of State, like succeeding Tides in Rivers, where the Mud of the former is hidden by the filth of the last.</p>
            <p>Laws, if very ancient, grow as doubtfull and difficult as Letters on buried Marble, which onely Antiquaries read; but if not Old, they want that reverence which is therefore paid to the virtues of Ancestors, because their crimes come not to our remembrance; and yet great men must be long dead whose ills are forgotten. If <hi>Laws</hi> be New, they must be made either by very Angels, or by Men that have some vices; and those being seen make their Virtues suspected; for the People no more esteem able men, whose defects they know, (though but errors incident to Humanitie) than an Enemie values a strong Army having experience of their Errors. And new Laws are held but the projects of necessitous Power, new Nets spred to intangle Us; the Old being accounted too many, since most are believ'd to be made for Forfeitures: and such letting of bloud (though intended by Law-makers for our health) is to the People always out of Season: for those that love life with too much Passion (and Money is the Life-bloud of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) ever fear a Consumption. But be Law-makers as able as Nature or Experience (which is the best Art) can make them; yet though I will not yield the Wicked to be wiser than the Virtuous, I may say, offences are too hard for the Laws, as some Beasts are too wily for their Hunters; and that Vice over-grows Virtue, as much as Weeds grow fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than Medicinable Herbs: or rather that Sin, like the fruitfull slime of <hi>Nilus,</hi> doth increase into so many various shapes of Serpents (whose walks and retreats are winding and unknown) that even <hi>Justice,</hi> (the painfull pursuer of Mischief) is become wearie, and amaz'd.</p>
            <p>After these meditations, me thinks Government resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles a Ship, where though <hi>Divines, Leaders</hi> of <hi>Armies, States-men,</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> are the trusted Pilots; yet it moves
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95940:21"/>
by the means of winds, as uncertain as the breath of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and is laden with the People; a Fraight much loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, and more dangerous than any other living Stowage; being as troublesom in fair weather, as Horses in a Storm. And how can these Pilots stedily maintain their course to the Land of Peace and Plentie, since they are often divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the Helm? For <hi>Divines</hi> (when they consider great <hi>Chiefs</hi>) suppose Armies to be sent from God for a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie Plague, not for continual Jurisdiction; and that Gods extream punishments (of which Armies be the most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent) are ordain'd to have no more lastingness than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams in Nature. They think (when they consider <hi>States-men</hi>) Policie hath nothing of the Dove, and being all Serpent, is more dangerous than the dangers it pretends to prevent: and that out-witting (by falshood and corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption) adverse States, or the People (though the People be often the greater enemie and more perilsom being nearest) is but giving reputation to Sin, and that to maintain the Publick by politick evils, is a base prostitution of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the prostitution of Religion is that unpardonable whordom, which so much anger'd the Prophets. They think <hi>Law</hi> nothing but the Bible forcibly usurp'd by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Lawyers, and disguis'd in a Paraphrase more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure than the Text; and that 'tis onely want of just reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Religion, which doth expose us to the charges and vexations of <hi>Law.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Leaders</hi> of <hi>Armies</hi> accuse <hi>Divines,</hi> for unwisely rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the War of the World by opposite Doctrine, and for being more indiscreet in thinking to appease it by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion; forgetting that the dispatchfull ending of War is blows; and that the natural region for Disputes, when Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are engag'd (though by Religion) is the Field of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, not Schools and Academies; which they believe (by their restless controversies) less civil than Camps; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine Quarrel is held more barbarous than forreign War. They think <hi>States-men</hi> to them (unless dignifi'd with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie Office) but mean Spies, that like <hi>African Foxes</hi> (who attend on <hi>Lions,</hi> ranging before and about for their

valiant prey) shrink back till the danger be subdu'd, and then with insatiate hunger come in for a share: Yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with the Eye of Envie (which enlarges objects like a multiplying glass) they behold these <hi>States-men,</hi> and think them immense as <hi>Whales;</hi> the motion of whose vast bodies can in a peacefull calm trouble the Ocean till it boyl; After a little hastie wonder, they consider them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with disdain of their low constraints at Court; where they must patiently endure the little follies of such small Favourites as wait even near the wisest Thrones; so fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically weak seem Monarchs in the sickness of Care (a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the head) when for the humorous pleasure of Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, they descen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> from purple Beds, and seek their ease upon the ground. These great <hi>Leaders</hi> say also, that <hi>Law</hi> moves slowly as with fetter'd feet, and is too tedious in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress of wrongs; whilst in Armies <hi>Justice</hi> seems to ride post, and overtakes Offenders ere the contagion of crimes can infect others: and though in Courts and Cities great men fence often with her, and with a forcive sleight put by her sword; yet when she retires to <hi>Camps,</hi> she is in a posture not onely to punish the offences of particular Greatness, but of injurious Nations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>States-men</hi> look on <hi>Divines</hi> as men whose long solitude and Meditations on Heaven hath made them Strangers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth: and 'tis acquaintance with the World, and knowledge of Man that makes abilities of Ruling: for though it may be said that a sufficient belief of Doctrine would beget Obedience (which is the uttermost design of Governing) yet since diversitie of Doctrine doth distract all Auditors, and makes them doubtfully dispose their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience (even towards spiritual powers, on which many would have the temporal depend) therefore <hi>States-men</hi> think themselves more fit to manage <hi>Empire,</hi> than <hi>Divines;</hi> whose usefulness consists in perswasion; and perswasion is the last medicine (being the most desperate) which <hi>States-men</hi> apply to the distemper of the People: for their distemper is madness, and madness is best cur'd with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

and force. They think that <hi>Leaders</hi> of <hi>Armies</hi> are to great Empire, as great Rivers to the continent; which make an easie access of such benefits as the Metropolis (the seat of Power) would else at vast distances with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie reach: yet often like proud Rivers when they swell, they destroy more by once overflowing their borders at home, than they have in long time acquir'd from abroad: They are to little Empire like the Sea to low Islands, by nature a defence from Forreigners, but by accident, when they rage, a deluge to their own shore. And at all seasons <hi>States-men</hi> believe them more dangerous to Government than themselves: for the popularitie of <hi>States-men</hi> is not so frequent as that of <hi>Generals;</hi> or if by rare sufficiencie of Art it be gain'd; yet the force of crowds in Cities, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to the validitie of men of Arms, and discipline, would appear like a great number of Sheep to a few Wolves, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a cause of Comfort than of Terrour. They think that chief <hi>Ministers of Law</hi> by unskilfull integritie, or love of popularity (which shews the Mind, as meanly born as bred) so earnestly pursue the protection of the Peoples right, that they neglect publick Interest; &amp; though the Peoples right and publick Interest be the same, yet usually by the People, the Ministers of Law mean private men, and by the other the State; and so the State and the People are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as we may say a man is divided within himself, when Reason and passion (and Passion is folly) dispute about consequent actions; and if we were call'd to assist at such intestine War, we must side with Reason, according to our dutie, by the Law of Nature; and Natures Law, though not written in Stone (as was the Law of Religion) hath taken deep impression in the Heart of Man, which is harder than marble of <hi>Mount-Sinai.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chief <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>Law,</hi> think, <hi>Divines</hi> in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should like the <hi>Penal Statutes,</hi> be choicely, and but seldom us'd; for as those Statutes are rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously inquisitive after venial faults, (punishing our
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95940:23"/>
very manners and weak constitution, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent appetite; so Divines (that are made vehement with contemplating the dignitie of the Offended, (which is God) more than the frailtie of the Offender) go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern as if men could be made Angels, ere they come to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Great <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>Law</hi> think likewise that <hi>Leaders</hi> of <hi>Armies</hi> are like ill Physitians; onely fit for desperate cures, whose boldness calls in the assistance of Fortune, during the fears and troubles of Art; Yet the health they give to a distemper'd State is not more accidental, than the preservation of it is uncertain; because they often grow vain with success, and encourage a restor'd State to such hazards, as shew like irregularitie of life in other recover'd bodies; such as the cautious and ancient gravitie of <hi>Law</hi> disswaded: For <hi>Law</hi> (whose temperate design is safetie) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prevents by constancie of Medicine (like a continu'd Diet) diseases in the bodie politick, than depends after a permitted Sickness upon the chance of recoverie. They think <hi>States-men</hi> strive to be as much Judges of Law as themselves; being chief Ministers of Law, are Judges of the People, and that even good <hi>States-men</hi> pervert the Law more than evil Judges: For Law was anciently meant a defensive Armour, and the People took it as from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine of Justice, to keep them safe from each others vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; but <hi>Sates-men</hi> use it as offensive Arms, with which in forraging to get relief for Supream Power, they often wound the Publick.</p>
            <p>Thus we have first observ'd the Four chief aids of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, (<hi>Religion, Arms, Policie,</hi> and <hi>Law</hi>) defectively appli'd, and then we have found them weak by an emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous war amongst themselves: it follows next, we should introduce to strengthen those principal aids (stil making the People our direct object) some collateral help; which I will safely presume to consist in Poesie.</p>
            <p>We have observ'd that the People since the latter time of Christian Religion, are more unquiet than in former
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95940:23"/>
Ages; so disobedient and fierce, as if they would shake off the ancient imputation of being Beasts, by shewing their Masters they know their own strength: and we shall not erre by supposing that this conjunction of four-fold Power hath fail'd in the effects of authority by a mis-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; for it hath rather endeavour'd to prevail upon their bodies, than their minds; forgetting that the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial art of constraining is the best, which assaults the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part; and the weakest part of the people is their minds; for want of that which is the minds onely strength, <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi> but their Bodies are strong by continual labour; for Labour is the Education of the Body. Yet when I mention the mis-application of force, I should have said, they have not onely fail'd by that, but by a main errour; Because the subject on which they should work, is the Mind; and the Mind can never be constrain'd, though it may be gain'd by perswasion: And since Perswasion is the principal instrument, which can bring to fashion the brittle and mis-shapen mettal of the Mind, none are so fit to this important work as Poets; whose art is more than any, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled with a voluntary, and chearfull assistance of Nature; and whose operations are as restless, secret, easie and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, as is the influence of Planets.</p>
            <p>I must not forget (lest I be prevented by the vigilance of the Reader) that I have profess'd not to represent the beauty of Virtue in my Poem, with hope to perswade com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon men; and I have said, that <hi>Divines</hi> have fail'd in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging their share of Government, by depending upon the effects of perswasion; and that States-men in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the people, rely not upon the perswasion of Divines, but upon force. In my despair of reducing the minds of Common men, I have not confest any weakness of Poesie in the general Science; but rather inferr'd the particular strength of the Heroick; which hath a force that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matches the infancy of such minds as are enabled by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Education; but there are lesser forces in other kinds of Poesie, by which they may train and prepare
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95940:24"/>
their understandings; and Princes and Nobles being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd and made Angelical by the Heroi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ks, will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant lights, which the people cannot chuse but use for direction; as Glow-worms take in, and keep the Suns beams till they shine, and make day to themselves.</p>
            <p>In saying that <hi>Divines</hi> have vainly hop'd to continue the peace of Government by perswasion, I have imply'd such perswasions as are accompanied with threatnings, and seconded by force; which are the perswasions of Pulpits; where is presented to the obstinate, Hell after Death; and the civil Magistrate during life constrains such obedience as the Church doth ordain. But the perswasions of Poesie, in stead of menaces, are Harmonious and Delightfull Insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations, and never any constraint; unless the ravishment of Reason, may be call'd Force. And such Force (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that which <hi>Divines, Commanders, States-men</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> use) begets such obedience as is never weary or griev'd.</p>
            <p>In declaring that <hi>States-men</hi> think not the State wholly secure by such manners as are bred from the perswasions of <hi>Divines,</hi> but more willingly make Government rely upon military-force, I have neither concluded that Poets are unprofitable, nor that <hi>States-men</hi> think so; for the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Poets, would first make the Images of Virtue so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, that her beholders should not be able to look off (rather gently and delightfully infusing, than inculcating Precepts) and then when the mind is conquer'd, like a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Bride, Force should so behave it self, as noble Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands use their power; that is, by letting their Wives see the Dignity and Prerogative of our Sex (which is the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands harmless conquest of Peace) continually maintain'd to hinder Disobedience, rather than rigorously impose Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But to such an easie government, neither the People which are subjects to Kings and States) nor Wives which are subject to Husbands) can peacefully yield, unless they are first conquer'd by Virtue; and the Conquests of Virtue be never easie, but where her forces are commanded by Poets.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:95940:24"/>It may be objected, that the education of the Peoples minds (from whence virtuous Manners are deriv'd) by the several kinds of Poesie (of which the <hi>Dramatick</hi> hath been in all Ages very successfull) is opposite to the receiv'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that the people ought to be continu'd in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; a Maxim sound<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng like the little subtilty of one that is a States man onely by Birth or Beard, and merits not his place by much thinking: For Ignorance is rude, sensorious, jealous, obstinate, and proud; these being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the ingredients of which Disobedience is made; and Obedience proceeds from ample consideration; of which knowledge consists; and knowledge will soon put into one Scale the weight of oppression, and in the other, the heavie burden which Disobedience lays on us in the effects of civil War: &amp; then even Tyranny will seem much lighter, when the hand of supream Power binds up our Load, and lays it artfully on us, than Disobedience (the Parent of Confusion) when we all load one another; in which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one irregularly increases his fellows burdens, to lessen his own.</p>
            <p>Others may object that Poesie on our Stage, or the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick in Musick (for so the latter was anciently us'd) is prejudicial to a State; as begetting Levity, and giving the people too great a diversion by pleasure and mirth. To these (if they be worthy of satisfaction) I reply, That whoever in Government endeavours to make the people serious and grave, (which are attributes that may become the peoples <hi>Representatives,</hi> but not the people) doth pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise a new way to enlarge the State, by making every Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a <hi>States-man:</hi> and he that means to govern so mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully (as it were, without any Musick in his Dominion) must lay but light burdens on his Subjects; or else he wants the ordinary wisdom of those, who to their Beasts, that are much loaden whistle all the day to encourage their Travel. For that supream Power which expects a firm obedience in those, who are not us'd to rejoycing, but live sadly, as if they were still preparing for the funeral of Peace, hath
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95940:25"/>
little skill in contriving the lastingness of Government, which is the principal work of Art; And less hath that Power consider'd Nature; as if such new austeritie did seem to tax, even her, for want of gravity, in bringing in the Spring so merrily with a musical variety of Birds; And such sullen power doth forget, that Battels (the most solemn and serious business of Death) are begun with Trumpets and Fifes; and anciently were continu'd with more diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Musicks. And that the Grecian Laws (Laws being the gravest endeavour of humane Councels, for the ease of Life) were long before the days of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> (to make them more pleasant to memory) publish'd in Verse: And that the wise <hi>Athenians</hi> (dividing into three Parts the publick Revenue) expended one in Plays and Shows, to divert the people from meeting to consult of their Rulers merit, and the defects of Government: And that the <hi>Romans</hi> had not so long continu'd their Empire, but for the same diversions, at a vaster charge.</p>
            <p>Again it may be objected, that the Precepts of Christian Religion are sufficient towards our regulation, by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of manners, and towards the ease of Life, by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing obedience; so that the moral assistance of Poesie, is but vainly intruded. To this I may answer, That as no man should suspect the sufficiency of Religion by its insuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfulness; so if the insuccessfulness be confess'd, we shall as little disparage Religion, by bringing in more aids when 'tis in action, as a General dishonours himself by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring with more of his own Forces, to make sure an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt that hath a while miscarried: For Poesie, which (like contracted <hi>Essences</hi> seems the utmost strength and activity of Nature) is as all good Arts, subservient to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; all marching under the same Banner, though of less discipline and esteem. And as Poesie is the best Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positor of Nature (Nature being mysterious to such as use not to consider) so Nature is the best Interpreter of God; and more cannot be said of Religion. And when the Judges of Religion (which are the Chiefs of the Church)
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95940:25"/>
neglect the help of Moralists in reforming the people, (and Poets are of all Moralists the most usefull) they give a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against the Law of Nature: For Nature performs all things by correspondent aids and harmony. And 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious not to think Poets the most usefull Moralists; for as Poesie is adorn'd and sublim'd by Musick, which makes it more pleasant and acceptable; so morality is sweetned and made more amiable by Poesie. And the Austerity of some Divines may be the cause why Religion hath not more prevail'd upon the manners of Men: for great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours should rather comply with things that please (as the wise Apostle did with Ceremonies) than lose a Proselyte. And even <hi>Honour</hi> (taught by moral Philosophers, but more delightfully infus'd by Poets) will appear (notwithstanding the sad severity of some latter Divines) no unfase Guid towards Piety: for it is as wary and nice as <hi>Conscience,</hi> though more chearfull and couragious. And however <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> be more pleasing to flesh and bloud, because in this World it finds applause; yet 'tis not so mercenarie as Piety: for Piety (being of all her expectations inwardly assur'd) expects a reward in Heaven, to which all earthly payments compar'd, are but Shaddows, and Sand.</p>
            <p>And it appears that Poesie hath for its natural prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings over the Understandings of Men (sometimes making her conquests with easie plainness, like Native countrey Beauty) been very successfull in the most grave and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant occasions, that the necessities of States or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have produc'd. For it may be said that <hi>Demosthenes</hi> sav'd the <hi>Athenians</hi> by the Fable or Parable of the Dogs and Wolves, in answer to King <hi>Philip's</hi> Proposition; And that <hi>Menenius Agrippa</hi> sav'd the Senate, if not <hi>Rome,</hi> by that of the Belly, and the Hands: and that even our Saviour was pleas'd (as the most prevalent way of Doctrine) whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to use such kind of Parables in his converting, or saving of Souls; it being written, <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hout a Parable spake he not to them.</hi> And had not the learned Apostle thought the wisdom of Poets worthy his remembrance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and instructive,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95940:26"/>
not onely to Heathens, but to Christians, he had not ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Epimenides</hi> to the <hi>Cretans,</hi> as well as <hi>Aratus</hi> to the <hi>Athenians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot also be ignorant that divers (whose conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Melancholy amazes and discourages others Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) will accuse Poets as the admirers of Beauty; and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors, or Provokers of that which by way of aspersion they call <hi>Love.</hi> But such, in their first accusation seem to look carelesly and unthankfully upon the wonderful works of God; or else through low education, or age, become incompetent Judges of what is the chief of his works upon Earth. And Poets, when they praise Beauty, are at least as lawfully thankfull to God, as when they praise Seas, Woods, Rivers, or any other parts that make up a prospect of the world. Nor can it be imagin'd but that Poets in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them, praise wholly the Maker; and so in praising Beauty: For that Woman who believes she is prais'd when her beauty is commended, may as well suppose that Poets thinks she created her self: And he that praises the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward beauty of Women, which is their Virtue, doth more perform his duty than before: for our envious silence in not approving, and so encouraging what is good, is the cause that vice is more in fashion and countenance than Virtue. But when Poets praise that which is not beauty, or the mind which is not virtuous, they erre through their mistake, or by flattery; and flattery is a crime so much prosperous in others who are companions to greatness, that it may be held in Poets rather kindness than design.</p>
            <p>They who accuse Poets as provokers of Love, are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Nature; and all affronts to Nature are offences to God, as insolencies to all subordinate officers of the Crown are rudenesses to the King. <hi>Love</hi> (in the most obnoxious interpretation) is Natures Preparative to her greatest work, which is the making of <hi>Life.</hi> And since the severest Divines of these latter times have not been asham'd pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to command and define the most secret duties, and entertainments of Love in the Married; why should not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95940:26"/>
Poets civily endeavour to make a Friendship between the Guests before they meet, by teaching them to dignifie each other with the utmost of estimation. And Marriage in Mankind were as rude and unprepar'd as the hasty ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of other Creatures, but for acquaintance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation before it: and that must be an acquaintance of Minds, not of bodies; and of the Mind, Poesie is the most natural and delightfull Interpreter.</p>
            <p>When neither Religion (which is our art towards God) nor Nature (which is Gods first Law to Man, though by Man least study'd) nor when Reason (which is Nature, and made art by Experience) can by the enemies of Poesie be sufficiently urg'd against it, then some (whose frowardness will not let them quit an evil cause) plead written Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And though such authority be a Weapon, which even in the War of Religion, distress'd disputers take up, as their last shift; yet here we would protest against it, but that we find it makes a false defence, and leaves the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my more open. This Authority (which is but single too) is from <hi>Plato;</hi> and him some have maliciously quoted; as if in his feign'd Common-wealth he had banish'd all Poets. But <hi>Plato</hi> says nothing against Poets in general; and in his particular quarrel (which is to <hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>Hesiod</hi>) one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemns such errours as we mention'd in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this <hi>Preface,</hi> when we look'd upon the Ancients. And those errours consist in their abasing Religion, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting the Gods in evil proportion, and their <hi>Heroes</hi> with as unequal Characters; and so brought Vices into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, by intermixing them with the virtues of great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Yet even during this divine anger of <hi>Plato,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes not against Poesie, but the Poems then most in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest: For these be the words of his Law: <hi>If any Man (having ability to imitate what he pleases) imitate in his Poems both good and evil, let him be reverenced, as a sacred, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and pleasant Person; but be it likewise known, he must have no place in our Common-wealth.</hi> And yet before his banishment he allows him, <hi>the honour of a Diadem, a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IF to commend your Poem, I should onely say (in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Terms) that in the choice of your Argument, the disposition of the parts, the maintenance of the Characters of your Persons, the dignitie and vigour of your expression, you have performed all the parts of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous experience, readie memorie, clear judgement, swift and well govern'd fancie, though it were enough for the truth, it were too little for the weight and credit of my testimonie. For I lie open to two Exceptions, one of an incompetent, the other of a corrupted Witness. Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent, because I am not a Poet; and corrupted with the Honour done me by your Preface. The former obliges me to say something (by the way) of the Nature and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Poesie.</p>
            <p>As Philosophers have divided the Universe (their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) into three Regions, <hi>Celestial, Aërial,</hi> and <hi>Terrestrial;</hi> so the Poets, (whose work it is by imitating humane life, in delightfull and measur'd lines, to avert men from vice, and incline them to virtuous and honourable actions) haue lodg'd themselves in the three Regions of mankind, <hi>Court,</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:95940:28"/>
               <hi>Citie,</hi> and <hi>Countrey,</hi> correspondent in some proportion, to those three Regions of the World. For there is in Princes, and men of conspicuous power (anciently call'd <hi>Heroes</hi>) a lustre and influence upon the rest of men, resembling that of the Heavens, and an insincereness, inconstancie, and troublesom humour of those that dwell in populous Cities, like the mobilitie, blustering, and impuritie of the Air; and a plainness, and (though dul) yet a nutritive facultie in rural people, that endures a comparison with the Earth they labour.</p>
            <p>From hence have proceeded three sorts of Poesie, <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ique, Scommatique,</hi> and <hi>Pastoral.</hi> Every one of these is distinguished again in the manner of <hi>Representation,</hi> which sometimes is <hi>Narrative,</hi> wherein the Poet himself relateth; and sometimes <hi>Dramatique,</hi> as when the persons are eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one adorned and brought upon the Theatre, to speak and act their own parts. There is therefore neither more nor less than six sorts of Poesie. For the Heroique Poem Narrative (such as is yours) is call'd <hi>Epique Poem;</hi> The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roique Poem Dramatique, is <hi>Tragedie.</hi> The Scommatique Narrative, is <hi>Satyre;</hi> Dramatique is <hi>Comedie.</hi> The Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Narrative, is called simply <hi>Pastoral</hi> (anciently <hi>Bucolique</hi>) the same Dramatique, <hi>Pastoral Comedie.</hi> The Figure therefore of an Epique Poem, and of a Tragedie, ought to be the same, for they differ no more but in that they are pronounced by one, or many persons. Which I insert to iustifie the figure of yours, consisting of five books divided into Songs, or Cantoes, as five Acts divided into Scenes has ever been the approved figure of a Tragedie.</p>
            <p>They that take for Poesie whatsoever is writ in Verse, will think this Division imperfect, and call in Sonets, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams; Eclogues, and the like pieces (which are but Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayes, and parts of an entire Poem) and reckon <hi>Empedocies</hi> and <hi>Lucretius</hi> (natural Philosophers) for Poets, and the moral precepts of <hi>Phoc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lides Theognis,</hi> and the Quatrains of <hi>Pybrach,</hi> and the Historie of <hi>Lucan,</hi> and others of that kind amongst Poems; bestowing on such Writers for honour,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95940:29"/>
the name of Poets, rather than of Historians, or Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. But the subject of a Poem, is the manners of men, not natural causes; manners presented, not dictated; and manners feigned (as the name of Poesie imports) not found in men. They that give enterance to Fictions writ in Prose, erre not so much, but they erre: For Prose requiteth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfulness, not onely of fiction, but of stile; in which if Prose contend with Verse, it is with disadvantage and (as it were) on foot against the strength and wings of <hi>Pegasus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Verse amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> was appropriated ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the service of their Gods, and was the Holy stile; the stile of the Oracles; the stile of the Laws; and the stile of Men that publickly recommended to their Gods, the vows and thanks of the people; which was done in their holy songs called Hymns; and the composers of them were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Prophets and Priests before the name of Poet was known. When afterwards the majestie of that stile was observed, The Poets chose it as best becoming their high invention. And for the Antiquitie of Verse, it is greater than the antiquitie of Letters. For it is certain, <hi>Cadmus</hi> was the first that (from <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> a Countrey that neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth <hi>Judea</hi>) brought the use of Letters into <hi>Greece.</hi> But the service of the Gods, and the Laws (which by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured Sounds were easily committed to the memorie) had been long time in use, before the arrival of <hi>Cadmus</hi> there.</p>
            <p>There is besides the grace of stile, another cause why the ancient Poets chose to write in measured language, which is this. There Poems were made at first with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have them sung, as well Epick as Dramatick (which custom hath been long time laid aside, but began to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived in part, of late years in <hi>Italie</hi>) and could not be made commensurable to the Voice or Instruments, in Prose; the ways and motions whereof are so uncertain and undistinguished, (like the way and motion of a Ship in the Sea) as not onely to discompose the best Composers, but also to disapoint sometimes the most attentive Reader, and put him to hunt counter for the sense. It was therefore
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95940:29"/>
necessarie for Poets in those times, to write in Verse.</p>
            <p>The Verse which the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Latines</hi> (considering the nature of their own languages) found by experience most grave, and for an Epique Poem most decent, was their <hi>Hexameter;</hi> a Verse limited, not onely in the length of the line, but also in the quantitie of the syllables. In stead of which we use the line of ten Syllables, recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the neglect of their quantitie, with the diligence of Rime. And this measure is so proper for an Heroique Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em, as without some loss of gravitie and dignitie, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver changed. A longer is not far from ill Prose, and a short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is a kind of whisking (you know) like the unlacing, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the singing of a Muse. In an Epigram or a Sonnet, a man may vary his measures, and seek glorie from a needless difficultie, as he that contrived Verses into the form of an Organ, a Hatchet, an Egg, an Altar, and a pair of Wings; but in so great and noble a work as is an Epique Poem, for a man to obstruct his own way with unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble difficulties, is great imprudence. So likewise to chuse a needless and difficult correspondence of Rime, is but a difficult toy, and forces a man sometimes for the stopping of a chink, to say somewhat he did never think; I cannot therefore but very much approve your <hi>Stanza,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the syllables in every Verse are ten, and the Rime Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate.</p>
            <p>For the choice of your Subject, you have sufficiently justified your self in your Preface. But because I have observed in <hi>Virgil,</hi> that the Honour done to <hi>Aeneas</hi> and his companions, has so bright a reflection upon <hi>Augustus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> and other great <hi>Romans</hi> of that time, as a man may suspect him not constantly possessed with the noble spirit of those his <hi>Heroes,</hi> and believe you are not acquainted with any great man of the race of <hi>Gondibert,</hi> I adde to your Justification the puritie of your purpose, in having no other motive of your labour, but to adorn Virtue, and procure her Lovers; than which there cannot be a worthier design, and more becoming noble Poesie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:95940:30"/>In that you make so small account of the example of almost all the approved Poets, ancient and modern, who thought fit in the beginning, and sometimes also in the progress of their Poems, to invoke a Muse, or some other Deitie, that should dictate to them, or assist them in their writings; they that take not the laws of Art, from any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their own, but from the fashion of precedent times, will perhaps accuse your singularitie, For my part, I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther subscribe to their accusation, nor yet condemn that Heathen custom, otherwise than as accessarie to their false Religion. For their Poets were their Divines; had the name of Prophets, Exercised amongst the People a kind of spiritual Authoritie; would be thought to speak by a Divine spirit; have their works which they writ in Verse (the Divine stile) pass for the Word of God, and not of man; and to be hearkened to with reverence. Do not our Divines (excepting the stile) do the same, and by us that are of the same Religion cannot justly be reprehended for it? Besides, in the use of the spiritual calling of Divines, there is danger sometimes to be feared, from want of skill, such as is reported of unskilfull Conjurers, that mistaking the rites and ceremonious points of their art, call up such spirits, as they cannot at their pleasure allay again, by whom storms are raised that overthrow buildings, and are the cause of miserable wracks at Sea. Unskilfull Divines do oftentimes the like; For when they call unseasonably for <hi>Zeal,</hi> there appears a spirit of <hi>Cruelty;</hi> and by the like <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>roun instead of <hi>Truth,</hi> they raise <hi>Discord;</hi> instead of <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Eraud;</hi> instead of <hi>Reformation, Tumult;</hi> and <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi> instead of <hi>Religion.</hi> Whereas in the Heathen Poets, at least in those whose works have lasted to the time we are in, there are none of those indiscretions to be found, that tended to subversion, or disturbance of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths wherein they lived. But why a Christian should think it an ornament to his Poem; either to profane the true God, or invoke a false one, I can imagin no cause, but a reasonless imitation of Custom, of a foolish custom;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95940:30"/>
by which a man enabled to speak wisely from the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of nature, and his own meditation, loves rather to be thought to speak by inspiration, like a Bag-pipe.</p>
            <p>Time and Education begets Experience; Experience begets Memorie; Memorie begets Judgement, and Fancie; Judgement begets the Strength and Structure; and Fancie begets the Ornaments of a Poem. The Ancients there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fabled not absurdly, in making Memorie the Mother of the Muses. For Memorie is the World (though not really, yet so as in a Looking-glass) in which the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the severer Sister busieth her self in a grave and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid examination of all the parts of Nature, and in register<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Letters their order, causes, uses, differences, and resemblances; Whereby the Fancie, when any work of Art is to be performed, finding her materials at hand and prepared for use, and needs no more than a swift motion over them, that what she wants, and is there to be had, may not lie too long unespied. So that when she seemeth to fly from one <hi>Indies</hi> to the other, and from Heaven to Earth, and to penetrate into the hardest matter, and obscurest places, into the future, and into her self, and all this in a point of time, the voyage is not very great, her self being all she seeks; and her wonderfull celeritie, consisteth not so much in motion, as in copious Imagerie discreetly ordered, and perfectly registered in the Memorie; which most men under the name of Philosophie have a glimpss of, and is pretended to by many that grosly mistaking her, embrace contention in her place. But so far forth as the Fancie of man, has traced the ways of true Philosophie, so far it hath produced very marvellous effects to the benefit of mankind. All that is beautifull or defensible in building, or marvellous in Engines and Instruments of motion; whatsoever commoditie men receive from the observations of the Heavens, from the descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Earth, from the account of Time, from walking on the Seas; and whatsoever distinguisheth the Civilitie of <hi>Europe,</hi> from the Barbaritie of the <hi>American</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:95940:31"/>
savages, is the workmanship of Fancy, but guided by the Precepts of true Philosophie. But where these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts fail, as they have hitherto failed in the doctrine of moral Virtue, there the Architect (<hi>Fancy</hi>) must take the Philosophers part upon her self. He therefore that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes an Heroick Poem (which is to exhibit a venerable and amiable Image of Heroick virtue) must not onely be the Poet, to place and connect, but also the Philosopher, to furnish and square his matter; that is, to make both Body and Soul, colour and shadow of his Poem out of his own Store: Which, how well you have performed I am now considering.</p>
            <p>Observing how few the persons be you introduce in the beginning, and how in the course of the actions of these (the number increasing) after several confluences, they run all at last into the two principal streams of your Poem, <hi>Gondibert</hi> and <hi>Oswald,</hi> me thinks the Fable is not much unlike the Theater. For so, from several and far distant Sources, do the lesser Brooks of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> flowing into one another, fall all at last into the two main Rivers, the <hi>Po</hi> and the <hi>Adite.</hi> It hath the same resemblance also with a mans veins, which proceeding from different parts, after the like concourse, insert themselves at last into the two principal veins of the body. But when I considered that also the actions of men, which singly are inconsiderable, after many conjunctures, grow at last either into one great protecting power, or into destroying factions, I could not but approve the structure of your Poem, which ought to be no other than such, as an imitation of humane life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>
            <p>In the Streams themselves I find nothing but setled Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, clean Honour, calm Counsel, learned Diversion, and pure Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> save onely a torrent or two of Ambition, which (though a fault) has somewhat Heroick in it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must have place in an Heroick Poem. To shew the Reader in what place he shall find every excellent picture
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95940:31"/>
of Virtue you have drawn, is too long. And to shew him one, is to prejudice the rest; yet I cannot forbear to point him to the Description of Love in the person of <hi>Birtha,</hi> in the seventh <hi>Canto</hi> of the second Book. There has nothing been said of that Subject neither by the Ancient nor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Poets comparable to it. Poets are painters: I would fain see another painter draw so true, perfect and natural a Love to the Life, and make use of nothing but pure Lines, without the help of any the least uncomely shadow, as you have done. But let it be read as a piece by it self, for in the almost equal height of the whole, the eminence of parts is Lost.</p>
            <p>There are some that are not pleased with fiction, unless it be bold; not onely to exceed the <hi>work,</hi> but also the <hi>possibility</hi> of Nature: they would have impenetrable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, Inchanted Castles, Invulnerable Bodies, Iron Men, Flying Horses, and a thousand other such things, which are easily feigned by them that dare. Against such I defend you (without assenting to those that condemn either <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> or <hi>Virgil</hi>) by dissenting onely from those that think the Beauty of a Poem consisteth in the exorbitancy of the fiction. For as truth is the bound of Historical, so the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of truth is the utmost limit of Poetical Liberty. In old time amongst the Heathen such strange fictions, and Metamorphoses, were not so remo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e from the Articles of their Faith, as they are now from ours, and therefore were not so unpleasant. Beyond the actual works of Nature a Poet may now go; but beyond the conceived possibility of Nature, never. I can allow a Geographer to make in the Sea, a Fish or a Ship, which by the scale of his Map would be two or three hundred mile long, and think it done for ornament, because it is done without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts of his undertaking; but when he paints an <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant</hi> so, I presently apprehend it as ignorance, and a plain confession of <hi>Terra incognita.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the description of Great Men and Great Actions, is the constant design of a Poet; so the descriptions of worthy
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95940:32"/>
circumstances are necessary accessions to a Poem, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well performed, are the Jewels and most precious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of Poesie. Such in <hi>Virgil</hi> are the Funeral games of <hi>Anchises,</hi> The duel of <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Turnus, &amp;c.</hi> and such in yours are <hi>The Hunting, The Battel, The Citie Mourning, The Funeral, The House of Astragon, The Library and the Temple,</hi> equal to his, or those of <hi>Homer</hi> whom he imitated.</p>
            <p>There remains now no more to be considered but the Expression, in which consisteth the countenance and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of a beautifull Muse; and is given her by the Poet out of his own provision, or is borrowed from others. That which he hath of his own, is nothing but experience and knowledge of Nature, and specially humane nature; and is the true and natural Colour. But that which is taken out of Books (the ordinary boxes of Counterfeit Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion) shews well or ill, as it hath more or less resemblance with the natural, and are not to be used (without examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation) unadvisedly. For in him that professes the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature (as all Poets do) what greater fault can there be, than to bewray an ignorance of Nature in his Poem; especially having a liberty allowed him, if he meet with any thing he cannot master, to leave it out?</p>
            <p>That which giveth a Poem the true and natural Colour consisteth in two things, which are; <hi>To know well,</hi> that is, to have images of Nature in the memory distinct and clear; and <hi>To know much.</hi> A sign of the first is perspicuity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and decency, which delight all sorts of men, either by instructing the ignorant, or soothing the learned in their knowledge. A sign of the latter is novelty of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and pleaseth by excitation of the mind; for novelty causeth admiration, and admiration curiosity, which is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull appetite of knowledge.</p>
            <p>There be so many words in use at this day in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Tongue, that, though of magnifick sound, yet (like the windy blisters of a troubled water) have no sense at all; and so many others that lose their meaning, by being ill coupled, that it is a hard matter to avoid them; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95940:32"/>
been obtruded upon youth in the Schools (by such as make it, I think, their business there (as 'tis exprest by the best Poet)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>With terms to charm the weak and pose the wise,</hi> they grow up with them, and gaining reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the ignorant, are not easily shaken off.</p>
            <p>To this palpable darkness, I may also adde the ambitious obscurity of expressing more than is perfectly conceived; or perfect conception in fewer words than it requires. Which Expressions, though they have had the honour to be called strong lines, are indeed no better than Riddles, and not onely to the Reader, but also (after a little time) to the Writer himself dark and troublesom.</p>
            <p>To the property of Expression I referre, that clearness of memory, by which a Poet when he hath once introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced any person whatsoever, speaking in his Poem, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth in him to the end the same character he gave him in the beginning. The variation whereof, is a change of pace, that argues the Poet tired.</p>
            <p>Of the Indecencies of an Heroick Poem, the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable are those that shew disproportion either between the persons and their actions, or between the manners of the Poet and the Poem. Of the first kind, is the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of representing in great persons the inhumane vice of Cruelty, or the sordid vice of Lust and Drunkenness. To such parts as those the ancient approved Poets, thought it fit to suborn, nor the persons of men, but of monsters and beastly Giants, such as <hi>Polyphemus, Cacus,</hi> and the <hi>Centaurs.</hi> For it is supposed a Muse, when she is invoked to sing a song of that nature, should maidenly advise the Poet, to set such persons to sing their own vices upon the Stage; for it is not so unseemly in a <hi>Tragedy.</hi> Of the same kind it is to represent scurrility, or any action or language that moveth much laughter. The delight of an <hi>Epique</hi> Poem consisteth not in mirth, but admiration. Mirth and Laughter is proper to <hi>Comedie</hi> and <hi>Satyre.</hi> Great persons that have their minds employed on great designs, have not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95940:33"/>
leasure enough to laugh, and are pleased with the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of their own power and virtues, so as they need not the infirmities and vices of other men, to recommend themselves to their own favour by comparison, as all men do when they laugh. Of the second kind, where the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion is between the Poet, and the persons of his Poem, one is in the Dialect of the Inferiour sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which is always different from the language of the Court. Another is to derive the Illustration of any thing, from such Metaphors or Comparisons as cannot come into mens thoughts, but by mean conversation, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of humble or evil Arts, which the person of an <hi>Epique</hi> Poem, cannot be thought acquainted with.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Knowing much,</hi> proceedeth the admirable variety and novelty of Metaphors and Similitudes, which are not possible to be lighted on, in the compass of a narrow knowledge. And the want whereof compelleth a Writer to expressions that are either defac'd by time, or sullied with vulgar or long use. For the phrases of Poesie, as the airs of musick with often hearing become insipide, the Reader having no more sense of their force, than our Flesh is sensible of the bones that sustain it. As the sense we have of bodies, consisteth in change and variety of impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, so also does the sense of language in the variety and changeable use of words. I mean not in the affectation of words newly brought home from travel, but in new (and withal significant) translation to our purposes, of those that be already received; and in far fetcht (but withal apt, instructive and comly) similitudes.</p>
            <p>Having thus (I hope) avoided the first Exception, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the incompetency of my Judgement, I am but little moved with the second, which is of being bribed by the honour you have done me, by attributing in your Preface somewhat to my Judgement. For I have used your Judgement no less in many things of mine, which coming to light will thereby appear the better. And so you have your bribe again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:95940:33"/>Having thus made way for the admission of my Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I give it briefly thus; I never yet saw Poem, that had so much shape of Art, health of Morality, and vigour and beauty of Expression, as this of yours. And but for the clamour of the multitude, that hide their Envy of the present, under a Reverence of Antiquity, I should say further, that it would last as long as either the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> or <hi>Iliad,</hi> but for one Disadvantage, and the Disadvantage is this: The languages of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> (by their Colonies and Conquests) have put off flesh and bloud, and are become immutable, which none of the modern tongues are like to be. I honour Antiquity, but that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Old time,</hi> is <hi>Young time.</hi> The glory of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is due, not to the Dead, but to the Aged.</p>
            <p>And now, whilest I think on't, give me leave with a short discord to sweeten the Harmony of the approaching close. I have nothing to object against your Poem; but dissent onely from something in your Preface, sounding to the prejudice of Age. 'Tis commonly said, that old Age is a return to childhood. Which me thinks you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on so long, as if you desired it should be believed. That is the note I mean to shake a little. That saying, meant onely of the weakness of body, was wrested to the weakness of mind, by froward children, weary of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulment of their parents, masters, and other admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours. Secondly, the dotage and childishness they ascribe to Age, is never the effect of Time, but sometimes of the excesses of youth, and not a returning to, but a continual stay with childhood. For they that wanting the curiosity of furnishing their memories with the rarities of Nature in their youth, and pass their time in making provision onely for their ease, and sensual delight, are children still, at what years soever; as they that coming into a populous Citie, never going out of their Inn, are strangers still, how long soever they have been there. Thirdly, there is no reason for any man to think himself wiser to day than ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95940:34"/>
which does not equally convince he shall be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser tomorrow than today.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, you will be forced to change your opinion hereafter when you are old; and in the mean time you discredit all I have said before in your commendation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am old already. But no more of this.</p>
            <p>I believe (Sir) you have seen a curious kind of perspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, where, he that looks through a short hollow pipe, upon a picture containing divers figures, sees none of those that are there painted, but some one person made up of their parts, conveyed to the eye by the artificial cutting of a glass. I find in my imagination an effect not unlike it from your Poem. The virtues you distribute there amongst so many noble persons, represent (in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) the image but of one mans virtue to my fancy, which is your own; and that so deeply imprinted, as to stay for ever there, and govern all the rest of my thoughts and affections, in the way of honouring and serving you, to the utmost of my power, that am</p>

            <head>POST-SCRIPT To the Reader.</head>
            <p>I Am here arriv'd at the middle of the Third Book, which makes an equal half of the <hi>POEM;</hi> and I was now by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to present you (as I promised in the <hi>Preface</hi>) the several Keys of the main Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which should convey you through such short Walks as give an easie view of the whole Frame. But 'tis high time to strike Sail, and cast Anchor (though I have
<pb facs="tcp:95940:158"/>
run but half my Course) when at the Helm I am threatened with Death; who, though he can visit us but once, seems trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom; and even in the Innocent may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get such a gravitie, as diverts the Musick of Verse. And I beseech thee (if thou art so civil as to be pleas'd with what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) not to take it ill, that I run not on till my last gasp. For though I intended in this <hi>POEM</hi> to strip Nature naked, and clothe her again in the perfect shape of Virtue, yet even in so worthy a Design I shall ask leave to desist, when I am interrupted by so great an experiment as Dying: and 'tis an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment to the most experienc'd; for no Man (though his Mortifications may be much greater than mine) can say, <hi>He has alreadie Dy'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be Objected by some (who look not on Verse with the Eyes of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, nor with the Reverence which it still preserves amongst other Nations) that I beget a <hi>POEM</hi> in an unseasonable time. But be not thou, <hi>Reader,</hi> (for thine own sake, as well as mine) a common Spectator,
<pb facs="tcp:95940:158"/>
that can never look on great Changes but with tears in his Eyes: for if all Men would observe, That Conquest is the Wheels of the World, on which it has ever run, the Victorious would not think they have done so new, and such admirable actions, as must draw Men from the noble and beautiful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Arts, to gaze wholly upon them; neither would the Conquer'd continue their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, till it involve them in sorrow; which is then the Mind's incurable Disease, when the Patient grows so sullen,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as not to listen to Remedie: and <hi>Poesie</hi> was that Harp of <hi>David,</hi> which remov'd from <hi>Saul,</hi> the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly Spirit, that put him in a continual remembrance of the revolution of Empire.</p>
            <p>I shall not think I instruct Militarie Men, by saying, That with <hi>Poesie</hi> in <hi>Heroick Songs,</hi> the Wiser Ancients prepar'd their Battels; nor would I offend the austeritie of such, as vex themselves with the mannage of Civil Affairs, by putting them in mind, that whilst the Plays of Children are punish'd, the plays of Men are but excus'd under the title of Business.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95940:159"/>But I will gravely tell thee (<hi>Reader</hi>) he who writes an <hi>Heroick POEM,</hi> leaves an Estate entayl'd; and he gives a greater Gift to Posteritie, than to the present Age; for a publick benefit is best measured in the number of Receivers; and our Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries are but few, when reckon'd with those who shall succeed.</p>
            <p>Nor could I sit idle, and sigh with such as mourn to hear the Drum; for if this Age be not quiet enough to be taught Virtue a pleasant way, the next may be at leisure: Nor could I (like men that have civilly slept, till they are old in dark Cities) think War a noveltie: For we have all heard, that <hi>Alexander</hi> walk'd after the Drum from <hi>Macedon</hi> into <hi>India;</hi> and I tell thee (<hi>Reader</hi>) he carry'd <hi>Homer</hi> in his Pocket; and that after <hi>Augustus,</hi> by many Battels had chang'd the Government of the world, he and <hi>Mecoenas</hi> often feasted very peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with <hi>Horace:</hi> And that the last wi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Cardinal (whilst he was sending Armies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and preparing against civil Invasion) took <hi>Virgil</hi> &amp; <hi>Tasso</hi> aside under the <hi>Louvre</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95940:159"/>
Gallerie, and at a great expence of time and Treasure, sent them forth in new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments. And perhaps, if my <hi>POEM</hi> were not so severe a representation of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue (undressing Truth even out of those disguises, which have been most in fashion throughout the World) it might arrive at fair entertainment, though it make now for a Harbour in a Storm.</p>
            <p>If thou art a malicious Reader, thou wilt remember, my <hi>Preface</hi> boldly confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, That a main motive to this underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, was a desire of Fame; and thou mayst likewise say, I may very possibly not live to enjoy it. Truly I have some years ago consider'd, that Fame, like Time, onely gets a reverence by long running; and that like a River, 'tis narrowest where 'tis bred, and broadest afar off: but this concludes it not unprofitable; for he whose Writings di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Men from indiscretion &amp; vice, becomes famous as he is an example to others en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours: and exemplary Writers are Wiser than to depend on the gratuities of this World; since the kind looks and praises
<pb facs="tcp:95940:160"/>
of the present Age, for reclaiming a few, are not mentionable with those solid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in Heaven, for a long and continual conversion of Posteritie.</p>
            <p>If thou (<hi>Reader</hi>) art one of those, who has been warm'd with Poetick Fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thee as my Judge, and whilst others tax me with vanitie, as if the <hi>Preface</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my good opinion of the Work, I appeal to thy Conscience, whether it be more than such a necessarie assurance, as thou hast made to thy self in like Undertakings? For when I observe that Writers have many Enemies, such inward assurance (me thinks) resembles that forward confidence in Men of Arms, which makes them proceed in great Enterprise; since the right examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of abilities, begins with inquiring whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we doubt our selves.</p>
