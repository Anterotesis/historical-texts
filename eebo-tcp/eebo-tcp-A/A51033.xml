            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore Self-Reformation must go before
Family-Reformation; you must first learn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you can teach.</p>
            <p>And for your Assistance, this Method is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
offered to each of you.</p>
            <p>1. Retire from the world for some time, and
remove from thy mind all thoughts of it, and
all Concerns about it, that there may be room
for Spiritual Meditation.</p>
            <p>2. Consider that thou hast a faculty or power
of thinking, whereby thou art capable to know
spiritual Things, and to converse with spiritual
Beings: And that this spiritual part of thee,
is out of its Element, and acting contrary to its
Nature, when it is employed about earthly
Things.</p>
            <p>3. Consider that thou gavest not Being to
thy self; for thou canst not make thy self wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
nor taller; thou canst not give to thy self
the things which thou wantest; thou canst
not add one finger to thy Hand, nor one joint
to thy Body; neither can any other Creature
give them to thee. And this will oblige thee
to believe, that there is a Supream Being,
which made all things, and upon whom all do
depend.</p>
            <p>4. Being convinced that there is a God, or
a Supream Being, who made and maintains all
things, and to whom all are accountable; sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there must be some acknowledgments of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
upon him, and of Duty towards
him; and this will oblige thee to enquire after
his Will, Laws and Commands.</p>

So you see, and you ought to believe, that
if you sincerely love and serve God, you may
have solid Joy and continual Comfort from
these five grounds: 1. From God's love and
goodness. 2. From the Workings and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the glorious Spirit. 3. From the
Truth of God. 4. From his gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.
And, 5. From your interest in Christ,
and likeness to him. Yea, Prayer and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
will never fail to refresh the Soul, and
chear the heart.</p>
            <p>So that it is your great mistake to think, that

            <p>Yea, there is no true Pleasure in the world
but in the ways of Religion, because none else
can satisfy the Soul. All earthly Pleasures are

play or wickedness, and their backwardness
to go to School, to yield or hearken to the
instructions of Parents and Teachers; their
unwillingness to go to Church, and their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attentiveness

need of early Care and diligent Education?</p>
            <p>Now if you, Parents, patiently permit them

and speedily amend.</p>
            <p>For as you are the Causes of your Childrens
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37609:22"/>
Being, so should you be of their Well-being;
as you contribute to their natural life, so should
you to their spiritual: As God has made them
yours by natural Generation, so should you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to make them his by vertuous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Education. They are a Trust commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to your Charge by our heavenly Father,
who will surely call you to account.</p>
            <p>As for you, whose Children have more Years
than Vertue, and do follow their own Will
more than the Will of God, I leave you to the
advice of Spiritual Guides, or Civil Magistrates,
according to the Command, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 18.</p>
            <p>But as for you who have, or may have young
Children, be careful to observe these Rules,
and you may easily rule them, and reap good
Fruit and Comfort for your Labour.</p>
            <p>1. Speak Truth and no Lies to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
that is, whatever you teach them, see
that you practice it your selves; otherwise
they will not believe that you are in earnest,
nor listen to your Dictates. Few words
will suffice, where there is a continual good
Example. Therefore let every Christian Duty
as well as Moral Vertue, be your daily Practice.</p>
            <p>2. Love your Children prudently, and do
not hate them effectually. <hi>Fond and foolish
love, proves to be the greatest hatred,</hi> Prov. 13. 24.</p>
            <p>Away with that fond and foolish, hurtful and
childish Flattering, Hugging, Caressing and
Dandling of Children, that is usual, which les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens
your Authority, tickles their Fancy, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:37609:22"/>
feeds their Folly. Make not Idols of your
Children; they are God's gifts, make them
not his Rivals; set them not up in his Throne,
lest he pull them down, and punish you,
either by taking them from you, or making
them your cross and scourge. Therefore love
your Children piously, and let the Fruits and
Effects of it, appear in promoting their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Good.</p>
            <p>3. Feed, but do not poison your Children.
God has given them sive Senses, but has left it
to you to regulate the Objects. Let them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
see nor hear any thing, that may corrupt
their Mind or Fancy. Do not poison their
Eyes with seeing any base, wicked or foolish
Action, till they be fortified against it, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to reprove and abhor it. Do not poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
their Ears with hearing any wicked, vain
or idle words, till they be able to tes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie against
them, and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>buke the Tongue that speaks
them. For Children are capable to think as
soon as to see, and to form Idea's as soon as to
hearken. They are capable to remember, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they can judge or determine. Therefore
let them hear none speak, who have not learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Language of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with none, but those who are acquainted
with the Lord Jesus, and can help to make
them so.</p>
            <p>Let the Streets and Publick Places be an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination
unto them, until Holiness to the
Lord be written on the Foreheads of all who
walk there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:37609:23"/>4. Seasonably and gently bow their Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Sinew,
before it become too strong; that is,
make their Will plyable. Teach them to be
denyed, and to deny themselves: Let them not
know, that you give them their Will in any
thing: Humour them not in any thing they
cry for: And let them have what is fit at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time, rather than when they call for it. If
you let them have their own Will, they will soon
torment you, and ruine themselves. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled
Will, makes an ungovernable Person.
But when you have effectually and prudently
brought the Will into good subjection and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
more than the half of your work is done.</p>
            <p>5. Throw water on their Wild Fire, that is,
let not Passions prevail: Let Frowns, Rebukes
and Rods, curb, restrain and suppress their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
Passions and irregular Desires: Let
Discipline chastise and keep in order these
Wild Beasts, till Reason be able to tame them:
Let them know by your Countenance and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
that Patience, Meekness and Sobriety,
are lovely and commendable Vertues.</p>
            <p>Beware of giving bad Example here.</p>
            <p>6. Regulate their Diet; nourish their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
but do not pamper them: Let them know
that Temperance is a Vertue, and that Fasting
is Physick: Let their Food be course and plain,
for Strength and Nourishment, not for pleasing
the sensual Appetite: And as soon as possible,
let them gain their Bread by the Sweat of their
Brow, according the Command, <hi>Gen. 3. 19.
2 Thes.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:37609:23"/>7. Moderate their Apparel, and do not feed their

            <p>8. Moderate their Recreations; let them never be
