            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Theſ. 5.5. although that there be much ſpirituall darkeneſſe in them, and that they are not wholly free from the ſinfull fleſh, but are in euery part polluted therewith: and for this cauſe in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate themſelues is this naturall corruption called a <hi>body of ſinne,</hi> Rom. <hi>6.6.</hi> For it is crept thorough euery part, and power of their ſoule and body.</p>
               <p>So then this naturall corruption is a body, but it is a body altogether vgly, and monſtrous, the parts whereof are wholly inuerted, or rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, as if the eyes ſtood in the place where the eares ſhould; and the mouth were ſet in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; and all the reſt of the members were moſt deformedly miſ-placed. To be ſhort, it is a ſimple
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2781:7"/>body of confuſion, and darkneſſe: it is the image of the Diuell; the draught, and proportion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than: it is in euery degree contrary to the image of God wherein at firſt he made Man.</p>
               <p>It is therefore idle, and fooliſh that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> pretend, who ſay, that this naturall corruption, or concupiſence which luſteth againſt the ſpirit, is not finne. For there is nothing more abominable in the eyes of God then this body: for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world more diſſonant, and contrarie to the will of God, and the image that he himſelfe hath made; he ſeeth that the image of the Diuell is therein. It is truely a monſter, miſhapen in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery member with ſinne: yea, when it worketh not, but lyeth ſtill without ſtirring, or mouing, it is altogether hatefull before God, euen as a wolfe, or a Beare is to vs when he lieth ſtill, and ſleepeth; and as we know the Diuell is abominable before God, although hee lyeth bound in chaynes of darkeneſſe, and ſealed vp in the bottomleſſe pitt. <hi>Iud. 6.

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> God doth it for the greater glory of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and of his children, and the greater ſhame, and diſgrace of the Diuell: for truely, it tendeth greatly to the prayſe and glory of God, and to the honour of his children, and to the ſhaming of the Diuell; that he knoweth how, &amp; is able to keepe, and preſerue ſuch weake and feeble veſſels againſt all the power of Hell, and to make them conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours ouer Sathan, in that very fleſh which is ſo polluted with ſinne, and was once depraued by the Diuell.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Lord doth it becauſe it is fit that there ſhould bee a difference put betweene the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2781:15"/>curſed earth, and bleſſed heauen; to be without finne, and free from combat with it, is a preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and priuiledge belonging onely to the ſeate royall, and court of heauen: it cannot be that we ſhould enioy it here vpon earth; no we muſt long after the fruition of it in heauen.</p>
               <p>It may be demanded againe,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> that ſeeing the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beſt are polluted with this naturall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what difference is there then betweene the children of God, and the children of the world, betweene true beleeuers, and carnall men?</p>
               <p>There is as great difference betweene them as is betweene the darkeneſſe of the darkeſt night,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and the light of the morning at the breake of the day, as we heard before; yea, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the carnall, and ſpirituall man, in reſpect of this inherent corruption, is great euery manner of way: for in the vnregenerate man, this monſter of ſinne, ſitteth, as it were, vpon a throne, ruling, and hauing dominion in his heart, where it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, and is obeyed in euery thing. For expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience makes it plaine, that there is nothing wherein worldly men doe take more delight and pleaſure, then in ſeruing their corrupt fleſh in all its luſtes, whether it be in couetouſneſſe, volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe, pride, ambition, or in any thing elſe whereunto their appetites carry them. But on the contrary ſide, in the children of God, (how s;oeuer it hath place in them, yet) it ſitteth not as vpon a throne, ruling, and commanding as a King, but lyeth, as it were, ſtretched out vpon a racke, where thorough the working of the ſpirit it is euery day

Furthermore, the daily practiſe of the true Children of God is, not to take care for the fleſh, to obey it in the luſtes thereof, as carnall men doe, but to beate it downe, and bring it in bondage to the will of God, as the Apoſtle did. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27.</p>
               <p>Here by the way we may conſider the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſottiſhneſſe of many poore, and wretched per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which ſerue the fleſh, and liue in ſinne, who when they once heare, that all men, yea, the very beſt are ſinfull, and that the moſt holy and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied haue their wants and defects, and are clogged with the ſinfull fleſh; then beginne they to iuſtifie themſelues, and to ſay, we haue all drunke of one cup; he that is without ſinne let him caſt the firſt ſtone at me; haue I my imperfections? Another hath his; I am not alone, I hope I ſhall get into heauen as well as another; and ſo they ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in equall degree with the true Children of God; they themſelues being no other then fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, and children of the world.</p>
               <p>But thou miſerable man which ſpeakeſt after this manner, vnderſtandeſt thou not? or wilt thou not vnderſtand, that there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene hauing the ſinfull fleſh in one, and figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with it; and hauing it in one, and louing and ſeruing it in the luſtes thereof? Is there no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene chaſt <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> who being ſet vpon by <hi>Potiphars</hi> wife, and tempted to commit folly, ranne away; and betweene the light, and wanton woman, who ſought to draw him vnto it?

Yea, there is ſo great difference (marke it well) that you with your ſinfull fleſh ſhall be caſt into Hell, where you ſhall eternally be tormented, if in time you repent not; where on the contrary ſide, the Children of God ſhall be freed, and deliuered from their ſinfull fleſh, and be exalted into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: yea, behold, there is ſo great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene you two, that the one ſhall be damned, and the other ſaued; the one goe to heauen, and the other to hell.</p>
               <p>But although this naturall corruption is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in all men, yet it is truely in all men, and that in the very beſt, as daily experience teacheth: for who is there among the moſt holy and ſanctified that liue, which feeleth not in himſelfe the pricke of the corrupt fleſh? and findeth not ſomething to be in him, which ſtandeth in his way, &amp; keepeth him from doing the good which he would doe, greatly hindering him in the ſeruice of the moſt high.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>hirdly, How the Apoſtle la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth ouer the bodie of Death?</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle his lamentation is two-fold: firſt, he declareth himſelfe therefore to be miſerable: ſecondly, he wiſheth to bee deliuered. Of both which wee ſhall ſpeake by Gods aſſiſtance: and firſt of this, that <hi>the Apoſtle declareth himſelfe to beo miſerable, becauſe he had the bodie of death in him. O miſerable man</hi> (ſayth the Apoſtle) <hi>who ſhall deliuer me?</hi> It is very ſtrange the Apoſtle lamenteth here after this manner: in other places he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and that confidently, that hee reioyced euen in the greateſt tribulations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8. &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4. &amp;c. How doth he here then ſo mournefully complaine? Did he ſpeake from his heart, when he ſaid, <hi>O miſerable man?</hi> Was he not then a man bleſſed of the Lord? Was he not then aſſured of his ſaluation? How commeth it then that he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelfe miſerable?</p>
               <p>Without doubt the Apoſtle ſpeaketh here in good earneſt, <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> for he was then in a hot skirmiſh, and had little time, or cauſe to dally, or leſt: yea,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2781:21"/>he ſpake not onely in earneſt, but alſo vpon good groundes, for the other afflictions wherein hee ſayth, he did glory, and reioyce, were outward afflictions, wherein in truth hee might well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce: but here he ſpeaketh (as wee haue heard before) of his naturall corruption; of the ſinne that hanged faſt vpon him, and of the olde man, which he began to behold in all the parts, and members thereof. The which made him lament and complaine in good earneſt, as being a thing out of which he could draw no comfort at all: in which regard he might inſtly account himſelfe to be miſerable: For <hi>this body of death</hi> conſidered in it ſelfe, maketh a man <hi>truely wretched and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> the which may ſufficiently be gathered out of the firſt part of our Text, whereunto wee will briefely adde, <note place="margin">The bodie of death hath theſe miſerable effects which follovv.</note> that <hi>the body of death,</hi> in reſpect of which the Apoſtle ſo earneſtly complaineth, hath theſe miſerable, and curſed effects which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>

If a man doth breake a leg, or an arme, how doth he cry out, and complaine of his miſery?

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terly depraued, and corrupted? Wee ſee that in a mans body, when any member is wounded, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with any griefe, the more worthie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent that member is, the greater is both the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2781:21"/>griefe, and danger of the ſore: prick a man in the arme, or the legg with the point of a Needle, and he will both feele it &amp; complaine of it; but pricke him in the apple of his eye, and that ſhall pierce him to the heart, and make him cry out. If it bee ſo with the eye of the body, how great is the paine and griefe, when the eye of the minde is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prickt, but wholly put out? When the moſt noble, and precious ſoule is wounded, and that to death? this is it that made the Apoſtle cry out, <hi>O miſerable man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Man thus depraued in ſoule by ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> corruption, <note place="margin">Being thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> is by nature a childe of <hi>diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> and a child of <hi>wrath,</hi> Epheſ. 2.2.2. That is, vnfit for the ſeruice of God, &amp; liable to the curſe of God; both which are miſeries beyond compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he cannot doe the workes of God: for he is as a broken tooth, which ſerueth for no vſe at all; and as a broken arme wherewith a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not worke. As ſoone as a man beginnes to frame himſelfe vnto the ſeruice of God, hee findeth his corruption euer to be in his way, ſo that the good that he willingly would doe, he cannot doe as he would: With this are the children of God great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moued, howſoeuer the children of the world, which put not forth their ſtrength to the ſeruice of God, feele no inconuenience herein: euen as one that hath a broken legge, and lyeth ſtill, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the ſmart thereof ſo much as he that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer aſſaying to walke; and therefore they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine not; neuertheleſſe, this exceedingly grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2781:22"/>the ſeruants of God, and they account it as a great miſery, that they can no better performe their dutie to God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the naturall man is liable to the curſe of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. He that deſtroyeth the image of God, him will God deſtroy: This is it that did caſt many of the Angells out of heauen into hell: this droue <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe, and maketh all the ſonnes of men ſubiect vnto eternall death: and from hence doe ariſe all the plagues and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments which are inflicted vpon man: now, as a man hauing committed murther, &amp; being come to himſelfe, accounteth himſelfe to be miſerable, in regard of the offence, which maketh him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of death, although he be neither apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor condemned to die: euen ſo it is with the children of God, who notwithſtanding that they are <hi>deliuered</hi> (as the Apoſtle was) <hi>from the feare of death, thorough our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> Heb. 2.15. yet becauſe they know that their ſinfulneſſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God to hide his cheareful countenance from them, <hi>Eſay</hi> 59.2. Which is vnto them as bitter as death it ſelfe, therefore they cry out vnfainedly becauſe of this bodie of death; <hi>O miſerable man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in that the Apoſtle himſelfe which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie in a great meaſure mortified, and ſubdued this <hi>body of death,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. yet neuertheleſſe ſo pitifully complaineth againſt it, whereas there are many thouſands that goe frolikely along being neuer touched, much leſſe troubled therewith, yet are as it were wrapped, and plunged ouer head and cares, in ſinne and iniquitie: from thence
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2781:22"/>followeth this Doctrine; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. The more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a man is, the more ſenſible is he of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                  <hi>The more ſanctified, and holy that a man is, the more ſenſible is he of his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the more troubleſome are they vnto him.</hi> This is manifeſt, in that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> that was none of the greateſt ſinners, but one of the holieſt vpon the earth, yet maketh the greateſt complain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his corruptions: he reckoneth vp 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. many, and ſundry bitter afflictions, and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet none of them maketh him cry out, and complaine ſo mournefully as he doth here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his naturall corruption, which he ſaw to be the mother of all miſery.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Dauid,</hi> when through his folly hee had wounded himſelfe with ſinne, goeth weeping vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the boſome of his heauenly Father, and cryeth out with a loud voyce, <hi>Heale my ſoule O Lord, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee haue I ſinned:</hi> But the Children of the world in the ſame caſe, wipe their mouth with the Harlot, and aske what cuill they haue done.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſons for which the regenerate, and true Children of God are ſo grieued with ſinne, whereas the children of the world are neuer tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, much leſſe troubled therewith, are chiefly theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſons.</hi> 1. Becauſe they haue a feeling conſcience ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of ſinne.</note> the regenerate and true Children of God haue receiued ſpirituall life in them, whereby they haue a quicke, and feeling conſcience, which the Lord giueth them to keepe them from ſinne; But on the contrary ſide, the naturall man is dead in ſinne, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. and hath a ſeared Conſcience 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. which is vtterly paſt feeling, as it is ſayd, their heart is waxed fat, that they cannot vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2781:23"/>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.15. Hence it is that the Children of the world, being dead in ſinne, and dead in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, can ſo eaſily digeſt all manner of ſinnes, and make ſo light of them; being accuſtomed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to lament for the iniquitie, &amp; offence of their ſins, but for ſome outward inconuenience, which they haue procured vnto themſelues in the world by their ſinnes, as loſſe, reproch, or the like: but the regenerate, being liuing in ſoule, and quicke in conſcience, are ſenſible of the leaſt prick of ſin, the ſmart whereof cauſeth them to cry out, <hi>O miſerable, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <note place="margin">2. They haue their eyes open to ſee the vgli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne.</note> the regenerate haue their eyes open to ſee the vglineſſe of ſinne, and the hatefull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie of this <hi>body of death:</hi> they ſee that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faceth the image of God in Man, maketh him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for the ſeruice of God, and lyable to the curſe of God: they ſee that it diſhonoureth God, and prouoketh him to anger; ſcandalizeth the Church, grieueth the godly, and reioyceth the wicked, and cauſeth the name of God to be blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, and his Goſpell to be diſgraced: they ſee alſo, that hell, and eternall damnation doe hang at the tayle of ſinne, how ſweete, &amp; pleaſing ſoeuer it ſeemeth to be: all this doe they ſee, as a people that is neere vnto God, who giueth great light vnto all them that are about him: they ſee alſo, that it ſhutteth Heauen, and openeth Hell: encreaſeth the heat of Hell-fire, for the vngodly, and hideth the comfortable light of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance many times from his owne children: All this doe the Saints of God ſee, which maketh
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2781:23"/>them ſo lament, and complaine of ſinne; but the children of the world becauſe they neither ſee, nor vnderſtand this, are nothing troubled with ſinne, notwithſtanding they are from top to toe polluted therewith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the regenerate and true Children of God, doe hate ſinne with a perfect hatred, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 97.10. Where on the contrary ſide, the vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate doe loue it as much: yea, they haue their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall beloued ſinnes, <hi>Iob</hi> 20.12. Now wee know it is a thing not a little grieuous for a man to haue one whom he hateth alwayes to be preſent with him, in his houſe, at his table, at his fire, in his bed, and euery where els, vnder his noſe; So it grieueth the children of God not a little, that the bodie of ſinne, and of death is in them, which they hate with all their hearts, and wiſh that it were drowned in the bottome of the ſea: but it is not ſo with the children of the world, for they lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſinne, or not hating it, are nothing troubled therewith, although they know it to be in them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Saints of God haue learned to judge of ſin, according to the word of God, which declareth it to be the moſt odious, and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thing that is, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.16. and herein haue they alſo learned to renounce their owne vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: but naturall men doe judge of ſinne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their owne carnall conceite, and good meaning; and being by nature louers of ſin, they cannot, nor will not vnderſtand that it is ſo hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as truely it is; and therefore, where they ſhould condemne themſelues for ſinne, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2781:24"/>the law as if it were too ſtrickt, and iudged too ſeuerely of ſinne.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as no element in his proper place is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie; So ſinne in the naturall man, being in its right place is not grieuous: but it is otherwiſe with the children of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. For examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by this, whether we be Gods children yea, orno.</note> Now come we to the Vſes that may be made of this that hath beene ſpoken; and the firſt ſhall be for Examination, and triall: for, by this Doctrine may euery man proue, and try himſelfe whether he be a childe of God, or not; in which the moſt part of men are wanting, ſuffering themſelues to be deceiued in the caſe of aſſurance of ſaluation; but it muſt not be ſo; for, would a man be willing without proofe, and triall of himſelfe to go along merrily, and laughing, with a hope of inheriting eternall life, and at laſt thorough want of tryall, and examination, finde himſelfe deceiued in his expectation, and be caſt into eternall damnation, without hope of euer being deliuered? Verily, I thinke not: therefore enery one muſt take the paines to proue and examine himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Now, here is an infallible Rule, for proofe, and tryall: See how thou art minded concerning ſin; is it ſo, that when thou haſt thoroughly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thy whole eſtate, and condition, and weighed in thy heart how euery thing ſtandeth with thee, thou findeſt nothing that troubleth, and grieueth thee ſo much as ſinne: and canſt thou, hauing all things at will, ſit downe with the Apoſtle and mourne becauſe of thy finnes, and cry out vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly, <hi>O miſerable man, who ſhall deliuer me?</hi> Wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2781:24"/>aboue all things to be deliuered from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of ſinne, and to be freed from the power ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; oh that is a good ſigne that there is ſpirituall life in thee; that thou haſt a ſpirituall eye open to ſee the hatefulneſſe of ſinne: that thou thy ſelfe hateſt ſinne, and iudgeſt thereof according to the word of God, denying thine owne carnall conceit therein: and that ſinne being in thee, is not in its proper place.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary ſide, if it bee ſo with thee that thou canſt lament, and bewayle thy loſſes, and croſſes in outward things, and art nothing troubled for thy ſins; it is a very euill ſigne: canſt thou mourne, &amp; grieue when thou haſt wounded thine arme; and doeſt thou make nothing of it when ſin hath wounded thy ſoule, euen to death? canſt thou frowne when others haue diſpleaſed thee; and art thou not mooued at all, when thou thy ſelfe haſt diſpleaſed the God of heauen and earth? canſt thou rage, and take on with thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants for breaking a glaſſe, or a pot; and haſt thou no holy indignation with thy ſelfe, when thou haſt broken the law of God? Behold, it is a ſigne thou art in a bad caſe. Furthermore, canſt thou, being poore and needie, lament, and bewayle thy ſtate, and cry out, <hi>O miſerable man?</hi> and canſt thou not becauſe thou art ſinfull cry out vnfainedly, <hi>O miſerable man?</hi> Then it is greatly to bee feared, that thou art not onely poore in body, but alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed in thy pouertie, and want, if ſo be thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineſt the ſame in ſoule as thou art, Againe, if thou hauing ſpoken a lye, beene angry, or perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2781:25"/>drunke the laſt night, canſt eaſily diſgeſt it, and goe on frolickly, without once being tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched at heart with any ſorrow for it; behold, it is a lamentable ſigne, that thou art dead in ſin, and art blind, not hauing an eye to ſee the hatefulnes of ſinne; that thou hateſt not ſinne as thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, nor iudgeſt of it as God doth: yea, that thou art altogether in ſinne, and ſinne in thee, is in its owne place: And to be ſhort, it is an infallible ſigne, that if thou cryeſt not out becauſe of thy ſinnes, <hi>O miſerable man, who ſhall deliuer me?</hi> Thou thy ſelfe art one of the moſt miſerable men that liueth vpon the earth.</p>

To cauſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation in regard of the commonneſſe of correction, and yet the great want of a ſenſible fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it.</note> Secondly, here is great cauſe of mourning, and lamentation: For is it not a miſerable thing, that ſinne, which is ſo common in the world among name-bearing Chriſtians, and hath ſo many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable effects, is ſo little complained of by men and yet the want of being troubled with it, is ſuch an infallible ſigne of a miſerable ſoule.

Where ſhall you find thoſe that from their hearts hold themſelues to be miſerable, becauſe they be ſinfull? and make the ſorrow for their ſinnes, to exceed all their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſorrowes, as the Saints of God were wont to doe? Nay, are there not multitudes to bee found which harden themſelues in ſinne? and are ſo far

               <p>Moreouer, the Apoſtle here wiſhing, <hi>asketh who ſhall deliuer him?</hi> which we muſt not vnderſtand as though he did not know thorough whom hee ſhould be deliuered; for he declareth in the verſe following, that he knew it well enough; but here he asketh the queſtion, onely, to let vs vnderſtand, that in himſelfe he found no meanes whereby he might be deliuered: Like <hi>Ioſaphat</hi> being enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with his enemies, &amp; ſeeing no way to eſcape, cryed vnto God for helpe, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.31.

So the Apoſtle cryeth here, as out of great miſerie, and affliction, vnto God for helpe, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it muſt come onely from him; for ſinne maketh man ſo miſerable, that nothing but the almightie power of God can deliuer him: for by ſinne we are caſt vnder the feete of Sathan; we lie condemned vnto eternall death; and the wrath of God is incenſed, &amp; kindled againſt our ſoules, for which who knoweth in himſelfe any remedy? <hi>Iudas</hi> finding none, ran vnto the tree: but <hi>Paul</hi> runneth vnto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> verſ: 25.

Now that we may be made partakers of Chriſt, we muſt beleeue in him, for it is faith in him that maketh vs free, <hi>Ioh:</hi> 8.31.32.36.

                  <p>But we finde by experience, that the faith of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men conſiſteth onely in words, being nothing els but an idle conceit ſwimming in their braines: for there be many who when they vnderſtand that men by faith are made free from their ſinnes, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2781:34"/>bleſſed, doe preſently perſwade themſelues, that they alſo beleeue, whereas alas, they know not what it is truly to beleeue in the <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> nor yet what is the nature, and vertue of true faith.

                  <p>For as we know, it is not enough for one that would be cured of ſome perillous diſeaſe, onely to beleeue that ſuch an expert Phiſitian can, and will cure him; but if he will be holpen, he muſt follow the aduiſe of the Phiſitian, and vſe the medicines which ſhal be preſcribed vnto him, or els he is like to be neuer the better: So it is not enough, that a man, to the end that he might be cured of the <hi>body of death,</hi> by the onely Phiſitian of the ſoule, Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.12. perſwadeth himſelfe that Chriſt can, &amp; will helpe him; but he muſt alſo follow the counſell of Chriſt, if he will be cured by him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which the holy Scripture ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely declareth, euen <hi>that Chriſt is the author of ſaluation vnto all that obey,</hi> Heb. 5.9.

                  <p>Now, what the will of God is in this, that men might thorough our Lord Ieſus Chriſt be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the <hi>body of death,</hi> very much might be ſpoken thereof, but my purpoſe is here briefly, &amp; in a word, to touch the moſt neceſſary things, and ſo to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, becauſe I haue largely handled it in another place; and, that wretched, and ſinful man might be deliuered from the <hi>body of death,</hi> through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the Prince of life, &amp; be more and more ſet free from the power of ſinne, he muſt practiſe, and endeuour theſe three things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will, and counſell of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he muſt forſake himſelfe, <hi>He that will follow me</hi> (ſayth Chriſt, namely, that will be led &amp; healed by me) <hi>let him for ſake himſelfe,</hi> Mat. 16.24. that is, let him caſt away, and renounce his owne vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, &amp; judgement; let him breake himſelfe of his owne will and affections: let him in nothing yeeld vnto his ſinful fleſh, nor <hi>take any care to obey it in the luſtes thereof,</hi> Rom. 13.14. And let him not pleaſe, or vphold this <hi>body of ſin,</hi> by giuing it any of thoſe deadly, &amp; pernicious things it luſteth after: but let him herin circumciſe himſelf; let him deale harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2781:35"/>and roughly with this <hi>body of ſin,</hi> keeping from it, and denying it of euery thing it would haue, ſo ſhall the ſtrength therof decay; for as it was the meat of Chriſt, to do his <hi>Fathers will,</hi> Io: 4.4. So is it the nouriſhment, &amp; ſtrength of the corrupt fleſh to doe againſt the will of God, by committing ſin, from which we muſt bridle it, if we will kill it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, this is the counſell of Chriſt, ſpeaking after the manner of a <hi>Phiſitian,</hi> who when he taketh a man in hand to cure him, requireth of him, that by all meanes he would keepe a good dyer, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine to eate thoſe things which nouriſh, &amp; feede his diſeaſe, the which the Chriſtian man muſt doe that willingly would be cured of the <hi>body of death;</hi> for we find it to be a common, and familiar thing, that thoſe which be ſicke in body, doe moſt deſire thoſe things that doe them leaſt good; So is it alſo with men that are ſick in ſoule: they euermore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, &amp; luſt after ſinne, which is moſt hurtfull vnto them: therfore thoſe that would be cured in their ſoules, <hi>muſt deny themſelues,</hi> according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript rule of Chriſt: yea, they muſt renounce, and forſake the whole <hi>body of death</hi> (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out againſt the whole <hi>body of death</hi>) &amp; not only this, or that part, or member thereof, as ſome doe, who, to be cured forſake, &amp; ſtriue againſt ſome ſins retaining ſtil other ſome pleaſing &amp; beloued ones, whereby they become the more incurable, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſick euen vnto the death, as the <hi>ſcripture</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, <hi>Eze:</hi> 18.31.32. for although the very beſt, ſo long as they remaine here, are not free from all ſinnes, yet, euery one that would be cured, &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2781:35"/>of his ſinnes, muſt ſtriue, and fight againſt all of them, <hi>Iob</hi> 20.12.</p>
                  <p>But this is very grieuous vnto a naturall, and corrupt man, to weane his luſtes of their deſires, and to depriue himſelfe of thoſe thinges with which his heart is moſt in loue: Oh, it is as death vnto ſinfull man: it is, as if he ſhould put out his eye, or cut off his hand, as Chriſt himſelfe giues vs to vnderſtand, <hi>Mat:</hi> 5. Neuertheleſſe, it muſt be done, as he that cannot lye teacheth vs in the ſame place, <hi>verſ:</hi> 29.30. And looke, by how much the more this <hi>body of death,</hi> that hatefull monſter, the corrupt fleſh, doth flatter, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace vs, for to entice vs to ſerue it in the luſtes thereof, by ſo much the more, muſt wee ſet our ſelues againſt it, and ſeeke to ſubdue it, and bring it vnder, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. For our ſinfull fleſh is like vnto a wicked Enchantreſſe, which ſmileth vpon vs when ſhe purpoſeth to deſtroy vs; the pleaſing and delightfull concupiſcences thereof, are like <hi>Ioabs</hi> kiſſes, who killed <hi>Amaſa</hi> when he ſeemed to kiſſe him, 2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 20.9.10. Therefore wee muſt not fauour and pleaſe this monſter of ſinne: but we muſt in this thing, <hi>denie our ſelues,</hi> and <hi>kill our earthly members,</hi> Col. 3.5. And <hi>crucifie our old man,</hi> Gal. 5.24. If we will liue, and be deliuered from the eternall croſſe, and the eternall death. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt we ſhrinke, or be afrayd to doe it; for, the luſtes of our fleſh, which we are to cut off, are as rotten members; members of the <hi>bodie of death,</hi> cankered, and putrified members, which if we cut them not off in time, will corrupt, and deſtroy our
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2781:36"/>whole man; yea, and bring vs alſo into eternall death, as the truth it ſelfe teacheth vs expreſſely, teſtifying, that if we fauour and make much of the members of this <hi>body of death,</hi> that is, our ſinfull luſtes, and cut them not off, we ſhall with them be caſt into hell, where the Worme neuer dyeth, and the fire neuer goeth out, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.44.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the man that would willingly bee more and more deliuered from the <hi>body of death,</hi> thorough Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, muſt not onely denie, and forſake himſelfe, but alſo, with all his affections, and the deepeſt deſires of his heart, make all poſſible ſpeede to come vnto Chriſt, that he may be cured of him, as he himſelfe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, namely, that all that are wearie, and laden muſt come vnto him, and he will eaſe them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28.29. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.15. He then that would be healed by Chriſt, and deliuered from the <hi>bodie of death,</hi> muſt giue vp himſelfe vnto him, to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him, euen as a poore patient which hauing long beene poſſeſſed with a grieuous diſeaſe, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe into the hands of a skilfull Phiſitian (which by Gods helpe can cure him) to be ruled and handled according vnto his will, &amp; preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Now the dyet, the phiſicke, the receipts which Chriſt the onely Phiſitian of the ſoule preſcribeth vnto his patients (that I may ſo ſpeake) for their curing, are found onely in the holy Scripture, <hi>Ioh:</hi> 5.39. which is the Phiſick booke wherein are plentifully conteined the words, which are <hi>life to them that finde them; and health vnto their fleſh,</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:2781:36"/>Pro. 4.22. Therefore the poore ſinfull man that would haue helpe, muſt order, and gouerne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe according to the rule, and true meaning of the holy Scripture, wherein is comprehended the great wiſedome of God, and all the myſteries of ſpirituall Phiſicke, according to which whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer truely frameth, and carrieth himſelfe, ſhall certainely, and vndoubtedly be healed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the greateſt folly, and madneſſe in the world, and a ſinne whereof very many ſtand guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie before God, that wretched ſinfull men ſhould be ſlacke, and negligent to enquire, and ſearch after the wiſedome, and counſell of God, and to frame, and faſhion themſelues according vnto it, notwithſtanding, the great, wife, and mercifull God hath reuealed vnto them in his word (which he hath put into our handes,) how they ſhould walke, to the end, that they may be healed of the <hi>bodie of death;</hi> but run vnaduiſedly after the blind conceipt of their owne head, without once right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidering, what the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the onely Phiſitian of the ſoule hath preſcribed, and deliuered in the holy Scripture, for poore ſoule-ſicke man to practiſe, and apply vnto himſelfe, to the end that he may bee cured; yea, the great ſtayne of this ſinne of the godleſſe children of the world, ſhall neuer be purged from them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they amend, therefore thoſe that would bee deliuered from the <hi>body of death,</hi> thorough our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, muſt ſo giue themſelues vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him to be cured of him, as that they diligently
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2781:37"/>ſearch, and learne out of his word how they muſt order, and addreſſe themſelues, to the end, that they may bee healed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He that would be deliuered from the <hi>body of death</hi> thorough our Lord Ieſus Chriſt; muſt by all meanes endeuour to beleeue, and hold as firme, and certaine, that he thus denying, and giuing vp himſelfe vnto Chriſt, ſhall truely bee deliuered, and cured by him: this did Chriſt require in the curing of bodily diſeaſes, <hi>Marc.</hi> 9.23. and elſe-where; teaching vs thereby that this faith is aboue all things neceſſary, and requiſite vnto the curing of the mortall diſeaſe of our ſoules, it being the Conduit which conueyeth vnto vs vertue from Chriſt, whereby we are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of our corruptions.</p>
                  <p>But the Diuell which ſetteth vp himſelfe as a God of the world, laboureth by all his might, and pollicie, to hinder and ſtop this: for hee will eyther perſwade a man that he ſhall liue, and bee ſaued by his faith, and beliefe in Chriſt, when hee liueth in a courſe of perdition, ſeruing the fleſh, wherein if he continueth, it is not poſſible that he ſhould be ſaued, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. or elſe hee will make him beleeue if he can, that his ſinnes are ſo great, that he ſhall not obteine pardon and remiſſion of God, when he hath denied himſelfe, forſaken his ſinnes, laboureth to be conformed vnto the will of God, and is heartily grieued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot performe ſuch obedience vnto
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2781:37"/>him, as hee ſhould, and as hee would: but let vs take heede of both theſe Rockes: let vs not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume of the mercy of God, when wee are not fit Objects of mercie, ſtanding in open rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt God, being friendes of ſinne: and let it alſo bee farre from vs to thinke, that God will not haue mercy vpon vs, when wee come vnto him for mercie, with true ſorrow and griefe becauſe wee haue offended him; for it is his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to haue mercie, and to haue reſpect vnto them that humble themſelues: but let vs wreſtle with our vnbeleiefe, and beleeue, that <hi>thorough the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt wee ſhall bee ſaued,</hi> Act. 15.11.</p>
                  <p>This faith, thus being founded, not vpon an idle conceipt of our owne braynes; but vpon the fore-named groundes, the word, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Chriſt, wee accordingly endeuouring truely to forſake our ſelues, and to put our ſelues into his hands, to be ruled and gouerned by him: This faith (I ſay) is mightie, and worketh won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and there is no diſeaſe of the ſoule ſo mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, or incurable, of which wee ſhall not bee cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if ſo be wee hold faſt, and continue in this our true, and holy faith, following the councell of Chriſt: for then may wee expect, the bleſſing of Chriſt, more and more to bee deliuered from the <hi>bodie of death:</hi> Then ſhall it bee done vnto vs, according to the words of Chriſt, <hi>Mathew</hi> the fifteenth Chapter, and the twentie eyght verſe, <hi>Be it vnto thee as thou wilt;</hi> Then ſhall wee
