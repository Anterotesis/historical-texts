         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To Macers of Our Privy Council
Meſſengers at Arms, Our Sheriffs in that Part Conjunctly and Severally Specially Conſtitute Greeting;
Foraſmuch, as We, by Our Letter, under Our Royall hand, dated at <hi>Kenſingteun,</hi> the twelfth of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi>
inſtant, have ſignified to the Lords of Our Privy Council, That whereas We are Informed, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
of Our Anſwer to the late Petition of the Councill Generall of the Company of that Our
Kingdom, Trading to <hi>Affrica</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> which We think ought to have given intire Satisfaction to all
Our Good Subjects; Yet there is on foot a Deſign of Addreſſing Us of New, on the ſame heads, carryed
on after ſuch a Manner, and with ſo little reſpect to Our Government, as gives Us too juſt Grounds to apprehend the Conſequences,
that We have never hitherto denyed Our Subjects their juſt Priviledges, nor will We ever diſcourage the Liberty of Petitioning,
when the ſame is done in ane Orderly and Dutiful manner, But that having fully declared Our Mind, as to the Subject of the
laſt Addreſſe, We cannot but take particular Notice of that unuſual Method that is taken to procure Subſcriptions to ane new
one, And that ſome Perſons, who ſignalize themſelves in carrying on the ſame, have given no Evidence of their good affection
to Our Government. And make it their Indeavour to lodge the late misfortune of the Company, on Proclamations emitted in the
Weſt <hi>Indies,</hi> tho they cannot but be ſenſible, that the ſame did proceed from other Cauſes. And being convinced, that ſuch
Practiſes may tend to Alienat from Us the Hearts of Our good Subjects, and that it is neceſſar, for the Support of Our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and preſerving the publick Peace of the Nation, that they be diſcouraged and prevented, We did therefore Recomend
to the ſaids Lords of Our Privy Council, to ſignifie and make known Our Diſpleaſure, and Diſ-ſatisfaction with ſuch proceedings,
and to take the moſt effectuall Methods conſiſtent with Law, for diſcouraging the ſame: And for preventing theſe that are well
inclined to Our Government, from Joyning with them, Wherefore, We, with advice of the Lords of Our Privy Councill, have
thought fit, that publick Intimation be made in manner underwritten, of Our Diſpleaſure, and Diſ-ſatisfation with the foreſaid
Proceedings, And that We will take the moſt effectuall Methods conſiſtent with Law, for Diſcouraging the ſame, and for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
theſe that are well inclined to Our Goverment from Joyning with them, OUR WILL IS HEREFORE,
And We Charge you ſtrictly, and Command, that Incontinent theſe Our Letters ſeen, ye paſs to the Mercat Croſs of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and
Remanent Mercat Croſſes of the whole Head Burghs, of the ſeverall Shires, and Stewartries within this Kingdom, and thereat in
Our Name and Authority, by open Proclamation make Intimation of the Premiſſes, that none pretent Ignorance. And Ordains
Our Sollicitor to tranſmitt Coppies to the Sheriffs, Stewarts and their Clerks for that effect. And Ordains theſe preſents to be
