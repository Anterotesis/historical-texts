         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>After this, a passenger tolde mee, which came in the Shippe, where the Gentleman was that brought a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this roote, and he chewed it wel, &amp; did disfleume there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and immediatly it tooke away the payne, &amp; he shewed me a little that remained therof, which was the same that I sawe, and since that, some haue vsed it, and it hath done very wel with them.</p>

And I being one day in the Custome house curing a Genoues which was there, an other of the same Nation complained vnto mee of the toothache, and wee caused to be brought some of the said Roote, and in the presence of as many as were there, hee chewed the rinde of this roote, hauing very greate paynes, and he auoyded much Fleume, and in disfleming it began to take away the paynes, and before he went from thence hee was throughly cured.

                     <p>This licour, or Balsamo is very much esteemed amongst the Indians, and is of greate value, and with the notable woorkes which therewith are done, and the Spaniardes haue learned, and by seeing the great woorkes which it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,

they haue brought it hether, as a thing of great estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and such a thing as they buy there for a great price: and they haue reason so to doe: for one of the best thinges that haue come from those partes, which haue beene brought for Medicine, is this Balsamo, which seemeth to be better then that of the newe Spaine, and in it selfe appeareth to haue more vertues.</p>

                     <p>It healeth al fresh woundes, comforting the partes, and ioyning them without making any matter, and without lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any signe of them. The superfluitie that is in the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d must be taken away of what sort soeuer it be, &amp; washed with wine, &amp; ioyned wel in the lippes &amp; parts therof, and then the Balsamo laid to it, when the coldnesse is out of it, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a double linnen cloth vpon it, wette in the same Balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, and so bounde that the lippes goe not a sunder, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping diet, and vsing letting of blood if it be needful, and not vnbinding it vntill the fourth day, and they shall finde the wounde comforted, except that there bee any acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which causeth it to bee vndone before.

euery day, by reiterating the wette Linnen cloth in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samo, it wil bee healed: for the vertue of this Balsamo is to cause that there bee no matter engendered in the woundes, and especially this Balsamo doeth profite in woundes, where there hath beene cuttinges of bones, taking them out that haue beene diuided one from another, and not tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the rest, for that the vertue of the Balsamo will caste them out, and hauing so done, wil heale the wounde. One of the thinges wherein this Balsamo worketh greate effectes, is in woundes, and ioyntes, and in cuttinges of Sinewes, &amp; in al prickes: for in all these kindes of woundes it maketh a maruellous woorke, curing and preseruing them from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame colde, and from running together of Sinewes, that they remayne not lame. The woundes which doe penetrate, are healed with this Balsamo, being mingled with whyte wyne, and spouting it into them, and after three houres ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it out again.

And if it bee in the belly, or in any parte of the body, wetting a Linen cloth hot in <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> of the best, and applying it to the place, where the griefe of the Stone is, and mingled with Oyle made for the purpose, it maketh a great woorke, it taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the paynes of the Sinewes, and when they bee shronke together, in a very hot weather, rubbing them with it, it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solueth them.

                  <p>These did write of many Medicines, with the which euery one may preserue themselues from poyson: for the malice of mankinde is very greate, and many haue procured for their interest, and reuenge, not onely with venome to offende and kill the common sorte of people; but also Emperoures, Kinges, great Princes and Lords; the which in how much more high estate they are appoynted and placed, so much the more daunger they are in.</p>

And many people for this cause, haue this stone layde in water continually, that they may drinke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being sicke, for it profiteth much to take away the Agewe, and geueth strength to the hart, and not onely this stone doth profite in venomous thinges and venomes, but in other disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as it hath byn proued: &amp; being geuen to them that haue the gidines in the head, it doth much profit, and also against opilations. And it happened that a Nunne that had sown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges and greate opilations, by taking the <hi>Bezaar</hi> stone was healed, and likewise of the opilations: and being long time without her customed termes, they came very well too her and aboundantly. This stone profiteth much to them that haue taken Arsenike or other corsiue venome, for that it dooth kill and consume the force of the venome, and taketh away the accidentes thereof. Milke hath in this a great preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and doth woorke effectually, by taking much quantitie, and continually vsing the same, for although that it be a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous remedie, it must be vsed in corsiue venomes, for that it maketh the venomes to be expelled by vomit, and doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish the mallice. It is the true Antidote against corsiue venome, and after the vse thereof, the stone may be giuen or the pouder, or any of the sayde medicines, that haue vertue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst venome. Also this stone doth profit muche against fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers that bringe certaine red spots in the bodie like to Flea-bytinges, that commonly doe appeare in their shoulders, and in their archter parts of the bodie: these doe come in sore Agewes, that doe expell the humours out of the bodie, and

An other thing which is conuenient, is to geue to the sicke, when these small spottes doe beginne to appeare, those thinges which doe extinguish and kill the venome: of the which we haue treated very largely hauing respect not to let blood, after that they haue appeared, if it come not of too muche replection and fulnesse of blood. One thing I haue founde for these redde Spottes and for Feuers of muche profite and notable experience in many, which is our Bolearmenike prepared in a dishe of earth with Rose wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter geuen in all medicines that are too bee taken, and in the meates that are too bee eaten, and surely in it I haue founde great effect, chiefly in one yeere, wherein reygned many Pestilent Agues, called Moder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And note this wel, that many times a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not giuen alwaies to eate of one meate, nor to see it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes tasted before he eate it, and afterwarde there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in it notable hurte, therefore it is good to take your meate with a forke or a spoone, and that they be made as <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome Montuo</hi> a learned man in Phisike had appoynted for king Henry of Fraunce, which was made to knowe if that he had eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any venom, there must be made a little forke and a spoone of one mixture of gold and siluer, that the olde wryters called <hi>Eletrum</hi> and it must bee 4. partes golde and one of siluer, they must bee smooth, cleane &amp; well burnished, with the forke or holder let him eate his meate, and with the spoone his broth: for putting them in the meate or in the broth, if that there bee any venom therein, foorthwith the golde will haue an euil colour, appearing tawnie, blewe, or blacke, and loosing the beautie that before it had, the which wil cause them to looke better to the meate, and this is done for trial therof, and to make further experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce by some beast that may eate thereof, and so to see the effect thereof, for that is the greatest experience: the lyke may bee done with the drinke to make a cuppe therof, or a broade vessel well burni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.

It is good to haue a peece of a right Unicornes horne in a smal cheyne of golde, that it may bee swilled continually in the water that shalbee dronke. It would doe well, for not onely it taketh away the suspition of the venom, but doeth put to the drinke a meruellous cordiall vertue. Also you must not stand by the fire that is made with venomous wood, for the smoke doeth poyson, as if you should take poyson, and to set in the chamber coales when they doe begin to kindle, many haue dyed therwith: let your apparell be kept by such as you haue trust in, for in them may bee put things that may do notable hurte, and for al that, as is said, it doeth much profit to haue trustie seruants, and that they bee such whome you may trust, and that they be of a good pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, and sticke not to reward them wel.

                     </note>We haue sayde with the opinion of <hi>Auicen,</hi> and the rest of the authors, that al metals are made of sulfur and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siluer, the sulfur as the father, and the quicksiluer as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the one as the maker, and the other as the matter, and being so, the matter whereof the yron is made, is of these twoo things, and of these twoo beginninges, of the most hot sulfur, and of the most colde quicksiluer. The which nature hath placed in the inner partes of the earth, and made them metals, and where there was these twoo beginninges, most pure, it was made golde, and lykewyse of that which was grosse and vnpure, according to the degree and qualitie of euery one, there was ingendred and made the metal, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably to the purenesse, or grosnesse that it had: and where these metals are more vnpure, more grosse, and more darke, the yron did ingender. The which being of beginnings not pure nor cleane, but grosse and filthy, became to be a metall, more harde then al other metals, so that by meanes of it strength, there might bee some who might make it easie and subiect to bee wrought, as also it might bee a necessary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument that thereof men might profite themselues. And whereas the yron is made and ingendred of these twoo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, which are, sulfur and quicksiluer, the one hot, and the other colde: so it hath the complection, and temperature, and doeth participate of both qualities: therfore it is so dry, and for this cause hard and strong. By meanes of the sulfur it heateth, it consumeth, it dryeth, it openeth, it comforteth, it prouoketh appetite, and maketh the meruellous woorkes that we will speake of heereafter, and al is done by meanes of the heate which it hath. And by meanes of the quicksil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, being grosse and vnpure, and being formed with earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vertue, wherewith it is mingled, it cooleth, it retayneth, it thickeneth, it congeleth, it withdraweth, and detayneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maner of fluxe, or runninges by binding, it taketh away stooles, it cooleth and tempereth the heate, and it doeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

other effects, which are all done by meanes of the coldnes that it hath, in such sorte y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as by the aforesaide is seene, the effects are contrarie which the yron doth: the cause wherof is by reason it is compounded of things that haue contrary qualities, which are rooted in it, and do worke conformably to the subiect where they doe worke. For where it is need to open, it openeth; and where it is neede to shut, it shutteth. Trueth it is, that besides these qualities, the yron hath an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther most principal, which is, that it is most dry, more then all other metals, by meanes whereof it doeth many of these effectes and workes, which wee haue spoken of, and also it hath vertue to heate, to coole, and to dry vp. And of this it commeth, that some doe say it is hot, bycause they see that it maketh workes of heate, and others saie that it is colde, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they see that it doeth workes to make colde, the reason whereof is, that it is compounded of twoo contrarie begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges, the one hot, and the other colde, and thereby it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that they may very wel defend themselues, who sayde that yron is colde, and worketh cold effectes: And lykewyse they that sayde, it was hot, and doth hot effects. Whereby it doth appeare that which the one and the other haue spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and treated therof, to be true. <hi>B.</hi> Maister Doctor hath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wel ended the controuersie, and contrariety that is in this matter discretly and wisely, wherby wee are satisfied: but there remayneth a doubt, if the quicksiluer bee colde, as he sayeth that some doe say that it is, and to prooue it, they say that it sheweth by his strength, colour, and taste, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes which it doeth, to make colde, seeing that such as doe vse of it, it maketh impotent, they suffer weakenesse, and trembling of sinewes, and are vtterly voyde of the vse of their members, and many dye all togither of a disease cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Apoplexie, and all this doeth come of cold causes. They which say that the quicksiluer is hot, doe prooue it with his effectes, for anoynting the iointes, and other partes, of the body therwith, it maketh great workes, and effects of heat,
<pb facs="tcp:13116:127"/>
it inflameth their mouth, and throte, their gummes, &amp; rooffe of their mouth, with great heat, and burning: it prouoketh sweat most vehement: we see that therof is made that most strong thing like to fire, that is called <hi>Sublimatum,</hi> which is most strong fire,<note place="margin">

It hath also min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with it fulfery parts, which seemeth to be very bright: for in chafing the quicksiluer betweene the hands, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in them the perfit smel of brimstone, &amp; so the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siluer i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The watery &amp; earthy parts giueth it vertue to make colde: by meanes whereof is done the vertue which we haue spoken of, and by meanes of the sulfure which hath ayery parts, it heateth, penetrateth, openeth and maketh thin, and by them it prouoketh sweat, it causeth to expel by the mouth, and by stooles the humour that doeth abounde, by hearing and doing other effectes of heate. And therfore it is not to be maruelled that the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siluer doth contrary effects, seing it hath diuers operations, which is the selfesame that we haue spoken of the yron, and so the doubt remaineth discouered which was propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by M. <hi>Burgus.

And seing that it shalbe declared, let vs loose no tyme, wherby we may the rather make an ende. By that which is sayde, you haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood howe the yron, and steele, are one kinde of metall, sauing that the steele is more cleane yron, and more fine, &amp; for this cause it is hard and strong. They of old tyme knewe not the steele, but onely treated of the yron, and to it they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed the medicinal vertues that wee will speake of, and vnder our talke of yron, we wil comprise the steele, seeing that it differeth not from it, in more then in being purer, &amp; cleaner from superfluities: and for this cause the steele doth make cold, and dryeth more then the yron. For where it is needful to heate and to open, the yron hath more force, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not cleane of the sulpherie partes, for there is lost much thereof, when the steele is made in the forme as it is aboue sayde.</p>

And for this cause the auncient Phisitions did forbid that in time of the plague the water shoulde not be put into the ayre to bee made colde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the corrupt ayres should not infect it. There is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise an other inconuenience, that you cannot euery night set the water too bee made colde in the Ayre, for some nights and the moste parte of them, in the Summer time are so whot, that not onely the ayre doeth not make colde, but the water that is set in the ayre, is whotter then it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and if it bee made any whit colde, it dureth no longer then the Morning, when it is not needefull, and likewise in the time betweene Winter and Sommer, or in the Winter when the ayre woulde make colde, then the rayne, the tempestes and cloudes and other alterations will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the ayre to doe it. All these thinges experience doeth shewe at this day.</p>
                  <p>There is an other manner of way how to make cold with the ayre, which is the most wholesome, and more without hurt than any of all the other: wherein there is no occasion of any euill qualitie. And there are many people of estimation which doe vse this way to make colde that, which they should

drinke, the which they put into vessels of earth, or metall, and do alwayes make winde and ayre to the vessels with a wet lynnen cloth. And it must be so, that it be in the ayre continually without ceasing, as long as you are at meate. And in this sorte it will be made colde to purpose, and the hote ayre that is ioyned to the vessell is taken awaye, and in place of it commeth freshe and colde ayre, euen as it doeth when there is gathered winde to the face, and taking away the hote ayre that is ioyned to it, and with freshe ayre it maketh it colde and refresheth.</p>

This kynde of making colde hath also many inconueniences, as well of the parte of the water, wherewith it is made colde, as of the parte of the place where it is put, cheefely in the welles of the cities and townes, that for the moste parte are fowle and full of filthinesse. The water of these welles is an earthly water, grosse and harde, because it is continually standing in one place, and shut within the bowels of the earth. And as it is a standing water, it must of force he putrified, for that the beames of the Sunne do not pearce it, nor yet the ayre doeth visite it, and therefore continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is full of euill vapours, whereof they do easily rott, and they are foule waters full of durte and claye, and of other mischiefes of an euill qualitie.</p>
                  <p>And seeing the water or wine is so put a long tyme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this foule standing water, what can come of it, but that it participateth of the euill qualitie that it hath? And so <hi>Galen</hi> sayeth,<note place="margin">

For the cold that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of snow, is healthful without receyuing hurt, by that which is cooled with it, nor causeth any alteration bycause it is a very good congeled water, and doeth make cold.</p>

a large relation, in the booke of diseases of the raynes, and in the booke of good and euil meates. And bycause that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicen</hi> did expound them, I wil shew what he wryteth, in the third part of the first booke, in the 8. chapter: He which doth drinke snow, and the water that doth proceed out of the same snowe, if hee doe vse it continually there will followe much hurt thereby: it doth offend the sinewes, and it is naught for the brest, and for the inner members, and especially for the breathing: and there is none that doe vse to drinke it, but it wil do them hurte, vnlesse hee be of a sanguine complection which if hee doe not feele hurt presently, hee shall feele it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde. Whereby it appeareth howe euill the vse of the sayde snowe is, and the water which doeth come out of it, if it bee not by the way of medicine, onely so it may bee vsed to coole therewith, for in such sorte it doeth not offende, as is sayde.

snowe, for the weakenes of the sinewes, and interiour parts, and for the tendernesse of their age, and chiefly they may drinke no wyne, but water, for that their age doeth not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that they may drinke it: and drinking water very colde, it doeth them very much hurte.

The third is, to put it to coole some reasonable time in water, that is most colde, or in snowe, for the more it is cooled, the more the strength and vapours are repressed, and so it will lesse of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the head, and it will lesse penetrate the ioyntes, which is seene in the sayde wyne, and beeing made colde there is abated much of his strength, in so much that if it bee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry colde, it seemeth as though that it were water. Some people there are which doe say and publish much euil of the cooling with snowe, without knowing if it be good or euill: and as it is a newe thing, and especially in this Countrie, they feare that there will come hurt to them by the vse of it.

                     </note> for if it bee not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, it heateth the snow, and it melteth the more.

And the other is, that the snowe doeth not melt so muche, let euery man doe as hee hath the quantitie of Snowe to doe it withall, and likewise in the cooling of it, more or lesse as his necessitie and health doeth require, and can beare well the vse thereof: of the which wee haue made a large relation, although that my intente and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose was for no more than too defende that the best way too make the drinke colde, and more healthfull is to make cold with snowe, and as for the other manner of wayes and vses too make colde, they haue many inconueniences which I haue spoken of, and onely too make colde with Snow, is that which is conuenient, seeyng that the snowe doeth not touche the thing, onely the little platter that is made cold with it, is onely that which doeth make colde.
