            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE Physical Reader.</head>
            <p>I Have long since observed, that Physicians did not cure conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Fevors, but rather did render them mortal: Though, if by good fortune any one hath been delivered of a Fevor, it is only to be imputed to the strength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which if she had not been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed by improper means, would have disintangled her self from the disease much sooner, and with less danger.</p>
            <p>The cause of this so unfortunate practice depends on a false supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:53438:3"/>
of fermentation, whence since they desume erroneous indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the success must necessarily frustrate their expectation. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess I have made use of the term of <hi>fermentation</hi> in several Treatises, and possibly in the illustration of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, but to this intent only, that I might in some manner be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisant to the received opinion of the times, not in the least imagining the notion thereof necessary, or contributing any whit to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or cure of Fevors. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the Reader is to take notice, that at present I have not written or acted the part of a <hi>Professor</hi> in the Chair, making a Methodical and Pedantick Lecture on the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, division, next the causes, then the Diagnostick, and afterward the Prognostick signs of Fevors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is my purpose, to discourse
<pb facs="tcp:53438:3"/>
succinctly of such things, as are most necessary for a Practical Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, and of such other cases, as I could call to mind, since the time, when I had seldom less in cure than two hundred Patients that lay sick of Fevors.</p>
            <p>What concerns other theoretical notions, and farther observations touching the several kinds of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, I shall hereafter propose them in distinct Sections; in the mean time, farewell.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Nature of Innate Heat.</head>
               <p>IT is usual among Authors, to derive the name, they intend to impose upon the distempers of parts, from the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest symptom; whence the word <hi>Febris,</hi> (or Fevor) being taken from <hi>fervor, i. e.</hi> heat, or from <hi>februa,</hi> a sort of fiery sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the Antients, or from the verb
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53438:6"/>
                  <hi>februo, i. e.</hi> I cleanse, likewise <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in Greek a Fevor, from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a fire, seem to be applied to this distemper. The word Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor in English is certainly derived from <hi>fervor,</hi> heat, only leaving out the <hi>r,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be written Fevor, and not Fever, unless you derive it from the French word, <hi>fievre,</hi> by omitting the <hi>i.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore what this <hi>fervor</hi> or heat, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> fire signifie, will best appear by confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with them the words <hi>Calor</hi> warmth, and <hi>Calidum</hi> heat, being their opposits: from warmth <hi>Calor,</hi> and heat <hi>Calidum</hi> we have our strength and live, but through <hi>Fervor</hi> a destructive heat and fire, we lose our strength and end our days.</p>
               <p>It will much conduce to our purpose I judge, to premise the difference of these words. <hi>Calidum</hi> heat denotes a hot essence or substance, but <hi>Calor</hi> warmth signifieth only a quality separable from its subject or hot nature by our thoughts or concept, and not really, though <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>calidum</hi> or heat, and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Calor</hi> warmth, are by <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> used in the same sense. Neither are you to imagine, that in feeling of Pulses of such as are ill of a Fevor, it is not the quality of heat, but fiery steems, bodies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> really physical, do strike your hand and ends
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53438:6"/>
of your fingers. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> fire is by <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> expounded the Innate Heat of man, but among the Latines generally a Fevor; whence a Fevor may be commodiously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, <hi>A fire kindled out of the Innate heat of the body, chiefly of the heart,</hi> (<hi>but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundarily:</hi>) Wherefore that the heart and its constitutive principle, is the part, for the most times hurt, is evident, from the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorish affection, and life (the proper acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heart,) being immediately op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest, from the inordinate pulse, a sudden decay of strength, and the actions of the whole oeconomy being very considerably, and all at once depravated, and diminisht. The experience of those, that have put their finger into the ventricles of the heart (the breast being suddenly opened) of malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, who by sentence have had their head cut off, and have extracted it again thence very hot, doth confirm, that the <hi>Calidum,</hi> or heat of the heart, is a substance really burning about its chambers, and thence dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing flames, through the articles, to the circumference. If on the other side, the destructive nature of a burning heat be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, it's not material, considering the burning, or flaming of brimstone, or spirit of wine, whose purity of flame will not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53438:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
burn those bodies it touches, especially when through graduation of the air, it may be moderated to any tone of heat or warmth.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, I state the <hi>Calidum Cordis;</hi> or heat of the heart, to be a <hi>Bitumen</hi> real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ethereal and vital, most exactly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecated or refined, dispersing every where its most subtile and pure flames, and feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the most pure and flowring particles of the blood. But since it's difficult, to gain an universal assent, that the nature of blood, excercising so slender a commerce with the air, and limited within the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bounds of the heart and arteries, should be convertible into a flame, and a perpetual warmth, it may be rendred obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by this only instance; Namely; almost all subterraneous waters; that partake of a continual heat, as the water of <hi>Aix la Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle, Bathe,</hi> and of other hot Baths, since they source out of the deepest and most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote bosoms of the earth, just in the same manner doth the indesatigable soring of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative, or living blood, leap very hot out of the bosom of the heart into the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, like rivulets; and certainly, that which by natural Philosophers is asserted to be the cause of heat in those waters,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53438:7"/>
may easily be imposed upon me, to believe the same, to be the cause of heat in the blood, namely a <hi>Bitumen,</hi> but not <hi>Sulphur,</hi> being immediately extinguisht by water; nor <hi>calx viva</hi> or lime, there being no such fury of heat discoverable in the caverns of the earth, as is requisite for its genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Wherefore in <hi>Bitumen</hi> only may be found a heat that is constant, and scarce to be extinguisht; for by water it's apt to be kindled into a higher flame, and to be nourisht by oyl, and oylie bodies.</p>
               <p>It is then in the heart where nature hath placed an abounding fountain of vital <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen,</hi> on the purity and continuity of whose flame, lise it self doth depend. Neither must it be asserted, that so great a proportion of this doth flow from the heart, as to suffice to protract the life of it, and of the whole structure, for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, but that it doth daily attract a bituminous nutriment from the streaming blood, which being kindled into vital flames, is by means of the pulse distributed into the rest of the small chanels of the body. It must also be observed, that all what we eat, or drink, the chyle and the blood do contain a certain proportion of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53438:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Bitumen,</hi> and as much hereof, as there is abounding in them, so much they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being serviceable to the heart.</p>
               <p>At present must be explained, what, and of what quality this <hi>Bitumen</hi> is; namely a body grown out of a sulphureous oyl and a Colophony, into a thick, liquable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamable substance. Such by distillation it's also discovered to be in the analytick parts of the blood of a living creature; to wit, an oyl swimming a top the phlegm, and a colophony with a part of fixed salt, setled in the body of the glass-gourd, withall a volatil salt passing the Alembick with the oyl; which later, namely the volatil salt, it is, that adds to the whole mixt body all its strength and power; not unlike Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whose <hi>Nitro-salin</hi> particles being ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred volatil, through virtue of the fire, do as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume so great a force, that they strike any object whatsoever, with the greatest alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and the smartest blow imaginable, when in the mean while the brimstone, and the charcoal-dust, only supply the place of a soporous matter. From what hath been said, the manner of the pulses may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously be extracted; only conceiving, that the <hi>Bitumen</hi> of the heart, burning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the period of life, and pour'd from the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53438:8"/>
ascending <hi>vena cava</hi> into the left ventricle, doth kindle the blood into a flame, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whereof the nitro-salin salt being blown into most volatile forcible particles, is like Lightning, or Gun-powder discharged out of a Gun, propelled as it were by an ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick force into the Great and other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Concerning the differences of Pulses and their causes.</head>
               <p>TO describe the difference and variety of the Waters of the Sea, would prove a task less difficult, than that of the pulsations of the Heart and Arteries, which are subject to be altered by every passion, wind, and disease; though <hi>Galen</hi> indeed counted them, as if he had blown them out at his fingers ends, among which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding scarce every third difference can be distinguisht by the feeling of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Wherefore I shall only discourse of such, which every one may almost discern in Fevors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:53438:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>In the Pulse I use to mind, first, the strength or force, next the swiftness of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thirdly the equality. From the strength a pulse is called strong or weak; hereunto are accounted a great pulse (to wit, full and strong) and small, namely empty and weak: the causes of the strength of the pulse I state to be the abundance of volatil salt, being vigorously and smartly discharged through the pulse of the blood, and the strength of the fibres being well nourisht with the moisture of the brain. On the contrary, the defect of salt, and emptiness of the fibres cause a weak pulse. Here it's worthy of your observance, that the pulse in some sevorish Patients is found much stronger, than it was in their state of health: and, what is more, in some, who were reduced to so low an ebb of strength, that they were scarce able to keep death a day from their door, I remember, their pulse would beat the tops of ones fingers smartly, which notwithstanding in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ought not to be called a strong pulse, but violent; for the vital faculty being ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritated, by a corroding and reverberated kind of salt, is forced into those violent pulsations; whence falling at last into a very in all and most quick pulse, is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53438:9"/>
attended with an <hi>Asphyxia,</hi> or cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of pulsation. It is an easie business, to distinguish a violent pulse from a strong; the former doth come full to the fingers, the later empty. Secondly, I have oft met with a weak pulse in such as lay sick of Fevors, that they seemed not to be able to hold out two days, which notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have for a fortnight, or twenty days, strove very successfully with the disease. This pulse proceeds from a thick and moist blood, which by a continuated rarefaction, and reiterated circulation, being advanced to a higher degree of concoction, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the vital faculty, whilst in the mean time, there hath been sustained no great loss of volatil salt in those weak pulsations. I have many times taken notice of this case in women, that lay sick of Fevors; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is warily pronounced by <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, Aphor.</hi> 19. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> The predictions of life and death in acute Fevors are not always certain and without doubt.</p>
               <p>That we may avoid being mistaken, we are to distinguish; a pulse that's really weak, is empty and small, and for the most part inequal in motion and weakness, neither
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53438:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
did it differ much from that degree since the beginning.</p>
               <p>Under the motion of pulsation, I take a slow and swift pulse, likewise a thick and rare pulse. A slow pulse is known by moving slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the <hi>systole,</hi> or a contraction of the pulse, to the <hi>diastole,</hi> or a widening or dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the pulse; and again from the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astole</hi> to the <hi>systole.</hi> A quick pulse is known by its quick pace from the <hi>systole</hi> to the <hi>diastole,</hi> and so reciprocally. A thick pulse to me is, which is perceived by the finger by its frequent beatings, or retreats; a rare pulse contrariwise. Here may be noted, in my apprehension a pulse can scarce be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scovered slow and thick at once, when a slow pulse necessarily doth not return fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently or thick, because it's slow; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common maxim, a thick and slow pulse may happen together, because it is called thick, in respect of the interval or rest between the <hi>systole</hi> and <hi>diastole,</hi> namely, which returns in a short space of time; but a pulse may move slow from the <hi>systole</hi> to the <hi>diastole,</hi> so that there is but a small interval between, before it returns from the <hi>diastole</hi> to the <hi>systole,</hi> and thence it's termed thick.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:53438:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>But taking the matter into farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, there is scarce any such pulse, as a thick or frequent one, according as it's commonly described; neither is there a rare pulse, because there is no interval of rest between pulsation; for conceiving, that the pulse is like a reciprocal swelling and falling, like the tide of the sea, there can only be inferred a point of reflection, namely, as soon as it swells up, the next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it falls again, and as soon as it's fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, the next minute of time it swells again. Moreover, this rising or swelling is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an impulse from the heart, by means of the constriction of its fibres, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by like waves, besides the forementioned swelling or turgescency, the blood is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled through the pores of the body, out of the arteries into the veins. Wherefore that I might not beyond necessity burden my self in my practice with notions, I scarce am used to take notice of any thing else, in the motion of the pulse, besides its swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and slowness, neither do I stand much whether it be hard, or hot, or pricking, since this rather relates to the altered qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, than the pulse. Thirdly, It is to be observed that those, whose pulse being naturally full, strikes quick, their vital fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53438:11"/>
is very weakly; wherefore in women and children the arteries strike quick, but full. Fourthly, In malignant Fevors the arteries do oft move slowly, in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that one might judge them free from all putrid heat; but this doth not happen, unless death be ready to follow within a day, two or three.</p>
               <p>The natural swiftness of pulsation (not in sick people) must be imputed, partly to the abundance of volatil salt, but such as is not close and compact; for as soon as it arrives to the ventricles of the heart, it's apt to be flusht into too volatile particles, and soon after, the salt being so copious, follows immediately from the other parts of the salt, whence another pulse is ready at hand; partly it's to be imputed to a <hi>Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> that is easily inflamed, which quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kindles and is kindled, whence happens the frequency of the pulse.</p>
               <p>By the way, a small question might here be moved, whether the pulse beating quick in Fevors, there passeth more blood through the heart, than when one is in a state of health? First, It must be agreed upon, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in every dilatation the heart is filled full of blood, and in every constriction it be quite emptied; some defend the affirmative
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53438:11"/>
part, which to me doth not at all seem plain; for those, whose pulse at one time beats full, and at another empty, it must necessarily be argued, that at one time the pails of the heart must be swelled up with a greater quantity of blood, and at another with a lesser; and from the consequents it's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that reciprocally in divers pulses, there must be expelled a various proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humors. Secondly, Since it may be observed, that a large <hi>diastole</hi> of the heart is sometimes the next moment followed by a short and weak <hi>systole,</hi> as appears out of the swelled <hi>diastole</hi> of the arteries of the wrist, or any other part, there oft follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a short and weak <hi>systole,</hi> whence it's deemed, there is more received into the receptacle of the heart, and less expelled, so that oft a proportion that's admitted by one <hi>diastole,</hi> is expelled in three or four <hi>systoles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To answer to the question, we assert, that the blood is not circulated nothing near so rapidly or quick in malignant Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, as it is in the state of health, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the pulsifick faculty of the heart is languishing; neither is the <hi>systole</hi> of the arteries or heart made with so much force; but in putrid Fevors, the <hi>systole</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53438:12"/>
                  <hi>diastole</hi> being violent, the blood is transfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed somewhat swifter, than in a healthful state. Here is to be observed by the way, if a swift pulse be perceived to go slower a day before, and the day after to grow swifter, a malignity is to be suspected.</p>
               <p>The third particular worthy of observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, the equality or inequality of the pulse, in reference both to motion and strength. Wherefore in respect hereof a pulse is said to be equal, or inequal in motion, to wit, swiftness and slowness; and in strength, namely fortitude and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. The equality which Authors are wont to apply to a thick and rare pulse, likewise to the tone or musical rithme, we pass by, being rather apt to occasion confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the practising Physician. To une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual in motion are accounted the <hi>dicrotus</hi> or anvile-pulse, <hi>caprisant</hi> or goat-pulse, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedent, and some others.</p>
               <p>A strong pulsifick faculty, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, likewise a temperate mixture of the blood being well depurated from heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous particles, are both some causes of an equal pulsation. On the contrary, blood that's unequally mixt with the vital <hi>Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and several sorts of salts, occasions an unequal pulse, both in respect of motion
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53438:12"/>
and strength. As for other differences, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the force of passion and other procatarctick causes, we refer to another place.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of what is generally to be observed in Urins.</head>
               <p>SInce the Urine for a more certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage must give place to the pulse, we have thought fit to discourse of this after the other.</p>
               <p>Through the abuse of pispot-gazers, and some Physicians, that imprudently pretend to tell wonders, the doctrine of Urines among some is fallen into disgrace; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless since it makes an ample discovery of the diagnosticks and prognosticks of disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, it ought not to be dismembred from the art of Physick. First, we shall set down, what Urine is, afterwards what particulars are to be observed in it. To me the Urine seems, to be a liquor melted from the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til and fixt salts, likewise of some excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious phlegm, dissolved in the <hi>serum</hi> or water of the blood, which being throughly filled
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53438:13"/>
and impregnated with the foresaid contents, through its weight tending downwards, is posted to the kidneys, thence as if it were distilled by descent, it falls down by drops towards the bladder. But that the nature of urine may be made more plain to you, some particulars are to be taken from the constitution of the blood, and proposed here. Those volatil salts I conceive to be the principal efficient of concocting the blood, adding to it a scarlet tincture, sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, homogeneity, and fluidity, in which shape the blood arriving to the pores of the parts, that are to be nourisht, doth desert the salts, which return with the superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood to the veins and lymphatick cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, that afterward disburden themselves into the <hi>emulgents.</hi> That those salts do not only illustrate the blood with a tincture, but likewise the urine, shall be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by sight. You shall find, that spirit of <hi>sal armoniack</hi> scarce differing from <hi>spirit of Urine,</hi> or <hi>spirit of Hartshorn,</hi> or <hi>spirit of Soot,</hi> a drop or two being dropt into whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish, drabbish and undigested urine, shall immediately concoct it into a golden or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinous colour, and an excellent consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. But if you effuse an acid spirit, that's forced out of a fixed salt, you shall see it
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53438:13"/>
turn more drabby, more crude, and of a heavier weight. In the same manner, if you pour some drops of those forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned volatil liquors into a small quantity of blood, though crude and phlegmatick, you will digest it into laudable blood and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it warm and slorid; but upon drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping some <hi>oyl of Vitriol</hi> into it, it turns im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately into a curd, the <hi>serum</hi> or whey is depressed downwards, and assumes a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple red colour. <hi>Spirit of Nitre</hi> doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the redness into a whitish or ash co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, but doth not precipitate the whey, suffering it to swim a top. Upon the further pursuit of the matter, I dropt a drop into a large proportion of blood almost coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whereby almost in a moment the tye of the coagulative particles was dissolved, and indued with a shining lustre, not at all inferiour to the best digested blood. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it only from this external use de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be termed so admirable, but that in a short time, being used inwardly, as I have oft made trial, it hath singularly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested the crude blood of Asthmaticks, Scorbuticks and of worfer habits. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency between thick and thin, signifies a vigour of concoction, chiefly to be ascribed to the volatil salt, living in the vital <hi>Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:53438:14"/>
The causes of the thinness or tenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of urine in those, that are sick of a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, are the scarcity of volatil and sixt salts, not being separated from the torrent float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the great vessels, also the dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the mucilage of the blood, through the heat, or its dissipation through the pores. The thickness of urine is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by the whey or <hi>serum,</hi> imbibing too great a quantity of salt, and thick muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage. Touching the matter of the <hi>hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> or settlement of the urine, there hath hitherto but little certainly been stated among Authors, though most are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it proceeds from the superfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the third concoction. To me the sediment appears to be a mucilage, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imbibed by the <hi>serum,</hi> or whey within the vessels, partly deterged from the slimy substance of the intern tunick of the ureters and bladder, wherewith they are liquor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to prevent their most exquisite sense be not hurt by the urine, that flows by. This mucilage if you examine the Chamber-pot, shall be found to be a glutinous, thick and slippery slime; moreover, that it's dissolva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by heat, and apt to be thickned by cold like phlegm, may be observed in turbid urines, which as long as they continue
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53438:14"/>
warm, after they are made, are clear and perspicuous, but a little after growing cold, are turned into turbid and dark, being deprived of the energy of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of hot volatil salts, that dissolved the slime; for if you do but hold the urinal a moment to the heat of the fire, or hold it in warm water, they will resume their former shape of clearness. Bubbles that oft swim a top the surface, I judge ought not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to a slatuous, but lixivious consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of urine; for ashes, soap and other lixivious things, being dissolved in water, render it subject to turn frothy and bubbly with the least stirring.</p>
               <p>The colour, consistency, and contents are chief universals, whence a Physician may extract, what preternaturals lye hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the body. The colour discovers the active qualities of the salts, the consistency the state of the serum or whey, and the contents the quantity of the foresaid salts and other excrements, that had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their office; a further and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar explication of all these, relating to the kinds of Fevors, shall be reserved to the sequel of the book. Lastly, it is to be noted, that in the contents are included the <hi>enae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orema</hi> and <hi>hypostasis.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Concerning the true and Spurious Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of a Fevor.</head>
               <p>IN the first Chapter we had hinted at the definition of a Fevor; what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns its explication, we have partly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred hither. That a Fevor is a deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive from the nature of fire, is abundantly suggested from its destructive manner of acting, most fierce heat, the tongue and roof of the mouth being crusted with a black smoak, likewise from other sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms thence proceeding, as thirst, dryness and roughness of the skin, and inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of several parts. Here the Reader is to assume, that the vital <hi>Bitumen</hi> of the heart and the whole body, being kindled into a fire, is the disease or Fevor, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the fiery distemper of the heart and the whole body or part, is the disease; but not the preternatural heat, being that's rather to be counted a symptom, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately flowing from the disease, in no wise differing from the manner the heat ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates from the fire. Wherefore the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53438:15"/>
which is extant among Academick Authors, as <hi>Fernelius, Sennertus,</hi> and others, ought justly to be rejected. To wit, <hi>A Fevor is a heat against nature, kindled in the heart, and from thence by means of the spirits and blood, diffused throughout the whole body, and doing hurt to all the natural actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The objections against this definition I offer you in these positions. First, I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, that the essence of a Fevor doth in no wise consist in an universal heat; nor se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the heat, which attends a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, doth not altogether arise from sparks glittering in the heart. The argument that confirms the former, is taken from the <hi>genus</hi> of a Fevor, which is stated a disease; but a disease is said to be the constitution of a part hurt or injured, which kind of say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth not at all agree with a preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat, that depends on the burning fixt <hi>Bitumen</hi> of a part; or oft on miasms or steems, blown from the heart (the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of the fire) to all or most parts of the body; but those torrid miasms are not to be taken for the disease, but causes, that in process of time, through their heat, may occasion a disease. Here may be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a probable objection, that a Fevor
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53438:16"/>
is the kindling or heat of the influent spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of each single or more parts, whose hurt is to be imputed immediately to the heat of the spirits, whence a Fevor may justly be judged a heat. Hereunto must be replied, that the name of a part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can in no wise be given to the spirits, because they flow continually, neither are they in any manner permanent, but are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for the animation and nutrition of the parts, and for that reason their distemper ought not to be taken for a disease; if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the subversion of the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament of a part should flow from a tumult of the influent spirits, and that thence they should be incapable of performing their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, nevertheless because it's a mediate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and to be derived from the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the spirits, it's not to be taken for a disease, but a cause. Secondly, If from the general opinion you have a mind to instance, that the putrid heat of all the parts of the body is a Fevor, to wit a continual putrid one, supposing likewise, that the said heat is risen out of the blood only, being through its means conveyed to the sanguin parts; I answer, it ought not be inferred a disease (since the blood also, because it's a fluent matter, cannot justly deserve the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53438:16"/>
name of a part) but a cause of a disease<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the vehicle of it. Thirdly, The bones, cartilages, and ligaments, are not sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of heat, neither are they subject to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any putrid heat, because in a Fevor they are seldom or never observed to be taken with a putrefaction or rottenness; how can then a Fevor be termed a preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat of all the parts? Likewise, Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Why ought the name of Fevor to be attributed to a fevorish heat more than to a shaking, or fevorish coldness in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a paroxysm of a Fevor, both the former and the later flowing equally as symptoms from a Fevor? Fifthly, An uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal heat is erroneously ascribed to a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, for in a lipyrious Fevor, a torrid heat doth torment the internal parts, though the externals are cold; moreover it oft hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that the hands and feet are stiff of cold, and the entrails do in a manner glow with a burning heat. Furthermore, it may be observed, that a Fevor doth sometimes only haunt one single part, as the foot or hand. Neither have I forgotten a certain Fevor, whose heat extended no further than the head and face. Hereunto add, that those particular Fevors are not only infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to be such, because of the preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53438:17"/>
heat, but also by reason of the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold, shaking and ulcerous lassitude. Sixthly, those that swell so much with the Doctrine of Fermentation, they do not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether affirm, that it is a preternatural heat that constitutes a <hi>Fevor,</hi> since the forementioned heat doth take its rise from a heap of influent spirits, striving to expel humours and such small bodies as are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noying; which heat ought therefore rather to be judged natural, than against nature.</p>
               <p>In the second position we maintain, that the heat, that attends a Fevor, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways kindled in the heart, as if the primar hearth were there, which assertion is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the kinds of symptomatick Fevors; for the Fevor that surprises a wounded pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or one that's detained with an inflamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an entrail, as the Spleen, Liver or Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, certainly it's not first kindled in the heart, but in the part affected, whence after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it's dispersed throughout the whole structure. Secondly, If the heart were the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brand of fevorish heat, the blood that passeth through its ventricles should retain a mark of being burnt, and undergo some change of tincture; when on the contrary, thousands that have been bleeded in Fevors, their blood that was extracted hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53438:17"/>
to the eye to be of a pure scarlet and florid, until the fourth, and oft until the sixth and eighth day.</p>
               <p>In the next paragraph I have thought fit, to please my self with the examination of the vulgar opinion, concerning the common seat of continual putrid Fevors, intimating it to be the blood seething in the vessels, and stained with putrefaction: but how grosly this rabble of Physicians is mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, may be extracted from what shall be proposed: First, If the sprout of a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Fevor were ingraffed on the blood, it would not be so refractory to cure, but consisting of fluid, and moveable elements, by means of alteratives, purgers, diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and emptying the vessels by opening a vein, might in a short time be reduced to its former purity and temperament: moreover, through one nights seething of the blood, nature doth oft expel those thin little bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that float in it, and the grosser it casts forth into pustules, botches and other such tumors. Secondly, I cannot grant, that what is stirred by motion, and continual flowing as the blood is, that it is easily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with putrefaction; for being full of vital spirits, and living heat, it's held in a continual motion. Thirdly, Until the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53438:18"/>
third, fourth, sixth, eighth or tenth day, computing from the beginning of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper, according to the degree of the height of the Fevor, the blood at the first phlebotomy is extracted pure and florid, as I have observed in hundreds; whence it's evident, that the primar matter of putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and the seat thereof, is erroneously placed in the blood, though afterwards passing the entrails, it be stained with a malignant quality, loading it self thence with hot Miasms and Salts. Fourthly, pure phlegm, or veiny gelly, being water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an immoderate quantity of a pale, green, and blew lymph or whey, since it makes two thirds of the blood, in the veins of those, that are troubled with the Dropsie, Green-sickness, and other kinds of diseases, why is not that blood, which is so heterogeneous, and so far remote from a temperature (moisture abounding and the plurality of particles breeding putrefaction) always forced into a fevorish heat? And on the contrary, why are hot and dry tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments, where choler is abounding, constantly so inclinable to putrid Fevors, whereas dryness doth so particularly resist putrefaction? Summarily, the blood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as I have asserted in the premises,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53438:18"/>
since upon no pretence it's to be accounted among the parts of the body, doth utterly exclude it self being capable to be a seat, place or part affected. If peradventure you doubt, that I have hitherto receeded from the path of the received doctrine, stating the heart or other entrail the seat in Fevors, you have the liberty to take it from the fountain, what is to be concluded concerning the matter. <hi>Avicen. fen.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>tract.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 43. dictates thus, <hi>Dicamus quod Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris sanguinis est Febris putredinis, &amp; Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris calefactionis &amp; ebullitionis,</hi> that is, Let us say, that a Fevor of the blood is a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of putrefaction, and a Fevor of heat, and ebullition. Here is to be noted, that the blood is inferred the subject, matter, and seat of a putrid Fevor. Also <hi>Galen. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Cris. cap.</hi> 12. <hi>Manentibus igitur in venis humoribus, continuae ex ipsis Febres generantur,</hi> that is, The humors remaining in the veins, continual Fevors are engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred out of them. Likewise, <hi>Aetius te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trab.</hi> 2. <hi>Serm.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 74. <hi>Putrescentes igi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur humores, aut intra vasa arctati, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuas &amp; nunquam intermittentes usque ad perfectam morbi solutionem Febris efficiunt,</hi> that is, Wherefore humours putrefying, or streightned within the vessels, do cause con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53438:19"/>
Fevors, and never intermitting, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the perfect solution of the disease. Here by the way observe, though according to <hi>Galen,</hi> Fevors are seated in the veins, by their name Arteries are also described, as <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Crisib. cap.</hi> 7. it's by him more largely expressed. <hi>Febres omnes sunt pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siones venarum; itaque in Febribus omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, quoniam venosi sunt generis passiones, nam arterias in hoc genere comprehendimus, ad urinas praecipue attendere oportet:</hi> the English is, All Fevors are passions of the veins; wherefore in all Fevors, because they are passions of the veiny gender, (for we comprehend the arteries also in this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) we ought chiefly to heed the Urins.</p>
               <p>On the other side, they have destined the seat of intermittent Fevors to be without the vessels, as appears here and there by the writings of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Avicen.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing I can scarce apprehend the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of these seats, wherefore I desire to be satisfied in this doubt, whether continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Fevors are said to bud forth in the veins, because the blood, that leaps out upon phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy, doth appear hot to the touch, and shews deep red being mixt with a blew, milky, or yellowish whey? But this blood is not different from any other, that's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53438:19"/>
in an intermittent Fevor, or any other disease. And whether the difference of seats is expounded to be such, because the blood within the vessels, having an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate commerce with the heart, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to foment a strong heat, whereas en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails, that are more remote from the heart, do only by fits profuse those putrid and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorish steems, and under that shape do oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion an intermittent heat? Certainly not. Moreover, the entrails being tyed to the vessels, are not less commodiously situated, by means of these small chanels, that tend directly to the heart, to foment a fevorish heat, than if the cause were engendred within the foresaid vessels: or whether, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the vessels are of a just capacity, wherein they may receive such a quantity of fevorish matter, as may suffice to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish a Fevor without intermission, whereas the entrails are stated to be streight, and not provided with a hollowness to retain matter enough.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, the entrails accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what the thing requires, ought to ingurgitate a larger quantity of matter, which might suffice to protract an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent Fevor, to some months and years, as doth oft happen. But to touch the knot
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53438:20"/>
of the difficulty, the cause of the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, intermission, remission, and intention of Fevors, is not to be imputed so much to the quantity, as the quality of the fevorish matter, as hereafter shall be treated more at large. In the precited definition, the heart is idly stated the part primarily affected; for thence would follow, that the greater part of Fevors should be mortal, because the composure of its temperament being once subverted, is not easily restored. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Suppose an inflammation of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or other entrail, attended with a Fevor, which do you think the part primarily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, the Heart or Liver?</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Concerning the fopperies of Fermentation.</head>
               <p>ALmost every Barber and Plaster-spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er have got the knack, to buzze eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry patient in the ear, the song of fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and know how to fit the tone of it to every disease, but chiefly to a Fevor, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrating the exposition thereof with this commentary, that the blood fermenteth, and the humors are in a fermentation, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53438:20"/>
the ferment of the Heart, Spleen, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and it may be of the Fundament too, if they go not orderly to stool, is deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; moreover, if a Corn of the Toe doth but ake, the distempered ferment is the cause of it. Summarily, fitting the word <hi>ferment</hi> to every disease, cause and sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptom, they conceive the case to be very well handled, and thence tell the Patient, they will expel the disease by correcting the serment, and so, as if they had done their business mighty well, they send the Patient home swelled with hopes. Concerning this abstruse Philosophy, borrowed from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain theorems of the Wine-press, and chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical notions, <hi>Anthonius Guntherus, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baldius Hoghelandius, Felicianus Betera, Conringius, Martinus Kirger,</hi> and others have prosessedly treated, whose Treatises if you peruse, you will find the word <hi>fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> to serve in divers significations; the one in a large sense gives the description of it, not at all different from Peripatetical mixtion, excepting, that this performs its task by qualities, the other by action and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action. But <hi>fermentation</hi> in a narrower signification, as it relates to fluids, is sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an effervescency of any liquor, tending to concoction. At present we will examine,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53438:21"/>
whether a Fevor be a fermentation, or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fervescency of the blood.</p>
               <p>To the resolving of this, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume from what hath been said in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter, that a Fevor, as it is a disease of the body, doth necessarily inhere in a part, as its subject and foundation; but the blood cannot perform the office of a part; therefore neither a Fevor or fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation can be properly attributed to it. Secondly, Neither can the blood ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be probably conceived to be the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent cause of a Fevor, because its fluid mixture is absorbed in a few days, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a Fevor is protracted to some weeks. Suppose a fevorish Patient, to contain four and twenty pints of blood in his vessels, whereof a quarter of a pint is consumed every day by abstinence, and dissipated away through the pores into vapors, and some days a whole pint, or at least three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, are drawn off by phlebotomy; for it's very familiar amongst the <hi>French,</hi> the first and second opening of a vein, to extract a whole pint of blood, and every bleeding afterward (which is commonly every other day) to take away two Porringers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining three ounces a piece: by this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation the whole mass should be drawn
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53438:21"/>
off in two weeks or less, and consequently the <hi>fermentation</hi> must be quieted and stopt, and the Fevor expelled. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if you should extract blood forty times (as I have oft observed in <hi>France</hi> they have done) the height of the heat will not be half a degree abated, but rather aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. Who would then maintain the blood, boiling through fermentation, to be the cause of a Fevor? However this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment is observed to be true, if you take off the third part of any liquor that is a fermenting, whether of Wine, Beer, or any other mixture, it will immediately be taken off from working; but ofttimes the blood is tapt off to the half, and sometimes to the last fourth part, without the least quieting of the fermentation, if I may call it so. Possibly you reply, that according as the vessels are emptied by bleeding, sweating, and other torments, they swell up again by the food and drink, that's dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken. On the contrary, there is a thin Diet ordered to such, as are in a Fevor, neither do most in the whole course of a Fevor, allow their stomach so much, as whereout the sanguifick faculty may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender a pound of blood: add hereunto, that their appetite for fourteen or twenty
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53438:22"/>
days is quite dejected. But you reply, that they take as much food, as answers, what is consumed; to this I return, that the blood, which is daily ingendred, and newly admitted into the vessels, either it's pure, or stained; if the former, then it ought to dilute, and temperate the fermenting mass, which it doth in no manner do; if the later, it is not to be doubted, but that it hath contracted its stain, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocting and depurating entrails; whence follows, that the primar and principal cause is not to be attributed to the blood, but the entrails. Thirdly, It's confirmed by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that <hi>fermentation</hi> doth happen to any mixt liquor, and soft compositions, as paste or dow, electuaries, and others, which is observed to be a mild working of the sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous and volatil-salin particles, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a temperate heat, that attenuates, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pands, and dissolves the whole essence, and separates the suliginous-salin parts from the homogeneous ones, by subliming them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a sharp salin scum; the tartarous and fixt salin particles it precipitates into a mucid and slimy mud. This being obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be the signification of <hi>fermentation,</hi> according to the true intent and meaning of those, that imposed it on things, that were
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53438:22"/>
to be fermented, it seemed indeed a very simple and idle assertion, that whilst the blood doth seeth, boyl, hiss, and burn the hand of him that toucheth it, and occasion a black and sharp steem, being an effect of fire, on the mouth and tongue, that all this should depend on a <hi>fermentation,</hi> and mild heat of the blood. Doth not <hi>fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> always tend to concoction, but a Fevor oft to corruption and death; and that one and the same word shall signifie two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, is it not an absurdity? To express alteration, mixtion, generation, corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, calefaction, and what not, by the word fermentation, (a word wondrous pregnant) is to set limits to all physical re-searches and inquiries. Neither do they detract less from the art of Physick, who assert a vitiated ferment the cause of a Dropsie, Phthisick, Pleurisie, and of the whole train of disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; on the correcting whereof (to wit the serment) every old Wife and Barber-surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall say the stress of the cure doth lie: and is it not then lawful, for this Tribe to vye with fermentitious Physicians, yes and exceed them? How formally and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly at this rate is the disease, cause and cure, proposed by every Glisterpipe? What is it at last come to? What necessity is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53438:23"/>
there, to apply ones study to Anatomy, Botanicks, Physiology, Pathology, and a thousand other things? O wonderful Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces! You will notwithstanding by the way admire, if this notion of <hi>fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> be only assumed as a <hi>phaenomenon</hi> or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position (for the thing it self is not yet agreed on) by those that are something higher advanced in Learning, to shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves more dextrous in illustrating the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, extracting of indications, and in the method of curing, yet it is not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that they ship off a greater troop of sick in <hi>Charons</hi> Boat, and deserve a greater fraight than the putrid Physicians.</p>
               <p>But to the business, let us now be at leasure, to examine the manner and method, that <hi>Fermenters</hi> undertake the cure of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual and intermittent putrid Fevors, what indications they answer unto, and wherein they receed from putrid Physicians. The <hi>Indicantia,</hi> and <hi>Indicata,</hi> ought to be ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in this order. The blood too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, or too little moved by <hi>fermentation,</hi> and a vitiated ferment, are the chief <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantia;</hi> those things that promote, or quicken the too slack <hi>fermentation,</hi> and temperate it, when too violent, and reduce the ferment, when receeded from its tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53438:23"/>
are the <hi>Remedies Indicated.</hi> The vital faculty languishing, and deprived of its spirits, doth indicate a cordial and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storative medicine. The animal faculty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken, through want of many nights rest, must be relieved with <hi>Opiats.</hi> The Belly if forgetful of its office, must be row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up with a stimulating suppository, or laxative glyster: neither are the urgent symptoms of a two swelling fermentation, to be neglected. A Phrensie that proceeds from sulphurous steems, fuming up from the fermenting mass, must be allayed by means that revell or draw back from the Brain. Astringent medicines bridle a loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and enormous vomiting. Thus far in general, concerning <hi>indications,</hi> taken from their theorems; nevertheless these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waved, the <hi>Fermenters</hi> do follow the method of cure of the putrid Physicians; in posting away their Patients, to the place of their fore-fathers, as shall be recited immediately. That it may be physically illustrated, we ought to premise their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, being fitted to a particular sick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; whose age, sexe, temperament, former custom of living, season of the year, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of their Pulse, state of Urine, urgent sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, occasional and procatarctick causes,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53438:24"/>
and manner of the first assault of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, what symptoms attended, what sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms arrived afterwards, manner of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the habit of the Hypochonders, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and Belly; the manner of the look of the sick man, his manner of speech, what habit of body, what usual evacuations are suppressed; whether the Fevor be essential or symptomatick; whether first come, or a relapse; what disease he was troubled with last, what remedies were applied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Physicians coming, and many other particulars, that are to be distinctly propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, all which I say ought to be represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the serious meditation of any Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, that is to undertake the cure of a Fevor. But they receed so far from these necessary animadversions, that being sent for to a Patient, having only felt his Pulse, they look upon the Urine, and make some little inquiry concerning the state of his Belly, whether loose or costive, neglecting all other necessary informations, and apply themselves immediately to prescribing; and their first business is, to put the Belly in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which they endeavour by this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing form of a glyster; but I am to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize you before, concerning the custom, that young Physicians, that are newly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53438:24"/>
come from the University, diligently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to the Apothecaries shops, for to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themselves with the forms and receits of the Elder Physicians, and being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, it happens thence, that every Physician is furnished with the same examples or forms of remedies, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the one go an inch from the road of theo ther. Wherefore I shall collect you the most received forms, throughout the whole course, for to remove a fevor, compiled by our modern ones; afterwards how successfully our age makes use of them, I shall particularly observe. The prescipti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a glyster according as it's commonly found in the Shops, is this.</p>

               <p>Some there are, that instead of common Salt put in Salt-peter, or <hi>Sal-prunellae,</hi> from half a dram to a dram: which for its
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53438:25"/>
detergent and cooling quality, is far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the other; and indeed <hi>Crystal mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> being added to any sort of glysters, is far more beneficial, because it agreeth so very well with the temperament of the Guts; on the contrary, Sea-salt being of a drying, inflaming, and irritating faculty, is very offensive to the Guts: For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the Antients made use of it as well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, in Pills, thick Syrups, Glysters; as outwardly in Oyntments. Some among the <hi>Fermenters</hi> do extreamly oppose the giving of purges, or laxative glysters in Fevors, because they provoke the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted excrementitious humours to ferment, whose steems piercing into the vessels, do disturb, and augment the <hi>fermentation</hi> of the Fevor. On the other side the putrid Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians make this reply to them, that gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters doing their work quick, and without the Vessels, cannot transmit the least breath of heat, nor blow up any steems, the valve of the <hi>Colon</hi> putting a stop to their passage. Lastly, That it is a ready means to cleanse the body, without weakning or fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the humours corrupted without the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, which otherwise in process of time, might largely contribute to the malignant matter within the Veins; for it is the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53438:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
judgement of many, that some Fevors, which at the beginning were only hurtful through their putrefaction, are changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to malignant and mortal, by reason the putrid drabby settlement, which lay hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the folds and coats of the guts, is regurgitated into the vessels, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore purging glysters once or twice repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ought to be necessarily put into use: afterward they cause a glyster of milk and sugar, to be administred once every day, to soften, deterge, revell, cool, and evacuate. There are those (but are scarce in their wits) that maintain, the foresaid glyster ought to be made out of crude milk, and to be applied cold, conceiving that by boyling, the volatil energetick particles might otherwise be evaporated into the air. But they are unmindful, how hurtful things are to the membranous parts, and the guts, that are actually cold, and that they repel those putrid vapours, that steem out of the hidden places of the mesentery, and guts, to the heart, and the brain. Others are of opinion, one third or half the proportion of water ought to be poured to the boyling milk; afterward putting su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar to it, they administer it warm. Others only simply order milk boyled, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53438:26"/>
with sugar, from half a pint to a pint.</p>
               <p>The lower region of the body being thus cleansed, two, four, or six hours after, bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to be celebrated in the right arm, which <hi>Fermenters</hi> do sharply oppose, because it doth exhaust the spirits and matter of life, which failing, the <hi>fermentation</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction are thereby much disturbed, and the heterogeneous particles getting the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand, is a presage of an unlucky <hi>crisis.</hi> However the greater number of this Sect do not think it safe, to vary from putrid Physicians in this matter, because almost all Fevors are too exorbitant in <hi>fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and the spirits oppressed by heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous particles, the heat being too much heightned, the skin being constipated, and lockt up through the soot of the pores, all which evils bleeding doth very much abate. These reasons swaying with the prudent, they command a vein should be open'd twice, thrice, or four times, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the degree of plethory; others tap off the blood every third day, some every other day, until together with the soul they have drawn out the whole.</p>
               <p>In the next place they are to bend their force against the matter, fermenting too fiercely, by giving Cordials and Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53438:26"/>
In this particular the <hi>Fermenters</hi> and the <hi>putrid Physicians</hi> are differing, the later relieving the impared vital faculty only with cold cordials, as shall be made known to you in another place. The forms of sudorifick Cordials, as they are hung on the Apothecaries files, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they have been prescribed by the more famous sort of Physicians, shall now be put down.</p>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53438:27"/>
which they say, doth enrage the <hi>fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> though according to the judgement of others, Vinegar doth qualifie the <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,</hi> and coagulate the fermentative particles; moreover, it's adstringent, shuts the pores of the body, and stops all eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations, for which reasons the use of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar is very much suspected by them; therefore instead of the <hi>Aqua Theriacalis,</hi> they allow to the prescription double the measure of <hi>Aqua Epidemica,</hi> the descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof is made publick in a small Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of the Colledge of <hi>London,</hi> Printed a good while since; but because the Copies are most dispersed, I shall think it no trouble to set down its description here.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:53438:27"/>In Childrens Fevors, <hi>Aqua scordii com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posita</hi> is preferred before <hi>Aqua Theriaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> or <hi>Aqua Epidemica,</hi> because it is less hot, and consequently less hurtful. Let us halt a while here, to examine, whether the Vinegar being an ingredient in Treacle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, doth suppress the <hi>fermentation</hi> of a Fevor in the vessels. To those that have but had the least tast of the Chymical art, it doth appear very plain, that fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth arise from a strife there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the acid, and alcalized, or lixivious salin particles, which in properties are so contrary to each other, that through the deficiency or failing of either of them, the action of <hi>fermentation</hi> is immediately cut off; the same likewise happens, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth exceed the other in its just pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of strength, through which they fall on each other. It is held for a certain truth, that in a burning Fevor the blood is full of lixivious and alcalized salts, wherefore, by giving of a medicine, that is vitriolate, diluted with Vinegar, it doth necessarily happen, through natures ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way of working, that the <hi>fermentation</hi> (if any such thing may be granted) is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in its fury, through the vigor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the annoying corpuscles are separated
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53438:28"/>
from the mass, and expelled thence, whereby at last it is perfectly depurated, and defecated. Moreover that we may lay the case whole open; if the concoction in the stomach be performed by <hi>fermentation</hi> (as it's every where declared by it's Assertors) take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that sauces, whereinto Vinegar is poured, (especially if impregnated with the infusion of Capers, Broom-buds, or other raw sour things) do set a very sharp edge to it; for as soon as they are ingested, we are troubled with a glowing heat about the Stomach, and Hypochonders, also about the face, and top of the head. Secondly, Treacle-water being tempered with Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, doth become thence more penetrating, and more vigorous in its vertue, whereby insinuating readily into the most inward and central parts of the body, it performs the work of an antifebril medicine. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Since this Treacle mixture is unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly composed of many things, that are very hot and sharp, as several spices, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterwort,</hi> and some impure Sulphurs, and others, Vinegar doth very much blunt the edge of them, and freeth those Sulphurs, not only of their stink, but impure recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Whereby it's apparent, how great an error they are in, that under that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53438:28"/>
of quieting the <hi>fermentation,</hi> rail against Treacle-water, and <hi>Aqua Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theriacalis,</hi> because of the acid ingredients. But setting aside these discourses, though I do not contemn Treacle-water for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons newly quoted, yet for other causes I look upon it as a medicine of no effect and vertue; for the liquor that's distilled off, from the matter digested in the body of the Still, doth appear to be nothing, but a phlegm impregnated with a small proportion of the vertues of the ingredients, and those obtused too by acids. Secondly, Acids in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the salin parts of the ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents it hath attracted, being thence ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more ponderous, do not pass the helm or alembick, but remain in the bottom; so that the <hi>Fermenters</hi> need not to be stomacht so much at the hurt of these acids, since they are left behind at the bottom. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those with whom this reason doth take place, make use of Vinegar impregnated only with the vertues of Alexipharms against pestilent and malignant Fevors, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aside the destilling of it, they hold it to be strongest by digestion and filtration, by means whereof the faculties of both are preserved intire. Likewise those that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to extract the volatil salts of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreticks,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53438:29"/>
and Alexipharmacals, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillation, having ordered their infusion in spirit of wine, they destil off the liquor, by all means avoiding the pouring any acids to it; hereof there is an example in the <hi>Aqua Theriacalis</hi> in the <hi>Augustan</hi> Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satory, and in that Treacle-water, which is ascribed to <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura è tribus in peracutis.</hi> According to this way of reasoning, it is inserred, that the <hi>Aqua Scordii composita</hi> described in the <hi>London</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensatory, is much weakned in its vertue, because the acid juices of Sorrel and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, not mounting up to the Helm or Alembick, detain the vertues of the other ingredients within them; though notwithstanding many railing at Treacle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, because of the Vinegar, make a great noise of the praises of <hi>Aqua Scordii,</hi> as being composed of Acids, that are not restringent. These I would have to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, out of solution of the Problem, to wit, whether Vinegar, as it is added to Treacle-Water, be restringent; certainly not; for in time its restrictive faculty doth languish away, by being united with the alcalized and volatil salts of the rest of the ingredients, until at length the nature of Vinegar being quite buried, the medicine
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53438:29"/>
groweth <hi>ecphractick</hi> or opening, in the same manner, as Oyl of Vitriol exceeding all others in restriction, and being obtused by the <hi>Alcali</hi> of Salt of Tartar, is now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to be a very great opener. Secondly, That astringents are very active (but it is <hi>per accidens</hi>) in removing the obstructions of bodies, especially of such, as are inclined to Fevors, is made evident by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, being confirmed by all mens judgements; Salt of Steel bred out of the stem of Oyl of Vitriol, is not at all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from vitriol it self, since it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly known, that the foresaid salt is oyl of vitriol, coagulated through the hungry matter of Iron, and reduced to its old form and body of Vitriol, but advanced to a higher degree of purity; for Iron growing out of Vitriol, condensed by being separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from its mercurial part, now its late mercurial part, namely Oyl of Vitriol, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned to it again, is as it were through a new birth reduced to its primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body of Vitriol; but its impure recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are rejected. So that hence, though the Salt of Steel is made visibly to be a most special medicine for astriction, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless it is prefer'd for a most potent medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to remove the obstructions of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53438:30"/>
Spleen, Liver and Womb. This effect it very successfully performs, by causing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and effervescency in the vessels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the acid and fiery salin parts of the humors, whereby the blood coagulated in the veins is at length dissolved, and that which is thick, is attenuated. Steel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Vinegar (whereby its vitriolate astringent vertue is increased) is esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed famous against obstructions by all Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians. Hence you may learn, that all chalybeate and purely vitriolate medicines are <hi>per se</hi> restringent and stopping, but <hi>per accidens</hi> they dissolve and open; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to be used with a great deal of caution by Dogmatick-spagirical Physicians, according as it is illustrated in this following relation. A fermentitious Physician of no mean rank, having given <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> three times to one, that was troubled with a bilious <hi>diarrhoea,</hi> or loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and though he had before prescribed him two infusions of <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> and <hi>Miro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:53438:30"/>Now it's time, to look back to the place, whence I digressed.

               <p>All this advice being followed to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and the fate of the sick patient drawing near, Physicians fly to the so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiously cried up <hi>spirit of hartshorn,</hi> as it were to their sacred anchor, giving hereof eight or twelve drops, twice or thrice a day, in a spoonful of cordial Julep; neither doth much time pass, before Phoenigms and Epispastick Emplasters, in testimony of the last unction, are applied to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the arm, a little above the wrists, likewise on the inside of the legs, a little above the ancle, and oft near the arm-pits, and now and then to the nape of the neck. The task they are designed to perform, is to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53438:33"/>
drive out the malignant and venemous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, under the shape of an <hi>ichor,</hi> or sharp water, into large bladders, from the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est parts, to the outward skin, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perforated, <hi>Melilot</hi> plaisters are to be applied, to dry up the moisture. At last they are to bid the Patient his last farewel, by tying live Pigeons, cut through the middle, to the soles of his feet, or pickled Herrings, or sharp Leven, Spurge, Crowfoot root, wild Pellitory, Mustard-seed, black Soap, or brown Salt, one of them, or all, beat together, and so the sick man is left to the disposition of the Stars, in which case some, though very few, after they have lain some hours speechless and senseless, under the shadow of death, they have been raised and awakened by degrees, nature exerting its drowsie strength; others dye with Convulsions, or in a fainting fit.</p>
               <p>Modern Practicers do not much matter, what drink their fevorish Patients are to quench their drought with, some bold Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians allowing them strong beer, others small beer with a tost in it, or the cold and rawness being taken away by warming of it. Some give their Patients thin wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grewel to drink, others the decoction of the shavings of Hartshorn, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53438:34"/>
burnt, or both together. Some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the decoction of French barly. Juleps tempered with acids, <hi>sal prunellae,</hi> and cooling syrrups, are among most grown out of use because of the acids, which they suspect for the causes newly alledged.</p>
               <p>If you require of me what animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions I make on the premised practice, I should not frustrate you expectation (though elsewhere, excusing the slenderness of my judgement, I shall use my indeavors in it) were it not, that the <hi>Belgick-German</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice (for there is scarce any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Practitioners, excepting that the later are more liberal in bleeding, and the former do much use cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain antifebril powders) and the <hi>French</hi> method could so conveniently be subjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here.</p>

               <p>THat the practice of <hi>Fermentators</hi> is to be abominated, and that it is kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, who can deny? Since among a great company of fevorish Patients, the greater part whereof are probably strong, young, well slesht-men, not being swelled or retcht in their Hypochonders or Belly, yet scarce the third man recovers his former state of health. What must be inferred from hence, when in the rage of a Fevor, though the Physician be sent for at the first mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of the Disease, and that the strength of nature is more than proportioned to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the Fevor, nevertheless the poor wretch dieth? yes, let all things be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred according to the most received rules of Physick, let the highest cordial be given, also <hi>Extractum Cardiacum, Pearl, Bezoar</hi> and the <hi>spirits of Hartshorn</hi> it self, yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry oft to no purpose, and the Fevors will triumph until the hour of death? But if
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53438:37"/>
in favour of the <hi>Fermentators</hi> it be instanced, that before our <hi>Aesculapius</hi> came to the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the sick man, the flame was kindled to the top, and that the <hi>Fevor</hi> had taken deep rooting, that the malignity of the disease had trodden down the principal or commanding faculties, the cause of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal day is not to be imputed to the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, nor to his remedies, but to the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant distemper, too much inraged by too long a stay. Hereunto I reply, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that the Physitian was at hand, at the very glimpse of the first spark of the Fevor (which possibly then was of no such ill aspect) as I hinted just now, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the case will run to ruine. But on the other hand, if any one that liveth in the Country, be he a Country man, or come from the City, be taken with a Fevor, and the care be committed to an old wife, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately shegives him a certain posset, that is throughly savoured with Carduus or Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and puts him to bed, covering him well with clothes until he fall into a dew sweat; this being once or twice repeated, she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the rest to nature, wherein she proves so lucky, that out of ten nine, if not all, for the most part get the better of their distemper. Moreover the Divine old man scarce ever gave greater relief to any in a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53438:38"/>
Fevor, than by doing nothing, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the whole business to nature, and therefore he oft urgeth that nature be not interrupted in <hi>concoction. Aphor.</hi> 22. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <gap reason="foreign">

It were better, if they cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scover the adequate remedy, to follow <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi> document, <hi>sen.</hi> 4. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Cum ignoraveris agritudinem, relinque eam na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae, quia aut curabit eam, aut manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stabit eam,</hi> that is, when you do not know the disease, leave it to nature, because ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she will cure it, or discover it. Also they would contribute far greater advantage to the ease of the sick, by expecting with <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the <hi>crisis,</hi> than by a thousand tricks to circumvent nature; for if they can do no good, let them do no harm at least. But now it is, I am at leisure, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to set down the order of this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy practice. Those that reject glysters in the beginning of a Fevor, because they should not blunt the edge of the ferment too much, do not at all perform their duty in the right administring of things, since the rubbish of the body that is lodged about the turnings and windings of the guts, and the hidden places of the mesentery, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53438:38"/>
expelled, doth either by profusing steems into the vessels, very remarkably increase the heat, or by putrid particles creeping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the blood, is apt to kindle the Fevor. This rubbish because it is incapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concocted, and is lodged without the vessels, does easily yield to a gentle laxative potion, or purging glyster, without any fear of increasing the heat. But since peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple here are such immoderate devourers of flesh, that the belly being the sink of the whole body, must needs abound with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did excrements, is not a laxative purge, or Cathartick glyster very necessary? But it must be given in the first preceding days, or afterwards the greatest part of that filth and dirt is carried away into the vessels, by the rapid torrent of the blood, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all purging is to be set aside; for hereby nature would else be drawn from its work, with a great disturbance, and that without the least benefit.

Secondly, all bodies that are inclinable to Fevors, or are fevorish, are for the most part in the beginning oppressed with a <hi>Plethora ad vires,</hi> or a fulness of the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, more than their strength can bear, whereby the spirits are pincht, and through too great a condensation grow vehemently hot, the circulation grows slug and dull, and is carried in a disorderly motion, and the pores are stopt; how urgent is the case then, that some blood be taken away im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately? thence the spirits will be able to bestir themselves, the motion of the blood from irregular will become regular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the passages of the skin will be more free, and the heat will be moderated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But since it is not seldom, that a Fevor being subdued by the first bleeding, though not to an absolute extinction of the fiery heat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the sparks raising the flame again, the blood doth swell up a new, and run vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently up and down, reason doth like

                  </gap> be deple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht the second time, that we may arrive to the same effects. But those that indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to venture the opening of a vein e third time, do unpunisht make a playgame of a mans blood; for there is not so great a benefit reaped this third bleeding, as there was by the two former, as I have found by a thousand trials, but the spirits and forces of the sick are barbarously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, by taking away their due food and nourishment, and quite ruining their base and foundation; for they inhere in the blood, as their foundation, and subject, and from it they draw life. Moreover, neither is the blood then so turgid and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous, because besides the former sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction of blood, the parts of the whole mass are attenuated, melted and dispersed through a great many little caverns and holes, that before were filled. Likewise there is now a close engagement between the vital spirits and the febril corpuscles (what these are shall be told you hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) so that if either you disturb the spirits, or exhaust and lessen them by bleeding, the fevorish miasms must necessarily get the victory, and produce death for their trophy. Thousands are killed by the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53438:40"/>
slaughter of the lancet. That you may understand the case more plainly, I will il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate it to you by an example of one, that lieth sick of a malignant Fevor, whom should you bleed but a second time, or sometimes but once, you would certainly bring his life into danger, for neither Pulse or Urin do signifie any great heat, that should be the cause of the swelling of the blood, neither are the pores stopt by an abundance of soot; wherefore there must by no means any blood be taken away, because it doth in no kind of manner, nor through its abundance, annoy the spirits; If however against reason blood should be extracted, the spirits will be so much wasted, that they will be rendred too weak for the encounter. Secondly, since the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels by opening of a vein, are so swiftly deplenisht, the malignant matter, that stagnates in the capillar vessels, or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, lieth hidden in remote holes and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret places, is thereby most impetuously drawn into the great vessels, that lead to the principal parts, where joyning with particles of their own nature, do with a joint force fall upon the strong holds of life: certainly this is a most clear demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration. We must here unty the knots of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53438:40"/>
two particulars, that were asserted above. The first is the manner of computing the bleedings, whence the first is to be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whence the second and third. The other is, why there are but justly two bleedings set down. At the first assault of symptoms, that are derived from the spring of a Fevor, that is not intermittent (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> here and there calls it, by which name are meant both continual and continent Fevors) the same day there ought some blood be taken away out of the right arm, to quiet and suppress the febril matter, that it may not be mixt with the mass, flowing through the great vessels, nor fiercely fall upon the spirits; for as much as this should happen, so much the quantity of the blood, that is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, ought to be moderated. Moreover, the measure of blood that is to be drawn away, is to be taken from the degree of the swelling of the blood; for if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>intumescence</hi> or swelling be at the degree of eight, and if unto this degree doth answer the taking away of ten ounces of blood, then if the <hi>intumescence</hi> be at the degree of four, the substraction of five or six ounces will be proportionable to allay it; and according to this manner you must
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53438:41"/>
make your computation in the others. But where the <hi>Orgasmus,</hi> or turgid working of the febril matter is appeased, and its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant faculty suppressed, you may safely next day or two days after, by a cathartick potion expel the matter of a Fevor, that is imprisoned in hidden places without the vessels, and in the capillar vessels. In the same manner is a malignant Fevor to be dealt withal at the first assault, though otherwise it would certainly tend to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of life, yet by so managing your affairs, the sick man will be released. There ought a laxative or at least an emollient gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to be administred before the bleeding. Fevorish patients are oft in the beginning tortured with a violent shaking, extream vomiting, and frequent fainting, in this case six or eight ounces of blood being extracted out of the veins the same day, the swelling of the blood, the plethory of the vessels, and the violent working of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bril matter have been quite suppressed. But possibly one may reply, that if the blood should be preyed upon, on every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the foresaid accidents, it would be oft lookt upon as a very careless and needless piece of work, when ofttimes those symptoms do of their own accord (the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53438:41"/>
blood being appeased) vanish away in six or eight hours, as useth to happen in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent Tertians, and some other kind of Fevors. I answer, that in such a case, the overweight of blood is never lightned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great benefit, by opening of a vein, since the forementioned symptoms do issue from a plethory, and a hot burning matter; and granting that the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent working doth settle of its own accord, it will return again upon the least occasion; wherefore to relieve nature, there must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily some part of the burden be taken off. Secondly, the nature of an <hi>Orgasmus,</hi> or violent working is well known almost to every experienced Physitian, whether it appears to be superficial and moveable, or permanent; and thence may easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude about the necessity of bleeding.</p>
               <p>But since it often happens, that sick peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do not advise with a Physitian before the second, third, and fourth day, or afterwards, there first ought to be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whether the same, or a greater, or a lesser quantity of blood should be extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than if a Physitian had had the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, at the first assault, to have given his advice. Secondly, whether nevertheless a Physitian coming the third or fourth day,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53438:42"/>
that substraction of blood ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the first, and whether the fifth, sixth, or eight morning after, the opening of a vein ought to be repeated: First there must be considered the degree of concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the ebb of the blood, occasioned by fasting or thinness of diet, must be taken notice of, before any thing can be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded on. Wherefore take it only for a supposition, if hereafter you are not convinced of the absolute truth thereof, that nature is imployed thirteen dayes, and sometimes fifteen days, in concocting the matter of acute Fevors, and afterwards doth endeavour to separate and expel it the fourteenth or sixteenth day, according to the course of the Moon, wherefore (<hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

in fourteen days) the <hi>crisis</hi> of acute Fevors are wont to happen. Now since the night before the <hi>crisis</hi> all things are very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, it must be, that nature is at that time most busied, and is at the highest point of concoction, which namely is the thirteenth day or night, immediately preceeding the fourteenth day, being the day of the <hi>crisis,</hi> on which, namely the fourteenth day as I hinted now, nature doth gradually sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and expel the concocted febril mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by stool, vomit, through the pores of the skin, or hemorrhage, but most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by urine, in the shape of a white and heavy sediment, if the concoction be perfect, or reddish if imperfect. Here is to be noted, that <hi>crises</hi> which happen to bodies in hot and thin climates, and whose blood floating in the vessels, is very thin, and the veins free from obstructions, are very rapid, and swift, expelling the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted matter by stool, or through the pores of the skin, all at once as it were, and with a violence: but those that lie sick in a northern climate, because their blood being thick, muddy and ropy, doth in all parts promote obstructions, and their skin is hard and thick, and the faculty of their guts is dull; for the most part they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53438:43"/>
are freed by having the febril matter gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually sent down to the Kidneys and Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. In the mean time it's not to be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that the word <hi>Crisis</hi> by its first im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position doth denote a sudden change with disturbance, either to life or death; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though I said above, that the matter was by a <hi>crisis</hi> gradually expelled, it is to be understood, in respect of a more rapid <hi>crisis</hi> that's proper to hotter countries; and in respect of the lingring solution of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, by translation of the matter, it doth just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly merit the name of a <hi>Crisis;</hi> for the whole matter is expelled in four or five days, more or less. This by the way. If then the thirteenth day be the top of the concoction, and that the symptoms are gradually intended from the minute of the <hi>augment</hi> or increase, which usually happens to be in true acute Fevors, about the fifth, or seventh day, according to the variation of the Moon, it will not be safe to open a vein past the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, because then the spirits are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to concoct, and the swelling of the blood is suppressed by fasting (if bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not premised) and thinness of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et; what is it then you will exhaust the veins for? If notwithstanding in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of an acute Fevor, (which is defined
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53438:43"/>
to be the first four or six days, because du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that time the first appearance of sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms is scarce altered) the fevorish Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient hath beyond reason and necessity gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified his stomach and appetite, and that thence the turgency of the blood hath been fed, it may be convenient to take away some blood, though it be the eight day; so that those things are to be defined, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the swelling of the blood, and the decrease thereof by a thin diet; for if so much be consumed by a thin diet in the beginning, or the first four or six days, as is proportionable to once bleeding, it will be advantageous to bleed once besides with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the seventh day; but those things are to be left to the judgement of every expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Physitian: yet let him not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful, that bleeding and purging are by <hi>Galen</hi> stated great remedies, on the use whereof life and death doth depend; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the former to be less suspected than the latter, wherefore that <hi>Aphorism</hi> 29. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. that was so prudently dictated, doth relate to both, <hi>viz.</hi>

to all diseases, and to Fevors. What need is there of words? we have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly made the case known by reasons, authorities, and experiments, whence it's evident, how barbarously they act to the ruine of those sick people, that are troubled with a continual putrid, and malignant Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, by taking blood away from them about the middle and end of the Augment and State. It is a great truth I shall say, that at the beginning it is life, in the middle and end of the Augment and State it is death.</p>
               <p>Against what hath been said an argument might be here taken from what the great master of Physick doth command, <hi>Aphor.</hi> 8. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>viz. Quando morbus constiterit in suo vigore, tunc victu tenuissimo utendum;</hi> that is, when the disease is in its vigour, then you are to use a very thin diet; that the mass of blood may not increase so much as to exceed the power of natures government; wherefore for the same reason one may take away blood in the vigor, that it may not too much oppress and burden the spirits. The objection is easily refuted; a very thin diet is commended, that the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits may not be drawn from the concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whilst they are busied in subduing the Febril matter; but not because of the too
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53438:45"/>
great increase of blood, since the mouths of the vessels lye almost flat, and there is rather a greater proportion of it required, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thence a greater quantity of spirits.</p>
               <p>It is not difficult, to extract from the premises a reason for two bleedings in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Fevors, since it's to be celebrated in the commencement of the Disease, or the beginning of the augment, though ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry seldom; for if it be performed as oft as possible at the time of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, namely in the space of four or six dayes, you ought not to open a vein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the second time; for there ought to be at least two days between each bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to recover strength; whence it's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent there is scarce occasion left for a third, unless thereby you intend to annoy nature in the augment, and to cut off from her strength. But if a Fevor be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with malignity, bleeding ought not to be attempted or repeated without a great deal of caution.</p>
               <p>What ought to be done in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Fevor hath been hitherto discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. At present, we must take into consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration the cure of the augment or increase of a Fevor. First of all we must be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, whether at the time of the growing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53438:46"/>
of the Fevor the fermentation is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted. Physitians here are blinded in a mist, being utterly ignorant of the stages of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, they follow a heedless and impious practice, daily tainting their hands with the death of their Patients; what compass do they steer by, to arrive at the exact mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of opening a vein, or giving a purge? what mark do they aim at, when they force pouders and cordials on their Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents? and if there should a faculty of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing continual putrid and malignant Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors be allowed them, being ignorant of the manner and punctual time of giving them, they are capable of doing as much mischief with them, as a mad Barber with a Rasor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> being perswaded by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, (which is to be rightly noted) doth take the beginning of his Aphorisms from an observation to be minded above all others in the art of Physick. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53438:46"/>
and occasion is of great moment; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in acute diseases; for the same medicine in respect of time doth both kill and cure. That a Fevor doth make as it were four stages, vulgar observation tells us. It pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the first whilst the fevorish matter li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hidden about the subservient entrails, the Stomach, <hi>Pancreas,</hi> Lungs, the Gall-Bladder, Glandules of the Mesentery, one or all of them, thence vomiting up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the blood certain tumultuous miasms, that force it into a heat. As soon as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said matter is thronged out of its lurking places, and forcibly rushed into the great vessels, the symptoms thereupon raging in heat do forthwith shew a countenance of the augment or increase. And when the whole mine of febril matter is quite float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the channel of blood, then the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or vigour is near at hand. At that time, there is a close ingagement with the febril enemy, and its force being broke, Nature by her victorious arms doth expel those rebellious intestine corpuscles and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated humours into several sinks of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; the disease in this manner declining, the sick man doth arrive safe and well. This expedition doth contain some particulars very worthy of note. 1. At the first of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53438:47"/>
the ingagement, nature doth encounter with the Fevor at a distance, some steems being only scattered abroad before, the gross of the preternatural matter lodging in the deep places without the vessels, nor at all mixt with the torrent of blood. 2. The Fevor increasing, the lesser part of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is confused with the blood that flows by, but the greater part doth as yet remain still and quiet in the spring. 3. At the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, all preternatural bodies are closely intermixt and confused with the natural. From hence doth shine a light, whereby the bottom of the difficulty wound up in the foregoing discourse may be plainly known and discovered. Wherefore since fermentation doth tend to the same end concoction doth, namely of subduing the heterogeneous quality of the adventitious minims that are got into the blood; and that whilst the disease is yet in the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, only part of the Febril matter is crept into the blood, and not throughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated into the depth of the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed scarlet juice: it will prove a help no ways deceitful, if the sick man doth take a <hi>Diaphoretick</hi> draught, well impregnated with volatil salts, whereby he may be put into a smart sweat; certainly a very proper means,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53438:47"/>
through which the vital power may free it self from those hurtful corpuscles; since as yet the spirits are numerous and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and are not so much ingaged by the intestine enemy; whence consequently they have still a power of expelling; the fumes and soot have not yet filled up the passages of the body, nor pores of the skin, being left open for natures cutaneous evaporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; a part only of the Febril matter is here and there loosly intermixt with the blood, and may easily be forced out thence. From all which it doth plainly appear, and is inferred that fermentation (fie upon the abuse of the word) is in this case to be rendred easie; the liquor of the veins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby attenuated, occasion is given to the spirits to fly together to make an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted force to grind off the sting of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bril matter, and thereupon to expel it. But though the fermentation is to be rendred easie, it is by no means to be increased and intended, for that would put the Bitumen of the blood into too high a flame, and through the crackling and vibration of the salts would occasion a very dangerous storm in the blood. Of this nature are almost all the remedies that are proposed by the <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters;</hi> namely <hi>Aqua Epidemica,</hi> Spirits
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53438:48"/>
of Hartshorn, and all the other fiery cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials, as shall hereafter be resolved more at large. Neither do I esteem those rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons I have now produced so much, but that the many experiences whereby I have delivered some hundreds after the manner aforesaid of their continual Fevors without suffering them to come to the height, do more clearly discover the matter.</p>
               <p>According to the mark spoken of before let us enquire, what harbour this Rhomb of giving hot cordials by spoonfuls will bring them to; undoubtedly if the Fevor be any thing outragious, there is danger of shipwrack. For things that are taken by spoonfuls contribute matter to the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fire, increase the matter of the soot, and really stop the pores; moreover, do not concoct the least part of the febril matter, neither do they separate or expel it being concocted. Wherefore if a Fevor is of its own accord carried on to the height without doing any thing, and the febril matter be more closely and intimately knitted with the blood and spirits, and the whole mine be disturbed, and profused in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the great vessels, certainly in doing ill, they must speed much worse. What they have acted in the increment, hath just now
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53438:48"/>
been shewed; at present pray give your judgement; are your toothless wifes in the country more dextrous in curing a Fevor, or <hi>Fermentitious</hi> Physitians? Neither are the sick themselves so void of sense, but that they are sensible, they are precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the burning cordials of Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in the state of their disease into their too early Tombs. The forementioned Cordials derive their burning nature from an impure <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which doth not only plentifully abound in the spirits of wine, the <hi>menstruum</hi> of all those compounded alexipharmacal liquors, but the ingredients themselves, especially the aromaticks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain excrementitious <hi>Sulphurs</hi> and impure salts; whence it happens, that those that have liberally taken of them, arrive sooner to the end of their fatal journey. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's plain enough, that by these things the fermentation is intended, the mass of blood is forced into a fiercer fire and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the whole sink of the Febril mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which only partly flows to the blood, and partly remains in its hidden station, is violently suckt up, and drawn in by the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating juices, and is united with them in every particle; so that to give the prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced cordials, which increase the fermentation,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53438:49"/>
and do not at all render it easie, by a most subtil and diaphoretick vertue, is with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to kindle the body into a flame, and rob the sick of his life. However that inquiry may not be pretermitted, what admirable effects do issue from the fore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced <hi>Aqua Epidemica,</hi> we are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved from the examination of the context of the simples. <hi>Tormentil</hi> Root is in the front, whose power doth reside in a pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous fixt salt, and for that reason no part of it doth ascend the Alembick. <hi>Liquorish</hi> in this place is termed alexipharmacal, which was never attributed to it by any Physitian, nevertheless it was possibly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to abate the acrimony of the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients: but since it doth also obtuse the attractive vertue of the <hi>Menstruum,</hi> and render it incapable of attracting the salts of the simples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither doth the least particle of it climb out of the body to the head of the Still; certainly it ought justly to be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hence. Moreover, who but a mad man would commend <hi>Mugwort, Agrimony, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,</hi> and other such like herbs, against the Plague, according as they are inserted by the former age in this composed medicine? These though they use some small force against the venom of the air, yet other
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53438:49"/>
Alexipharmacals, as long as they are far more deservedly commended, for oppugning this Epidemick venom with all their force, ought to be preferred.</p>
               <p>What concerns Spirits of <hi>Hartshorn,</hi> you would stand in a doubt, whether they be more prevalent in their pernicious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, or in their ungrateful tast. This latter is taken notice of by all, that have had the occasion of tasting them; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is very amply asserted from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of those that have used them; for they are no sooner past the throat, but have caused a furious burning in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and entrails, raised the fermentation to the highest pitch, put the whole stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture into a fire, and destroyed the spirits and strength of nature. All these evils do proceed from an impure and venomous <hi>sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> that is latent in the spirits of <hi>Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,</hi> and corroding fiery volatil salt, that is united with the foresaid <hi>sulphur.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding though the aforesaid spirits are so virulent and deleterious, they are not quite to be rejected, for experience and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority do witness, that the most mortal ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noms, namely, <hi>Antimony, Quicksilver, Arsenick,</hi> &amp;c. do contain within their bowels an alexipharmacal vertue, which is very
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53438:50"/>
powerful in expelling of venom, and other subtil malignitles. Wherefore if the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of <hi>Hartshorn</hi> by a particular prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are purged of that virulent <hi>sulphur,</hi> and the force of its corrosive salts extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht, there will be remaining only a pure cordial <hi>sulphur,</hi> and a most subtil volatil salt, which by their close union and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescence do not only contribute strength to the vital spirits, but with an united force first extinguish the malignant miasms, and afterwards expel them. These spirits do not burn and inflame, like others, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of a pure ethereal and most penetrating body, and are famed not for intending the fermentation, but rendring it apt and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, whereon the efficacy of the cure doth chiefly depend.</p>
               <p>The fame of <hi>Lapis Contrajerva</hi> against putrid and malignant Fevors is spread among most people, but how deservedly, let those judge, that have made trial of it. The <hi>Contrajerva</hi> roots, which are the base of the composition, besides dregs and a mealy thickness, contain neither volatil, not fixt salt, that is effectual, nor any qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that may be discovered by scent or tast; but on the other hand, it is inferred from many experiments, though the root
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53438:50"/>
hath been given in a double dose to those, that lay sick in fevors, that it scarce did a pins worth of good. The <hi>Virginian root</hi> doth potently heat and kindle the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen</hi> of the humours; so that it doth not effect so much good by its diaphoretick vertue, as it doth harm by its caustick qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. <hi>Cochenil</hi> grains do recreate the sight by its colour, but not at all the vital spirits by its cordial vertue. Priests do swear on the words of the Gospel, but some Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians swear more religiously on the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious vertues of <hi>Extractum Cardiacum,</hi> described above. But whence such great vertues should proceed, may be lawfully inquired into. Certainly, in all extracts the most active particles do together with the <hi>Menstruum,</hi> that is evaporated, fly away into the air, a gross dreg that is without any soul in it, remaining in the bottom, and constituting the body of the extract; pray tell me, are there not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful faculties, for suppressing malignant Fevors, hidden in the bowels of such a kind of Extract? Moreover since <hi>Narco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> are the chiefest parts of it, the vital spirits being now ingaged at the deepest, and somewhat giving way, are not to be quite cast down and overthrown by such
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53438:51"/>
Narcoticks, or their strength to be setter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them. Wherefore those things are to be given with a great deal of caution and scruple, especially to such, as lye languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to avoid the throwing them into a sleeping bottomless pit, as most may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, hath happened to many. Others endeavour to relieve cast down Nature with pretious fragments, <hi>Bezoar stone, Pearl, Coral,</hi> and shelly medicines, as if they would redeem her for a certain price, from a deplorable state; but to no purpose, for these premised stones, since they do chiefly consist of a ponderous earth, though pure and transparent, being taken inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, through their weight sink to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the stomach, which for that reason they do extreamly burden, and oppress, and occasion obstructions round about. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what notion they refresh the heart, and vital spirits, and oppugn the malignity, hath not been my luck hitherto to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; it's true, through their splendor and rayes they recreate the optick, and likewise sympathetically the other animal spirits; but do not in the least strengthen, but by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersing the sight rather weaken them. When they are reduced into powder, they contain nothing that is volatil, nor
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53438:51"/>
any fixt salt that may be advantageous for the liquor that floats in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach to extract, unless they are calcined before. If you instance that the acid li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of the stomach, which goeth by the name of a <hi>Ferment,</hi> doth extract the tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture out of them, that contains all their energy, and entire faculties, take for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that, 1. At the time of a Fevor, the stomach is quite deprived of that acid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. 2. The tincture of almost all stones are not real tinctures, but alterations and concoctions of the <hi>Menstruum,</hi> proceeding from the matter, that is to be extracted, which notwithstanding doth not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the least thing to it, since after the extraction is made, if it be weighed in a scale there is not a grain of its weight les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened. Moreover, what concerns the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoar</hi> stone, I have known seventeen grains of it given to a Vintners child, that was scarce two years old, without the least ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or alteration following upon it. Some that were grown up, who had taken half a dram of it, found no kind of altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but an oppression and weight at their stomach; besides I pass by, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of those stones is fictitious, and counterfeit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:53438:52"/>At the conclusion of this chapter, there remains something to be said, concerning the use of <hi>Epispasticks.</hi> According as they are usually applyed by Physitians now a days, their greatest benefit is, that a few (namely such as lay ill of Fevors) having undergone the punishment of <hi>Vesicatories,</hi> had recovered their former health, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that had received the same kind of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, were dead. At present ought to be inquired into the matter of fact, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those few ought rather to bless <hi>Vesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories</hi> for their recovery, than many others to curse them for being the occasion of their death. The case is to be decided by the consequence; a few that have used <hi>Vesicatories,</hi> have escaped; many that have used <hi>Vesicatories,</hi> have perisht: it may then probably be concluded, that the use of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicatories</hi> is pernicious and mortal. But let us take the reason of the thing into consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; for the most part, that small number, that have escaped from a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Fevor, (after the concoction was past, which through occasion of their lowness of strength was not discovered) have had <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicatories</hi> applied, which by reason of the concoction and separation have drawn forth a great puddle of salt and sharp water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53438:52"/>
great bubbles; but those, on whom the precited <hi>Vesicatories</hi> have been affixt, where there hath been no concoction or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration before, have had a small quantity of moisture extracted into low blains, which for the most part is a mortal sign; so that it doth appear thence, that the cause of their cure and recovery is not to be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the <hi>Vesicatories,</hi> but to the subducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and concoction of the malignant water and heterogeneous humours.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in <hi>Epispastick</hi> medicaments the <hi>Cantharides</hi> perform the chief work, the relation of whose properties I judge may be advantageous. They are of a most hot and burning nature, they oft oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion Fevors, great tortures and pains, a disturbance of the humours in the vessels, and a very sharp irritation, which a <hi>dysu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and bloody making of water do oft fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, they are extreamly hurtful to the brain and sinews, and suddenly destroy ones strength, so that they are markt with a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature of the most malignant venom, though only applied externally.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if <hi>Epispastick</hi> plasters, being thick spread with <hi>Cantharides,</hi> are appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Patient, that is ill of a malignant Fevor, at the time of the vigour, when his
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53438:53"/>
strength is decayed, do they not increase the Fevor, put the malignant humours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a rage, heap up one malignity on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, quite oppress the principal faculties, destroy the forces, and certainly deprive the Patient of his life? Possibly here may be objected, that though <hi>Vesicatories</hi> do occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion a great deal of hurt <hi>per se</hi> to a fevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish body, yet <hi>per accidens</hi> they do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of good by exhausting the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>serum,</hi> and putting the external parts to pain, whereby there is a revulsion made of hurtful humours and steems from the brain. Hereunto is to be replied, that in this case, the blood is most frequently want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of moisture (whence the febril fire burneth the more violent) so that it's pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible only to attract a very few drops, whereby a heap of very great evils is brought upon the Patient. Secondly, since malign corpuscles are chiefly seated in fuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous salts, you cannot possibly by any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice extract them; for at the time of the state, they are so very closely and intirely soldred to the humours, that to draw them asunder, is by no means feasible. That these things are so, is proved by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; The Ichor or bloody moisture, that by an Epispastick is attracted outward at
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53438:53"/>
the time of declination, or concoction and separation, doth swell out in a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity under the blains, which when cut doth leap out, being of a sharp tast, fiery and salt, because it's laden with those foresaid fuliginous and malignant salts; but being expelled at an unseasonable time, appears lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, insipid and fresh. Moreover I will now tell you, what the vulgar will scarce give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to; namely, that Vesicatories being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied at the declination to parts, that are not so convenient, have very suddenly snatcht sick Patiens away out of this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary orb. A certain person, that was ill of a burning and malignant Fevor, aged thirty two, after he had lain sick fourteen days, not without some signs of perfect concoction and separation, in manner that on the fifteenth he walkt several times up and down his room, being attended with all characters of health, to expel the latent malignity outwards, had by the advice of two fermenting Physitians, at the hour of Rest, large Vesicatory Plaisters applied to the nape of the neck, and the wrists. The following morning the Fevor was bursted out again burning enough, his speech was taken away, and was grown light headed; but that they might make an end of their
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53438:54"/>
task, on the sixteenth they took the man out of the world. Doubtless the malignant salts being attracted out of the whole body to the brain, and nervous parts, did very suddenly extinguish his forces and spirits.</p>
               <p>Many other tragical cases I could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce for testimonials, did not the purpose of a compendious tract disswade me, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take the precited in lieu of all. It may be stated for a certain, that at the beginning of a malignant Fevor, especially when it hath attracted the seminary of malignity out of the air, (which seldom happens) <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasticks</hi> being applied to the remote parts, the symptoms have been subdued immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and the Fevor extinguisht; but then they were applied within the third or fourth day. Likewise, being affixt to one that is taken with a pestilential infection, they have been very advantageous. In some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses they may also be applyed to convenient parts at the declination.</p>
               <p>My business doth only permit me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise these particulars in this <hi>first Section;</hi> in the second section which will e're long follow, I shall apply my self to give you a description of putrid continual and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Fevors, likewise of the Small Pox, and Meazels, by their foundation, subject
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53438:54"/>
and symptoms, and likewise shall subjoin practical observations, and the true method of cure and remedies. In the third section shall discourse of the division of Fevors, and in particular of intermittent Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors.</p>
               <p>Upon so important an affair as the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical part of Malignant Fevors, I ought not to make so sudden a recess, as to leave those salutiserous maxims, premised in this Tract, only astipulated with reason, but to recommend them to you confirmed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, abstracted from those cures, which for success and happy event are not to be conferred with the vu<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gar methods. Among the number of them I could here produce, shall only insert some few of the last years date, whence a proof sufficiently evident may easily be reduced.</p>
               <p>The last preceding autumn I was called to one Mr. <hi>Van Mildert,</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of considerable note, aged about twenty nine, of temperament Pituitous and Melancholick, not robust of constitution, but of a rare texture of body. On the Sunday he was surprised with drowsiness and heaviness of his head, a Catarrhe in his throat, an ulcerous lassitude, a <hi>rigor</hi> or shivering and shaking, a nauseousness or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53438:55"/>
to vomit, and some other sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms dependant on the former: during the first four days he used the prescriptions of one of the elder City Physitians, the chief whereof, to the best of my memory, directed some vulnerary vegetables for a decoction; another was a decoction of <hi>Carduus B.</hi> in posset ale, intended to move a gentle vomit, and after that, advised bleeding. The fifth day I made my first visit, and found the Patients sense of sight and hearing much diminisht, his pulse extreamly languid, inequal in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and debility, a little more frequent than in the state of health, the urine thick, turbid, and a little high coloured; the tongue scabrous, red, dry and fissured; his thirst was so extream, that no quantity of any former drink could in the least abate it. By intervals his rational faculty was perverted with a <hi>Delirium</hi> that would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue several hours. Touching his sleep some dayes and nights he was wholly rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, other dayes soporous and comatick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a case of greater difficulty I have not met with, neither have I observed any to escape such symptoms, being universally declared mortal, <hi>viz.</hi> the pulse at the beginning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly languid, the tendons of the wrist convell'd and vibrating, the animal faculty
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53438:55"/>
supprest and broken, the urine very crude and indigested, &amp;c. This being a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Fevor and contagious, (for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient had lately conceived the seminary of his distemper at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> where it was then Epidemick,) certainly is a case that may give evident testimony of the effect of the method premised, and asserts the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onality of the practice thereof. For only at the beginning I ordered a Laxative Gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and not after; prescribed an Alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharmacal Apozem with particular ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents to allay the fury of those lixivious and absorbing salts, that continually sublimed to the upper part of the stomach, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned his excessive drought, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved so successful, that in twenty four hours after, no more complaint was made of it, during the whole course of sickness. The sixth, seventh, and eighth day were exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited greater doses of Alexiterial powders, and decoctions, than afterwards; soon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this the vital faculty began to revive, and pulsate so, that it might sensibly be perceived by the touch, his urin began to be digested, and was voided in greater quantities. On the eleventh day the urine was perfectly concocted, and the pulsation of the arteries was vigorous; all his sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53438:56"/>
did much abate in their violence, except the deprava<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion of his rational facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which persisted by reason of some fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bril steems, and calcined salts, that ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the brain. It was here, if at any time, that Epispasticks might be of some use in revelling those acrimonious steems, and exhausting part of the salin <hi>serum,</hi> that abounded and was separated from the blood, likewise there being present all the good signs of concoction, seldom doth any ill issue from them. The thirteenth day they were applied to the legs, and arms, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to expectation they attracted a vast quantity of <hi>serum,</hi> which continued to flow copiously for some days after. The Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent was perfectly restored.</p>
               <p>The first Aphorism of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> i e. <hi>Occasion and opportunity is of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is in no case so important as in Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, especially if malignant; for every day and hour you have an opportunity of applying remedies, that for the most part do cure the distemper; but if you slip this opportunity, and those remedies are advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed late, that ought to be applied soon, and those soon, that should be administred late, you must certainly destroy and kill the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53438:56"/>
Patient. As for instance, in the case here recited, if Epispasticks had been applied on the tenth or eleventh, before a digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or if he had been blooded after the sixth, or if a Purgative Glyster had been made use of near the state of the disease, or if Antifebrils and Alexipharmacals had not been given in the beginning in large quantities, whilst there was strength and spirits to subdue the <hi>materia febrilis,</hi> in all probability this person must have stoopt to the distemper.</p>
               <p>The Malignant Fevor, by which Mr. <hi>Drakes</hi> son in <hi>Hind Court</hi> in <hi>Fleetstreet</hi> was attackt in <hi>August</hi> last, in point of eminent danger and difficulty, doth almost parallel the preceding. He was aged twenty four, and of a sanguine temperament. It was from a pernicious air on board of a ship of war, and the use of hot liquors (which for the avoiding inconveniencies, arising from the nauseous salin vapours of the Sea, most do submit themselves unto) this distemper had taken its growth, and with a speedy ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer was advanced to a great defect of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal spirits, the arteries scarce giving any testimony of their pulsation; likewise a black scabrous sooty tongue, an insatiable drouth, a most piquant burning heat, want
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53438:57"/>
of sleep, anguors, continual jactitau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, dejection of appetite, nauseousness of stomach, frequent and opprest respirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and an intermittent <hi>delirium</hi> were sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms that were very urgent. The seventh day gave an indubious remark of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, the Patients skin being universally pencill'd with red spots, <hi>Petechiae rubrae.</hi> The course of remedies was thus managed. The second day he was blooded out of the right arm, to nine ounces; the third day received a laxative glyster in the morning; at four in the afternoon, an Alexiterial Apozem of <hi>Rad. Scorzon. Bistort. acetos. fol. ulmar. pimpinel. galeg. dictamn. cret. dracunt. sem. Hormin. citr.</hi> there was also added a small proportion of <hi>scordium</hi> and <hi>Absynth. Rom.</hi> which latter seems to be the sole specifick against naseousness and vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Fevors. To these forementioned were added some salts and spirits to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate their heat and refine their <hi>sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs.</hi> The first, second, and third doses of this Apozem were very liberal. A day or two after was prescribed an antilipyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous powder of <hi>Bezoara. mineral. Coral. Terra Sigil. Sal. Prunel.</hi> &amp;c. By which means the body was gradually promoted to a <hi>Diaphoresis,</hi> and <hi>Diuresis,</hi> and lastly there
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53438:57"/>
appeared a large <hi>Parotis</hi> or inflammation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ear, a symptom Pathognomonick to pestilency and malignity, which being suppurated, deterged, and consolidated, the Patient arrived to a perfect state of health. Moreover both in this and the former case, was prescribed a cordial julep, to take by intervals, for the present support of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and animal spirits. Likewise twice there was made use of an Opiat. A <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arrhaea,</hi> or looseness survening, or conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant to a malign Fevor, is judged a sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptom as urgent, as any other whatsoever, and doth not only require particular reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but oft such, as the malign Fevor doth counterindicate, and consequently must shew a very ill aspect to the life and recovery of the Patient. Such was the case of Mrs. <hi>Read</hi> on <hi>Lambeth</hi> Hill, aged thirty, and of temperament phlegmatick and melancholick, her Fevor was ushered in with a looseness so very importune, that on the ninth day, her Visitors and Neighbours expected her departure: on the same day it was I made my first visit, and having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, what was prescribed by her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Physitian, (who likewise had a very ill opinion of this distemper) and detecting some great errors in this course, was in hope
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53438:58"/>
that by their rectification, and the prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of means more rational, I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store her to former health. I prescribed a Restringent Cordial, Anodyne Glysters, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisebril Adstringent Powders, and an Alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharmacal Apozem. Thrice also there was an <hi>Hypnotick</hi> given. But the chief means was the method, (which I need not here repeat) that proved so successful, in conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this dangerous distemper.</p>
               <p>I shall forbear inserting the recital of many other cures of this nature, since these are sufficient to convince you of the truth and excellency of this method; and pass over to an observation I have universally remarked; that all or most malignant Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, though dextrously cured, leave such an impression on the bowels, that thereby within a month, two or three, another di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper is ingendred, that for the most part proves obstinate to cure, and in this particular they imitate the manner of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of venoms or poysons, which being accidentally taken inward (and though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward well cured) yet occasion such an impression on the bowels and blood, that in a sortnight or month, or sometime lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, either the Patient loseth his nails, the hair of his head, and the cuticula, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53438:58"/>
skin of his body; or falls into a Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, Consumption, Dysentery, or some other distemper.</p>
               <p>The distempers that are posthumous to malignant Fevors, are chiefly a tertian Ague, a Pulmonick Consumption, a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick Fevor, Rhumatisms, Scurvey, Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentery, Yellow jaundice, Cachexia, and a Cephalaea.</p>
               <p>Among these the Pulmonick Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption seems to transcend the others, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of danger and stubbornness of cure, and doth very frequently grow out of the cinders of a malign Fevor.</p>
               <p>One Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Merchant, his age not exceeding thirty, and lodging in <hi>Fanchurch street,</hi> partly through a hot temperament of his bowels, that was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, partly through the <hi>fatigue</hi> of his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from <hi>Plimouth</hi> hither, and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of diet, fell into the burning flames of a malignant Fevor, which his purpre spots breaking forth on the seventh day throughout the whole field of his skin, did amply detect, whereunto adjoyning his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding vomiting, and most importune hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough, his impatient thirst, dry red fissu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red tongue, deplorable head-ach, flammy urine, and low frequent inequal pulse,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53438:59"/>
spake the distemper to threaten an ill event. Having ordained his diet to be very thin, and prescribed a laxative Glyster in the morning, being the second day of his Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor; advised eight ounces to be extracted by phlebotomy out of the right arm, at four in the afternoon. The blood ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very thin, and in point of colour tending towards a blew, whereinto I instil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a few drops of spirits of Nitre, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scover the constitution of it. Upon the commixture, the colour turned to a vitellin citrin; an indication the blood was very sulphurous and hot, and not easily to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a <hi>Crasis.</hi> Six hours after bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he was to take a dose of this following mixture.</p>

The second day the malignity appeared in a <hi>delirium,</hi> and oppression of the vital faculty; her heat was very great, and drought very urgent. The same day about four in the afternoon I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, she should bleed about five ounces out of the right arm; the next morning a glyster was given.

               <p>Some four hours after bleeding I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed an ample dose of an Alexiterial Julep, with twelve drops of <hi>Essentified spirit</hi> of <hi>Hartshorn</hi> dropt into it, the same was to be repeated for two mornings and nights following; the operation of these medicines was signal in a gentle sweat and breathing, which on the seventh day extinguisht the

Fevor and malignity. Though this course proved so successful, as to restore her to a perfect health; I am apt to suspect that about the next Autumn she will be troubled with an intermittent Tertian, because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Fevors, as I observed before, generally leave an imp<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ession on the bowels, through which in a short time another di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper is ingendred. This observation not long since was verified in the tertian ague, one Mr. <hi>Powel</hi> a Taylor in <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street Covent Garden</hi> was surprised with, three months after I had cured him of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry malignant and dangerous Fevor. The principal medicine, to which I attributed the cure of this Fevor, was spirit of Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, depurated of its poysonous <hi>Sulphur</hi> and salt, by a late invented process. That the sulphur and salt I do defecate by the forementioned process, from spirits of Hartshorn, is venomous, appears by these circumstances. 1. The quantity of two scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples is a proportion sufficient to kill a dog. 2. The scent of it doth commonly occasion vomiting, and a raging headach. 3. The spirit of Hartshorn that is thus freed and depurated from this noxious <hi>sulphur</hi> and salt is far more powerful in provoking sweat and urine in the same quantity and dose,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53438:64"/>
than the common spirit. Neither doth the said spirit cau<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e that burning heat, anguor, and suffocation, which the common usually doth.</p>
               <p>His Tertian Ague, though the paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xysms were durable to ten or twelve hours, and the other symptoms very fierce, yet was easily conquered by taking three doses of my <hi>Pil. Polychrestae.</hi>

               <p>Since a greater number of particulars than two or three is required to render an obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation universal, I shall insert one or two more. I have a page or two before given you the journal of the malignant Fevor of Mr. <hi>Van Mildert;</hi> it was in him also the preceding observation was confirmed: for about two or three months after his recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from the said Fevor, he was taken with a violent <hi>Rigor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> i. e.</hi> shivering and shaking, a raging headach, vomiting, a great drought, a bitter tast in his mouth, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Rigor</hi> a very smart heat, and towards the latter part of his paroxysm did suffer a most immoderate sweat, a sign this single tertian Ague would prove very obstinate. After a Laxative Glyster, there was eight ounces of blood drawn out of the right median on the intermittent day. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

other day he took a dose of a <hi>Vinum Medicatum</hi> composed out of Hepaticks and purgatives done up in a bag, and insused in an anatick measure of Rhenish Wine and Succory water. Having used this thrice he intermitted eight or ten days, and then took two doses of Antisebril Pills, which <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Mrs. <hi>Wilkins</hi> a Tradesmans Wise in <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lane,</hi> three or four days after delivery of a child, was on a sudden taken with a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, after that with a very scorching heat, and a opprest frequent respiration; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond night raved, and was very turbulent. This Fevor, which from those symptoms might justly be termed malignant, took its rise from her wine Cawdels, and supping of hot Spirits, which the good women had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her, to support her strength, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her eating meat, as Pigeons, and other heavy food, did much contribute, in the causing an ebullition of the blood, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing her <hi>Lochia.</hi> I advised her to have the Saphana opened, for derivation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsion, and caused <hi>Suppedanea</hi> to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied composed of Pickle-herrings, Soap and Salt of Tartar: Prescribed Whey made by instilling some few drops of spirit of Salt into Milk, hereof a half pint to be taken

She enjoyed her health near ten weeks, about which time she sell into a melancholy, and a great palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the heart, not without frights and fears. This continued eight days, when the Moon being at full, she grew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack or Bethlem mad. I ordered she should be kept in a dark room, and be blooded nine ounces out of the right arm, two days after gave her a dose of <hi>Hartmans Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial, Cathartick Pills,</hi> which operated very well. Upon three days intermission repeated the same Pills. Next morning she took this following Electuary,</p>

The observation is such that it gives me occasion to admire so many preceding ages have so grosly erred in their practice, and doth likewise detect the cause
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53438:66"/>
why malignant, and indeed most Synochical Fevors prove so oft mortal.</p>
               <p>It is an universal theorem, that in these Northern Climates Fevors are terminated not critically, but slowly and gradually, by sweat and urine, (<hi>per Diaphoresin &amp; Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resin</hi>) Through the former, <hi>viz.</hi> sweat, the salin volatil, and fuliginous matter is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled; through the latter, namely urine, the fixt salin and lixiviated matter is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. To accomplish this usually (as I said before) are prescribed Diaphoreticks, as <hi>Aqua Epidemica, Theriacalis, Scordii Composita,</hi> &amp;c. of one, or more of these, the measure of an ounce or two is mixed with the same proportion of Alexiterial simple waters, and hereof two or three spoonfuls is to be given, every second, third, or fourth hour, according to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricio</hi> of the Physitian, undoubtedly the effect doth not answer his expectation, and no sweat appears; upon this it may be double the quantity is to be used, and yet not a drop of sweat is forced out; then apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logizes your Doctor for himself, and tells you, if the Patient could but be brought to sweat, he would soon mend, and further prognosticates, if he doth not fall into a a sweat by to morrow, or it may be next
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53438:66"/>
day, he is a dead man, and so <hi>Buenas No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> Now I will render it as evident to you, as the light of the Sun, that Mr. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor is the cause of this mans death, that is to be understood, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. There being nothing more familiar among the fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, than to explain their notions by theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rems taken from the Brewhouse, and Kitchin, I shall make use of arguments desu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from the same Categories. There is possibly a piece of meat to be prepared for to be eaten, which to maturate or take away the crudity of it, to mollifie or render it tender, to dissolve and to purge it from its filth and impurity, is to be boiled; if you put to it salt, wine, or other ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and there be not a sufficient proportion of water, or that the water boileth away too much, especially if the meat be left dry, it will not only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>harden, but be burned, smell of adustion or empyreum and soot, and be entirely corrupted and spoiled; whereas if it had been supplied with water, the meat would have been softned, concocted, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purated from its recrements and impurities, which it casts forth into a scum. The case is not different in the blood, that boyelth up in the veins and arteries of fevorish Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, which being full of salin, adust, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53438:67"/>
other heterogeneou; particles, is by ebullition to be depurated of the said impurities; if then the blood wanteth water or <hi>serum,</hi> to dissolve those salin particles, it must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily grow dry, coagulate, and be burnt up; and consequently death must be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable issue. Now observe, that a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, that hath been broyling under a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Fevor for eight or ten days or longer, his entrails scorcht and parcht, his blood dried up, and affected with an empyreum, how impossible it is, he should be put into a sweat by hot cordials though diaphoretick, as <hi>Aqua Epidemica, Theriacal. lap. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jerv.</hi> to be given every third or fourth hour, by spoonfuls, or scruples. These certainly must render the blood hotter and dryer, and totally absorb the remaining moisture. The infallible way to prescribe a remedy to Patients of this nature, is, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that for to cast one into a sweat, you are to consider the subject, the matter of sweat, the efficient of sweat, the several causes that hinder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but chiefly the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of sweat and the efficient. The matter is the superfluous serosity of the blood. The efficient is the spirits, that expel the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said serosity to the circumference. These two are nearest causes, without both
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53438:67"/>
which at the same time no sweat can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured; for if we have only abundance of spirits, and no abounding moisture, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits will be provoked into a greater rage and force, and consequently if there be any moisture remaining, they will absorb that, and so quite exsiccate the body; this is that end, which the Fermentators and the Putrid Physitians attain by their <hi>Cochleatim</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials.</p>
               <p>The indication drawn hence doth direct, that to procure sweat (which as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is a common terminator of malign Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours) is to moisten the body well with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate Juleps or Apozems. Which done, give but two drams of any alexipharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal water, or five or six drops of spirit of Hartsh<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rn rectified, and you shall certainly cause an abundant sweat.</p>
               <p>In the next place, consider though there be moisture sufficient, to subminister mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for sweat (as sometimes there is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign Fevors) there either may be a defect of spirits, or the spirits may be opprest by the malignity, and in a manner rendred languid, or drowned by moisture too much abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; then in this case Putrid Physitians do commit a killing error, in forcing the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to swallow down their acid Juleps and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53438:68"/>
Apozems. The indication desumed hence doth direct so subtil cordials, as through their penetrability may insinuate into the most intime effuges of the body, and disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle the spirits from those malign parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, that oppress them, which done, they will soon expel their malign enemies through the pores by sweat. But since no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can illustrate this point more than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, I will give you a most convincing instance. I was not long since called out out of my bed to see the child of Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi> in <hi>Fetter lane</hi> end next <hi>Holborn,</hi> who I was told lay a dying. The child was two years and an half old or almost three. I found she fetcht her breath with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, her Pulse did beat convulsive, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating, and extreamly frequent, as in like cases it usually beateth, some two or three hours before death. She was deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous not knowing any, that were used to be about her, her eyes were very hollow, dim and very slow in motion, her face was pale and cadaverous. I examined how she had been the day before, I was told, that she had a high colour, had been very burning, and was very droughty, and drousie. She had been ill some four or five days. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had examined her mouth and belly, I
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53438:68"/>
soon understood what it was, <hi>viz.</hi> a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Fevor occasioned by the Small Pox, which nature could not cast forth for want of moisture; for hot cordials she had taken in abundance, almost every half hour, and would undoubtedly have been dead in three hours more had they gone on in that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. I prescribed four or five drops of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified spirits of Hartshom with a grain two or three of <hi>Bezoard. mineral.</hi> and a dram of <hi>Aq. Scordii comp.</hi> to be given in a large draught of pure posset drink; in less than two hours the Small Pox appeared, and she was put into a tolerable sweat, then cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed two Epispasticks to be applied to the Wrists, which had singularly performed their operation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by extracting a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of malignant serosity. By next morning her senses were returned, her as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect appeared florid and vivid, her Fevor very much abated, and all her malignant symptoms vanisht, insomuch that within two or three days she was perfectly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>Some other observations I must refer to the next opportunity, in the mean time I wish Physitians would prefer experience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their opiniater notions.</p>
