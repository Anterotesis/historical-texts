            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(whom, for honour
sake, in an Epistle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive,
I have not
named in full sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles)
I had no sooner
heard that your Lordship had exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
against my Booke, concerning the
<hi>Masse,</hi> but I laboured both by my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of letters unto you, and solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation
of an Honourable friend, to
be acquainted therewith, having first
<pb facs="tcp:13230:3"/>
understood, that you had objected the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to
some Protestants, by way of Traduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and then imparted them to a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
tongue, which you knew to be as
shrill and loud as <hi>Bow-bell,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
it into the eares of others round
about, in the vilest termes of <hi>Falsifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi>
and <hi>Impostor.</hi> A pestilent
ayre, which presently after was heard
blustering at the Court: Whereunto
I addressed my Answer, <hi>Satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
as I thought. And about five
weekes after I received a Replie from
your Lordship closely sealed up, with
divers seales, for secrefie sake: But,
behold a Miracle! the same Replie
flyeth out amain, the <hi>Seales</hi> (as it were
the <hi>Doores) being shut,</hi> which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed
abrod by the wings of Report,
preoccupateth the eares and mindes of
the most of your Profession, within the
<pb facs="tcp:13230:3"/>
County of <hi>Hampshire,</hi> to my great
ignominie and reproach. All which
your Obliquity of dealing I received
from the intelligence of Persons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all Exception: Whereby I learne
that your Ayme was not your owne
<hi>Satisfaction</hi> (then pretended) but my
defamation. So that your Lordship
may not now bee offended, to see your
owne private letters present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
againe unto you in publique
Print, and attended with this my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
and Answere unto them. For
you were not to thinke, that when as
you had placed the <hi>Candle</hi> upon the
<hi>top of the Table,</hi> I should hide it
<hi>under a bushell:</hi> but seeing that you
would not pinion your <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that

meet with them upon the same stage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13230:4"/>
Your Lordships Exceptions are
partly against my <hi>Allegations,</hi> and
partly against my <hi>Style of writing;</hi>
and you will bee knowne to bee the sole
Author of both: but your Lordship
will con me thankes, if for your credit-sake
I attribute the Objections against
my <hi>Allegations</hi> rather to some <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Suggester</hi> than to your selfe;
when you shall perceive the manifold
falsities of the Objections, from point
to point. Nor will your knowne wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
permit mee to beleeve, that you
would offer to challenge a <hi>Bishop,</hi> in
matters of his owne profession (unto
whom you are pleased to ascribe more
than ordinary Attributes of learning)
and to impute such errors unto him
with that Confidence, as to wish that
<hi>another Bishop</hi> of the same professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
might bee <hi>Umpier</hi> betweene us;
<pb facs="tcp:13230:4"/>
except you had first consulted with
some <hi>Romish Priest;</hi> especially see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that in your Replie you judge your
owne <hi>Romish writers</hi> not to be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
enough, which come forth
without the Licence and <hi>Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Superiors.</hi> Howsoever,
as well for your <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> as for
mine owne <hi>Iustification,</hi> I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
unto your Lordship such a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
and Conscionable an Answere,
which I dare permit to the <hi>Umpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi>
of any Romish Doctor, or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
were it your <hi>Bishop of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
the <hi>Pope</hi> himselfe. Yet shall
not either Popeship, Doctorship, or so
much almost as any Schollership be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
in this case, wherein, as when
any felon is brought before a Iudge, or
a Iustice, that was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in the manner, they need
<pb facs="tcp:13230:5"/>
not be troubled with any further exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
then the view of the stolne
stuffe, which was taken upon him. In
like manner (were the Author either
your selfe, or any other) your falshood
in objecting of Falsities will be so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant,
that the reader shall not need
to busie his braines with any further
Disquisition than the view and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usall
of the words excepted against. In
a word; These and all other like Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations,
used by <hi>M. Parsons,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny
other, have beene shewen hitherto
to have beene as causelesse, as if it had
befallen spiritually to my Adversaries,
as it hapned corporally to the enemies
of <hi>Lot,</hi> when they sought to assaile
him, but <hi>could not find the doore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other point of your Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
touching the <hi>Bitternesse</hi> of the
<hi>Style,</hi> being a subject of humane <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
rather than of <hi>Theologicall</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:13230:5"/>
judgment, I shall not gainsay, although
you shall challenge it to your selfe; who
hearing me, upon good proofes, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>Romish Masse</hi> of <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
Sacriledge,</hi> and <hi>Idolatrie;</hi>
passe by this in silence, &amp; only quarrel
the Denominations, in calling your
<hi>Masse Superstitious, Sacrilegious,</hi>
and <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> Now forsooth, ô the
Bitternes of the Style! But ô violent
Cavillation, may I say. Much like as if
I had frendly admonished your Lo: for
your safety sake, to avoid such a By-way,
because it is hau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with theeves;
or to forbeare to tast of such a Cup,
which is infected with poyson; or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine
the next house, wherein is the
pestilence; all this should bee received
without regret: notwithstanding you
should take offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that I should call the
<hi>way Theevish,</hi> the <hi>Cup poyso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>able</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:13230:6"/>
and the <hi>house Pestilent.</hi> All the rest
of your Instances of <hi>Bitternes</hi> labour
of one and the same fault, which is
<hi>Impatience,</hi> not to suffer <hi>Errors</hi> and
<hi>Vices</hi> to be arrayed with their sutable
Attributes of <hi>Erroneousnesse</hi> and
<hi>Vitiousnesse;</hi> as if you would deny
the child his proper name. But Hony
and any sweet thing seemeth <hi>Bitter</hi> to
one in an ague, yet the cause is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
of the Party. Others spit out,
as loathsome, that, which is <hi>Bitter</hi> in
their mouthes, although it would bee
never so Cordiall at their hearts; and
this disease is somewhat a-kin to a
Phrenzie. And that your Lordship
should blame me for confuting Errors,
and condemning faults in such bitter
names, without which they could not
bee so much as named, much lesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed,
or condemned; is a fault in it self,
<pb facs="tcp:13230:6"/>
which I will not name, for feare you
should accuse mee of <hi>Bitternesse.</hi> He
that would indeed busie his pen in blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out the <hi>Bitter Styles</hi> of outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Raylers,</hi> may spend his life time
in expunging whole Bookes of your

in <hi>Gretzer</hi> the Iesuite his defence of
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and <hi>Stapleton</hi> his
<hi>Counter-blast,</hi> both which have been
studied by some, only to furnish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with store of salt, vinegar, and
gall, for personall Invectives.</p>
            <p>As for my selfe, none ever more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
that <hi>Caninam eloquentiam,</hi>
that is, <hi>Doggish eloquence;</hi> never
did any (be it spoken without arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance)
insult lesse upon so great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages;
witnesse the same Booke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
throughout; nor shall any unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
Reader find in any of the Places,
<pb facs="tcp:13230:7"/>
which your Lordship hath noted of
<hi>Bitternesse,</hi> any one Terme, which
may not bee held medicinable, and
which the matter it selfe did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
me unto, who have had this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie
from a Royall mouth,<note place="margin">K. J.</note> that I
used not to <hi>Flite:</hi> else should I not in
my younger yeares have plaid the Asse,
as it became mee, when I sustained
whole loads of reproachfull and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
termes of <hi>Grashopper,
Leud Lad,</hi> and <hi>very Asse,</hi> cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me by the old man <hi>M. Parsons,</hi>
without any retaliation on my part,
but rather glorying that I might bee
thought worthy the name <hi>of Asse,</hi> in
that cause, wherein I did carry my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Christ, by supporting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
his Truth.</p>
            <p>So little cause had your Lordship,
in any reason, to threaten me, with any
<pb facs="tcp:13230:7"/>
               <hi>unruly pen.</hi> But let come that <hi>Pen,</hi>
when it will, and though it bee dren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in bitterest waters of <hi>Mara,</hi> I am
ready for it, and sure I am, that I shall
be avenged of the <hi>Pen-man.</hi> But
how? <hi>Didicit quis maledicere? &amp;

imitating Physitians, whose

I will be a Christian, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
the lesson of our Lord, &amp; Master,
who teacheth us to revenge others
<hi>Cursings</hi> of us with our <hi>Blessings</hi>
of them: even as I now doe with

            <head>A
SECOND ADVERTISE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to all Priests and Jesuites
of the English Seminaries,
wishing to them Grace,
and Peace in Christ
JESUS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Epistle (I confesse) is
somewhat large, yet so, that
as it is much necessary, both
for you to read, and for
mee to write, that you may know the
Reasons, whereby I seeke to perswade
Others, that they are not to expect
from you any Reall and conscionable
Answer to that <hi>Booke of the Masse,</hi> by
occasion whereof some of you have
used so vile, vehement, and malignant
detractions and calumniations against
mee. For, first, as that Painter in <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
who as soone as hee had finished
his Picture, in his opinion perfect, and
<pb facs="tcp:13230:9"/>
to life, betooke himselfe behinde the
Table, to harken what fault any Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator
should finde with it. I likewise
after the publishing of that Booke,
convincent as I thought, stood atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to understand what exception any
Reader would take: and behold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as
there a shoomaker intruding himselfe
among other spectators, and noting
the fashion of the Girdle in that Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
to be amisse, was answered by
that Artist, <hi>Ne Sutor supra crepidam:</hi>
even so hath one adventured to impute
Mis-allegations to that Booke, in such
manner, as deserving to be dismissed
by the Author in this sort, <hi>Ne Sciolus
supra Captum:</hi> the exceptions being
such, that it may well be said of them;
<hi>The very repeating them is a refuting
them,</hi> as some also have acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Yet hath this beene of late, your
onely manner of answering, although
it be indeed but a meere Tergiversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that is, a shamefull flying all the
forces of confutation of your Romish
Masse; as men in battell, seeking to
<pb facs="tcp:13230:9"/>
evade, when they are in despaire to
invade.</p>
            <p>The experience which I have had
hereof, heretofore, may be to mee a
ground of prophesie for the time
hereafter, to wit, that no Reall answer
shall be had from any of you. And <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi>
I call it, when <hi>Res cum re, Ratio cum
ratione concertat,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> speaketh; but
not that which is exercised onely in
Cavillation, about words and syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables.
For were the exceptions now
taken by your Objector never so true,
yet notwithstanding, what then
would become of his cause? but are
they false? what then shall wee thinke
of his conscience? let these two be put
to the tryall. First, do you not know,
that when two witnesses of Ten are
disabled, yet the other Eight, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the eye of Justice untouched,
and untainted, must carry the cause?
Suppose therefore that those few <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,</hi>
against my <hi>Allegations,</hi> were
true, yet how should five, or, if it were
fifty erroneous Citations prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb facs="tcp:13230:10"/>
two Thousand (for I conceive
they are no fewer) other Testimonies
therein faithfully alleaged in the same
Booke? whereby your <hi>Ten</hi> Romish
<hi>Transgressions</hi> against one command of
Christ [DO THIS,] are abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
your many Romish <hi>Depravations</hi> of
the sense of the Holy Ghost, in those
words of Christ, [THIS IS MY
BODY] are infringed; the Romish
<hi>Novelty</hi> of your doctrine of <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi>
is discovered; your sixe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
<hi>Contradictions,</hi> against the truth
of the <hi>Bodily nature of Christ,</hi> are confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
the Romish <hi>Capernaiticall eating of
Christs flesh</hi> is exploded; and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
<hi>Sacrilegious Sacrifice,</hi> together
with her <hi>Idolatrous worship</hi> in her <hi>Masse,</hi>
is irrefutably condemned.</p>
            <p>As for false Imputations of fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
as they must needs be damnable
to the Author, who accusing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in his owne guilt, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>condemneth himselfe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 1.</note> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
teacheth: so, to the party un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
taxed, it cannot be but mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:13230:10"/>
of advantage and estimation; for
Brazen plates, fixed on grave-stones,
(you know) the more they are trod
upon by mens dirty feet, the greater is
their luster, and brightnesse, as soone
as the dust is but blowne away. Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blably
the more the Accusations be,
which are unjustly charged upon any
Adversary, the more shall his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
flourish, as soone as the fraud &amp;
falshood of the Accuser shall be dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
except it be among men that
so stupifie their conscience, that they
will not see even that which they see.</p>
            <p>Such a one, of your owne order,
some few moneths past, having onely
so much modesty, as to conceale his
own name, dehorted a Knight by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
from reading the Observations,
which I had concerning the Masse, by
putting him in minde of M. <hi>Parsons</hi>
Booke of <hi>Sober Reckoning,</hi> objecting
Mis-allegations unto mee: but suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
all mention and memory of my
<hi>Encounter,</hi> in answer unto him, by
whom he was proved to be indeed but
<pb facs="tcp:13230:11"/>
a <hi>Drunken Reckoner,</hi> yet not with
wine, but with a farre worse spirit of
lying, as your owne fellow-<hi>Priests</hi> will
tell you, in the sequel of this discourse.</p>
            <p>Another reason may be, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of those Bookes of <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,
Appeale, Encounter, Causa Regia,</hi>
which (notwithstanding many promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
or rather threatnings of Answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring)
have laine still upon your hands;
beside the former booke of the <hi>Romish
Grand Imposture,</hi> which woundeth the
very <hi>Head</hi> of Romish religion, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>Church,</hi> even as this other
doth strike at the fat <hi>Belly</hi> thereof,
your <hi>Romish Masse.</hi> So that this later
Booke may seeme to be secure, till that
be first assaulted, seing that, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
of nature, every sensible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is prone, above all parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to defend the head.</p>
            <p>But principally am I confident, I
shall have no other answer to this
Booke, except onely either a <hi>Nihil
dicit,</hi> or a <hi>Nihil ad rem,</hi> not because it
is my booke (For I alas, I am but the
<pb facs="tcp:13230:11"/>
               <hi>Collector,</hi> and Composer) but because
it is yours, fighting against your <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Masse,</hi> with your owne <hi>Principles,
Conclusions,</hi> and <hi>Confessions;</hi> as also
confronting you with your owne <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
Absurdities, Falsifications,</hi>
and <hi>Perjuries, (Bis perit, qui armis suis
perit)</hi> beside the evidences of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
and <hi>Fathers,</hi> which are imprei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
All these are so many <hi>Barraca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does,</hi>
to hinder all approach, against
the Materialls of that Booke. I may
not conceale from you a Riddle. It was
but some few weekes since your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Lord intimated unto mee, that
my Booke of the Masse is to be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and that he thought he could take
that Opponent off, for some time. My
answer then was, that the dayes of my
life could not be long, but whatsoever
length of dayes God should give mee,
I could not bestow it better than in
defence of his Truth, and therefore
desired his L<hi rend="sup">p</hi> to let the party whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
take his course. Howbeit the
dog-trick, which once M. <hi>Parsons</hi> plaid
<pb facs="tcp:13230:12"/>
with mee, would not suffer me to give
saith to that Insinuation, who avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in print, that my bookes of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie</hi>
were then in answerin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
at <hi>Gratz</hi> in <hi>Austria,</hi> assigning also
the time when it was to be published;
when as he, honest man, beleeved it
not himselfe, but spake it onely by his
Equivocating spirit of Mentall Reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
(being a great Master in that
blacke art himselfe) and thereby hath
taught me how to expound the words
of this Lord delivered unto mee. The
<hi>Booke</hi> (saith hee) <hi>will be answered</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
in his minde) when yesterday
shall be to morrow: &amp;, <hi>a Iesuite hath it
in hand</hi> (sub-understanding to burn it;)
and <hi>that hee will goe thorough it</hi> (bearing
in his thought) with an aule, or a
needle: and, <hi>It will be a Booke of some big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
(meaning) mathematicall, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible.
So that this your <hi>will-be</hi> is but
that old lesson, learnt at <hi>Rome,</hi> from
the <hi>Crow,</hi> which sitting on the Top of
Tarpeys hill, cryed still <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by that Poet, <hi>Est quia non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13230:12"/>
I returne to your selves, lest that
you may thinke this Discourse to be
tedious, know then that the Lord, the
Opponent, will tell you a <hi>merry Tale</hi>
by the way; nor may you thinke this
<hi>Rejoynder</hi> unnecessary, seeing that the
Lords Reply hath already inveigled
Lords and Ladies so farre, as to thinke
his Exceptions answerlesse. But be
you (Beloved) lovers of <hi>Truth,</hi> from
what Organ soever it come, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Apparell it shall appeare. For,
<hi>God is Truth.</hi> Thus writeth hee, who
promiseth unto you certaine <hi>Additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls</hi>
to the now impugned <hi>Booke of the
Masse,</hi> of such requisite Explanations,
Confutations, and Corroborations, as
will dispossesse, I hope, even the spirit
of Prejudice it selfe, out of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
and conscionable Reader, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, as will shortly be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,

in the first place, your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
against the Allegations;
and, afterwards, to give you an
accompt, for the Acerbity of the
Style. Because every Reader (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
will rather affect materiall
discussions, than verball skirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
and more especially, for that
it will much more concerne me,
to defend my Integrity, in cyting
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:13230:18"/>
my Authors, than to secure my
Discretion, touching any Aberra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

act of discretion dependeth upon
seaven severall Circumstances,
wherein the breach of any one is
accompted a full forfeiting of that
which we call Prudence, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scretion.

discovering the inexcusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Falsehood of this first
Objection.</head>
                     <p>IF I had said simply, as is here
affirmed, that your Romish
Doctors confessed sixe Tropes
in those onely <hi>Foure words</hi> of
Christ, <hi>[Hoc est corpus meum: This

lesse satisfied, than either you (my
Lord) or yet any Romish Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie,
and assuredly I should have
plainely be-assed my selfe for so
grosse a mistake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but so far was
I from that error, that contrarily
my words (as they are to bee
seene in the Dedicatorie Epistle)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13230:20"/>
were, that <hi>our Romish Adversaries
confessed sixe Tropes in the words of
Christ, Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> &amp;c.
that is, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> &amp;c. or,
<hi>And so forth;</hi> or, as if it had beene
said, <hi>in the words following.</hi> Now
your Suggestor, that hee might
make me so absurdly false, as to
have put the sixe confessed
Tropes in the compasse of these
<hi>Foure words,</hi> hath played me a fine
tricke of legerdemaine, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
the Particle &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the words following are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
implyed, and putting it
up in his pocket. And for your
Lordship, after your often rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of that &amp;c. so distinctly
set downe, to connive at him in
such a vile piece of Conning (I
had almost said Coozenage) truly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13230:21"/>
it was not honourably done. As
for example, your Lordship is
Catechising your Sonne, saying,
My Sonne, remember you get by
heart the twelve Articles of your
Creed, <hi>I beleeve in God the Father
Almighty,</hi> &amp;c. By and by your
Suggester pulleth you by the
sleeve, saying, O my Lord, you
told your sonne of twelve Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Apostles Creed; and
now you affirme that all the
twelve Articles are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in these seaven words; <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in God the Father Almighty.</hi>
So hee, leaving out the &amp;c.
what would your Lordship say
to such a stupid cavillation?
would you indure it? Yet is this
just parallel to his first Exception
against mee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:13230:21"/>

now? albeit this his falshood be

expounding the word, &amp;c. yet
notwithstanding, as if boldnesse

mee that I have not proved any

any one Trope in these

The second is, that I my selfe have
not confessed any Trope in
them. What not my selfe, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gester?
blush you not, who have
read the Booke 2. Pag. 72. Where,
in the first Section, there is a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:13230:29"/>
proofe specified in this speech of
Christ <hi>[This is my body]</hi> in two
words, the Pronoune <hi>[This,]</hi> and
the Verbe <hi>[Is.]</hi> And divers pages
following are spent wholly in
proofe of both.</p>
                  <p>His other Assertion is, that no
<hi>Catholike</hi> (meaning, Romish Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
hath beene alleaged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
any Trope or figure in these
words of Christ, <hi>[This is my body.]</hi>
So he, although knowing right
well, that I produced (Booke 2.
pag. 88.) your Romish <hi>Glosse,</hi>
authorized by Pope <hi>Greg.</hi> 13.
(which therefore ought to be of
equall estimation with many
Romish Doctors put together)
which Glosse saith: <hi>This Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is called the body and blood of
Christ improperly, so that the sense
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:13230:29"/>
is, This signifieth Christs Body.</hi>
Which is the proper and expresse
language of us Protestants. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
in the Booke 2. pag. 78. the
Title of a Section is this: <hi>That the
Pronoune,</hi> [This] <hi>in these words
[This is my Body,] is Tropicall;</hi>
which I proved out of your Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Doctors, by an Induction
of the divers senses of the word,
<hi>This:</hi> which, whether it demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
<hi>Bread,</hi> or <hi>Body of Christ,</hi> or
<hi>Individuum vagum,</hi> yet every way
is the sense improper and figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
In the first, by the Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Doctors on all sides. In
the second, by the confession of
divers Romanists, which called
that Sense <hi>Absurd.</hi> In the third, by
other Romish Authors, who
condemne this, as being <hi>full of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13230:30"/>
Absurdities.</hi> And all were discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
at large in my Booke 2. cap.
1. &amp; 2. in five full leaves; yet your

all this. It may be your Lordship

                  <p>IT seemeth <hi>strange</hi> to this my

my selfe. Is not this
kindly spoken, and to my credit?
But to the matter. I thinke it not
<hi>strange</hi> in him, who hath beene
deprehended in so many falsities
already, that He should not deale
ingenuously in this. For in my
Booke, writing professedly upon
the <hi>words of Consecration,</hi> I proved
exactly out, of the Confession of
the <hi>Arch-bishop of Caesarea,</hi> that
those words <hi>[This is my Body]</hi> are
not properly the words of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration:</hi>
But in my Letters to
your Lordship, speaking but <hi>obi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tèr</hi>
of them, I called them <hi>Words
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:13230:31"/>
of Consecration,</hi> by that liberty of
Schooles, <hi>Dato &amp; non concesso;</hi> than
which what kinde of speech can
be more familiar among men?
One is to pay unto your Lordship
twenty pounds, and in tendering
the payment unto you, saith,
There is here (my Lord) sixteen
pounds in silver, &amp; foure pounds
in good gold: upon tryall, the
gold is found to be counterfait,
yet the man is instant, saying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
and againe, The gold is
good: and your Lordship per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
his pertinacie, saith unto
him, Friend, as for your good
Gold, take it to your selfe, and
pay me my money in silver. Now
commeth your Suggester upon
you, saying, This is strange my
Lord; You said once that the gold
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:13230:32"/>
was counterfait, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
it, and now you will call it
good gold.</p>
                  <p>Just so dealeth your Suggester
with me, Who called these words
<hi>[This is my Body]</hi> words of <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,</hi>
only in imitation of the
Romish phrase, and not in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
thereof. But of this
more hereafter. Yet now what
is all this to the point in question?
(which is) why your Suggester
did so fraudulently conceale the
Particle [&amp;c] when he made his
first Exception against me? Just
as if a man, being questioned for
having found about him some
hidden, and concealed, stolne
stuffe, should by way of digressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
turne his talk to another mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
telling that it seemeth <hi>strange</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:13230:32"/>
unto him that this his Examiner
(the justice of Peace) had bound
over to the Assizes three of the

Whether this Evasion could satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie

                  <p>BUt seeing that contrarily I

(as you have heard already) a

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:13230:35"/>
there may be some Trope in
[Hic calix est novum Testamentum

knew that in my Treatise (Book

two words,</hi> Cup, <hi>and</hi> Testament,
<hi>are to be improperly and</hi> Tropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
<hi>understood, by the Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(first) of your learned</hi> Bishop
Iansenius: These words, Cup, and, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
<hi>(saith he)</hi> cannot be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken in that speech of Christ [This
Cup is the new Testament in my blood;]
whether the Cup be taken for the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
used for drinking, which was a
temporall thing, and therefore could
not be the Testament of Christ, which
is aeternall: or else whether it be taken
for the matter in the Cup, for it being
the Cup of the new Testament, could
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:13230:35"/>
not be the Blood it selfe; <hi>So he. Next
was the Confession of the</hi> Ies: Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meron
<hi>(in the same page)</hi> The Cup
being taken for the thing contained in
the Cup: and, Testament, for the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacie

                  <p>All these were then, in your

and yet he now, playing

in, saying, <hi>Perhaps some of our

out of the Booke 2. pag. 72.
where the Title of the Sect: is set
downe in these words; <hi>That a
figurative sense is in these words of
Christ, [This is my body:] from the
Principles of Romish Schooles.</hi>
Which was also performed, by
proving a figure in the Pronoune,
<hi>This,</hi> in the same speech of Christ
[THIS <hi>is my body:]</hi> which word,
<hi>This,</hi> (by confession on both
sides) must relate either to <hi>Christs
body,</hi> or to a <hi>common substance,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Individuum vagum,</hi> or else to
the word <hi>Bread.</hi> But, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of your owne Doctors,
the Pronoune, <hi>This,</hi> could not
properly demonstrate <hi>Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
because (by your Romish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine)
Christs body, at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation
of the word, <hi>This,</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:13230:42"/>
was not yet present in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Neither could it properly
betoken your <hi>Individuum vagum,</hi>
or <hi>confused substance,</hi> because (by
the confession of Others) that
sense is <hi>full of absurdities.</hi> Lastly, if
it should betoken <hi>Bread,</hi> as to say,
<hi>This bread is my body,</hi> then (say they,
with unanimous voices) it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
not to be <hi>Tropicall;</hi> even

Asse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which point may be more
Emphatically confirmed by the
other words, which you call <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secratory,
[This is my blood:]</hi> where
the Pronoune, <hi>This,</hi> relateth to
the <hi>Cup,</hi> wheresoever that speech
of Christ is recorded in Scripture,
<hi>Matt.</hi> 26. 27. and <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. thus <hi>[He
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:13230:42"/>
tooke the Cup and gave It</hi> (the Cup)
<hi>to them, saying, Drinke ye all of This,</hi>
(viz. Cup) <hi>for This</hi> (namely still,
<hi>Cup) is my blood.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> cap. 22.
and <hi>S. Paul. 1. Cor.</hi> 11. rehearse
Christs words thus: <hi>[This Cup
is the new Testament in my blood.]</hi>
So that the word, <hi>This,</hi> pointeth
out alwaies the <hi>Cup.</hi> But the <hi>Cup</hi>
cannot properly be called <hi>Christs

The first Reply is to perswade a
Lord, that I had but two Romish
Doctors, to witnesse, that when
Christ said <hi>[This is my Body, Given
for you]</hi> he meant, <hi>Given shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his death on the Crosse,</hi> by a <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
called Enallage.</hi> And when he
said, <hi>[This is my blood, shed for you]</hi>
he had the same meaning, of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to bee shed at his Passion:</hi> and
that I had not the greater part of
their Doctors to verifie my
words, when I said, <hi>Adversarii
nostri confitentur, Our Adversaries
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13230:47"/>
confesse.</hi> Which is an unjust Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning,
because although (Book
2. pag. 87) I used the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
but of Two; yet Booke 6.
pag. 6. I produced a witnesse
without all Exception, even your
learned Bishop <hi>Iansenius,</hi> testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that in these words of Christ
<hi>[This is my blood, shed for you] by the
word, Shed, is Commonly understood</hi>
(saith he) <hi>the Future time, when it
was to be shed upon the Crosse.</hi> Where
the <hi>Common understanding</hi> (you

                        </p>
                        <p>His second Aberration is,

then was your other words, <hi>[I

thousand, discussing this point,
would sweare that the word,

The reason may be this,
<hi>Dici de, sequitur in esse in,</hi> that is to
say, never can any thing be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
properly of that, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:13230:56"/>
(whose sentence I alleged, Book

                           <hi>(saith your

more: whereby it is proved also, his
true blood never to be any where
without his body. <hi>Our third wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
was your</hi> Ies. Coster, <hi>thus:</hi>
Christ <hi>(saith hee)</hi> suffered a true
effusion, or shedding of blood upon the
Crosse, his blood being separated from
his body: but here <hi>(namely in the
Sacrament)</hi> is onely a Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Blood. <hi>So hee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To reduce these Confessions
into forme of arguing. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
there is a true <hi>Effusion,</hi> or
<hi>Shedding of Blood,</hi> there is a <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:13230:56"/>
of Blood</hi> from the Body. But
Christ, neither at the time of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting
this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> nor yet
after his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> had any
true <hi>separation of Blood</hi> from his
body. <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee had not either
then, or after, any true and proper
<hi>Shedding</hi> of blood. And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
cannot his Blood be said
<hi>properly</hi> to be <hi>Shed</hi> in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Where now will your

                        <p>IT is a jolly matter to see a man
turne to his wits againe. The
Suggester saith (as well as can
be wished) that it is now plaine,
that the word, <hi>Cup,</hi> is put for
the liquor in the Cup: whereby
is confessed that it is plainly a <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative</hi>
speech; as when one
saith to his friend, Sir, take you
my Purse to keepe, meaning,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:13230:60"/>
the money in his purse. Such
speeches may wee allow to be
current, but yet not to be direct
speeches, as the Suggester would
have it. But will it please your
L<hi rend="sup">p</hi>: to aske of your Suggester, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
this confession, what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of that your Suggester,
who talked even now of an
<note n="*" place="margin">See a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove N. 20.</note> 
                           <hi>hundred thousand, who denyed any
Trope in the words, Cup, or Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
against the opinion of some
few;</hi> and was encountred with
a greater number than hee
brought, and is now confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by his owne Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
where is the <hi>Vertigo</hi> now, my
Lord?</p>
                        <p>His quaint Crotchet of <hi>Peeple</hi>
and <hi>People,</hi> though peradventure
it be applauded by you, or some
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:13230:61"/>
ignorant people, yet cannot be
but hissed at by any of sound
judgement; because in our
question, concerning the word,
<hi>Cup,</hi> (the word, <hi>Cup,</hi> being put
for the liquor in the <hi>Cup)</hi> it
doth necessarily vary the sense:
because the <hi>Cup</hi> is no more the
<hi>Liquor</hi> in the Cup, than the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
in the Cup can be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called the Cup. But whether
the word be written <hi>Peeple,</hi> or
<hi>People,</hi> it altereth not the sense of
the word, and is therefore sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
applyed to our Question
concerning the <hi>Cup.</hi>

                        <p>His third Untruth is, by intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

                        <p>Nor this onely, but (Booke 1.
pag. 641.) I shewed the generall
doctrine of the Church of Rome,
in the point of <hi>Concomitancie,</hi> to
be this, viz. <hi>That Blood is still in
the veines of Christs body, as it was
before the consecration of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
So that Christ is received
as whole man in his perfect bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
whereupon I inferred, that,
because a man could not properly
drink the blood of a man, whose
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:13230:71"/>
blood is still in the veines there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
therefore can hee not be said
<hi>properly to drinke it,</hi> because it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
under the forme of a solid
body, and not under the forme
of blood, or any liquid thing. As
yet therefore <hi>Maldonate,</hi> and <hi>Brere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
remaine our faithfull Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates.
And if your Suggester shall
prove the contrary, I shall thinke
that hee was a sober man, when

which is in controversie. And
the matter in Controversie is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

<hi>Drinke,</hi> whether they be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

and figuratively. Some of
your Doctors hold them to be
properly spoken, others deny this,
and say, this is <hi>a false sense</hi> (as you

will needs play the Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
saying, that <hi>they agree in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
namely, in the matter in

their <hi>maner of speaking;</hi> although

                        <p>Iust as if when the Lords in

his owne Crowne and life, even

our Protestant Reasons are so

of your <hi>Inquisitors,</hi> in
expunging out of the
Bookes of Romish Doctors all
their ingenuous Confessions,
whereby our Protestant doctrine
and defence hath been avouched
and justified, I have called a <hi>Book-butcherie.</hi>
If your Lordship should
know any great Personage que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned
about any Criminall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licts,
some whereof were also
Capitall Transgressions, to have
violently cut out the tongues of
all such, whom hee did suspect
could bring any matter of Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
against him, would your
Lordship thinke much to heare
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:13230:82"/>
this cruelty called a <hi>Butcherie,</hi> and
not rather judge such a fact to be
a most infallible Argument of a
guilty Conscience in that partie?
even so the <hi>Indices Expurgatorii,</hi>
wherewith the Testimonies of
your owne Authors, witnessing
for our Profession in their Bookes,
be so many <hi>Indices,</hi> yea <hi>Iudices,</hi> to
convince and condemne your
now-Romish Church to bee an
unjust and shamelesse Patronesse
of a false Cause. What the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
of this practise must bee,
mine owne experience can best
tell. I alleaged out of <hi>Polydor Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill</hi>
a sentence expressely printed
in his first Edition, out of <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor's</hi>
owne Originall and Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphe:
which sentence by your
<hi>Indices Expurgatorii</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:13230:82"/>
to be there blotted out,
and afterwards to be left out in
the next Editions <hi>of Polydore,</hi> and
so it was. <hi>M. Parsons</hi> finding the
sentence wanting in the latter E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of <hi>Polydore,</hi> rayleth downe
right upon me, and noteth mee
for a notable <hi>falsificator,</hi> never ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
knowledge of the truth of
the Allegation, as it was set down
and is now to be read, in the first
proper and true Editions of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydore.</hi>
Can there then be a more
Satanicall Art of delusion, than
this is of your <hi>Indices expurgatorii,</hi>
whereby you may have a faculty
to play the Theeves, by stealing
out of the Bookes of your owne
Romish Doctors, all such their
ingenuous Confessions, marked
for defence of the doctrine of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:13230:83"/>

                        <p>IF I should deny this, I should
contradict my selfe, who in
my latine Apologie, (part. 2.
lib. 5. cap. 4.) have defended this
Position, by the Confession of
your owne writers, to bee the
Confutation of the Extravagant
glosses of your <hi>Popes,</hi> and Popish
Doctors. Among which wee
may reckon that of <hi>Pope Innocent</hi>
the 3. who, to prove that his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Authority was above the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall,
alleaged that Scripture
<hi>Gen. 1. God made two great Lights,
the Sunne to governe the Day, and
the Moone to governe the Night.</hi>
And now our Suggester will
have you, in effect, to know, that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:13230:85"/>
this is but a <hi>Lunatique Argument,</hi>
because it is <hi>Symbolicall,</hi> no way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to prove that the <hi>Imperiall,</hi> as
the <hi>Moone,</hi> had borrowed its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from the <hi>Papall,</hi> as from
the <hi>Sunne.</hi> Your Pope <hi>Boniface</hi>
the VIII. argued thus; <hi>Luc. 22.
Peter said to Christ, Behold here are
two swords:</hi> and <hi>Christ answered, It
is enough. Hee said not</hi> (saith your
Pope) <hi>it is too much, and therefore
both the Temporall and Spirituall
Sword are in the Pope,</hi> as he is <hi>Vicar
of Christ.</hi> So he, which Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
your Suggester now tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
to be no better than a <hi>woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
dagger,</hi> or rather a fooles bable,
because this kinde of <hi>Symbolicall
Reasoning is of no force.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
this Papall Crotchet hath
beene (in my Latine Apologie
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:13230:85"/>
part. 2. lib. 5. cap. 28.) confuted
by your two Jesuites, <hi>Maldonate,</hi>
and <hi>Suarez,</hi> as being a <hi>violent
distorturing</hi> of holy Scripture.</p>
                        <p>The same may be said of your
two eminent Cardinals <hi>Baronius</hi>
and <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> from that Text
<hi>Act.</hi> 10. where, in a vision, it
was said to <hi>Peter, Kill and Eate:</hi>
which being spoken of the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and eating of beasts, the first
word, KILL, your <hi>Baronius</hi> ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
against the state of <hi>Venice,</hi> to
shew that the <hi>Pope</hi> being S. <hi>Peters
Successor,</hi> had power to compell
them by violence. The other
word, EATE, <hi>Bellarm.</hi> wresteth
to prove the <hi>Pope</hi> to be the <hi>Head
of the Church,</hi> but why? <hi>For, to
eate</hi> (saith hee) <hi>is the property of the

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:13230:86"/>
                           <hi>Symbolicall</hi> (I had almost said, <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall)</hi>
profanations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
might be produced out of
your Romish Writers, upon all
points of Controversie, which
justly do fall <hi>(quasi in spongiam)</hi>
upon this <hi>Thesis, viz. Symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Arguments make no necessary
Conclusions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But what maketh this against
us, concerning the matter in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
which is the <hi>figurative</hi>
words of Christ, <hi>This is my body?</hi>
The position maketh onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, who extract either a
<hi>Literall sense</hi> out of a <hi>Parabolicall</hi>
&amp; <hi>figurative</hi> speech, as <hi>Origen</hi> did,
when having read that Scripture,
<hi>There be some that castrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for the Kingdome of God</hi>
(which was but a Parabolicall
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:13230:86"/>
speech) he did really, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
foolishly castrate himself. Or
else, when men turne the words
of Scripture, properly and literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spoken, into a <hi>figurative</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
as your Popes dealt with
<hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moone,</hi> and with <hi>Peters
Swords.</hi> But by that <hi>Thesis</hi> was it
never forbid, whensoever in
Scripture the name of the thing
signified is attributed to the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol
or signe, that then the <hi>Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall</hi>
and Sacramentall speech
should be judged <hi>Tropicall.</hi> But
this kinde of exposition was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
approved of Christ, and
by his Church. So here, Christ
taking <hi>Bread,</hi> and breaking <hi>Bread,</hi>
which was the Symbol and
signe of Christs body, and saying
of the same <hi>Bread This is my body]</hi>
                           <pb n="140" facs="tcp:13230:87"/>
it is not possible that the sense
should be <hi>Literall,</hi> but altogether
<hi>figurative,</hi> as hath beene most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
&amp; copiously proved unto
you by direct confessions (in my
Treatise of the Masse, Booke 2. p.
84.) of your owne Divines, &amp; by
examples in Scripture, (lb. p. 85.)
to wit, the <hi>sign</hi> of the Passing over
called the <hi>Passover; Baptisme,</hi> the
<hi>sign</hi> of <hi>regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> called <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
the <hi>Rock,</hi> but a <hi>signe</hi> of Christ,
called <hi>Christ:</hi> in each one of these
the symbols being a signe and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
the speech must infallibly be
figurative. And therefore <hi>Bread,</hi>
being a <hi>figure</hi> of Christs body, is
called <hi>Christs body figuratively.</hi> But
your Romish literall exposition,
from this <hi>Symbolicall,</hi> hath beene
proved to be as false as the other
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:13230:87"/>
is true, by the confessions of your

it is <hi>Spirituall bread</hi> of the

none of all these, for I said, that
though <hi>Iudas received the bread of
the Lord,</hi> yet he received not that
which the other Disciples recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
namely, <hi>The Bread the Lord:</hi>
whereby I distinguished, <hi>The

                     </p>
                     <p>Our second Argument is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from S. <hi>August.</hi> his other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Generall Rule, concerning
<hi>Eating.</hi> For Christ, as he said <hi>Take
my body,</hi> so he said also, <hi>Eate, this is
my body:</hi> to teach, that such as is
the <hi>Being</hi> of a thing (be it proper,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:13230:91"/>
or figurative) such is the <hi>Eating</hi>
thereof. But of <hi>Eating Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
there was alleaged unto you
(Booke 2. pag. 100.) the generall
Rule of S. <hi>August.</hi> to wit; <hi>Whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the word,</hi> or <hi>precept of Christs
speech doth command any flagitious
thing, it is figurative<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as for example)
where it is said, Except you eate the
flesh of the Sonne of man.</hi> So hee.
And that we may understand he
excluded all Corporall eating of
Christs body, whether visible, or
invisible, he explaineth his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to have beene <hi>Spirituall</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by the mouth of the soule, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
us in his next words, <hi>Wee
Eate, in beliefe of Christs passion, by
a secret and profitable remembrance
that Christs flesh was crucified for us.</hi>
So hee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:13230:91"/>
                        <hi>S. Aug.</hi> his third Rule was
produced (Booke 2. pag. 95.)
which strikes at the heart of the
Question, viz. <hi>That Sacraments be
Signes, which have the appellations of
the things, which they represent: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do they carry the names of the
things themselves.</hi> So hee. And
this is verified by the example,
which you have already heard, to
wit, the <hi>Signe of the Passover,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Passover: Circumcision,</hi> the
<hi>Signe of the covenant,</hi> called <hi>the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:</hi>
the <hi>Rock,</hi> the <hi>Signe of
Christ</hi> in his passion, called <hi>Christ:</hi>
and <hi>Baptisme</hi> the <hi>Signe of Christs
buriall,</hi> called his <hi>Buriall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But where (will you say) shall
wee finde in <hi>Augustine</hi> the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the question, which is, that
the <hi>signe of Christs body</hi> is called
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:13230:92"/>
his <hi>Body?</hi> which would put the
point out of all question. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
even in the place above ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
out of <hi>S. Augustines</hi> owne
words, saying that <hi>As Baptisme is
called Christs buriall, so is the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the body of Christ called his
body.</hi> Which is likewise said by
S. <hi>Aug.</hi> out of another part of his
workes, and hath beene cited,
Booke. 6. pag. 36. which satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
your objected Testimony out
of S. <hi>Aug. Not to interpret the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Scripture Allegorically, except
there be some other manifest Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Scripture, whereby other more
obscure places may be illustrated.</hi>
Here I might adde, that if the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Christ be properly so called,
and accordingly extant in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
then being (as your
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:13230:92"/>
Church teacheth) properly offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
it should be a proper Sacrifice.
But S. <hi>Aug.</hi> (cited, booke 6. p. 36.)
hath taught you that <hi>The body of
Christ is so said to be sacrificed here,
by a Similitude, as Easter day is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Day of Christs Resurrection.</hi>

                        <p>All these are the Consequences
of your Literall Expositions of
these words of Christ, wherein
you have had S. <hi>Augustine</hi> an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Adversary from point to point;
saying of the first, <hi>Our eyes see
Bread in this Sacrament</hi> (speaking of
<hi>Bread after consecration,</hi> as hath
beene cited, booke 3. pag. 119)
And of the second, in concluding
against <hi>Heretickes</hi> an <hi>Impossibility</hi>
that <hi>Christs body could be in two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
at one instant,</hi> as namely, in the
<hi>Sunne and Moone,</hi> (as was allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:13230:93"/>
booke 4. pag. 171.) And this
hee confirmed, by teaching that
it is a property of the <hi>Deity</hi>
(whereby the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be God) to be in diverse
places at once, as I related unto
you Booke 4. pag. 187. Lastly,
hee is Adversary to the third
point also, determining that <hi>every
Body, whatsoever, filleth the place
wherein it is, and cannot be whole in
any part thereof,</hi> which you might
have red Booke 4. pag. 192.</p>

both of the ignorance
and malignity, which your
Suggester bewrayes in this Exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.
For, first, none but an Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
would have objected a
Contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in these two Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
because they were spoken
in a different respect. For speaking
of an ordinary Case, I said (and
truly) that the <hi>Sacrament ought to
be consecrated by a lawfull Minister:</hi>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:13230:104"/>
but in an extraordinary Case,
wherein it is not possible to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the lawfull Calling and
ordination of the Minister, it is
otherwise. And this sense I suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
explicated (Booke 7. pag.
117.) by calling this second, a
<hi>Case perplexed,</hi> and <hi>Indeprehensible.</hi>
In which difference of Respects,
I may say of <hi>King Saul,</hi> that he <hi>was,</hi>
and <hi>was not a Prophet.</hi> Because if
the word, <hi>Prophet,</hi> be taken for
one, whose ordinary office and
function is to prophesie, so was
<hi>Saul</hi> never accounted a <hi>Prophet.</hi>
But if, by <hi>Prophet,</hi> be understood
onely an extraordinary Rapt and
<hi>Act of Prophesying,</hi> so is it true
which is written of him, <hi>And
Saul was reckoned among the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
Next, the scope and ayme
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:13230:104"/>
of the Suggester is (as he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed)
to charge mee with wrong
Allegations of my Authors, yet he
saw no more in this, but (as his

not inferre that he omitted the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall

<hi>[Doe this]</hi> were words of <hi>Command</hi>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:13230:112"/>
whether wee understand <hi>[Doe

<hi>Non item</hi> (as I said) <hi>not to

Both the Bookes have been now

hath there not appeared any one

                  <hi>He that justifieth the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,

               <p>THe <hi>Aegyptian dogge,</hi> passing

and there of the water, not daring
to lappe any space of time any one
where, for feare some <hi>Crocodile</hi>
catch hold of him, and devoure
him. I once published a booke
called a <hi>Full Satisfaction,</hi> written
for the discovery of the <hi>Rebellious
Positions</hi> and <hi>Practises of Romish
Priests. M. Parsons</hi> fell upon it,
with all the strength of his wit,
singling out here and there that
which he thought might seem to
impeach my sincerity in some
Allegations of Authors; but the
most materiall points, concerning
the <hi>Rebellious Doctrine</hi> it selfe, he
commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly pretermitted in, I think,
an hundred places: and was not
this to lappe here and there, and
runne away? And good reason,
for in these pretermitted places
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:13230:117"/>
were solid proofes of <hi>Romish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliousnesse,</hi>
a <hi>Crocodile,</hi> which he
durst not meddle with in that his
Dispute.</p>
               <p>His nimblenesse and agility in

One I may not omit, which

your <hi>merry tale</hi> with a mad trick,

in this <hi>forme of Syllogisme,</hi> wherein
hee meant to expresse the greatest
skill hee had, hee bewrayed the
grossest errors he could, if he had
studied to be absurd. For besides
three other Faults, which were
repugnant to all <hi>Rules of Logick,</hi>
the master-peece of his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,

Fourth Errour, by changing of

of this Allegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was this; <hi>It
is a malicious Minister, having neither
simplicity nor truth, but of a lost co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
by a manifest &amp; malitious cavilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Harken now to his falshood;
for, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was made known that
I alleaged that passage out of the
genuine book of <hi>Polydore,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
originally it was set down by
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:13230:122"/>
himselfe, and not in the after-Editions,
corrupted by their Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Inquisitors: wherein the
former sentence of <hi>Polydore</hi> (as
most of all his other ingenuous
Confessions) have beene since ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
and cancelled, which made
any whit for advantage to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
causes; M. <hi>Parsons</hi> (a <hi>Sober
reckoner</hi> forsooth) maketh no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Reckoning</hi> but this<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See the Encounter,</hi> cap. 14. p. 229.</note>: <hi>I had
not</hi> (saith hee) <hi>that part of Polydore
by mee.</hi> Do you marke, my Lord,
hee could not say, that hee was
ignorant of that <hi>perfect Edition</hi> of
<hi>Polydore,</hi> which might have justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
mee, but that <hi>Hee had it not
by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then the Case is this; The
Accuser M. <hi>Parsons</hi> hath by him a
false knave (that I may so call their
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:13230:123"/>
               <hi>corrupted</hi> Edition of <hi>Polydore)</hi> to
witnesse against mee, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of another witnesse, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
fellow (namely true <hi>Polydore</hi>
in his owne <hi>first Edition)</hi> who
would have justified mee to the
full, whom hee passeth by and
neglecteth, because hee is not at
hand. And what is, if this be not
a wilfull blindnesse? which may
deserve his own <hi>Bitternesse</hi> to be
retorted upon himselfe, whereby
he traduced mee for <hi>A man of no
truth, and of a lost conscience.</hi>

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:13230:123"/>
               <hi>Where is this mans innocency?</hi> (saith
M. <hi>Parsons) Can this be ignorance?
can it be done but of purpose? and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
by a guilty conscience: what
may a man beleeve of all that he saith,
when we see him intangled in such foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
trechery?</hi> This is his <hi>bitter vomit</hi>
(as your L<hi rend="sup">p</hi>: seeth) but now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his falshood; for I alleaged
the <hi>Colen Edition</hi> of <hi>Carerius,</hi>

came greedily to see it, and found
the word,<note place="margin">

And at length M. <hi>Parsons</hi> was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to credit mee thus much, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had said, <hi>There was but one
Edition of Carerius.</hi> Therefore was
his former Invective the venome

promised a Discovery of
Crimes, which I laid to the

much. For, their preferring a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
in your Church, which (as
they confesse) <hi>Worketh lesse grace
to the soules of Christian men,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

extolling of the <hi>Wisdome</hi> of

Their swearing to admit all
<hi>Apostolicall Traditions,</hi> and yet to
reject some, I named <hi>vile Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
(whereof there is a full Section
in the eighth Booke.) Their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing,
in point of Antiquity,
their <hi>Custome</hi> of <hi>Three,</hi> or at most

                     <hi>Madnesse.</hi> And lastly, your <hi>Iesuites</hi>

to dispense with the divine Law
of God, I held to be <hi>Blasphemie</hi> it
selfe.</p>
                  <p>All these Points were truly
discovered, and now my <hi>Style</hi> is

Who perceiving the Proofes,
whereby I made evident such
Doctrines to be <hi>Sacrilegious, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous,
&amp;c.</hi> are you more offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with me, for calling them so,
than with them for making them
such? Say now, upon your second
thoughts, is this a conscionable
Taxation, my Lord? I would
gladly have learned what termes
your Lordship would have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
in this case? would it have

tolerable; the <hi>Perjury</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
So indeed doe they, who
masque the visages of Sins with
the vizard of Virtues; calling
<hi>Drunkennesse,</hi> Good-fellowship;
<hi>Pride,</hi> comelinesse; <hi>Rage,</hi> valour;

                  <p>THe matter was this, (but
you will bee loath to heare
it.) Your <hi>Romish Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
reckon up some Thirteene
<hi>Miraculous Apparitions of true flesh,
and true blood seene</hi> (as they say)
<hi>in the Eucharist;</hi> and of the <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
of one from the other, the
<hi>Blood</hi> being <hi>shed,</hi> and <hi>dropping out,</hi>
and the like. To these I oppose
your Romish Theologues and
Divines, confuting such kinde of
<hi>Relations</hi> by good and solid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
saying that in such <hi>Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
there could not be <hi>true flesh:</hi>
and others denying absolutely
that <hi>Christs blood can bee properly
said to be shed out of his Body,</hi> after
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:13230:136"/>
his Resurrection, as you have
heard in the first part of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge.
Hereupon I came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
saying; <hi>If therefore credit
may be given to your judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
then are, and were the Authors
of those Apparitions flat Liars, their
Reporters incredible Writers, and
their Beleevers stark Fooles.</hi> What
have I here said, which your <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi>
(who have avouched as
much as I alleaged) will not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
in condemnation of such
Delusions? Only I called the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,</hi>
because of their indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(metaphorically) <hi>Vncleane
Beasts,</hi> accordingly as ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
haue done the Beleevers of
Fables. And did I not contrarily
call your Divines, by way of
commendation, <hi>Cleane Beasts
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:13230:137"/>
that can chew the Cud?</hi> that is, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
Truth from falshood, as
likewise the holy Fathers have
taught; in which respect (as you
see) I named them also <hi>Iudicious
Divines.</hi> I demand therefore why
your Lordship should bee more
displeased with mee, for calling
those <hi>Historians Liars,</hi> and their
<hi>Beleevers Fooles,</hi> than with your
owne learned <hi>Divines,</hi> who
proved them to be such? True
zeale and jealousie for God
would hate all feinings of <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
as the worst kinde of <hi>Lying,</hi>
being indeed the counterfeiting
of the <hi>Seales</hi> of God Almighty;

                  <p>HEre are two as odde and
uncouth Instructions, as
I have heard of. The first
is, that no Writer may use <hi>Bitter
speeches</hi> against a Crime, which
he, in his owne judgement, dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
may deserve such <hi>Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:</hi>
so that it must bee a Crime,
now, to name a crime: to see one
reeling in the street, and after
wallowing in his owne vomit,
and to call him <hi>Drunkard;</hi> to
heare one swearing outragiously,
and to say he is <hi>Profane;</hi> to know
one lead a lewd &amp; filthie life, and
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne him of <hi>Iasciviousnesse.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:13230:140"/>
The second Advice is, that no
<hi>Person of Eminence</hi> ought to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
Any publikely with <hi>Termes
of Bitternesse,</hi> in case of an <hi>High
Article of Faith.</hi> This would make
well for <hi>Arians, Pelagians,</hi> yea and
<hi>Atheists</hi> themselves, if in denying
of one, or other, or all <hi>Articles of
Faith,</hi> they should not bee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
censured, according to their
deserved appellations; both cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably,
to reduce them from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
yea and seemely too, because
there is no better <hi>Seemlinesse,</hi> than
Congruity, as of manners, so of
words. And this is, when <hi>Epithets</hi>
are sutable to the things and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of whom we speake. S. <hi>Paul</hi>
was a person of <hi>great Eminence,</hi>
and so was <hi>Peter</hi> also, yet <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
<hi>Peter to his Face,</hi> for
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:13230:140"/>
that, which if it had not beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,

somewhat of <hi>Charity:</hi> but if

                  <p>THanks, my Lord, that
you thinke I would not
argue so absurdly, or
otherwise than I have done in
other Cases, Rationably, I hope;
Conscionably, I am sure. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
then, that the <hi>Tenth Reason</hi>
there given is expresly against
<hi>Romish Priests</hi> only, who were
possessed with those former <hi>sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Positions</hi> therein <hi>discovered.</hi>
This was the Subject of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
in the same Book (Pag. 47.)
confirmed by the Examples of
your <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Iesuites</hi> (Pag.
50.) together with the <hi>Practices</hi>
of your <hi>Popes,</hi> in the place ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
(pag. 51.) The Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:13230:146"/>
was, that <hi>No Loyall Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
could be expected</hi> (said I)
<hi>from This Religion,</hi> (to wit) <hi>This</hi>
of that rebellious doctrine of
your <hi>Romish Priests</hi> and <hi>Popes</hi>
there specified; and of no other.
Which you might as well have
seene, at the first Reading, by
distinguishing the Persons to
whom, from the persons against
whom I writ. The former were
the <hi>Romish Laicks</hi> only, whether
they were of the Nobilitie, or
Commonaltie, to whom the
Epistle Dedicatorie was directed,
whom I called <hi>seduced,</hi> because
of their Popish Religion; and
sought to perswade them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
lest they also might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
in this other point of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Rebelliousnesse;</hi> telling them
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:13230:146"/>
that I had presented unto them
that <hi>Discovery</hi> of such Doctrines
of their Priests, <q>
                        <hi>To the end that
you</hi> (said I) <hi>through the detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their</hi> (viz. Priests) <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
might be brought to a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion
of their Inchantments, not
doubting but when you have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the damnablenesse of their
Doctrine, you will easily avoid
the danger of their Charme.</hi>
                     </q> And
in the end of the same Epistle
(pag. 52.) immediately after the
words now objected against
mee, I added, saying: <q>
                        <hi>Thus have
I proved, deare Brethren, the
dogmaticall doctrine of these men,</hi>
(viz. Romish Priests) <hi>not confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them, for this I understood
was not your desire, but revealing
them.</hi>
                     </q> Wherein Any, at the first
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:13230:147"/>
sight, may observe that I produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the <hi>Romish Laicks,</hi> as men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
ignorant of such <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Positions,</hi> and <hi>Practices;</hi>
when I said, <q>
                        <hi>Not doubting but
when you have perceived the
damnablenesse of their Doctrine:</hi>
                     </q>
but what <hi>Doctrine?</hi> what but
that, which was there proved to
be <hi>Rebellious?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As yet therefore I held them
guiltlesse, and plainly distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
them, in this respect, from
<hi>Romish Priests and Doctors,</hi> who
were proved to be the Authors
of both; and thereupon also, in
the end of the same Epistle, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the foresaid Laicks; <q>
                        <hi>Be

you against all such poisonable

<hi>Subjection,</hi> approved by <hi>Pope

Romish <hi>Priests,</hi> which is to bee
subject with a <hi>[Donec]</hi> that is, <hi>Vntil</hi>
there may be power to resist; (as
you have read in that booke of
<hi>Romish Rebellious Positions,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:13230:150"/>
which kind of <hi>Subjection King
David</hi> would have called <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish,</hi>
as that of the <hi>Horse</hi> and <hi>Mule;</hi>
which are to bee <hi>held in with Bit
and Bridle.</hi> Onely I cannot but be
sensible of the Injury done unto
mee, by your violent enforcing
upon mee a purpose to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
all <hi>Lay Romanists</hi> for
being of that <hi>Religion</hi> there <hi>disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered</hi>
and condemned, which
was direct Treason.</p>
                  <p>You ought to have consulted
with the College of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and
those <hi>Parisian Doctors</hi> would have
taught you to distinguish even
of <hi>Romish Religion:</hi> discerning
ROMISH, in respect of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Court,</hi> from <hi>Romish,</hi> in respect
of the <hi>Romish Church</hi> in generall.
The first, they know, hath often
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:13230:150"/>
harboured seditious documents,
which they have alwayes impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
for the defence and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the <hi>Gallicane Regalities</hi>
and <hi>Liberties.</hi> Besides, there are
two wayes to free your <hi>Laicks</hi>
from suspition of that <hi>Doctrine,</hi>
which your <hi>Priests</hi> hold, and
professe among themselves. The
one is their owne Ignorance, in
not knowing it; the other their
Incredulity, in not beleeving it.
I could give instance in that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
which I had from an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Personage, of knowne
and experienced loyalty to his
King and State, saying, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
his much acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with <hi>Iesuites,</hi> yet they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
uttered any Doctrine to him
savouring of <hi>deposing of Kings,</hi> or
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:13230:151"/>
disturbing of Kingdomes for
Religion-sake. This, said I, as it
may bee an argument of their
subtilty in concealing their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
<hi>Positions;</hi> so much more
may it bee an evidence of your
Lordships Integrity, which (as it
were) commanded them silence.
Secondly, the not beleeving your
<hi>Priests,</hi> in such Doctrines, is the
next point of security, which I
will presume many of your
Laicks (albeit otherwise profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
of the Romish Religion)
doe detest, even from the unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
heinousnesse thereof, as a

                  <p>BVt stay a while, my Lord
(I pray you) and tell mee
what minde you thought
mee to bee of, when I writ so
unto you? If you imagine that
I was of any other, than I had
beene, at the writing of that
<hi>Booke of Discoverie,</hi> and of those
words therein, whereunto you
have laid your whole Battery, to
oppugne them, you are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
and that you may know
I have good evidence for mee, to
say thus much, and for your
Lordship to be perswaded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
in my next Booke (written in
the defence of that Booke of <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery)</hi>
I gave this expresse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement,

                     <q>
                        <hi>viz. I have
writ against our Romish Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
but not without note of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
and distinction; being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
perswaded that Divers, even
the Zealous among them, partly by
light of the ingrafted Law of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and partly from some glimpse
of the Gospell of Christ, doe abhor
such Doctrines and Practices,
which have beene discovered in
cases of Rebellion and Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>

                  <p>How like you this, my Lord?
Doth this please you? Then may
it satisfie you for my then-mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
when I said, <hi>No loyall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
can be expected from this
Religion,</hi> (namely, of those <hi>Popes</hi>
and <hi>Priests.)</hi> And accordingly
may it remove the <hi>Scandall</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:13230:154"/>
from thence by your
Lordship and <hi>Others.</hi> As for your

make, they are no way pertinent
to our discourse; I chuse rather
to heare of your friendly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.</p>

Function, against the Calumnies
of his Adversaries, hee, lest hee
might incurre the suspition of
Arrogancy, preoccupated, saying,
<hi>I speake foolishly,</hi>

every Minister of Christ, of the
lawfulnesse of a selfe-Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
whensoever it shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
from him by the iniquity
of an envious and detractive Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,
upon a necessity of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
and dignifying his owne
<hi>Calling.</hi> In which respect, <hi>Selfe-praise,</hi>
although it may seeme <hi>foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
in the outward sound and
eares of carnall men, yet doth it
relish of true prudence, in it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persense,
and in the apprehension
of every Conscionable Christian.
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:13230:157"/>
Wherefore if any words have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
from my quill, which may
seeme to savour of a like affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I shall desire it may receive
the like Construction; even for
that I can, in like manner, excuse
my selfe, saying, <hi>You have compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
