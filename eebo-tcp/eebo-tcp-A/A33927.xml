         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>EADER,</hi> the reaſon why I have brought forth this ſmall Treatiſe to publike view, is for thy infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, who haſt been a long time deluded with a Miniſtry of Antichriſt, under the name and notion of a Miniſtry of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe the Lord hath ſaid it, that we ſhould ſhew no pitty to Babilons inhabitants, much leſſe then to the ring-leaders of that mysticall confuſion, that at this day the world lyeth in, under the name of Church, Ministry, Ordinances, &amp;c. Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance may ſuppoſe that the end of this diſcovery, is to make them contemptible in their perſons, names, &amp;c. flowing from a private ſpirit of revenge. But truly friends it's not ſo, I can ſay truly, the Lord hath taught me another leſſon, to doe good to ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, pray for them, ſeek their converſion; and I can ſay truly, that it would be a great joy to me, to ſee any of them enlightened, renewed, changed; but when I behold the great confuſion that is among
<pb facs="tcp:103593:3"/>
the men of the earth, principally occaſioned by the Miniſters of the earth; thouſands, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, lying not only dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, but in profeſſions and Ordinances, &amp;c. I ſay not only for <hi>Zions</hi> ſake, but for the ſake of the poor deluded Soul, who live below and without truth; under the profeſſion of ſomething like the externall part of truth. I cannot hold my peace, till all theſe falſhoods and deluſions fall to the ground, and the glory of <hi>Zion</hi> be more known and lived in: read, and judge with an impartiall ſpirit, and I truſt you ſhall not finde one word of a malicious ſpirit; not like Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> reckoning up perſonall infirmities, for then I could ſay much more; but clearer and true diſcoveries of deceivers under the name and notion of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thus much by way of information, as likewiſe by way of prevention of thy miſ-underſtanding of that which followeth: by him who remains thy friend, and the truths ſervant.</p>

               <hi>The firſt Parrallel.</hi> BETWEEN The <hi>JEWISH</hi> Prieſts and Levites: And thoſe of our times.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>The Jewiſh Priests and Levites, and thoſe of our times are as like, as if they had indeed been all the Sons of one Father, the Tribe of <hi>Levi;</hi> they ſay the Lot of Gods own Inheritance, although in truth, there is no ſuch thing.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Jewiſh Prieſts were to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, to make Peace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for the ſinnes of the People; and herein they were a Type of Chriſt, <hi>Levit.</hi> 9. with <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. This hath been one principall work of the Prieſts of theſe latter times to offer Sacrifice, to make peace and reconciliation for ſinne; this hath been their end in praying, and preſſing others to pray, that ſo they might make peace and reconciliation for tranſgreſſion, although not poſitively, yet circumſtantially, there it ends, though Chriſt be often mentioned, yet not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103593:4"/>
without prayers, teares, reformation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to fit the Soul for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. Hence it is, that ſinners are ſo often preſt to weeping and mourning, that ſo they might weep and mourn out ſinne, and never tell of believing, till ſinne be wept forth, and then believe; nay, that there is no ground of believing till then: a meer deluſion, a very lye. Hence it is likewiſe that prayers, dayes of Humiliation, have been ſo much exalted, as peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and the glory of both of internall conſolation as of externall deliverances hath been given unto it, and the Prieſts muſt have the greateſt ſhare of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Why? Becauſe they pray moſt, and beſt, they doe it by office; it is their trade to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, to make peace: others may pray wel, and doe much, but they can pray better, becauſe they doe it by office; this I have heard aſcerted by them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore affirme it; and thus they have not only been peace-makers themſelves in their own apprehenſions, but have directed others to the ſame work, to the ſame way: what is the converſion taught by them but only a legall converſion from ſinne to duty. If thou canſt forſake thy ſinnes, pray, hear Sermons, walke holily, my ſoul for thine thou ſhalt be ſaved; thus ſetting up ſelf-reformation, duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the roome of Chriſt, making peace.</p>
            <p>Oh wonderfull and horrible deluſion! And People, look well unto your ſelves, if you build upon this foundation, and ſo live and die, you are like to be undone for ever; <hi>If the blinde lead the blinde, both are like to fall into the pit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Jewiſh Prieſts were to interpret the Law, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8. 7, 8. Hence it is that Chriſt cals them Lawyers, <hi>woe be unto you Lawyers, &amp;c.</hi> and this hath been the work of the ſecond Tribe a long time, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103593:4"/>
the Law, to ſet people a working for life, Preaching the Law, and threatning judgement, to drive to Chriſt, and not to draw with the cords of love, which is ſutable unto the Goſpel. True it is of late, that many of them have learned to ſay ſomething of the externall part of the Goſpel, becauſe elſe they cannot be eſteemed, neither will their wares goe off any longer, people having received ſome farther light; but this they doe with much confuſion, ſome times almoſt looſing themſelves; and ſome-times thwarting, and contradicting themſelves often in a Sermon Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be well known that not many years ſince, it was a matter of fact, and deſerved cenſure, to preach Chriſt freely, juſtifying ſinners without themſelves, duties, prayers, tears, reformations, to fetch in love, conſolation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not acting to God from the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, peace, love, power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that they might enjoy Communion with God, and receive from him what is their own in him.</p>
            <p>3. The Jewiſh Prieſts were to purifie their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>Levit.</hi> 12. They were to be accounted unclean, untill the time of their purification: this is likewiſe the work of the Prieſts of theſe times, to purifie the women, until which time they are accounted as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, unclean. <hi>I wonder what is become of the Lamb and the Pigeon, commanded for a burnt and a ſin offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> verſ. 6, 7. It's like, the Prieſts-prayer muſt paſſe in ſtead of it; only note, in one thing they paſſe the Prieſts then, though they come ſhort in the <hi>Pigeon</hi> and <hi>Lamb,</hi> (that is) they provide a purifying Sacrifice, and ſell it unto the women inſtead of a <hi>Lamb,</hi> a prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or two for four pence, although skarce worth it.</p>
            <p>4. The Jewiſh Prieſts were to live by Tythes and offerings, they had no portion given them in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103593:5"/>
land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and this hath the Prieſts of our times appropriated to themſelves, they are Prieſts of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> as themſelves ſay, and they doe the worke of Prieſts, and therefore they muſt have the maintenance of Prieſts: to wit, Tythes and Offerings, and this they plead for by Divine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Right, from the Old Teſtament, becauſe ſet a part for the Prieſts then under the Law. It is true, ſome of them plead for it from humane right, becauſe the Parliament (ſay they) have given it unto them: but it ſeems it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not much with them, whether it be of Divine, or Humane right, ſo they have it, they deſire not much to diſpute the buſineſſe; take him Gaoler is the ſtrongeſt ſyllogiſme they deſire to make uſe of, for confirmation of this, as of all other their Divine Humane rights.</p>
            <p>I ſhall a little examine the buſines about Tythes, before I paſſe this particular, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 21. You ſhall finde that Tythes were given to the Tribe of <hi>Levi; And behold I had given the Children of Levi all the tenth in Iſrael for an inheritance, for the ſervice which they ſerve, even the ſervice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, &amp;c.</hi> Where you may take notice:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That Tythes were ſet a part by God, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. 3.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Comanded only of the Jewes, and none elſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To be paid in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and no other Land mentioned in Scripture; the Jewes were not commanded to pay it, till they came into that Land, where the reſt of the Tribes <hi>had inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> given them, and the <hi>Tribe of Levi none,</hi> for the tenth was reſerved for their <hi>Inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, It was to be paid to that Tribe, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> and none elſe, if any other Tribe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103593:5"/>
or perſon had appropriated it to themſelves, they had been Theeves and Robbers; <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
            <p>How this illigitimate Tribe, that now appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priates Tythes to themſelves, can free themſelves from the like, I leave it to all men to judge.</p>
            <p>5. The end of the payment of Tythes, was for the livelihood of thoſe who ſerved at the Altar. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. They were under a Legall adminiſtration, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were to live of the Law; but thoſe who are under the Goſpels diſpenſations, they live of the Goſpel: that is, free, for Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> people are a free people; and Miniſters who live in a free Covenant of Grace, can truſt God for their maintenance, and be content with a little: as Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who could ſay truly, that though they had nothing, yet they poſſeſſed all things.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>It is ſaid,</hi> Gen. 14. That Abraham paid Tythes to Melchiſedeck, which was not in the Land of Canaan, neither yet to the Tribe of Levi.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, yet note:</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Abraham</hi> gave the tenth voluntarily, and freely, not by compulſion, as now the Prieſts demand it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Abraham</hi> paid the tenth of the ſpoil which he had taken in war from the enemy, and none elſe, which is no warrant for the taking of the tenth of all; therefore all that can be expected thence, is but the tenth of ſpoil taken in war, if the Souldiers are free to give it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This tenth of the ſpoil was given to <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> and not to them; therefore unleſſe they prove themſelves to be <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> this Scripture will doe them no good at all, which I thinke they will not aſſume; for he was an imediate Type of Chriſt: <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. as were the Prieſts and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103593:6"/>
Levites, to whom Tythes were due, and that by an Ordinance not of man, but of God.</p>
            <p>4. The Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi> paid Tythes to this <hi>Melchiſedeck;</hi> therefore no ground for our ſecond Tribe to demand Tythes, but rather to pay Tythes, if <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> come to demand them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> If Tythes were not paid, how ſhould Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters be maintained, for it is meet that thoſe that preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel; but we know by experience that many places would skarce maintaine their Miniſters bread, if they were not compelled by a Law; therefore it is convenient that Tythes ſhould be paid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt it is an evident ground, that they are no Miniſters of Chriſt, that will not truſt him for their maintenance, and a principall note of infidelity; a wonderfull diſhonour to Jeſus Chriſt, to pretend to be his Servants, and yet will not truſt him, but will be caring and providing for themſelves. It is, as if a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant conditioning with his maſter to ſerve him, ſhould not only indent with him for maintenance, but would be caring and providing for himſelf: nay, not only caring and providing for himſelf, but conditioning with another man to care for him, and to give him wages; this is the dealings of the Prieſts with Jeſus Chriſt, they will not truſt him: Queſtionleſſe it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are none of his Servants, they doe not his work, if they did, they would be content with his wages, which is free gift, as well Temporally as Spiritually.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Thoſe who cannot preach without Tythes, or any other ſtinted maintenance, it is an argument they ſeek more their own bellies, then the honour of Jeſus Chriſt, like unto your day-labourers, that will be ſure to know their pay, or elſe they will
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103593:6"/>
not work: ſuch belly-gods are they, that if any put not into their mouthes, they even prepare war againſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Did ever Chriſt and his Apoſtles practiſe the like?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They never ſet forth an holy Ordinance for Tythes, they never vext men at Law in all their lives; nor ever were they Wolves unto the Sheep, but rather as meek Lambs, in ſufferings deep.</p>
            <p>It is very juſt that they ſhould be pined for want, and that for theſe Reaſons:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe they would not truſt Jeſus Chriſt, but forſake him, and truſt to the power of Magiſtracy to maintaine them; the civill Sword is the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall of their livelyhood; now can they blame Chriſt, if he care not for thoſe that will not truſt him? Did he ever engage himſelf by promiſe to ſuch a people, if ever their Maſters that ſet them a work, from whence they expect power to fetch in mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, leave them? As ſuch a time will come: Who then will care for them, when their mountaines will not cover them any longer?</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe they thruſt ſuch a people upon Jeſus Chriſt as he never owned, no wonder if ſuch a people ſtarve their Teachers; and juſt it is it ſhould be ſo, for they ſtarve, delude, and undoe their Souls, telling them they are Chriſtians, a Church, when they are not: was ever ſuch a thing as this heard of, that a Miniſter of Chriſt ſhould be in doubt of ſtarving, unleſſe he provide for himſelf by a Law? A wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and horrible thing is committed in the Land, <hi>The Prophets propheſie lyes, and the Prieſts bear rule by that means, and the people love to have it ſo, and what will you doe in the end thereof?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Becauſe the Lord hath ſaid it, <hi>The Lions</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:103593:7"/>
               <hi>ſhall lacke and ſuffer hunger, but they that fear the Lord and wait upon him, ſhall want nothing that is good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quere.</hi> Are the Prieſts of England Lions?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, For firſt, Lions get their prey by violence, ſo doe they; witneſſe their holy Ordinance for Tythes, witneſſe their taking by violence from thoſe to whom they might better give; witneſſe their greedy deſire to devour with open mouth, the Lambs of Jeſus Chriſt, would the Parliament once grant their unſatiable deſire; Witneſſe their Petition to the Parliament to have them burnt with the letter B. to have them proſecuted as felons for their lives: this was the good will of the Prieſts to the poore Lambs of Jeſus Chriſt: but when their Lion, the Lord Jeſus ſhall roar out of <hi>ZION,</hi> all the Beaſts of the Forreſt ſhall tremble, which will be ere long.</p>
            <p>Thus are they like to be a Generation that muſt ſuffer want, at leaſt in their Souls, in the time of drought, when the Towers fall. <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> 65. 11, 12, 13. Yea, (to wit) <hi>The Saints ſhall eat, but they ſhall be hungry, yea, ſhall drinke, but they ſhall be thirſty, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. The Prieſts were the greateſt enemies to Jeſus Chriſt in thoſe times; they it were, who hired <hi>Judas</hi> to betray him; who cryed out, <hi>crucifie him, crucifie him,</hi> a way with ſuch a ſellow from the earth; they it was who gave large monies to the Souldiers to belie him, and to ſay his Diſciples ſtole him away by night, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This hath been, and is the practiſe of the Prieſts in our dayes, under the notion of Hereticks and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, to deſtroy the Saints: And why? Becauſe the Saints diſcovering truth, will deſtroy their errour and falſhood; we deſire not the Magiſtrate to deſtroy
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103593:7"/>
them, but liberty to profeſſe and practiſe truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which they are not able to ſtand, no more then a morning dew before the Sun.</p>
            <p>6. The Prieſts under the Law, <hi>they loved the uppermoſt rooms at feaſts, and the chief places in Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men Rabbi, Mat.</hi> 23. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quaere.</hi> Were the Scribes and Phariſes Prieſts?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, See <hi>Nehem. 8. 9. Ezra the Prieſt, the Scribe, &amp;c.</hi> And this is the expectation of the Prieſts now, there need no Scripture to prove it, they love the uppermoſt rooms at Feaſts, and uſually have it; and the Chief Seats in the Synagogues, that was in their places of meeting, now (not for want of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance) commonly called Churches, who have the Chief Holy high place, where none may come but themſelves, with their conſent, with reverence be it ſpoken: and greetings in the markets, the cap and knee is much expected, and to be called of men <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi,</hi> that is, Maſter; although there be no maſter in a Towne beſides, yet this Prieſt muſt be a maſter: this is one of <hi>Solomons</hi> evils that he had ſeen under the Sun, <hi>Servants on Horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> back, and Maſters walking on foot as ſervants, on the ground;</hi> they are the peoples Servants, they expect their wages from them. Oh horrid pride! Was ever ſuch a thing as this heard of? What, Servants become their Maſters Maſter. Servants on horſe-back, riding, ruling, and their Maſters on foot, made ſlaves unto them.</p>
            <p>7. They built the Tombes of the Prophets, and garniſhed their Sepulchers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 29. but they perſecuted Chriſt and his Apoſtles: ſo doe our Prieſtly Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites, pretend to have high thoughts of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, but are as ready to perſecure and kil the diſciples &amp; followers
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103593:8"/>
of Chriſt as ever the Prieſts of old; they build their Tombes, and garniſh them; they ſpend all their time, and ſtudy to finde out the minde of Chriſt and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in their writings, and yet come infinitely ſhort of it: <hi>Chriſt</hi> a Carpenter, <hi>Paul</hi> a Tent-maker, <hi>Peter</hi> a Fiſher-man, all of them poore tradeſmen: yet theſe men of Arts and parts, ſpend all their time, and make uſe of their Authors, to underſtand what they write: but if God raiſe up any Fiſher-man, Carpenter, Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, or the like, in him, and by him, to reveal his truth; O away with ſuch a fellow from the earth! he is a Mechanick fellow, one of no breeding, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Originall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I warrant you if Chriſt and his Apoſtles were on the earth againe, they ſhould finde as hard meaſure from them, as ever from the Prieſts of old:</p>
            <p>What doe theſe but Juſtiſie the proceedings of all perſecutors that have gone before them, and ſo bring upon themſelves all the righteous blood-ſhed, even from the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> untill this time?</p>
            <p>8. And finally the end of all was, that they might hold up their Religion, and in that their honour and profits: they knew, if they ſhould let Chriſt alone, he would deſtroy their religion, and ſo lay them open unto contempt. This is likewiſe the ground of our Prieſts oppoſing and perſecuting the Saints, to uphold their Nationall Church, Religion, Worſhips, &amp;c. And therein their Honour, <hi>viz.</hi> the Cap and Knee of the Vulgar; their profits, Tythes, their great DIANA; This they can doe, but by the exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their humanity, Arts and parts gotten by their induſtry at the Univerſities; and this is their greateſt Goddeſſe DIANA; by which they uphold all, and hope to keep in their credit, with the ignorant ſtill; but this Diana learning in the things
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103593:8"/>
of God, will fall and break its neck ere long, as Dagon before the Ark, it begins to tremble already, it dares not look truth in the face, without the power of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to aſſiſt, &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>Second Parrallel.</hi> BETWEEN <hi>Them: and</hi> Simon <hi>the Sorcerer, Acts</hi> 8.</head>
            <p>SImon Magus his ſin is looked upon by thoſe who know not what it was, as very horrid and wicked, and it's true, <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid that he declared himſelf by it, to be in the gall of bitterneſſe, and bond of iniquity; the Prieſts give a very high and learned interpretation of it, (that is,) to buy a Parſonage; and this they call Simony, who ſo buyes a Perſonage as Simon Magus: But I believe if we come to examine what was Simons ſinne, we ſhall finde more Sir Simons, then many are aware of.</p>
            <p>Simons ſinne, it was Firſt, to buy the gifts of the holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>2. As it is generally underſtood, to that end he might ſell them again, and its likely to be true, for it would have gotten him much credit as well as profit;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103593:9"/>
he ſhould have made a good exchange, for the loſſe of the ſpirit and power of divination and ſorcery, to have gotten the Spirit of God, by which, he thought quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to inrich himſelf.</p>
            <p>So then, here was Simons ſin, he would have bought the gifts of the Spirit, to that end he might have ſold them, that ſo he might inrich himſelf by it. See then how the Prieſts of our time run parrallel with him.</p>
            <p>I argue it thus, Thoſe who buy their gifts, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſell them, are guilty of Simon the Sorcerers ſinne. But the Prieſts of <hi>England</hi> buy their gifts of purpoſe to ſell them, and get gain; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Prieſts of <hi>England</hi> are guilty of Simon the Sorcerers ſin. That this was Simons ſin, is cleared; that who ſo doth the like, are guilty of Simons ſin, is unqueſtionable; that only which remains to be proved, is, That the Prieſts of <hi>England,</hi> buy their gifts of purpoſe to ſell them. Firſt that they buy them it will appear, theſe things conſidered.</p>
            <p>Firſt, What gifts and abilities they have, are hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, ſuch as they have attained in the Schools, which coſt them much money, as well as induſtry for the gaining of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Their appropriating all abilities of Preaching, to themſelves, accounting it altogether impoſſible for any other to have any gift at all, who have not bought it like themſelves; ſo that they doe not only buy themſelves, but deny any other way of attaining gifts, to any elſe; pretending Phyloſophy to be the Mother of Theology; Ah horrible blaſphemy againſt the Spirit, who is freely given, and freely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates as it pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Their owne confeſſion when they come to ſell, that their gifts coſt them much money;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103593:9"/>
and therefore they ſell them at the deareſt rate.</p>
            <p>2. That they buy of purpoſe to ſell, appears:</p>
            <p>Firſt, It was the great end for which they were by their Parents dedicated and ſet a part a purpoſe to get a living, even as they binde their children Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It appears by their practiſe, which is, to ſel all, and that at the deareſt rate too; witneſſe their looking after the greateſt and fatteſt livings, where there are moſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Calves, Lambs, and Tyth-pigs, Corne, Hay, and Gleb-land, thither uſually is their call; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe their often removing from a leſſer living to a greater, ten pounds more <hi>per annum</hi> is a ſufficient call from one Parſonage to another; witneſſe their firſt quere, what it is worth <hi>per annum,</hi> and if that pleaſeth them, then they go, never querying what Saints be there: nay, ſo far are they from that, if they hear that Chriſt and Saints be there, then they dare not come there, for fear that light will diſcover their darkneſſe; witneſſe their indenting for thus much by the weeke, in caſe they ſupply any place that wants, which is ſo much clear gain unto them, for their own pay goes on nevertheleſſe at home; witneſſe, their Petitioning the Parliament for increaſe of maintenance, where they judge it is too little, although ſome of them have 40. pound, ſome 80. li. ſome 100. li. ſome 140. li. and beſides a great wrong to the Parliament, or at the leaſt to the Subject; witneſſe the common practiſe of Towns and populous places, who beholding their temper, dare not attempt the getting of a Miniſter, as they deſire to be called, untill they firſt make up, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by petition to the Parliament for the ſtates mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which poor Soulders want, or ſome other way, a round ſum of money; which being effected, puts courage into poore ſimple Country men to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103593:10"/>
into their preſence with all lowly ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>Sir, we have maintenance for an honeſt man, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps 100 li. <hi>per annum,</hi> if that be too little, wait a while, and perhaps 200. or 300. appears, which will ſerve to make up the bargain: juſt as a ſervant who puts forth himſelf for a year will make the moſt of his ſervice; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it's true, the conditions are contrary.</p>
            <list>
               <head>Conditions.</head>
               <item>
                  <hi>INprimis,</hi> I will be your Miniſter (which ſignifies a Servant) or rather your Lord, on condition that you will engage to give me thus much by the year in money, or Tythes, as the condition is. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Prieſts of <hi>England</hi> preach for hire.</item>
               <item>2. I will be your Miniſter in name, provided I may be your Lord; for ſo they are indeed, and rule over you, and you will become ſubjects and ſlaves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, bow down before me, and call me your Maſter. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Prieſts of <hi>England</hi> are the peoples Lords.</item>
               <item>3. I will be your Miniſter, provided you will not contradict me in what I preach and teach you, if you will believe as I believe, and teach you; or rather then this Article ſhall make a breach, they will get an Ordinance from the Houſe of Lords, which will ſerve their turn to prevent any from objecting againſt their Orthodox Divinity, although never ſo humane: O hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible impiety! Men may now preach lyes by a Law.</item>
               <item>4. And finally, I will be your Miniſter, provided that I may have my liberty to remove again when I ſee a call: which is like to be the next Parſonage tendred, wherein 10. or 20 li. <hi>per annum</hi> be augmented to his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103593:10"/>
yearly maintenance: as the hired ſervant keeps him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at liberty for his own advantage, at the end of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Thus the bargain is made, and the condition is drawn, the Prieſts now with much comfort and ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crety, fals a preaching, for he knowes to a peny what he hath comming in for every Sermon he makes. One thing by the way I cannot omit, which I have known: in caſe any one be ſo ſimple as to limit himſelf for thus much by the year, while he live, unto a people, they have a way to fetch him off again with credit as thus: refer it into the hands of a Jury of Divines (as they call them) although indeed but humane, the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple people agree unto it; judging theſe men, if any, will be honeſt.</p>
            <p>This Jury of humanes quaeries into the buſineſſe, finde that their brother hath engaged himſelf for life, perhaps for ſome 70 li. <hi>per annum,</hi> the more ſimple man he: Now within a year after, ſome 6 or 7 ſcore is tendred, the concluſion it delivered in, he may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſuſpend with his promiſe, and former engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being called unto another place.</p>
            <p>1. There is more maintenance, the great Lord that drawes; he is by the Scripture to provide for his own, or elſe he is worſe then an Infidell.</p>
            <p>2. There are perhaps more Souls, and ſo more need of a Preaching Miniſtry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus the man may lawfully remove, his brethren ſo determine it: And why? It poſſibly may be their own turn next; that this is truth: witneſſe Maſter <hi>Swayn</hi> at <hi>Trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> (with others) thus the minor appears, that the Prieſts of <hi>England</hi> buy, that they may ſell for advantage; therefore guilty of the ſin of Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus: ſo that the truth is, we have many Sir Simons amongſt us, though under fair pretences and colours:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103593:11"/>
only note one word by the way, wherein it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that they exceed Simon in wickedneſſe.</p>
            <p>1. Simon would have bought the gifts of the ſpirit, that ſo he might have done ſomething for his money: but theſe men buy humane gifts inſtead of the ſpirit, and ſet up, and ſell that, as if it were ſpirit.</p>
            <p>2. Simon had good thoughts of the ſpirit, he would have bought it: but theſe cry down the ſpirit, calling it a ſpirit of giddineſſe, and its like they know no other ſpirit, but that which comes from <hi>Oxferd,</hi> or <hi>Cambridge:</hi> Horrible blaſphemy againſt the ſpirit! <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>3. Simon did only deſire the ſpirit himſelf, not to limit it to himſelf, as thoſe who know not what the ſpirit is, who would have none to have it but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: no Fiſher-man, as <hi>Peter;</hi> or Tent-maker, as <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>4. And finally, Simon was made ſenſible of his ſin, might repent for ought that any one knowes; he deſired the Apoſtle to pray for him: but the Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts of our times are ſo farre from repenting, that they ſtill juſtifie themſelves in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and I am afraid, it will be a very hard thing to recover many of them to repentance, unleſſe when too late.</p>

               <hi>A Third Parrallel.</hi> BETWEEN <hi>Them, and the Artificiall Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing Tradeſman.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe oneneſſe between the Artificiall Tradeſman and the Prieſts, will appear, theſe few things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
            <p>The tradeſman, before he attains his craft, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, muſt firſt be an Apprentice ſeven years, that ſo he may get underſtanding and art in his calling, for there is ſome myſtery in every calling; therefore time is required for the underſtanding of it, which by the Law is not judged leſſe than ſeven years.</p>
            <p>So it is with the Prieſt; he muſt, before he can be his crafts-maſter, ſpend many years in the Schools, perhaps twice ſeven before he comes to maturity, at leaſt, he had need be one ſeven years in the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, commonly called the ſchools of the Prophets, the nurſery of piety, or rather of impiety and wickedneſſe, the well-head of Divinity, or rather humanity; and then by this time he hath gotten a pretty good head and hand, he is, its likely, able to make a ſermon now and then, or elſe he muſt needs be a very dunce, for he hath a very dull head that cannot learn his trade in ſeven years; yet ſo it comes to paſſe among theſe men very often, as well as other tradeſmen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome are more ready and handy in it then others, one can make two Sermons perhaps, while another can ſcarce make one:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103593:12"/>
ſo it is with your Shoomakers, Taylers, or any other handicrafts-man: and ſo like other tradeſmen, they prove differently; ſome prety honeſt in their way, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers knaves, ſome drunkards, others ſober, ſome whore-maſters, others chaſte, ſome more wiſe and crafty, others ſimple and fooliſh, and thus now their Apprentiſhip being expired, they are become Maſters of Art. The ſecond thing to be expected, is their freedome to ſet up their trade: ſo it is with the handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts-man eſpecially in the City of <hi>London,</hi> or other priviledge places, for a ſmall matter they are declared free-men of <hi>London.</hi> So it is with the prieſts, after they have ſerved their Apprentiſhips, gained the Art of making a Sermon, and before two, ſome of them; they now muſt get their freedom, which is the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and ordination of ſome principle men of the ſame Art; thus it is with the tradeſman, and thus it is with the Prieſts, that is, either the hands of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat, or ſome other Prelaticall, Epiſcopall creatures, newly Anabaptizeed into the name of Presbyters, or CL Aſſes.</p>
            <p>3. The tradeſman having obtained his freedome, he now opens ſhop-windows, and ſets himſelf to work: ſo likewiſe thoſe Prieſts, they have their ſhops, (<hi>viz.</hi>) their ſtudies full of good old books, Authors, Fathers, all expoſitures of Scripture, and they ſet themſelves to work, ſearch one Author, and another Author, and for the moſt part theſe are the fountains from whence they draw all: come to aſk their judgement upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny text of Scripture, you muſt tarry till they have looked their expoſiters, and then they will tell you what their expoſiters ſay, whether it be true or falſe; for you muſt note, they are not infalliable, nor Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall. 4. The tradeſmen muſt have a time to make their wares, he cannot make them with his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103593:12"/>
word, nor blow them together with the winde: the ſhoomaker muſt have his time to make his ſhooes, the Tayler to make a garment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when its made, its made, &amp; not before. So muſt theſe tradſmen of another nature have their times to make a Sermon, ſome a moneth, ſome two weeks, ſome one, ſome two or three in a week, when like to have good ſale, but a time they muſt have to make it up, they cannot preach by the ſpirit, alas! they know not what it is, they are ſtrangers unto it, they oppoſe it, this is that will throw down theſe Sermon-makers in concluſion; when poor tradeſmen, Coblers, Taylers, Tinkers, Plow men Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, all ſorts of men ſhall preach the everlaſting Goſpel, with ſo much light, life, and power, that will darken all the light of theſe Sermon-makers; and then none will buy their wares any more.</p>
            <p>5. When the tradeſmans ware is made, it is then fit for ſale, and he hath his free market in his owne town, he ſteps forth ſometimes into other markets, that ſo he may vend his wares at the deareſt rates, it is his liberty, and doubtleſſe he may lawfully doe it; and ſometimes when he wants ware, he buies of another to fit his cuſtomers, that ſo he may keep his calling go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſo it is likewiſe with our ſpirituall merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers when their Sermons are made, they have their market daies to ſet them at ſale, their Sunday or their Sabbath, the firſt day of the week: well might they, as I have heard them formerly, ſtir up people to come to their ſpirituall markets; for they ſell all, and that at an exceſſive, exciſed rate too, and they have their change of markets, if it make for their advantage; they can ſell one year perhaps for twenty ſhillings a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the next they have found a new market place, where they can ſell it may be for 40 ſhillings or three pound a Sermon, then Sermon-making is worth ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103593:13"/>
a goodly trade: many Gentlemen of note and quality bring up their children to this craft; and they can beſides this, break forth now and then a day into a new market, which ads unto the old ſtore, for this they are ſure, their own goes on at home, although themſelves keep market in another place; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when neceſſity, or idleneſſe drives them to it, they buy of other men, <hi>viz.</hi> Preach a Sermon of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans, if the people know it not, it goes for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, though ſometimes they can read along with them as they preach, but I muſt confeſſe this is ſomething baſe. Thus it appears, that our ſpirituall Merchants run parrallel with the temporall, and that Preaching is become a meer art amongſt men; and truly they have their ſhops full of godly wares; by which they delude and deceive ſouls, <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 11, 12. Opens their ſhops, or rather their pack, where he gives them the tearm of Merchants; and abundance of good ware there is, and they ſell all, and the ſouls of men too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quere.</hi> How may they be ſaid to ſell the ſouls of men?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In that they own thoſe to be Chriſtians, which are no Chriſtians, and thoſe to be Churches, which are no Churches, for this very end, that they may inrich themſelves; thus they ſell ſouls, that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude and undoe ſouls under the name of Chriſtians for money; witneſſe their readineſſe to ſprinkle and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Infants, if their parents pay them Tythes, elſe not: they ſell the ſouls of men, for five or ten pound, they will forſake their cure of ſouls, as they call it, ſel them for gain, be a ſhepherd to them this year, ſell his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in them the next, go whither they will, he cares not, if he can get advantage: a very hireling, that doe not only fly from his flock when danger comes, but ſels his intereſt in them for gain, come what wil come of them, he cares not; although it's confeſt, it's better
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103593:13"/>
where they are not, then where they are, for there is ſome hopes of undeluding poor ſouls.</p>
            <p>Thus it evidently appears, that the artificial tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the Maſters of Arts the Prieſts, run parrallel together, as much ſpiritualneſſe in the one as in the other; I mean in relation to their calling; although its confeſt that the firſt is lawfull, the ſecond, altogether earthly, ſenſuall and deviliſh; only take notice of a word by the way, wherein it will appear, that the Art and trade of making and ſelling of Sermons, far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all other arts and trades beſides, and that in theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p>1. In their Gentility, they are maſters before e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they open their ſhops, or ſet up their trades.</p>
            <p>2. In their ſale, they uſually have the higheſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, they often ſell their Sermons (when cheapeſt) for an Angel; when one might buy as good in a book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers ſhop, and it may be a better for three pence, ſo that their ware comes uſually to a good market, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of late, except ſome poor ones, or Cavaliers, they its like would be content with a reaſonable mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket ſometimes, but its like ere long that this trade of Sermon-ſelling will be very dead and low, ſo low; that they will ſtand weeping and crying alas! alas! for no man buies their wares any more; and how will their honour, houſe-keeping and hoſpitality go forwards then?</p>
            <p>3. They have one great advantage more, they doe not only meet with the deareſt markets, but they can ſell one Sermon diverſe times, they can ſell a Sermon, and yet keep him to make and ſell twenty paire of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and yet have never the leſſe. Let any handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts man come forth and doe the like, if they could, they might well inrich themſelves: but was ever ſuch a thing as this heard of? What, ſell a thing, and keep a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103593:14"/>
thing, and ſell it again? Yea, and again too perhaps. Should I know a ſhoomaker ſell ſhooes, and yet keep them, and ſell them again, I would brand him for an arch cozoner, or the like of any other calling.</p>
            <p>4. Advantage, They can ſell that which is not money nor ware, as the proverb is; ſo it be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing it paſſes: a tradeſman muſt ſell that which is good, or elſe he ſhall be counted diſhoneſt, and the buyer hath ſo much liberty as to try it, to look into the goodneſſe of it, if he like it, he buyes it, if not, he leaves it; but theſe Merchants have gotten an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to compell men to receive what they bring them, be it good or bad: Oh horrid wickedneſſe! What, muſt we have it whether we will or no? You Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> ſtir up your ſelves, get you ſuch an Ordinance if you can, it muſt needs inrich you: What, ſell all manner of ſtinking wares by a Law? And none durſt queſtion it?</p>
            <p>5. They are Monopolizers too, they have gotten their Pattentees to Monopolize all to themſelves, none muſt ſell, nay, none may give, when they ſell; a wonderfull way to inrich themſelves, Was there ever ſuch a thing as this heard of? What, to Monopolize the gift of Preaching!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quere.</hi> Is not this againſt the liberty of the Subject?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, queſtionleſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quere.</hi> Have not the Parliament declared againſt it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quere.</hi> Was it not one end of the Parliaments war to free the Subject from it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, it was ſo pretended, and I ſuppoſe it was really intended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quere.</hi> Are not Monopolizes and Monopolizers much more dangerous and diſhonourable, in ſpirituall things then in temporall?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:103593:14"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, For firſt, Herein the free operation of the ſpirit is as much as lyeth in man prevented by it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Poor ignorant Engliſh men are much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuſed by it, who know not their liberty.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the ſpirituall Merchants of the man of ſin, the kingdome of Anti-chriſt, are inriched by it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quere.</hi> Did the Parliament thinke they had made a Patentee, and the Prieſts Monopolizers, when they gave them that Ordinance, that none ſhould preach but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſuppoſe they did not, if they had, they could not have walked in a way ſo directly againſt their own principles, their own Declarations, and the Subjects liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quere.</hi> May we not expect that the Parliament will call in this Patentee again?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, queſtionleſſe, when they ſee the evil of it, and it is the ſubjects liberty to expect it; it is that for which they have adventured their lives, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the loſſe of their eſtates; and therefore it cannot but be a great bondage and burthen unto the ſubjects, to ſee and feel the heavy yoak and bondage of Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polizers yet remaining.</p>
            <p>However, God will take their Patentee from them, for the Saints muſt ſpeak thoſe things they have ſeen and heard; notwithſtanding their engroſſing all into their own hands: Thus have I briefly, and plainly diſcovered the careleſnes and corruption of the Prieſts of <hi>England,</hi> notwithſtanding their fair pretences, not ſcandalizing their perſons, but diſcovering their evil conditions, to that end that Engliſhmen might not be enſlaved, eſpecially in their ſpirits, unto ſuch a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, who alone ſeek themſelves.</p>

               <p>

               <p>2. They were a type of all the Saints in Chriſt, for Chriſt and the Saints are one, and all the Saints are the Lords portion, an holy Prieſt-hood unto the Lord, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. no Prieſt-hood by office, but all the Saints are Prieſts.</p>

               <p>Is it not neceſſary, ſeeing the gifts of the Spirit are loſt, that there ſhould be a getting of thoſe gifts again by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane induſtry, as Tongues, Arts, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>

being loſt, Antichriſt ſets up the wiſdome of the fleſh in room of it, for in all things Antichriſt ſeeks to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Chriſt, as well in the fleſh, as in the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>3. The Saints are made pertakers of the ſame Spirit the Apoſtles were; for if the ſpirit of Chriſt be not in you, yee are none of his; Chriſt is in you, elſe you are reprobates, if ſo, then no need of all this Humanity.</p>
               <p>4. This Spirit of God manifeſt in the Saints, will diſcover and deſtroy this Humane ſpirit of Anti-chriſt; by things that are not in the worlds eyes, wil he bring to nought things that are.</p>

            </head>
            <p>1. IF ever the Lord made uſe of any as Miniſters of his minde, unto the people, that were bread idle at Schools and Univerſities all the daies of their lives, without a calling, as the Prieſts of <hi>England,</hi> but rather the contrary, as <hi>Moſes</hi> a ſhepherd, <hi>Eliſha</hi> a Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>David</hi> a ſhepherd, <hi>Amos</hi> a Herdſ-man; Chriſt himſelf a Carpenter, <hi>Paul</hi> a Tent-maker, <hi>Peter</hi> a fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erman? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>3. If ever Univerſities and Schools of humane learning were in Scripture, called the fountains, or well-heads of Divinity?</p>
            <p>4. Whether ever Chriſt and his Apoſtles did In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent with their hearers, what to have for preaching before they preached unto them?</p>
            <p>5. Whether ever Chriſt and his Apoſtles built their Churches by humane Authority?</p>

the Church, excluding the Saints, who out of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe and light, follow him?</p>
            <p>7. Whether ever Chriſt and his Apoſtles deterred any from Preaching the Goſpel, by the powers of the earth?</p>
            <p>8. Whether ever Chriſt and his Apoſtles made uſe of theſe two great bug-bears, ſo common in uſe with the Prieſts of <hi>England,</hi> to prevent the Saints from preaching the Goſpel, and the world from hearing them, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The approbation and ordination of the men of the earth. 2. Humane learning, the language of the Beaſt, without which men are in their account altogether unmeet to medle in the things of God?</p>

            <p>10. Whether ever Chriſt and his Apoſtles deluded the World, <hi>viz.</hi> the ignorant and prophane, with the name of Chriſtians; when there was no ſuch thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared?</p>
