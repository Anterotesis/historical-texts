            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE CASE OF</hi> John Coombes, Valentine Houſeman, <hi>and</hi> Edward Pearce.</head>
            <p>THE Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> having ſettled his Eſtate on Doctor <hi>Thomas Spratt;</hi> now Lord Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> and <hi>John Wildman</hi> Eſquire. In Truſt for payment of 5000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to the Duke himſelf, and for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Debts in a Schedule to the Deeds of truſt annexed, and ſuch other Debts as the Duke ſhould appoint; And the ſurplus for the ſaid Duke. And the ſaid Duke being minded to build a Houſe at <hi>Clifden,</hi> and that the Workmen ſhould be paid out of his ſaid Truſted Eſtate, by a Deed poll, dated the 24th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1676. declared and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, That the Truſtees out of Money to be raiſed out of the ſaid Truſted Eſtate, by Sale or otherwiſe, ſhould be ſaved harmleſs, and reimburſe themſelves ſuch Moneys as they ſhould pay or be engaged to pay for the ſaid Duke, though the ſame ſhould croſs the former Truſts, or upon what Account ſoever it ſhould be. And the ſaid Duke by the ſaid <hi>John Wildman,</hi> his Truſtee and Agent, propoſed to the ſaid Workmen, That if they would do the Plaiſterers, Joyners and Carvers Works in the ſaid Building, they ſhould be paid out of the ſaid Truſted Eſtate. And accordingly the 17th of <hi>March</hi> 1676. the ſaid Duke in the ſaid Work-mens preſence wrote and ſigned a Paper Writing, directed to the ſaid <hi>John Wildman</hi> one of his Truſtees, whereby he appointed him to pay the ſaid Workmen, which was done to the intent that the ſaid <hi>John Wildman</hi> ſhould be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized to pay the ſaid Workmen out of the ſaid Truſted Eſtate. And the ſaid Duke declared, That his whole Truſted Eſtate ſhould be lyable to make Satisfaction for what the ſaid Mr. <hi>Wildman</hi> ſhould pay, or be engaged to pay to the ſaid Workmen. Without which the ſaid Workmen would not have done the ſaid Works. And the ſaid Duke ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Surveyors to ſurvey and value the ſaid Works, and appointed the ſaid <hi>John Wildman</hi> to pay ſuch Bills as ſhould be Signed by his ſaid Surveyors. And the ſaid <hi>John Wildman</hi> in Purſuance of the ſaid Duke's ſaid Declaration and Appointment, imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſaid Workmen to do the ſaid Works, and promiſed to pay them for the ſame. And the ſeveral Works done by the ſaid Workmen, were viewed, ſurveyed and approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Prizes thereof aſcertained by the ſaid Duke's Surveyors, who ſigned the ſaid Workmens Bills, and the ſame were from time to time entered in a Book, kept by the ſaid <hi>John Wildman,</hi> by the ſaid Duke's direction for that purpoſe, and the Book ſigned by the ſaid Duke's Surveyors, to the intent, That the ſaid <hi>John Wildman</hi> might with more ſafety and certainty pay the ſaid Monies. And the ſaid Duke's Agents, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of the ſaid Duke's ſaid Declaration and Order, met the ſaid Workmen at the ſaid <hi>John Wildman</hi>'s Houſe in his preſence, and propoſed and promiſed to the ſaid Workmen ſeveral Mannors and Lands to be ſold for payment of the Monies due to the ſaid Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or to be conveyed to them for their ſatisfaction. And the ſaid Workmen not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to obtain their Monies, and being much ſtraightned for want thereof, exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Bill in <hi>Chancery</hi> againſt the ſaid Duke and his Truſtees, to recover their Monies out of the ſaid Truſted Eſtate. And at the hearing of the Cauſe in <hi>Chancery,</hi> the ſeveral Matters aforeſaid appearing to the Court by the Proofs in the Cauſe, the Court of <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi> was fully ſatisfied, That by the Matters aforeſaid, the ſaid Truſted Eſtate was lyable in Equity to the payment of the Monies due to the ſaid Workmen, and Decreed, That the ſaid Truſtees out of the ſaid Truſted Eſtate, ſhould pay the ſame, and the Intereſt thereof, from the time of the filing the Bill in <hi>Chancery,</hi> and ſhould ſell part of the ſaid Truſted Eſtate for that purpoſe; There being due to — <hi>Coombes</hi> 969 <hi>l.</hi>—16 <hi>s.</hi>—8 <hi>d.</hi> for Plaiſterers Work, and to —. <hi>Houſeman</hi> 1534 <hi>l.</hi>—12 <hi>s.</hi>—3 <hi>d.</hi> for Joyners Work, and to — <hi>Pearce</hi> 587 <hi>l.</hi>—5 <hi>s.</hi>—9 <hi>d.</hi> for Carvers Work.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Duke hath appealed from the ſaid Decree to the Lords in Parliament to have the ſaid Decree reverſed, and thereby to obſtruct the ſaid Workmen in receiving their ſaid Monies, which have been due to them above ſix Years.</p>
