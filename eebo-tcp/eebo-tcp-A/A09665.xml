            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Saith, that he then ſent his Sergiant Maior, towards the ſhip of the Generall, to aduertiſe him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his ſhip was in danger of ſincking, deſiring him to prouide thereupon, and to ſend ſome ſpéedy remedy. And that he incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the ſaid Sergiant was gone, (perceiuing that the water increaſed very much in his ſhip) did ſend two <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Gentlemen againe, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaide General, to let him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand yet more earneſtly their great néede and danger wherein they were of periſhing, and to bee drowned alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, if remedie did not come.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid Sergiant Maior, did returne again vnto him, before the other two might bee vnto the Generalles Ship, and brought with him, a Boate, to ſaue his owne perſon there withall if he would.</p>

            <p>That they came ſo néere, that they could ſpeake the one vnto the other, but yet that they did remaine that whole day in the ſelfe ſame ſtate.</p>
            <p>That towards the euening, he ſéeing his ſhip did begin to ſinck, and to ware ſo heauie, that with her full ſatle ſhe was not able to folow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Generall, he diſcharged two pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, therby to certifie his great perill, but hee had no aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer therupon, neither did his Sergiant Maior, and the other two Gentlemen before named, returne vnto him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, wherby he was that whole night very deſolate.</p>
            <p>Saith, that he thereupon tooke counſaile with his men, to know what theyr beſt remedie ſhoulde bee for to ſaue themſelues.

            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:15200:5"/>Saith, that after this, they met with another boate, the which did come ſomwhat néerer, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which he required to be brought into any Hauen appertaining vnto the King, and that therupon he departed from him, ſaying, that the Hauen of <hi>Dunkerke</hi> was right ouer againſt <hi>Fluſhing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That therupon, they went once againe from lande into the Sea, and that they knew not where they were.</p>

            <p>Saith, that towards the euening, his ſhippe remained ſtill, and could goe no further, and that hee was vpon ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen fadames, and did caſt his Ancker, and that the Fiſher came to ſpeake with him, ſaying that he would come the next morning againe to helpe them, but that he wold fiſh that whole night. That he did ancker within their ſight, and remained there about three houres, and afterwards he went his waies.</p>

            <p>Saith, that they were aſſured (hauing 50000. men on land) to bring that Kingdome very eaſily vnder their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, becauſe that the Engliſh nation is vſed to liue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie delicatly, hauing likewiſe no experience of war, &amp; that therfore they ſhold eaſily haue brought them vnder their feete, with their continual trauels &amp; troubles, the which they had not béene able to endure, as their Spaniſh nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would haue doone, the which is vſed to ſuffer hunger, thirſt, hardly to lie, not to ſléepe, and yet neuertheleſſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ready to their worke.

            <p>Saith, that thereof was not anie remembring or ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>Saith, that the occaſions which made the King to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take theſe wars, were, that it was not conuenient vnto
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:15200:8"/>
vnto the King to ſuffer and forbeare, that one <hi>Drake,</hi> with two or three rotten Ships, ſhoulde come alwayes, and at his pleaſure, to ſpoyle the Hauens of <hi>Spayne,</hi> and to robbe the beſt Townes thereof, and ſo to hinder the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation of the <hi>Indies.</hi> And that he did thinke with leſſer charge to ſubdue and to inuade <hi>England,</hi> then yéerelie to entertaine ſuch an Armie as this to defende himſelfe of ſuch inuaſions, and that if ſo bee that this Fléete doth not ſpéede at this time vpon <hi>England,</hi> that the King doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to ſende the ſame there againe againſt next Lent.</p>
