            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶To the right honourable my especiall good Lorde the Erle of Surrey: Thomas Churchyarde wisheth many happie Newe yeres, Fortunate daies and weekes, encrease of honour and vertue, with moste assured felicitie.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Knowe not my good lorde, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my boldnesse and presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption be greater, then the base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of my matter herein pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and I mynde to presente: consideryng the worthinesse of the personage, to whom I dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate my booke, and the weakenesse of my wit, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth vaine verses, where vertue of the mynde aboundeth. But for that I treate not of mere trifles, (nor meane to corrupt sound senses, and good maners with wanton wordes or leude rime) I am partly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded this myne Newyeres gift, shall giue your lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship delite, and purchace to my self the desired than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, that euery honest writer deserueth: Because the substance and effect of all my inuentions, are shadowed vnder the sheld of good meanyng: And a matter well meant (by the courtesie of true constructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) maie passe
<pb facs="tcp:5289:3"/>
the muster &amp; good opinion of the people, emong the best assemblies that looketh on the furniture I bryng, and ablenesse of my penne. And albeit some weapons want to beate backe the thompyng boltes of euill tongues (in my defence be it spoken) yet the Armour of right, and Target of trothe shall bee sufficient to strike doune the blowes, that hautie hartes with threatnyng thwartes can offer. And who so euer hastely or vnaduisedly through malicious wordes, hinders the credite of any honest workes, maie be thought both a rashe and a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall speaker, &amp; a busie medler in matters, thei neither mynde to amende, nor nor will suffer that the worlde shall speake well therof. But now farther to procede, &amp; enter into the cause of this my boldnesse, the troth is in callyng to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance à promes that I made, touching some verses. And honoryng in harte the Erle of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, your Lordshipps graundfather, &amp; my master (who was a noble warriour, an eloquent Oratour, and a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Petrarke) I could doe no lesse but publishe to the worlde somewhat that should shewe, I had lost no time in his seruice. And finding an other of his race and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse, who hath taste and feelyng in the good gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Nature, and noble vertues of his auncestours, (the hope of whiche graces, promiseth greate perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to followe in tyme to come) I thought I might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
<pb facs="tcp:5289:3"/>
a booke vnto your Lordshippe, named by myne owne liking Churchyards Charge. But now right no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Earle, the worlde louyng change and varietie of matter, waxeth awearie of freuoulous verses (because so many are writers of Mieter) and looketh for some learned discourse, by whiche meanes my barrain boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes maie remaine vnred, or misliked, and so lye on the Stationers stall, as a sillie signe of a newe nothyng, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worthe the buiyng, nor the regardyng. To that I maie aunswere (vnder pardon and correction) that the grounde whiche of Nature yeldeth, but Thistles or Brambles, maie bryng forthe no good Corne of it self, contrary to his operation and kinde. Nor a man that is accustomed to treate of trifles maie, not meddle with the deepenesse of graue argumentes. For as it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the searche and capacitie of a simple witte, to se in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any matter of importaunce, so it is necessarie that a pleasaunt and plaine companion, should alwaies be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied about pastymes, and namely at Christmas, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> little short tales, driues out a pece of the long nightes, and rather with mirthe to procure a laughter, then with sadnesse prouoke a lowryng: and he that sturreth vp the heauie myndes to light some consaites, is more welcome in euery place, then he that ouerthrowes the weake senses of common people, with curious imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb facs="tcp:5289:4"/>
and burthens bothe bodie and mynde, with wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of greater weight, then common iudgement can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and be able to beare. A tale or a toye mirrely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, pleaseth moste mennes eares: and an earneste sadde argument, either rockes a man a slepe, or maketh the hearers a wearie. And the nature of Rime is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue the spirites, or moue a smile, when many a one is scarce pleasauntly disposed. A Rime goeth on sutche feete, standeth on sutche ioyntes, and rappeth out sutch reasons, that wisedome taketh pleasure in, and follie will make a wonder of. The woordes by inuention hits a thyng so iompe, and kepes sutche a decorum and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode, that bothe order and measure is seen, in the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng conueyance of the verses, especially if the swete and smothe sentences bee sifted, from the sowre rough Branne of needelesse babble and vanitie. A sensible witte hauyng the pennyng of the matter. But loe my good Lorde, in shewyng the nature and qualitie of a good verse, how my hoblyng is seen, and perceiued by the badnesse, or bare handelyng of the thynges herein written: yet now I haue ron so farre in ouerweenyng, that either I am forced to goe forward, or remaine in the midwaie discomforted, and without remeadye. VVherefore, albeeit I shall shewe but a bondell of drie deuises, I must open my fardell, &amp; make sale of sutche

And for that I would haue all menne to thinke, that in trothe and plainnesse I haue greate felicitie, and doe hate any kinde of flatterie or finenesse. I meane in my next booke, called my Challenge, to ronne ouer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of myne other woorkes, and where peraduenture by some reporte of others, (that knewe not the trothe,) I haue failed in settyng foorthe of some seruices, emong the whiche Maister Ihon Norrice, and diuers wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie

For so sure as GOD is Almightie, if I could gaine mountaines of golde, to flatter any one in Printyng an vntrothe, I would rather wishe my handes were of, then take in hande sutche a matter. For neither affection, fauor, commoditie, fame, nor par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallitie, at no tyme nor season, shall willyngly lead my penne amisse.

            <l>To all and yet the vse thereof, but to a fewe a sinde:</l>
            <l>For some haue all their parents left, all thei them selues can catche,</l>

            <l>He saied witte was a happie gifte, but wealth made all the feaste:</l>
            <l>Witte with the wise must companie keepe, then cold oft is his chere,</l>
            <l>Wealth hath companions eury where, and banketts all the yere.</l>
            <l>Wealth hath the waie the cappe and knee, and twentie at his taile,</l>
            <l>When witte hath nere a restyng place, no more then hath a Snaile:</l>
            <l>Wit is compeld to be a slaue, to wealth and serue hym still,</l>

            <l>But if that wealth maie match with hap, then bid fine wit goe plea,</l>
            <l>Our old Prouerbe is giuen me hap, and cast me in the Sea:</l>
