            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </head>
               <p>AS for our little Army of <hi>Vaudois, Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montois,</hi>
and <hi>French Refugiez,</hi> conſiſting
of about 3000 fighting Men under
Colonel <hi>des Loches,</hi> and his two Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Colonels, <hi>Julien &amp; Mallet;</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that, they have been hitherto divided into
three ſmall bodies, at <hi>Suze, Lucerne</hi> and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueras,</hi>
they have behaved themſelves well up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all occaſions offered, and particularly at
<hi>Lucerne,</hi> where they killed 7 or 800 <hi>French,</hi> with
the loſs of 25 or 30 only on their ſide, and but
four or five <hi>Piemontois</hi> of their ſmall number,
and took two Colours from them which I ſent
to the King by the Meſſenger that carry'd the
Treaty, as the Firſt-fruits of their Courage in
thoſe Parts. Their Encouragement and Subſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is of vaſt importance to the good Cauſe and
the Proteſtant Religion, both there and in all
theſe parts of the World; beſides the inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
conſequence it is of, as a back Door, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the only ſafe and certain Inlet into <hi>France.</hi>
Oh what glorious things might be done in all
<hi>Europe,</hi> and particularly in this, for its Freedom
and Deliverance, and for the Honour of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion, if the Parliament would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
delay in this extraordinary Conjuncture of
Affairs, aſſiſt the King ſo vigorouſly and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
as to enable Him to finiſh Honourably and
Succeſsfully thoſe noble and important Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
that lye before Him, both at Home and
Abroad, and to the compleating of which,
God has call'd him in ſo wonderful a manner!</p>
               <p>We are in great ſtraits what to do about
the diſtreſſed <hi>Vaudois</hi> Families, (I mean the
Women, Old Men, and Children among them,
for the Men that can bear Arms are in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies)
that are come into theſe parts before
their time, in impatient hopes of returning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their old Habitations. They came without
Order, there being nothing r<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> Houſes are

Corn this year, great Numbers of them
are like to ſtarve and periſh for want of Bread,
all the Collections of all ſorts for them in theſe
Parts, being totally at an end. It would be a
moſt generous, Chriſtian, and ſeaſonable
Aſſiſtance, if we could get another very ſpeedy,
though ſmall Collection, from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
without which, I ſee no way to avoid their
periſhing. Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> is come to ſee his
Family at <hi>Neu Chaſtel,</hi> and returns ſpeedily into
the Vallies. He ſpent two or three days with
me here. The whole Hiſtory of the Subſiſtence,
Deliverance and Victories of theſe Proteſtants
in the Vallies, is a continued Miracle, and would
make a good Proteſtant of a profeſs'd Atheiſt,
if he were not arriv'd to the laſt and fatal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Obduration. I have perſwaded and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
determined him, as he aſſures me, to begin
ſpeedily, and to finiſh a ſecond <hi>History of the
Vaudois,</hi> and of all the Miracles that have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
their whole late State and Concerns;
which I deſire him may be much more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated
and particular, than that of Monſieur
<hi>Leger,</hi> his Nephew, who is ſetled a Profeſſor
at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and was imployed there in the late
Collection of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> for the <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois.</hi>
I deſir'd Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> to conſult for

               <head>II. Part of a Letter of Monſieur de Loches, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
of the Vaudois.</head>
               <p>A Fortnight ago I had notice given me, that
the Enemy, whoſe Army which was En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd
near <hi>Carmagnole,</hi> had cauſed their firſt
Line to March, with ſix pieces of Cannon, and
that the reſt follow'd them cloſe on purpoſe to
exterminate thoſe of the Religion, and totally
to ruin them in theſe Vallies, and that Monſieur
<hi>Catinat</hi> and other Generals of the <hi>French</hi> Army
had publickly made known this their Deſign.
I do not in the leaſt doubt of this Intelligence,
for our Troops daily Intercepting their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys,
and being a continual plague to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> it was likely they would do
their utmoſt to be rid of them. I writ to His
Royal Highneſs about it, and to ſome others at
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59948:2"/>
                  <hi>Turin,</hi> who knew very well how few Men I
had with me, without Mony, or Proviſion;
moſt of them without Cloaths, Shoos or Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and ſeveral of them Sick: His Royal
Highneſs did me the Honour to Anſwer me by
three Couriers one after another, That it was
true he had been Inform'd the Enemy had ſuch
a Deſign, but that the condition his Army was
in would not permit him to oppoſe it; and
therefore I ſhould do well to leave the Vallies,
and ſo gain the Hills towards <hi>Cony,</hi> 15 or 20
Leagues from hence.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs that in this occaſion I viſibly
found that God by his Providence did watch
for our Preſervation. For notwithſtanding the
evident dangers I was expoſed to, inſtead of
Flying, as I was adviſed, he ſo ſtrengthned me,
that I reſolved to ſtand the Enemy. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I did ſend a Detachment of a 130 to the
Town of <hi>Barges,</hi> three Leagues from this place;
where on the third inſtant, being Attackt, they
Fought ſo well Retreating, that they kill'd many
of the Enemy, and following the Orders which
I had given them, they retired to a Village call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Bibiane,</hi> that is half a League from hence.
There they were Joyned by another Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of 90 Men, which I had poſted in that
place. The next day at 11 in the morning
they were Attackt by 8 Squadrons of Horſe and
Dragoons, and as many Batalions of Foot, the
beſt Troops of all the <hi>French</hi> Army, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Marqueſs <hi>de Feuquieres</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
General. Our Men made their Diſcharge
at them, but when they were very near, got
out of the Village, and Diſputed the Ground
with ſo much courage, that they ſtopt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in every Poſt that did any wiſe favour their
Retreat, killing ſeveral Officers and Soldiers;
which when I heard, I Detached a Captain with
50 Men to back them, and being Inform'd that
they gave ground, I ſent two ſeveral times
Lieutenants with 20 Men to Faciliate their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat:
But their obſtinacy hindred them from
executing my Orders, and being got within
Cannon ſhot of this Town, they gained the
Hills of <hi>Roura.</hi> Then the whole Body of the
Enemy fell upon <hi>Lucerne,</hi> all the Inhabitants
whereof are Papiſts, and which being Diſman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell'd,
lies open on all ſides. By the help of
God I ſtopt the Enemy for 3 hours, hindred
them from paſſing over a ſtone Bridg, and
forced them to wade through the River, where
they loſt ſeveral Officers and Soldiers; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overpowered by their number, I Retired
to a Hill that commanded this Town; from
thence I ſent Orders to the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> who keep
the Poſt of the Vallies of St. <hi>Germain,</hi> St. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew,</hi>
and St. <hi>John,</hi> to Joyn with all ſpeed.
The Enemy Detached their Vanguard, which
entred the Town a quarter of an hour before
Night, burnt ſome Houſes, kill'd 8 or 10 Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
ſome old ſick Men, and little Children who
could not get away, having made no greater
ſtay than was neceſſary for their Troops to
March off. Monſieure <hi>de Feuquieres</hi> made a ſhow
as if he would have Encamp'd near the Town,
by making a great number of Fires there; but
ſoon after he cauſed his Men to March towards
<hi>Pignerol</hi> without Drum or Trumpet, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
committing any other act of Hoſtility upon
the Lands of the Proteſtants, being favoured
by a thick Fog, and making uſe but of two
Lights; but when they had got half a League off,
they lighted above a thouſand, and begun to
beat their Drums. This haſty March broke all
the Meaſures I had taken to fall upon his Rear
the next day, and to purſue the Sieur <hi>de Feuqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eres</hi>
in the ſame manner as we had done when we
came into the Vallies. I have loſt in all theſe
Attacks, a Serjeant and three Soldiers, and ſome
Wounded; and the Sieur <hi>de Feuquieres,</hi> to hide
his loſs, Ordered his Dead to be Buried in the
way, ſo that we met with Graves at every ſtep.
I am come back into <hi>Lucerne,</hi> and thank God
with all my Heart that he has permitted us, with
a handful of Men, to baffle the moſt cruel Deſign
that ever was Formed againſt theſe Vallies.</p>
