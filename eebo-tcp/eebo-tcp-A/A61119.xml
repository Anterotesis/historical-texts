         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>8. That the myſtery of the <hi>Popiſh Miniſtery</hi> hath ever been to lead the

have ſeen ſo much as a little to debate <hi>Religion</hi> with the <hi>Synods:</hi> and

And (friends) let not the old Popiſh things of <hi>merit, martyrdome,</hi> and <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,</hi>

                     </gap>hat you were traduced by me:</hi> Let not <hi>you</hi> and <hi>I</hi> be judge of
that: both our Books are abroad; and I have quoted your <hi>words</hi> to the

               <p>For my ſelfe <hi>unknown to you but by two Pamphlets:</hi> I take your ſleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
I could call your Treatiſes by a worſe name then <hi>Treatiſes;</hi> for I
knew <hi>one</hi> of them ſome yeers ſince, <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Lots,</hi> wherein you defended
<hi>Cards</hi> and <hi>Dice-playing:</hi> And it had been happy for others as well as my

ſtrengthened the hands of many to <hi>ſin.</hi> I know you love ancient Writers
well, by your <hi>Margin</hi> and <hi>quotations.</hi> And I pray remember how <hi>Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
honoured Truth as much by confeſſing <hi>Errours</hi> as profeſſing <hi>Truths.
What fruit ſhould you and I have of theſe things whereof we are now aſhamed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For your <hi>witneſſing to the Antinomian party againſt your will:</hi> Is that your
fault, or mine? Nor am I to judge of your reſerves, and ſecret ſenſes, but
of <hi>words</hi> and <hi>writings.</hi> Nor is it an Antinomian party I alleadge you to
countenance: but a Party falſly traduced and ſuppoſed ſo: a Party called

                  <hi>Antinomian</hi> by you, and others, and then writ againſt: A ſetting up Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks

are the men. You may make more by this trick, then you find ſo.</p>
               <p>To the Second, <hi>that you will lay open the unſound ſtuffe: I</hi> ſhall not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing,
I hope, to be told my failings: but <hi>I</hi> muſt look to the <hi>ſtuffe</hi> you

               </p>
               <p>To your Third, of ſome <hi>finding out a ſhorter cut to Heaven then ſome
former Divines:</hi> I know not what you meane by <hi>ſhorter cuts.</hi> The Papiſts
find a way, they ſay, to Heaven by <hi>works,</hi> ſome Proteſtants by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>

that Free grace in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And is that a <hi>ſhorter cut</hi> then theirs, as you
call it? or rather, a clearer revelation of <hi>Truth?</hi> Methinks your expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
have too much of that which <hi>Solomon</hi> cals <hi>frowardneſſe</hi> in old men.
Argue, and prove, and bring Scripture as long as you pleaſe, but be not too
<hi>quarrelſome.</hi> But <hi>I</hi> ſhall excuſe you in part, becauſe you tell us you are not
yet recovered from ſickneſſe: ſo as I take this, with other of your Books,
as <hi>part</hi> or <hi>remainders</hi> of your <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> rather then your <hi>judgement;</hi> and the

not a better time to trie <hi>Truth</hi> in, when you were not ſo much in the <hi>body?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the Fourth, That <hi>nothing leſſe was intended by you:</hi> I undertook not
to diſcover your <hi>intents</hi> to the world. You might have don well to have
revealed your ſelfe more at firſt, that <hi>I</hi> might not have taken you to be
more a friend to <hi>Truth</hi> then I ſee you are: <hi>forgive</hi> me this injury, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſaies, if I accounted you better then you deſire to be. <hi>Love hopeth all
things, and beleeveth all things.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> it ſeems was better perſwaded
of <hi>Agrippa</hi> then there was cauſe, and quoted ſome of the Heathen Poets
better then they intended them, as it ſeems I have done with you; that
being the greateſt thing you lay to my charge.</p>
               <p>Maſter Gataker.</p>
               <p>(1) That our Antinomian Free grace is not the ſame with that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
in the Old Teſtament, and the Apoſtles in the New. (2) That in ſaying
the Old Teſtament was rather a draught of a Legall diſpenſation, then an
Evangelicall or Goſpell-one, was to taxe the Miniſtery of the Prophets for no
Free-grace. (3) That in ſaying the Miniſters now by the qualifications they
preach, do over-heat Free-Grace as your poore ſoules cannot take it, doth make
the Prophets, Iuglers and deluders of the people.</p>
               <p>Anſwer.</p>
               <p>To your firſt, That <hi>our Antinomian Free Grace, is not the ſame with the
Prophets and Apoſtles:</hi> Why do you tell us of <hi>Antinomians,</hi> of <hi>Prophets</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:63943:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Free-grace? It is not the Free-grace of any of theſe: Free-grace
is of God in Jeſus Chriſt; Prophets and Apoſtles are but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencers
of it, and Ambaſſadours of it, and Miniſters of it; and yet Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours
not in the ſame habit: The <hi>Prophets</hi> preached Grace in a <hi>rough</hi>
and <hi>hairy</hi> garment, or, more <hi>Legally;</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in a more <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>bright</hi>
habit, in the <hi>revelation</hi> of the <hi>myſtery</hi> of <hi>Chriſt: The Law was given by Moſes,
but Grace and Truth by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> I could as eaſily ſay, Maſter <hi>Gatakers
Free-grace,</hi> and the <hi>Legalists Free-grace,</hi> as he ſayes <hi>Our Antinomian Free-grace;</hi>

is according to your Inference only. Becauſe the <hi>Spirit</hi> ſayes, the <hi>Law
was given by Moſes,</hi> therefore will you put upon the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi>

                  </hi> Becauſe I ſay, <hi>The Old Teſtament was
a Legall miniſtration,</hi> therefore do I ſay there was no Free-grace in it? or
doe I not rather ſay, Therefore it was Free-grace legally diſpenced, or
preached, or miniſtred? Would not ſuch Inferences be bad dealing with
the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and will it be faire dealing with me? I wonder you who pretend
to write againſt me, as having not dealt <hi>juſtly</hi> with your ſenſe, will deale
ſo <hi>unjuſtly</hi> with mine, and commit the ſame <hi>ſin</hi> your ſelf, in the very time
of your reproving mine. You may ſee what this <hi>Logick</hi> hath brought you
to, To deceive your ſelfe, as well as your neighbour. Can you caſt out my
mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, and behold, a beame in your own eye?</p>
               <p>I have printed all you quoted: let the Reader judge from this and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
it with the reſt of my Book.</p>
               <p>The whole frame of the Old Teſtament was a draught of Gods anger at ſin.
—And God in this time of the Law appeared only as it were upon tearmes and
conditions of reconciliation: and all the Worſhip then, and acts of Worſhip then,
as of Prayer, Faſting, Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> went all this way, according to God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that appearance. And in this ſtraine (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) runnes all the Miniſtery of
the Prophets too, in their exhortations to Duty and Worſhip, as if God were to be
appeaſed and entreated, and reconciled, and his love to be had in way of purchaſe
by Duty, and Doing, and Worſhipping: So as under the Law, the efficacy and
power was put as it were wholly upon the Duty and Obedience performed, as if
God upon the doing of ſuch things, was to be brought into tearmes of peace, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and forgiveneſſe; ſo as their courſe and ſervice then, was as it were a w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for life and reconciliation.</p>
               <p>Do not theſe words and termes inſerted, <hi>As it were,</hi> and, <hi>in the way,</hi> and,
<hi>as if,</hi> and, <hi>is it were,</hi> cleare me from ſuch poſitive and excluſive aſſertions of
<hi>Free-Grace</hi> as you would make me ſpeake?</p>
               <p>To the Third, That <hi>in ſaying the Preachers with their qualifications over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heate
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63943:9"/>
Free-grace, I doe by that make the Prophets deluders of the people,</hi> &amp;c.
I anſwer: That way of preaching the Prophets uſed, preſſing, as you ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Repentance, Reformation, Humiliation, and with Commination, and the
Law, &amp;c. was but according to the way, and method, and ſtraine the <hi>Spirit</hi>
taught them under the <hi>Old Teſtament:</hi> but if the <hi>Prophets</hi> ſhould have held
forth Jeſus Chriſt under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and when Chriſt was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
in the <hi>fleſh,</hi> with ſuch <hi>vails</hi> over him, and ſo much <hi>Law</hi> over him, as
they did before, they had ſinned againſt the <hi>glory</hi> of that <hi>miniſtration,</hi> as
well as ſome of you, who bring Chriſt back againe under the cool ſhadow
of the <hi>Law,</hi> and make that <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſſe</hi> that he warmes not ſo
many with the <hi>love</hi> of him as he would doe, if ye would let them behold
with open face as in a glaſſe the glory of the Lord, and if you would give
his <hi>beams</hi> more liberty to ſhine upon them; doth not the <hi>miniſtration of the
Spirit exceed in glory?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor were the Prophets <hi>deluders of the people then,</hi> becauſe it was the
peoples time of <hi>Pupillage,</hi> and being under <hi>Bondage;</hi> they <hi>were ſhut up under
the Law till faith came;</hi> they were under <hi>Tutors</hi> and <hi>Governors till the time
appointed:</hi> So as that was <hi>truth,</hi> and right diſpenſation in them to preach ſo
much of the <hi>Law,</hi> of <hi>curſe,</hi> and <hi>judgement, &amp;c.</hi> as they did; and of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
and <hi>Reformation</hi> in that ſtraine they did: But in ye who pretend to

               <p>Anſwer.</p>
               <p>To your firſt, for our <hi>girding at thoſe that bid men repent, and be humbled,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>as Legall teachers:</hi> If ye preſſe <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>humiliation</hi> legally, why
wonder ye at ſuch words as <hi>Legall teachers?</hi> Will ye doe ill, and not be
told of your faults? muſt we propheſie ſmooth things to you, and ſay ye
are able Miniſters of the New Teſtament, when we are perſwaded that
truth is detained in unrighteouſneſſe? We blame not any that bid men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
or be ſorry for ſinne, &amp;c. be humble, &amp;c. if they preach them as Chriſt
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63943:9"/>
and the Apoſtles did; as <hi>graces</hi> flowing from <hi>him,</hi> and out of his <hi>fulneſſe,</hi>
and not as ſpringings of their owne, and <hi>waters</hi> from their fountaines; as if
the teachers, like <hi>Moſes,</hi> would make men beleeve they could with ſuch
Rods and exhortations, ſmite upon mens hearts as upon rocks, and bring
waters out of them, be they never ſo hard and ſtony. We agree with you,
that <hi>repentance,</hi> and <hi>ſorrow for ſinne,</hi> and <hi>humiliation,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-deniall,</hi> are all
to be preached, and ſhall contend with you, who preaches them moſt, and
cleareſt: but then, becauſe <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaid Repent, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid Repent, and
<hi>Peter</hi> ſaid Repent; are we to examine the Myſtery no farther? Know we
not that the whole Scripture in its fulneſſe and integrality reveales the
whole truth? and muſt we not looke out, and compare Scripture with
Scripture, ſpirituall things with ſpirituall, and ſo finding out truth from the
degrees, to the glory and fulneſſe of it, preach it in the ſame glory and
fulneſſe as we find it? We heare Chriſt preaching before the Spirit was
given, <hi>Repent;</hi> and we find, when the Spirit was given, Chriſt is ſaid to
give <hi>Repentance</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>forgiveneſſe of ſinnes;</hi> and ſhall we not now
preach Jeſus Chriſt, and Repentance in Jeſus Chriſt the fountaine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
the author of repentance, and yet preach repentance, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
thus, and repentance in the glory of it more? The Apoſtle in one
place ſaith, <hi>Beleeve in the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved;</hi> and in
another place, <hi>He is the author and finiſher of our Faith;</hi> Shall we not now

               <p>So as the difference betwixt us is this; Ye preach Chriſt and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,

ſuch preaching anſwers not the <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of the Myſtery, the <hi>riches</hi> of the

crown and glory to every grace and gift: nay, he is made not only <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi>

It is true, we have much of what they ſaid, and we want much; yet

the Cup that we bleſſe, is it not the Communion of the bloud of Chriſt;</hi>

Communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> and yet neither the <hi>Wine</hi> nor the <hi>Bread,</hi>

Take heed you charge not Chriſt for being with Publicans and Sinners,

Chriſt for us, and yet loved us in Chriſt too; Can any thing without God,
be a cauſe of Gods love? Doth God love as we love one another, from
complexions or features without, or loves he not rather thus? <hi>God is love,</hi>
and therefore we are <hi>made,</hi> and <hi>Redeemed,</hi> and <hi>Sanctified;</hi> not becauſe we
are <hi>Sanctified</hi> therefore he loves us; <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us;</hi>
he loved us, becauſe he loved us, and not becauſe we <hi>love him;</hi> not becauſe
of any Spirituall complexion or feature in us; becauſe of his Image up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, that is but an <hi>earneſt</hi> of his love to us, that is only given us, becauſe he
<hi>loved us;</hi> he <hi>loves us</hi> from his <hi>will,</hi> not from without: for though we are
<hi>like him,</hi> yet we are not <hi>himſelfe,</hi> and he loves us as in <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas you ſay, <hi>God is as man, and as a Father;</hi> I hope you meane not
as in <hi>himſelfe,</hi> but as in his wayes of <hi>ſpeaking</hi> and <hi>appearing</hi> to us, and if ſo,
we are agreed: But your taking things more in the <hi>Letter,</hi> then the <hi>Spirit,</hi>
makes your Divinity leſſe <hi>Divine,</hi> and your conceptions more like things
of men then of <hi>God:</hi> This makes the Goſpell ſo legall and carnall, when

                  <p>To the ſecond, That <hi>they ordained by Biſhops, are true Miniſters as the
Independents, and I a Preacher, for all that Ordination.</hi> If you meane that
the Biſhops Ordination makes not one for ever a falſe or Antichriſtian
Miniſter, I grant it, becauſe it is no marke to them that renounce it: <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
is no more <hi>Babylon</hi> to them that are gone out of it. But what is this to
your Miniſtery or Ordination, who are yet under the Marke and Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Ordination? Renounce it, come out as the Spirit cals ye, and then
your being <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> is no more to ye, then to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> that they
ſhould be leſſe <hi>light</hi> becauſe they were once <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> or leſſe alive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were once dead.</p>
                  <p>To the third, That <hi>Succeſſion is not neceſſary to a true Miniſtery,</hi> It is
both true, and falſe, in ſeverall acceptions. When there was a true power,
they ordained others, and others them. There was ſucceſſion. But that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:63943:15"/>
being loſt under Antichriſt, ſo far as viſibly to derive it to us, there can be
no ſuch true viſible Succeſſion appearing. And yet you that pretend to
ſtand by the firſt power, muſt prove your Succeſſion, if you will prove
your power.</p>
                  <p>To the Fourth: <hi>If no true Miniſtery, no true Baptiſm.</hi> For that as you
pleaſe: I dare not exalt the <hi>truth</hi> of your <hi>Baptiſm</hi> above that of your <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,</hi>
no more then <hi>you.</hi>

and <hi>that there is no more Divine Right aſſerted in the Congregationall
Presbytery then in the Claſſicall,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which is done ſo by the diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
I anſwer: Let the Modell be printed to the world, to end the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt <hi>you</hi> and <hi>me.</hi> And for the Divine Right of the one and the
other, I am of your mind; they are able to prove both alike of <hi>Divine
Right</hi> that is in their <hi>Presbytery:</hi> The <hi>one</hi> is no more of <hi>Divine Right</hi> then
the <hi>other,</hi> and <hi>neither of them</hi> of <hi>any.</hi> And for the diſſenting Brethren, it is
not <hi>them,</hi> but <hi>you</hi> I deale with. Why come you under <hi>their ſhadow</hi> in a

                  </p>
                  <p>To the Seventh: <hi>Though the Ordination by Biſhops be null, yet they have
the other neceſſaries to a Preacher.</hi> Will ye undertake for the Aſſembly they

ſo, we are agreed: if not, all their other neceſſaries are no more then

To the Tenth, That <hi>Presbyteries, becauſe not infallibly gifted, are of no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

all your <hi>Presbyteries</hi> to be of <hi>Divine Right</hi> as the firſt. But our
queſtion is rather whether the <hi>firſt</hi> was any ſuch <hi>Presbytery</hi> as you now
affirme: and for ought I ſee, you can no more prove the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi>
then in the ſenſe you take it, then your <hi>Presbytery</hi> to be <hi>one</hi> with it,
<hi>one</hi> only in <hi>Divine Right,</hi> not in <hi>Divine power</hi> or <hi>gifts.</hi> And how are theſe
things ſutable?</p>
                  <p>To the Eleventh, That <hi>I contradict the pure Government I plead for, by
pleading for yours as prudentiall.</hi> It were true indeed, if I pleaded it in mine
own behalfe. I plead it occaſionally for them, who will needs have what
the <hi>State</hi> cannot in <hi>conſcience</hi> allow them, and yet will not practice any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but what the State ſhall give them; and ſo trouble both the <hi>State</hi> and
their own <hi>conſciences,</hi> and would caſt a <hi>ſnare</hi> upon both. Brethren, if ye
will needs have the <hi>State</hi> to allow ye your <hi>Presbytery,</hi> Why are ye not
content with what they can allow ye? If ye will have a <hi>Divine Right</hi>
which they cannot allow ye, why do ye trouble them, and ſit down under
a <hi>bondage</hi> of your own making? But how juſtly is this <hi>yoke</hi> come upon
you, who would have brought a worſe upon your <hi>Brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the Twelfth, That <hi>the firſt Presbyters, and Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
as in divers practices.</hi> What is this to the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>gifts</hi> they taught
and taught by? They failed as <hi>men,</hi> but not as <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> They erred as
they were <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> but not as moved by the Holy Ghoſt. Take
heed by opening the Apoſtles failings to juſtifie your own, you ſpeake not
worſe Blaſphemy then you name in me, and make that glorious Word of
Scripture queſtionable which they preached, like the <hi>words</hi> that your
ſelves <hi>preach</hi> from that <hi>Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the Thirteenth, That <hi>to ſay the Apoſtles did adviſe in place of the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Word, is Blaſphemy.</hi> What Blaſphemy is it to ſay, that the ſame <hi>Word</hi>
which they writ and <hi>preached;</hi> the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> ſpake in them, and <hi>ſpake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
the ſame <hi>truth</hi> in <hi>them</hi> which writ in <hi>them?</hi> And is it ſo with any of your<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <hi>Presbyters?</hi> Therefore till the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> ſpeak <hi>truth</hi> in them ſo as in the
firſt <hi>Presbyters,</hi> will they challenge the ſame <hi>right,</hi> the ſame <hi>power?</hi> Will
they have a <hi>Divine Right</hi> acted by a <hi>ſpirit</hi> leſſe <hi>Divine</hi> then the <hi>Right?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the Fourteenth, That <hi>the Presbyterians in</hi> France, Scotland, <hi>and the</hi>
Netherlands, <hi>do not embroyle Kingdoms.</hi> There is good reaſon: in <hi>France</hi>
they cannot if they would. I wiſh you would walke under the Magiſtrate
as they do, and as your diſſenting Brethren here, and not make him ſerve
you, And in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> do you as they do there, and leave your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
to the like <hi>liberty</hi> that is in that State, and they will not grudge ye
your <hi>Presbytery</hi> amongſt your ſelves. For <hi>Scotland</hi> they are Brethren I
wiſh no worſe to, then <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> above their <hi>Miniſters.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:63943:16"/>
To that of <hi>excommunicating kingdoms being a bugbear.</hi> You do well to
ſay ſo, till ye be eſtabliſhed: but you that dare ſo capitulate with <hi>States,</hi>
whom ye are called to adviſe in things onely propounded, what more
may be expected upon all your principles, I leave to be judged.</p>
                  <p>To the Fifteenth, That <hi>they aske not of the State a power, but a liberty
to exerciſe that power.</hi> Well: and will ye trouble the State no further?
Will ye not intreat them to puniſh ſuch a one, and ſuch a one, whom ye
judge an <hi>Hereticke</hi> and a <hi>Schiſmaticke?</hi> to fine and impriſon, when you
have done with them at <hi>Excommunication?</hi> May the State be quiet if
they ſay to ye, go all that are ſo perſwaded as you are, and <hi>worſhip</hi> and
<hi>practiſe</hi> as your diſſenting brethren and other Saints, and trouble not us
to provide for your Tythes, and Rule for you in things of your own cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
over Conſciences.</p>
                  <p>But you would onely have <hi>liberty</hi> from them; your <hi>power</hi> is of Chriſt.
But you cannot ſo cleare things as you thinke. If your <hi>power</hi> and <hi>liberty</hi>
reſpectively to your <hi>ſelves</hi> and the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> be ſo diſtinct, why have
ye mingled them and confounded them all this while? Why make ye the
<hi>truth</hi> and <hi>power</hi> ye have from Chriſt, wait ſo at <hi>Parliament-doores,</hi> as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Caſe</hi> ſaid? if the powers on earth will not do for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as you
would make the people beleeve, Why do not ye your ſelves more for
Chriſt? <hi>Is it better to obey God or man?</hi> Thus the more ye would ſingle
your ſelves in your power and right from the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> the more your
practice makes an argument againſt ye.</p>
                  <p>To the Sixteenth, That <hi>I ſhould ſay, In a ſound Church, Church-officers
ſhall excommunicate and judge of offences; and in an unſound the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi>
and the Inference there: I anſwer, I <hi>ſpake</hi> and <hi>writ</hi> ſo, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>your principles,</hi> not to <hi>my owne.</hi> Nor can I ſee how you can cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
ſuch a <hi>one, entire,</hi> and <hi>ſimple.</hi> Diſcipline excluſively to the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi>
upon no more true, pure, and Scripture-principles then your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Presbytery is. And I conceive the <hi>powers</hi> on <hi>earth,</hi> or in the <hi>world,</hi>
have to do in every <hi>Government</hi> that is more of the <hi>world</hi> then of <hi>Chriſt:</hi>
For if ye exclude them from a part in that <hi>Government</hi> which is partly
<hi>prudential,</hi> and of <hi>man,</hi> you exclude them from off part of their owne
<hi>Kingdome,</hi> which is theirs by inheritance, and of more <hi>Divine Right</hi>
then I conceive yours to be. And whereas you would make us beleeve
you ſtand onely in a pure Goſpel ſtrength and <hi>power,</hi> and deſire no more
of the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> but <hi>liberty:</hi> can this be ſo in <hi>truth,</hi> when all is eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
invalid and nothing, if the <hi>Magiſtrates power</hi> doth not actuate the
<hi>Miniſters power?</hi> I know you may diſtinguiſh of <hi>powers</hi> Scholaſtically,
and <hi>Spheres</hi> of <hi>working</hi> for thoſe <hi>powers,</hi> and ſo tell the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> and
<hi>us,</hi> he doth but act in his Sphere, when he acts in yours, and indeed acts
yours, making it to be ſtronger then it is in it ſelfe. But is not his Civil
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:63943:16"/>
power that which puts life, as you think, into all your Presbytery? Yet he
muſt think he doth but as a <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ſtill, as if ſo be that the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi>
were made to be <hi>rods</hi> in the hands of the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Swords</hi> to be drawn
by them, and <hi>Iron whips</hi> at their girdles. We are not now as <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi>
we are not a Kingdom of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> nor a Church of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> though too
many of you have preached the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> more then the <hi>New;</hi> for
what advantage, let the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> judge.</p>
                  <p>To the Seventeenth, That <hi>he may in time ſay as much of juſtice living up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
voyces in Aſſemblies, as of Truth; and ſo to be a Myſtery of Iniquity.</hi> Theſe
are but infirmations to the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and ghoſts of Jealouſie which you
raiſe. And to put an end to ſuch feares; when I make <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,
Magiſtrate</hi> and <hi>Miniſtery, Goſpell</hi> laws and <hi>Civill</hi> to be both one, then chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
me for that opinion: But I have learned, that <hi>Chriſts Kingdom</hi> and
the <hi>worlds</hi> have a ſeverall <hi>Policy;</hi> and that may be a <hi>Law</hi> in the <hi>one,</hi> which
is not to the other. And now is it your <hi>Inference,</hi> or my <hi>Principle,</hi> wrongs
the <hi>Magiſtrate?</hi>

you, as I ſpoke. I told you at parting, I hoped we ſhould overcome you by <hi>prayer.</hi>
I beleeve we ſhall pray you either into <hi>Repentance,</hi> or <hi>Shame,</hi> or <hi>Judgement,</hi>
ere we have done with you. But Oh might it be <hi>Repentance</hi> rather, till Maſter
<hi>Edwards ſmite upon his thigh, and ſay, what have I done?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For your</hi> Anagram <hi>upon my name, you do but fulfill the Propheſie,</hi> They ſhall
caſt out your name as evill, for the Son of mans ſake.</p>
                  <p>And for your Book of <hi>Jeeres</hi> and <hi>Stories</hi> of your Brethren; Poore man! It
will not be long muſick in your eares, at this rate of <hi>ſinning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the <hi>nameleſſe Author</hi> and his <hi>After-reckoning;</hi> let all ſuch men be
doing, for me: Let them <hi>raile, revile, blaſpheme,</hi> call <hi>Hereticks:</hi> It is enough
to me, that they write ſuch <hi>vanity</hi> they dare not own.</p>
                  <p>And now let me tell ye both, and all ſuch <hi>Penſioners</hi> to the great <hi>accuſer of
the Brethren, Fill up the meaſure of your iniquity,</hi> if ye will needs periſh whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we will or no. I hope I reſt in the boſome of Chriſt, with others of my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
raile, perſecute, do your worſt, I challenge all the <hi>powers of hell</hi> that ſet
ye on work, while Chriſt is made unto me <hi>righteouſneſſe, wiſedome, ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>redemption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I muſt tell ye further, that ſince any of the <hi>light</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
dawned upon me: ſince firſt I ſaw that <hi>Morning-Star</hi> of <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> any of
the <hi>brightneſſe</hi> of the <hi>glory</hi> in my heart, that heart of mine which once lived
in the coaſts of <hi>Zebulon</hi> and <hi>Nephtaly,</hi> in the <hi>region and ſhadow of death,</hi> I
can freely challenge <hi>ye,</hi> and thouſands more ſuch as <hi>ye,</hi> to <hi>ſay, write, do, worke,
print,</hi> or <hi>any thing,</hi> and I hope I ſhall in the ſtrength of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in whom I am
able to do all things, give you <hi>bleſſings</hi> for <hi>curſings,</hi> and <hi>prayers</hi> for <hi>perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
