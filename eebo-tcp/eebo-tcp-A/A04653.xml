            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

face is here: A most promising, open, smooth, and ouerflowing
face, that seemes as it would runne, and powre it selfe into you;
your <hi>Courtier Elementary</hi> is one but newly entered, or as it were

only apply your selfe to this face of the <hi>Elementary Courtier,</hi> A
light, reuelling, &amp; protesting face, now blushing, now smiling
which you may helpe much with a wanton wagging of your

                  <p>A notable <hi>Finch.</hi> One that hath newly entertain'd the
<hi>Beggar</hi> to follow him, but cannot get him to wait neer inough.
Tis <hi>Asotus</hi> the heire of <hi>Philargirus:</hi> but first Ile giue you the
others Caracter, which may make his the clearer? He that is
with him is <hi>Amorphus,</hi> A Traueller, One so made out of the
mixture and shreds of formes, that himselfe is truely defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
Hee walkes most commonlye with a <hi>Cloue</hi> or <hi>Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toothe</hi>
in his mouth, Hee's the very Minte of <hi>Compl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb facs="tcp:9728:17"/>
All his behauiours are printed, his face is another volume of
<hi>Essayes;</hi> and his beard an <hi>Aristarchus.</hi> He speakes all creame,
skimd, &amp; more affected then a dozen of waiting women; Hee's
his owne promooter in euery place: The wife of the <hi>Ordinary</hi>
giues him his diet to maintaine her table in discourse, which
(indeed) is a meere Tiranny ouer her other guests: for he will
vsurp all the talke: Ten Cunstables are not so tedious. He is no
great shifter; once a yeare his Apparell is ready to reuolt; He
doth vse much to arbitrate quarrells, and fights himselfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
well (out at a window.) He will lie cheaper then any
Begger, and lowder then most Clockes; for which he is right
properly accommodated to the <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

gallant is his <hi>Zani,</hi> &amp; doth most of these tricks after him; sweats
to imitate him in euery thing (to a haire) except a Beard, which
is not yet extant: he doth learne to eat <hi>Anchoues,</hi> &amp; <hi>Caueare</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he loues 'hem, speakes as he speakes; lookes, walkes, goes
so in Cloathes and fashion, is in al, as he were moulded of him.
Marry (before they met) he had other very pretty sufficiencies,
which yet he retaines some light Impression of: As frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a dauncing schoole, and grieuously torturing strangers,
with inquisitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after his grace in his Galliard; He buyes a fresh
acquaintance at any rate; his Eye, and his Raiment confer much
together as he goes in the street; He treads nicely, like a fellow
that walkes vpon ropes, especially the first Sunday of his Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stockings,
and when he is most neate and new, you shal stripp
him with commendations.</p>

He striues rather to be (that which men call) Iudicious,
then to be thought so; and is so truely learned that he affects
not to shew it: He wil thinke, &amp; speak his thought, both freely;
but as distant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deprauing any other mans Merrit, as procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
his owne: For his valor, tis such, that he dares as little to
offer an Iniury, as receiue one. In sum, he hath a most Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and sweet spirit, a sharp and season'd wit, a streight iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
and a strong minde; constant and vnshaken: <hi>Fortune</hi>
could neuer breake him, or make him lesse, he counts it his
pleasure to despise pleasures, and is more delighted with good
deedes then Goods, It is a competencie to him that he can be
vertuous. He doth neither couet, nor feare; he hath too much
reason to do either: and that commends all things to him.</p>
