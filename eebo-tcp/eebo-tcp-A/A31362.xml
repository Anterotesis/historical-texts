         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46108:10"/>

               <p>Why are they not given to disputing?
for if the truth be on their sides, they might

               <p>There is so much disputing in the
World, vvhich is altogether unprofitable,
that it is a mercy that they are no more
inclined to it; for what good can there be
brought forth by it, seeing that by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of Disputers the holy Scripture is
not a little wrested &amp; perverted, the Name
of God too much dishonored, and many
precious hearts disturbed, grieved, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by the tedious disputing which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men, and by reason of it much strife
and contention is brought forth, in which
these people have no pleasure nor content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for they have not so learned Christ,
neither do they seek by way of disputing
to overcome their opposors, (whom they
with meekness do instruct when they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
oppose themselves) but to that of
God in the consciences of their opposers,
they seek to be made manifest, that by that

they might be overcome, which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them of the Truch which these peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

good; for as men come to be brought to

were most surely believed among the Saints
of old, who were eye-witnesses, and some

And further they say, that the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

the same to day, yesterday, and for ever; &amp;
they that are his, of his Fold, and of his

which the Apostles had fellowship, &amp; they
are lead and guided by the same spirit that
revealed things (which had been hid

Apostles and Saints, and they are preserved
in that power which gave the Saints victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

of immortality, which was made manifest
in the Saints of old; so that the same light,
life, spirit, and power, is now made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest

that God would not command and
require that of men, which could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly

of these people are now, who expecteth
to be made free from sin, as the Saints were,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 18. and by the blood of Jesus they

repentance; but these people (whose eyes

go they on unto it, and will proceed, if the

them which is perfect, by which he will

               <p>If thou observed Christs words
wel, thou would not cal them simple, for
not going to Law with their adversaries;
for did he not say, if any man wil sue thee
at the Law and take away thy Coat, let
him have thy Cloak also? now they that
walk in his light who spoke these words,
they abide in his doctrine, &amp; when their
adversary hath sued them &amp; recovered
treble damage, &amp; taketh away twice the
worth of that which he recovered, they
resist not, but bears it patiently, knowing
this that there is one that wil plead their
cause, to vvhom vengeance belongs and
he will repay.</p>
               <p>And although that the law be open, yet
they are not free to go to it; For what

tell them that there was utterly a fault
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46108:21"/>
among them, because they did go to law
one with another; why (saith he) do you
not rather take wrong? why do you not
rather suffer your selves to be defrauded?
so that here thou may see it doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Saints to go to Law, and that espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
before them that are out of the
truth; for such Magistrates will connive
at the sufferings of the oppressed, &amp; not
reprove the oppressors, who ought by
magistrates to be rebuked: But there are
some prudent understanding men that
are much wearied, with being so daily
incumbred with the beggerly suits of
these covetous priests, against these harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
innocent people: And some of the
Magistrates are backvvard enough in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Justice, and too forward in fulfilling

               <p>Yea, yea, a cloud of vvitnesses might

               <p>Yea, they also are comforted in
their tribulations, that they are able to
comfort them which are in trouble, by
the comfort wherewith they themselves
are comforted of God; for as the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Christ abound in them, so their
consolation also aboundeth by Christ, of
which all the opposers and adversaries in
the world cannot deprive them of; they
may be bereaved of their goods, &amp; separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from their friends and brethren, &amp;
be debarred of their liberty &amp; freedom
by the power of their adversary; but his
power extendeth not so far, as to deprive
them of their peace in him which is their
life, and of the comfort and consolation

which they receive from him; and that
they prefer above the whole world.</p>

               <p>The Bread that they break is the

these People, for many exclaims out against
them, for judging and condemning others: Now

any thing besides that which is condemned in

and unrighteousness, which the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Lord hath passed upon in
their own particular; and when they meet
with such as pleads for that which is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
of old for condemnation, perhaps
they may sharply reprove them, if they
judge not the deceit in them; then the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
reproved being one that cannot stand
in the judgement, exclaims out against
them as if they were censorious Judges,
and horrid blasphemers, when they have
judged and reproved nothing but deceit in
them, and that which is to be eternally
condemned, even the very same that is
judged in their own particulars.</p>
